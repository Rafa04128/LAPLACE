foreword to be successful in woodwork construction the possession of two secrets is essentialto know the right joint to use and to know how to make that joint in the right way the woodwork structure or the piece of cabinetwork that endures is the one on which skilful hands have combined to carry out what the constructive mind planned and it is just here that the present volume will help not alone the beginner who wishes preliminary instruction but also the expert who desires guidance over ground hitherto unexplored by him in the preparation of this new edition the publishers have secured the services of mr william fairham by whom the chapters have been carefully revised and reillustrated although intended for the practical man and not professing to be a graded course of educational woodwork the volume is one which handicraft instructors will find of the greatest value in conducting woodwork classes no book hitherto published contains such a variety of illustrations of joints almost all of which will form suitable exercises of practical educational importance in a woodworking course j c s b illustration old oak chests showing the method of structure which forms the origin

every country in the world and is frequently met with in mummy cases and other examples of ancient woodwork alternative names under which it is known are the butt joint the rubbed joint the slipped joint whilst in certain localities it is known as the slaped pronounced slayped joint illustration fig 1simplest form of glued or rubbed joint the glued joint is made by planing two pieces of timber so that when placed together they are in contact with each other at every point they are then usually united with glue fig 1 shows a sketch of a butt joint in its simplest form in fig 2 is indicated the method of holding the joint whilst being glued the upright portion is held rigid in the bench vice thus leaving the left hand to hold the piece which is to be jointed whilst the right hand operates the glue brush the pieces of wood which form a butt joint may be glued together with or without the aid of cramps or artificial pressure if the joint is to be made without cramping the two surfaces of the timber are warmed so as not to chill the glue the surfaces are then glued and put together and rubbed backwards and forwards so as to get rid of the superfluous glue they are then put aside to dry glueingthe better the glue penetrates into the pores of the wood the stronger the joint will be for this reason timber of the loosefibred variety such as pine etc will hold up at the joint better than hardwoods like teak and rosewood the glue used for jointing should be neither too thick nor too thin the consistency of cream will be found suitable for most purposes it should be nice and hot and be rapidly spread over the surface of the wood illustration fig 2how the wood is held whilst glueing if lightcoloured woods such as pine satinwood sycamore etc have to be jointed a little flake white should be procured and mixed into the liquid glue this will prevent the glue showing a thin black line on the joint broad surfaces of closegrained hardwood having a shiny surface are usually carefully roughened with a fine toothing plane blade previous to glueing supporting the jointthe jointed boards should not be reared up against a bench leg or wall without having any support in the centre as dotted line at fig 5 because in all probability they will fracture before the glue has time to set and when we go to take them up to renew working operations we shall be annoyed to find that they have assumed a position similar to that at fig 5 shown exaggerated and this will of course necessitate rejointing illustration fig 3correct jointing illustration fig 4faulty jointing illustration fig 5boards unsupported illustration fig 6boards supported illustration fig 7a glued slip b glued moulding illustration fig 8grain alternating a correct method to adopt is seen at fig 6 here we have supported the joint by rearing up against the wall a couple of pieces of batten one at each end of the board thus supporting it throughout its entire width until the glue is thoroughly set the two or more pieces of timber in a butt joint adhere by crystallisation of the glue and atmospheric pressure a wellfitted joint made with good quality glue is so strong that when boards of 3 feet and upwards are jointed together by this method the timber in most cases will break with the grain sooner than part at the joint butt joints may be cramped up if desired and it is customary to warm them as previously stated in the absence of the usual iron cramp the amateur may make an excellent wooden arrangement out of any odd pieces of timber that happen to be handy two blocks of hardwood are screwed on the base board at a suitable distance for the work in hand the boards to be jointed are glued and placed in position between the blocks and the two hardwood wedges are inserted and hammered in opposite directions to each other thus exerting the desired pressure an example of this method of cramping is shown in fig 25 which also indicates the use of iron dogs when jointing care should be taken to first plane up the boards true on one sideie take them out of winding the method of testing for this is shown at fig 9 and it may with advantage be used when jointing the edges of the boards two laths or strips of wood are planed up to exactly the same width having their edges straight and parallel one edge of each lath may if desired be bevelled a little the method of using these twist sticks or winding laths is to put them on the board as indicated and sight along their top edges the winding laths being much longer than the width of the board show up the irregularity greatly pronounced the tools generally used for making the butt joints are the jack plane for roughing the edges etc the wooden trying plane or iron jointing plane for trueing up the work the try square for testing purposes the winding laths and straight edge the method of work is as follows each board is in turn put in the vice and planed straight lengthwise it is then tested with winding laths and a try square the latter method is shown at fig 22 illustration fig 9testing surface with winding laths the boards are then put on the top of one another as at fig 1 and tested with a straight edge they should appear true as shown at fig 3 if they show faulty as at fig 4 the joints must be again fitted until the required degree of accuracy is obtained difficulties may be avoided by care in selecting timber suitable for jointing and it must be remembered that timber shrinks circumferentially the heart side becoming curved as dotted lines in fig 10 if the timber be jointed with all the heart side one way as at fig 10 the tendency will be for it to cast as shown by the dotted line if the timber be alternated as at fig 11 the tendency will be to cast wavy whereas if quartered timber can be obtained it will stand practically straight as the tendency to shrink is in thickness only the grain of quartered timber is shown in fig 12 illustration fig 10showing heart side of timber one way illustration fig 11heart side of timber shown alternated illustration fig 12grain of quartered timber illustration fig 13boards showing uniformity of grain judgment should also be exercised to avoid jointing in which one piece of timber is wild and large in the grain and the adjoining piece of a mildgrained nature jointed boards should always be glued up with the grain running in the same direction if possible this we show at fig 13 and nothing looks worse than a dressing chest end or similar piece of work in which the grain runs haphazard when jointing thin timber say 14in 38in 12in and 58in boards the best method is to use a shooting board fig 26 it must be noted however that a shooting board and plane practically never give a true right angle owing to wear and the grinding of the blade therefore the boards should not all be laid with the face mark on the shooting board whilst the edges are shot because any inequality would be multiplied by the number of pieces jointed a better method is to alternate the boards face side up then face side down whilst shooting the edges this will prevent convexity or concavity on the face of the jointed board because any slight error in the angle is neutralised see fig 8 applications of the jointthe following show various applications of the butt or glued joint illustration fig 14carcase wingpieces glued on fig 7a shows a mahogany or other hardwood slip glued on the edge of a cheaper wood such as pine or whitewood as is the case on bookcase shelves when only the front edge is seen and polished fig 7b shows a moulding glued on a shelf both mould and shelf in this instance being of polished hardwood a shelf of this type might be used in a recess the object of the overhanging moulding being to hide a small 38in iron rod which would carry the curtain rings and heading of the curtain which covers the recess the shelf would be fixed about 3 ft 9 ins to 4 ft 3 ins from the floor fig 14 shows the wing pieces glued on the top bearer of carcase work the application of this bearer in its position will be shown in the chapter on dovetailing fig 15 shows a butt joint planed at an angle of 45 degrees commonly called a mitre used for box feet etc fig 16 shows jointing up of an ogeeshaped panel the dotted lines indicate the thickness of the timber previous to its being worked up to the finished shape bowfronted and semicircular panels are jointed in a similar manner illustration fig 15butting mitred angle joint illustration fig 16jointing ogeeshaped panel fig 17 shows timber jointed at right angles to the upright piece and at an angle of 30 degrees fig 18 indicates quartercircle jointing as used in roundcornered chests of drawers wardrobes cupboards etc fig 19 is similar to fig 18 but

required width in a case of this description suitably grained and coloured wood should be selected otherwise the bad match will at once draw attention to the joint fig 21 shows the application of butt or glued jointing to the building up of the core of a piano fall previous to shaping up and veneering fig 23laminated workthe building up of circular rims for cabinet and joinery work plan and elevation show rim pattern of a pulley as used in the patternmaking trade illustration fig 27cramping glued joints handscrews and batten shown at left temporary batten at right to keep the wood flat fig 24the glueing of a ploughslip to a drawer side is seen here the ploughslip being used to carry the drawer bottom fig 26 shows the method of jointing with shooting board and trying plane the right hand operates the plane whilst the left hand holds the wood firm upon the shooting board owing to the importation of narrow and faulty timber the necessity of jointing is greater today than ever it was wide timber of course meaning higher cost for raw material the method of using iron dogs is illustrated in fig 25 and it will be observed that owing to the wedgelike formation of each fang see enlarged sketch the dog exerts the necessary pressure to close the joint at the centre of this illustration is suggested the homemade hardwood blocks baseboard and wedges referred to on page 4 fig 27 shows how the iron sash cramps are used to apply pressure to the joint as this method is in some cases apt to bend and distort thin boards it is wise practice to fix as a temporary measure a stout piece of straight wood on to the board to be joined by using two handscrews as shown at the left hand of the illustration at the right hand of the sketch a wooden cramping arrangement of the box type is given and by wedging up the boards are closed together it is obvious that if this type of box cramp be used it will prevent the boards buckling and the handscrew method at the left may be dispensed with the halved joint the halved joint is frequently known as halflapping and sometimes as checking and halfchecking in the majority of cases it is made by halving the two pieces ie by cutting half the depth of the wood away there are however exceptions to this rule as in the case of threepiece halving or as it is sometimes called third lapping and in the halving of timber with rebated or moulded edges halving is one of the simplest methods of connecting two pieces of timber especially where it is desired to make frames and bracket supports for either inside or outside use illustration fig 28frame with various halved joints these joints numbered 1 2 3 etc are shown in detail in figs 29 to 38 fig 28 shows the elevation of an imaginary frame which is indicated as made up of a number of halving joints it shows also the application of the various joints to this class of work each joint used in the construction of this frame may be dealt with separately the numbers marked on fig 28 refer to the individual joints shown separately in figs 29 to 38 illustration fig 29halved corner joint illustration fig 30halved t joint fig 29 shows the halved joint at the corner of the frame where the two pieces form a right angle see fig 28 1 each piece is halved and shouldered at opposite sides thus forming a perfect fit one with the other and giving a strong joint with a minimum amount of labour for inside work the joint would be glued and screwed together the screw heads being countersunk so as not to come in contact with the cutting iron of the plane when levelling off the work for outside work in exposed positions where the work will have to withstand the weather the alternative method of smearing the joint with paint or with a mixture of varnish and white lead would be advisable the joint being nailed or screwed fig 29 shows the two pieces separated fig 30 shows a similar joint to the above but in this case the top rail runs through and it is generally spoken of as a halved t joint fig 28 2 it may be used in nearly all cases where a top or bottom rail runs through an upright the method of securing the joint is as before fig 30 shows a sketch of the joint separated illustration fig 31oblique halving with shoulder illustration fig 32oblique halving at fig 31 is shown an oblique halving joint where the oblique piece or strut does not run through fig 28 3 this type of joint is used for strengthening framings and shelf brackets an example of the latter is shown at fig 48 a strut or rail of this type prevents movement or distortion to a frame diagonally generally spoken of in the trade as racking fig 31 shows the joint apart fig 32 is an example of oblique halving with the upper piece running through fig 28 4 this joint is used in similar positions to fig 31 and has in some cases the disadvantage of showing end grain at the top of the frame the sketch shows the two pieces separated fig 33 is dovetail halving the dovetail running through the top piece fig 28 5 this is a strong joint used where outside strain is likely to occur in the top piece the dovetail preventing the rail from being drawn away from the shoulder the two pieces are shown separate illustration fig 33dovetail halving illustration fig 34mitre halving at fig 34 is seen mitred halving a somewhat weak joint but necessary in mirror frames etc where good appearance is required on the face side fig 28 6 its use is obvious if the face of the frame be moulded with beads or other sections which require to intersect one with the other this also applies if the frame be moulded on its face edges fig 35 is a halved joint with one side of the piece dovetailed fig 28 8 this joint is used in similar positions to fig 33 and rather less labour is required in the making the two pieces are shown separate for clearness fig 36 indicates the halved joint the pieces at one end showing a double dovetail fig 28 7 this particular joint is seldom used except for manual training purposes the illustration shows a sketch of the joint apart fig 37 is oblique dovetail halving one side of the piece being dovetailed the joint is used to prevent racking and as a cross brace to framing it is occasionally made with both its sides dovetailed as shown at fig 33 for reference see fig 28 9 illustration fig 35halved joint with one side dovetailed illustration fig 36halved joint with double dovetail illustration fig 37oblique dovetail halving illustration fig 38stopped dovetail halving fig 38 shows stopped dovetail halving in this case the dovetail is similar to fig 33 with the exception that it does not run through the bottom rail this is an advantage if the bottom edge of the rail is in evidence or if it is required to glue a moulding or hardwood facing slip on the lower edge the glue adheres better with the grain than it would end way of the grain and if slight shrinkage occurs across the width of the bottom rail the moulding would not be forced away by the upright see example at fig 28 10 illustration fig 39cross halving joint illustration fig 40cross halving joint edgeways illustration fig 41tee halving joint the joint lettered b in fig 28 is a cross halving joint where each piece runs through the other fig 39 shows this joint separated and fig 40 shows a similar joint separated where the joint is made edgeways fig 41 shows a tee halving joint with a dovetail cut on the edge this is seldom used except as a woodwork exercise fig 42 is a dovetailed halving joint used for lengthening timber and is also a favourite manual training model it might also come under the heading of scarf joint although rarely used in actual practice as such as a practical woodwork exercise it calls for accurate marking out and careful fitting illustration fig 42dovetailed halving joint used for lengthening timber illustration fig 43dovetailed and halved joint illustration fig 44dovetailed halved joint with shoulders fig 43 shows a combination of a halved joint dovetailed edgeways whilst fig 44 shows a dovetailed halved joint with the shoulders housed this latter is seldom used in actual work at fig 45 we have the application of halving joints when constructing a barrow wheel the centre portion is an example of three pieces halflapped or as it is sometimes called onethird lapped a sketch of the three pieces separated is shown at l b c fig 46 this joint is extensively used in the pattern making trade for lapjointing the arms of pulley patterns etc it is probably the most difficult of the halving joints to mark out and construct with the desired degree of accuracy illustration fig 45halved joints on barrow wheels illustration fig 46detail of halved joints in fig 45 fig 47 shows a combination of a bevelled dovetail halflapped joint this is only used as a puzzle joint when neatly constructed and glued together it is apparently impossible to make it showing as it does a half lap on one side and a dovetailed half lap on the reverse side fig 48 is the end view of a kitchen table with drop leaf showing the skirting board scribed to the solid side a table of this type is fastened to the wall with two iron holdfasts which engage the ends of the table the hinged bracket frame shows the application of the halving joint to bracket supports for this and similar purposes such as brackets to support shelving etc in this example the hinged brackets turn underneath the table top and allow the leaf to drop out of the way when not required the dotted lines show the position of a shelf for boots and shoes illustration fig 47bevelled

parts of fig 55 shown separate fig 51 is an oblique cross halving joint where the two pieces are not at right angles a plan and elevation of the joint are shown at the left whilst a sketch of one piece of the joint is given in the righthand illustration figs 52 and 53 are principally used as manual training models and call for patience and manual dexterity fig 54 is used in carpentry and joinery where a tie or cross piece ties joists or beams at an angle fig 55 shows the elevation and end view of a cross halving joint with housed or notched shoulders this joint is seldom used in actual practice the separate parts are given in fig 56 at fig 57 are shown two cross rails and an upright halved together this type of joint is used where three pieces meet as is the case in building the framing of a poultry house the joint is nailed together illustration fig 57cross rail and upright halved joint illustration fig 58workshop trestle joint illustration fig 59cellarette partition joints fig 58 is the end view of an ordinary workshop trestle showing the application of dovetailed halving where the legs have a tendency to strain outwards the inset sketch of joint shows the housing of the top rail to receive the legs fig 59 shows a deep drawer generally known as a cellarette and used in a sideboard to accommodate wine bottles here we have a good example of halving the cross pieces so as to form compartments the part shown separately illustrates the method of construction the ends of these pieces engage the housings or grooves of the drawer sides pigeon holes or compartments in stationery cases bookcases and writing bureaux are constructed in a similar manner although the method of housing or combined halving and housing is to be preferred in some cases illustration fig 60joint used for table with circular top or rim at fig 60 is the plan of a circular table having a small circular shelf with the top removed the rims or framing are built by the method known as laminating see fig 23 in chapter on the the glued joint after which they are veneered on the face sides the application of the halving joint to the shaped bottom rails which in this case carry and support the small shelf is shown in the part elevation illustration fig 61 aoxford frame with halved joints four alternative corner treatments are given illustration fig 61 bhalved joint of oxford frame with front edges champered illustration fig 61 cback view of oxford frame fig 61 a shows the wellknown oxford frame illustrating halved joints when the edge is rebated figs 61 b and 61 c make clear the construction of this type of joint alternative suggestions are shown for the treatment of the corners the simple inlay being black and white ebony and holly or boxwood frames of this type are made in various widths and sizes and are used for pictures mirrors etc illustration fig 62the two pieces of a halved joint the tools used for making joints of the above class are planes the gauge tenon or other saw chisels try square and in some cases a joiners bevel to obtain and mark the necessary angles pencil and marking knife plane up the face side and face edge of the timber gauge and plane to both thickness and width mark shoulders with pencil or marking knife gauge to the thickness of the required halving saw waste portions away pare up with chisel to a good fit glue or glue and screw or use paint as previously mentioned and then level off the surfaces setting out the halved jointalthough at first sight the halved joint may appear to be a very easy item of construction it requires much care and attention in marking out and sawing fig 62 shows the two pieces which form the joint separated and it will be noticed that each piece of wood has half its thickness cut away so as to accommodate the other piece this type of joint is used where two pieces of wood cross each other at right angles or at an angle as shown in fig 51 the halving joint is used also for joining two pieces of wood at their ends as for instance the corner of a frame one half of this joint being shown at fig 65 b illustration fig 63how the timber is marked illustration fig 64marking the joint with try square to make the joint the timber should be carefully planed to its exact width and thickness the two pieces may then be placed upon the bench as shown at fig 63 or fixed in the vice find the centre of the timber c fig 63 and set out half the width of the wood on each side of the dotted centre line thus suppose the wood w to be 2 ins wide then set 1 in on each side of the centre line take a square as at fig 64 and with a sharp penknife blade score or cut a line all round each piece of timber illustration fig 65using the marking gauge next take up a marking gauge and set the marking point to half the thickness of the wood the distance may be measured and its exactness tested by pricking a small hole from each side of the wood with the marking gauge and carefully noting that the pricked holes coincide the gauge mark is clearly shown in the various illustrations now take a pencil and scribble or mark waste on the parts you intend to cut away this will save trouble later on especially if you are making several joints at once take your sharp penknife or marking knife blade and cut fairly deeply into the marked line on the portion you are going to pare away illustration fig 66chiselling away wood up to gauge line illustration fig 67how work is held when sawing shoulder fix the wood firmly in your vice or against your cutting board or bench stop as may be more convenient to you and with a sharp chisel cut away the wood up to the marked line as at fig 66 the channel in the sketch is exaggerated so as to show the method clearly the object of using a penknife or marking knife to mark your work instead of using a pencil will be obvious owing to the knife having scored about 116 in deep across the fibres of the wood the timber will come away cleanly when the chisel is used as at fig 66 the small channel thus made will form a guide in which to start your tenon or dovetail saw it prevents the saw cutting on the wrong side of the marked line and thus making the halving too wide illustration fig 68paring away waste with chisel illustration fig 69showing an oblique halved joint sawinglay the work on the cutting board as at fig 67 or if you prefer put the work in the vice carefully saw down the work until you just touch the gauge line do not press heavily with the saw use it lightly the weight of the back iron which is fixed on the saw will ensure the saw feeding into the work quite fast enough if the saw is newly sharpened it will in fact be an advantage to slightly ease the weight of the saw from off the wood owing to the keenness of its edge if the halving is a very wide one additional cuts may be sawn between the outside marks and these will greatly facilitate the removal of the waste wood when paring it away for sawing the joint reference may be made to the chapter on dovetailing illustration fig 70sawing the cheek of a halving joint paring away the waste material with a chisel is the next step and this is shown at fig 68 the work may be chiselled either in a vertical or a horizontal position the horizontal position is the easiest for the amateur who has a vice or handscrew because he may hold the work securely with a mechanical device and so avoid the unnecessary risk to his fingers take the chisel and cut away a fig 68 now turn the chisel and cut away b after which keep the chisel horizontal and cut off the top of the hill as it were c repeat the three operations until you gradually pare the wood away exactly to the gauge line when chiselling if you find a tendency for the work to chip or crumble at the back edge owing to the forward pressure of the chisel turn your wood round and begin to cut from the other edge allowing the chisel to finish paring at the centre joints other than a right angleif the halving joint is at an angle similar to the sketch shown at fig 69 great care will have to be exercised in the use of the chisel owing to the change in the direction of the grain of the wood the arrow marks in this sketch distinctly indicate the direction in which the chiselling must be done so as to give a smooth result this change of direction for cutting also applies to the bottom of the halving joint cutting joint at end of timber fig 70should the halving joint be used at the end of a piece of wood as at fig 30 the waste material may be roughly sawn away and the flat surface trimmed up with a chisel to saw out this type of halving joint proceed to work the shoulder line as already described then place the piece of wood obliquely in the vice as shown fig 70 and proceed to saw down the vertical line carefully watching the gauge line to see that you saw on the waste side of the lines then turn the piece of timber with its opposite edge towards you and again use the saw as illustrated you will this time only have to watch the gauge mark on the edge of the wood because the saw will readily follow in the saw kerf already made now place the wood vertically in the vice and keeping the saw in a horizontal position saw down to the shoulder line halving joints properly made and fitted should knock together with the weight of the clenched fist the use of a heavy mallet or hammer will deface the work illustration fig 71joints used in the erection of a queen post roof truss the bridle joint a bridle joint is often defined as the reverse of a mortise and tenon and is chiefly used in the carpentry and joinery trades the name probably originated from the fact that it bears some resemblance to the manner in which a bit slips into the horses mouth and is fastened to the bridle there are fewer varieties of the bridle joint than of the halved or the mortise and tenon and this being the case we may take the opportunity of giving a few detailed directions with explanatory illustrations on the setting out and the making illustration fig 72simple bridle joint fig 72 shows a bridle joint in what is perhaps its simplest form the separate pieces being given at the left and the completed joint at the right a joint of this type may be applied in nearly all cases where a halved or a mortise and tenon joint could be used bridle joints have an advantage as regards appearance over the mortise and tenoned variety in cases such as fig 73 which shows an occasional table leg fitted to the circular top framing the bridle joint here allows the grain of the leg to run through to the top and gives a better and more workmanlike appearance to the completed article illustration fig 73table leg bridlejointed to rail fig 74 is a mitred bridle joint the part a showing the upright portion separated this is a most useful joint for positions similar to that shown in the small glass frame fig 75 the wood framing in this case is only 138 in in width and if a mortise were used it would have to be exceptionally small the shaped rail at the bottom of this frame again shows the application of the bridle joint fig 76 shows an oblique bridle joint used in many instances as a brace or strut to prevent framing from racking see also figs 31 and 32 fig 77 is a stopped bridle joint used in positions where the top or bottom edge of the work meets the eye and where if the rail were allowed to run through the end grain would appear unsightly illustration fig 74mitre bridle joint illustration fig 75mirror frame with bridle joints fig 78 is a socalled bridlejoint at the corner of a frame this is also called an open slot mortise and tenon joint a good strong serviceable joint which can be used instead of the closed mortise and tenon type its advantage being that less labour is required in the making see also fig 169 fig 79 is an oblique angle bridle joint used in similar positions to the above but when the two pieces meet at an acute angle at the end of a frame fig 80 shows the application of the bridle joint to a roof truss two sketches are shown at the joining of the tie beam and the principal rafter the joint a is the type generally used see also fig 71 for the joints in a queen post roof illustration fig 76oblique bridle joint illustration fig 77stopped bridle joint illustration fig 78bridle joint at corner of frame illustration fig 79oblique angle bridle joint illustration fig 80application of bridle joint to roof truss setting out and markingit is a safe rule when setting out a bridle joint to divide the thickness of the timber into three equal parts this will leave the timber on each side of the tongue equal to the thickness of the tongue thus giving uniform strength to the joint the bridle joint is chiefly used for connecting the internal parts of wooden frames it is stronger than the halving joint and owing to its peculiar construction requires little in the way of pegs screws or nails to secure it in position fig 81 illustrates the joint both open and closed to understand the method of setting out and marking glance at the sketch fig 81 it is not necessary that the bridle piece a be the same width as the cross piece b but it must be remembered when setting out the joint with the marking knife or pencil that the width marked w on piece b must be equal to the width w on the piece a the timber should be fairly accurately sawn or planed to the same thickness and all edges should be square and true the wood is placed upon the bench and the joint marked out by using a marking knife or penknife blade and the try square a knife blade is much better than a pencil as the sharp edge severs the fibres of the wood and gives a finer line than the pencil it is not always necessary to exactly square and trim the end of piece a it may with advantage in many cases be left at least 14 in longer than necessary and levelled off with the saw plane and chisel after the joint is put together see method of cutting in fig 92 page 47 when the piece a has to have a bridle joint fitted at each end it is customary to cut the timber about 38 in longer than necessary and mark the shoulder lines c to the exact length after which the joints are cut this leaves the ends standing over the horizontal rails and after fixing the complete frame together the small projecting ends are levelled off flush with the cross rails gaugingafter squaring all the shoulder lines round the timber with the knife and try square the mortise gauge should be set so as to strike the two gauge lines marked g figs 83 and 84 at one operation if the worker does not possess a mortise gauge the lines may be marked at two distinct operations with the aid of the marking gauge fig 82 the gauge should be adjusted so as to mark the wood into thirds and the stock of the gauge the portion of the gauge containing the thumb screw in fig 82 must be used from the face side of the timber when gauging up the whole of the pieces forming a frame the face mark on the work is indicated by a glorified comma and the edge mark is shown by x as in the various illustrations fig 82 shows the method of holding the gauge in the right hand whilst gauging the lines on the work illustration fig 81bridle joint open and closed illustration fig 82gauging the timber the joint when marked out will appear as at figs 83 and 84 and the portions which are to be cut away may be shaded with a pencil as indicated this will prevent mistakes arising whilst cutting the work especially by one who is not thoroughly familiar with the joint the distance a b in fig 84 must not be less than the distance a b in fig 83 illustration fig 83 fig 84 the two parts of the joint marked boring away wasteexamine fig 84 the shaded portion in the centre has to be cut away and it will greatly facilitate the removal of this waste piece by boring a hole with a twist bit at the position shown the twist bit should be about 18 in less in diameter than the width between the gauge lines g the easiest method of boring out this hole is shown at fig 85 which gives the correct position of the worker illustration fig 85vertical boring previous to chiselling sawingthe wood should be put in the vice as fig 86 taking up a saw with the index finger on the side of the handle commence sawing and proceed until you come to the position indicated by the dotted hand and saw a this will leave a saw kerf or cut running diagonally from the shoulder line to corner of the wood release the vice and refix the wood so that it leans in exactly the opposite direction to fig 86 then reverse your own position and repeat the sawing so as to cut another diagonal saw cut from the shoulder line to the corner fix the wood upright as shown at fig 87 and saw as shown when you will find that the saw has no tendency to run out of the guide cuts already formed by the method used at fig 86 remember when commencing to saw at fig 86 that it is necessary to saw inside the gauge line otherwise the joint will be too slack owing to the amount of sawdust removed by the thickness of the saw blade the index finger on the side of the saw pointing in the direction of the saw cut will greatly help the worker to saw in a straight line as it is natural to point with this finger to any object that is to be aimed at illustration fig 86how the saw is held for the first cut cut down the other line in a similar manner and then with a chisel of suitable width carefully chop away the waste material the wood may be placed edge way upon the bench or in the vice and the chisel should be held vertically the hole which has been bored with the twist bit will allow the chips which are cut away to offer little or no resistance to the chisel blade the chiselling should not all be done from one side or a chipped underedge will be the result it is better to chisel the work until halfway through and then turn the other edge of the wood uppermost and again begin to chisel from the top this method will finish the cutting in the centre of the work and prevent burred and ragged or chipped edges at the shoulder illustration fig 87third or horizontal cut illustration fig 88chiselling operation cutting the shoulderswith regard to working the piece b fig 81 place the wood against the bench stop or in the vice and taking up a 34in chisel carefully cut away a small channel as shown at fig 88 treat the other shoulder lines in a similar manner if the marking knife or penknife blade has been used with a fair amount of pressure so as to score the fibres of the wood this small channel which is to form a guide for the saw will quickly and easily be cut next place the wood in the vice or on the cutting board as shown at fig 89 and begin by sawing lightly at the back edge as shown when the saw has entered the wood 14 in gradually bring the handle down from position a to position b dotted lines whilst the saw is in motion continue sawing until just on the gauge line then treat the other shoulder lines in a similar manner illustration fig 89sawing the shoulders chiselling away wastefix your wood firmly in any suitable manner vice or otherwise and holding your chisel tilted as at fig 90 pare away the blacked portion 1 then pare away the blacked portion 2 after which hold the chisel flat and by gradual operations pare away the dotted lines 3 until you come down to the gauge line then repeat the method of cutting on the opposite side of the wood if any difficulty be experienced by chipped or ragged edges whilst chiselling it can easily be overcome by chiselling alternately from the outside of the wood so that the finish of the chisel cut takes place in the centre of the work some prefer to chisel away the waste by placing the wood on its edge and using the chisel vertically instead of horizontally the same methods 1 2 and 3 hold good in this case illustration fig 90chiselling away waste joints other than at 90the two pieces forming a bridle joint are not always at right angles as at fig 81 in many instances it is necessary that the joint be at other than 90 degrees the work however is treated in a similar manner with the exception that an adjustable joiners bevel is used instead of a try square to mark out the shoulder lines and that a change of direction in the grain of the wood will occur when chiselling out the work fig 91 indicates the change in the grain of the wood and the adjustable joiners bevel is also shown illustration fig 91bridle joint at angle other than right angle illustration fig 92sawing off waste from bridle joint see reference on page 39 the tongued and grooved joint the tongued and grooved joint is used in one form or another throughout the whole of the woodworking trades covering as it does a great variety of work from the laying of flooring boards to the construction of dressers bookcases and other cabinet work flooring and match boarding generally have the tongues worked on the solid board and examples of a few of the various types are shown as follows illustration fig 93tongued and grooved flooring board illustration fig 94 fig 95 method of nailing hardwood floors fig 93 shows the end view of the ordinary 78in tongued and grooved flooring board as used in the construction of floors for mills workshops and cottage property this type of flooring is nailed to the joists in the ordinary manner no attempt being made to conceal the nails used fig 94 is a section of flooring which is generally made of hardwood such as maple oak or jarrah it is used in positions such as ballroom and skating rink floors etc the tongue and groove being worked in such a manner that the joint covers the nails as shown each nail is driven into its position at one edge of the board the groove holding the next board and hiding the nail fig 95 illustration fig 96tongued and grooved matchboarding with bead on one side illustration fig 97tongued and grooved matchboarding with bead at each side illustration fig 98matchboarding tongued grooved and veed fig 96 shows an example of matchboarding known as tongued grooved and beaded on one side only and fig 97 shows a similar type tongued grooved and beaded on both sides this variety of matchboarding is known in the trade as t g and b it is used for nailing on framing to form partitions for rooms offices etc for panelling corridors etc and for making framed and ledged doors building tool houses cycle sheds and other outhouses fig 98 is an example of matchboarding that is tongued grooved and veed on one side and fig 99 shows tongued grooved and veed both sides these are used for similar purposes to figs 96 and 97 and many prefer the v matchboarding variety because it is more easily painted than the beaded variety the object of working a bead or beads on matchboarding is to break the jointing of the various pieces and to aim at ornamental effect also to prevent unsightliness should the timber shrink slightly when a moderate amount of shrinkage takes place as is nearly always the case the joint at the side of the bead appears to the casual observer to be the fillet or channel worked at the side of the bead if the tongues are not painted before the work is put together the shrinkage will cause the raw wood to show and thus make the joint too much in evidence illustration fig 99matchboarding veed both sides illustration fig 100doubletongued matchboarding illustration fig 101doubledovetailed tongued and grooved fig 100 shows a double tongued and grooved joint used in the wholesale cabinet factories it is preferred for the jointing of cabinet stock and the amateur can make a similar joint by working two grooves and inserting loose tongues fig 101 is the end view of a doubledovetailed tongued and grooved joint and fig 102 is a sketch of a similar joint having only one dovetailed tongue from a constructional point of view fig 101 is far and away the best joint that has yet been produced unfortunately however there is not at the present time any hand tool that will economically produce it owing probably to the fact that the joint is the subject of a patent the dovetail tongue tapers slightly throughout its entire length gripping the joint on the principle of the wedge and squeezing the glue into the pores of the wood illustration fig 102joint with single dovetail tongue and groove illustration fig 103a cross tongue b feather tongue illustration fig 104method of secretnailing hardwood flooring boards cabinetwork jointswith regard to tongued and grooved joints which apply more particularly to the jointing of cabinet work fig 93 is produced by planes which are specially made for the purpose one plane makes the tongue and another the groove the handiest sizes to buy are those which joint 38 in 58 in and 34 in timber it being usual to dowel or loosetongue thicker boards the 38 in partitions or as they are sometimes called dustboards between the drawers of a sideboard or dressing chest are in good work jointed in this manner the 58 in and 34 in ends and tops of pine or american whitewood dressing tables wardrobes etc call for the larger sized plane loose tonguesthere are two methods of jointing with loose tongues viz the use of the cross tongue fig 103 a and the use of the feather tongue fig 103 b cross tongues are the stronger when glued in their position and can be used very much thinner than feather tongues feather tongues are cut diagonally across the grain as illustrated illustration fig 105cradle for planing fig 105 is a cradle for planing up loose tongues to the required width generally 78 in two grooves are made in a piece of 114 in hardwood one groove is used for planing the width way of the tongue and the other for planing the edge way these tongues can be cut to accurate size on a circular saw bench if power and machinery are at hand applications of the jointfig 106 is a sketch of a portion of a sideboard top showing the plough groove ready worked out to receive the tongue the other half of the top is treated in a similar manner it will be noticed that the groove is not worked through the full length of the board but stopped about 114 in from each end this leaves a square joint at each end of the top on which the moulding is worked if the groove be run through the board it looks very unsightly when the mould is finished fig 107 is a shaped spandrel such as is fixed in the recess of a sideboard or cupboard or shop window fitment it is of such a width that were it cut from a wide board the shaped portion would be apt to break off owing to the short grain at c the shaping is therefore built up out of three separate pieces the grain running as indicated the loose tongue is represented by the dotted line and a section is shown of the joint at the line a b at the opposite corner the tongue is left blind ie not run through the edge this is the method that should be used when the shaping is above the level of the eye illustration fig 106part of sideboard top grooved with ends left blind the boards are shown upright illustration fig 107shaped spandrel for recess fig 108 shows part of a carcase of a dressing table the drawer runner a is shown grooved across the end to receive a cross tongue this cross tongue engages a similar groove in the front bearer this method of fastening the runner to the bearer is in everyday use illustration fig 108part carcase of dressing table illustration fig 109framed writing table top fig 109 is a writing table top the centre boards are first jointed and glued up after which the ends and sides are grooved ready to receive the cross tongues the hardwood margins are shown at one end and at the front and the grooves are arranged so that on completion the marginal frame stands above the top just the amount of the thickness of the leather which will cover the table in some cases the margin at the end runs the same way of the grain as the top thus allowing for slight shrinkage cross tongues would of course be used in this case fig 110 is a sketch showing onequarter of a barred or tracery cabinet door an enlarged section of the astragal mould which is grooved to fit on the bar which forms the rebate is also shown fig 111 is a combing or corner locking joint a method of making boxes by means of a continuous use of tongues and grooves instead of dovetails this type of joint is generally machine made the amateur however who is not proficient to undertake a dovetailed box frequently uses this method illustration fig 110corner of barred door illustration fig 111combing or locking joint illustration fig 112single loose tongue and doubletongue joint corner jointsfig 112 shows both a single loose tongue and a double solid tongue both are methods used to connect circular cornered work such as a counter end to the front framing fig 113 indicates a tongued and grooved joint suitable for edge or end jointing such as fitting matchboarding round a chimney breast making small jewel drawers etc fig 114 is a tongued and grooved joint with a bead worked on same to hide the joint sometimes called a staffbead it would be used in positions such as boarding around an upright iron pillar etc the bead giving a neat finish at each corner fig 115 is a similar joint but at an obtuse angle an example of its use is in fixing boarding around an octagonal column of brickwork illustration fig 113 fig 114 fig 115 examples of tongued and grooved corner joints fig 116 shows a tongued and grooved mitre as used for strengthening the corners of cabinet work such as tea caddies small boxes plinths etc two pieces of wood are glued in position and allowed to set prior to glueing and cramping the joint proper these pieces are afterwards planed away thus leaving a clear surface to the box sides fig 117 shows the method of working the groove in the above joints the pieces are turned back to back the mitres thus making a right angle the guide on the grooving plane thus works against each face of the joint and this ensures correct jointing fig 118 is somewhat similar to fig 113 but with a quarter circle mould to hide the joint fig 119 indicates the building up of a double skirting mould c represents the brickwork a the oakframed panelling and b the packing and fixing block a wide skirting of this type is made in two portions for convenience in working the moulding and to prevent undue shrinkage illustration fig 116cramping a tongued and grooved mitre illustration fig 117working a groove illustration fig 118corner joint with corner mould fig 120 illustrates the use of a tongued and grooved joint for fixing together the sides of a corner bracket and the same method holds good when jointing a corner cupboard a capping mould or top shelf will conceal the joint it then has the appearance of a glued butt joint but is of course considerably stronger no screws or nails are required if this joint be used ploughingwhen grooves have to be worked in the edge or face of a board to receive tongues the process is generally called ploughing and it is usually accomplished by a special tool called a plough or as it is occasionally spelt plow when a plough plane is bought it is usual to procure eight plough bits or blades of various sizes to fit the plane in fig 121 is given the sketch of a plough plane with the names of the various parts lettered thereon illustration fig 119double skirting mould illustration fig 120joint for corner bracket or cupboard the board or boards which it is desired to groove are first planed straight and true exactly as though it were desired to make a glued or butt joint one of the boards is now placed edge way up in the vice and with the face side to the worker take the plough plane and select a suitablysized blade fix it in the plane in the usual way allowing the cutting edge to project beyond the steel skate about 132 in and securely drive up the wedge next loosen the small boxwood wedges at the side of each stem and adjust the plane by tapping the stems with a hammer until the cutting iron is in the desired position then knock up the small wedges nice and tight when setting the fence to or from the blade it is a wise precaution to measure the distance from the fence to the skate at each end of the plane this will ensure the skate being parallel to the fence the neglect of this is a source of annoyance to many amateurs now adjust the depth stop by turning the screw at the top of the plane measuring the depth of the required groove from the edge of the blade to the stop and carefully lock the screw which adjusts this stop illustration fig 121the plough plane and its parts the plane is now ready for use hold the fence close up to the side of the timber the hands in position as shown at fig 122 the position of the body being that generally assumed in planing move the plane backwards and forwards in the usual manner beginning the cut at the end of the board nearest to the vice jaws the front and proceed with the planing until the depth stop is in contact with the wood then take a step backwards and repeat the process until the whole length of the groove is ploughed care must be taken to force the fence up to the board with the left hand whilst the right hand thrusts the plane backwards and forwards and the plane must be kept vertical illustration fig 122method of using the plough plane tongueingthe grooves having been completed the tongues have to be made fig 123 shows a sketch of a board and the method of marking out cross tongues a and feather tongues b the usual procedure for making cross tongues is to plane the end of the board and use a cutting gauge to give a line the required distance from the end see sketch the board is sawn with a tenon or panel saw and the piece of timber for the tongue is thus procured if a feather tongue is to be used it is cut diagonally from the board b and the ends cut square as shown by the dotted line illustration fig 123method of marking out for cross tongues and feather tongues feather tongues can be obtained in fairly long lengths out of narrow boards whilst on the other hand cross tongues are limited by the width of the board after cutting off the tongues they require planing with nicety to fit the grooves and the advantage of a grooved board fig 105 will be appreciated a glue spoon similar to a plumbers ladle is generally used to pour the glue into the grooves and it is customary to glue the tongue into one board first after allowing this to set the joint is completed in the usual manner tongueing planesfig 124 shows the end view of a tongueing plane for working matched joints out of the solid the method of holding and using the plane is similar to the directions given for using the plough the part lettered f in front represents the fence which in this case is not adjustable illustration fig 124 fig 125 end views of tongueing and grooving planes in description fig 125 is similar to fig 124 the steel skate runs in the groove and supports the cutting blade similar to that in the plough plane and provided a grooving plane of this type is of suitable width it may be used for making grooves for loose tongues there is on the market a metal plane which is specially designed with handles at both ends this plane carries a grooving iron on one side and a tongueing iron on the other side thus with one plane both the tongue and the groove can be worked illustration fig 126tongueing shoulders of tenons fig 126 shows the method of tongueing the shoulders of tenons as used in thick timber which is to be veneered on the face a temporary piece of wood a is put between the tenon cheek and the saw thus forming a guide for the latter after cutting one saw kerf a thicker piece is made and a second saw kerf cut the waste between the saw kerfs is now removed with an 18 in chisel and this completes the groove a tongue of this type acts as an extra tenon and prevents the joint from lipping becoming uneven on the face side the mortise and tenon joint a mortise and tenon joint is the method of joining timber by working a solid rectangular projection in the one piece and cutting a corresponding cavity to receive it in the adjoining piece the projection is called the tenon and the cavity the mortise joints of this type are secured in various ways small wedges wooden dowels metal dowel pins glue and paint are frequently used and prior to the introduction of glue we have examples of egyptian furniture in which the mortise and tenon joints were united by a composition of cheese illustration fig 127barefaced tenon joint illustration fig 128stub tenon barefaced tenonsfig 127 illustrates the joint in its simplest form and shows a tenon having only one shoulder this is called a barefaced tenon and it will be noticed that the portion which carries the mortise is thicker than the rail on which the tenon is cut the joint is therefore level or flush as it is called on one side only and it should never be used at the corner of a frame it is a useful interior joint for framing that has to be covered on the back side with matchboarding and allows the work to finish level at the back when the boarding has been applied see plan fig 127 stub or stump tenon fig 128 also occasionally called a joggle tenonthe illustration shows a tenon as used in the interior of a frame the tenon is not allowed to run through the stile and unsightliness on the edge is thus avoided this type of tenon is often used at the corner of a frame and it then requires to be haunched a good workshop method of gauging the depth of the mortise for a stub tenon is shown in fig 129 a piece of gummed stamp paper is stuck on the side of the mortise chisel indicating the desired depth of the mortise this greatly facilitates the work as it is not necessary to be constantly measuring a haunched tenon as used at the end of a door frame is shown at fig 130in this case it will be seen that the width of the tenon is reduced so that sufficient timber will be left at the end of the stile to resist the pressure of the tenon when the joint is driven together the short portion a which is left on the tenon is called the haunch and the cavity it engages is termed the haunching the haunch and haunching prevent the two pieces of timber lipping or becoming uneven on the face side as would be the result if it were cut away entirely up to the shoulder fig 131 shows the type of tenon and haunch used when the stile or upright rail is grooved to receive a panel in this and similar cases the haunch is made the same width and the same depth as the groove the groove therefore acts as the haunching an application of this joint is shown in the top rail of the door frame fig 132 illustration fig 129method of gauging for depth of tenon

occasionally used where the work in hand demands a thin tenon and a stout stump to take heavy strains illustration fig 134joint for inside framing illustration fig 135haunched barefaced tenon a joint used for inside framing is seen at fig 134 the rails may be used as shown but in the case of a door frame as fig 132 they would have the inside edges grooved to receive the panels the tenons would therefore be slightly narrower than shown owing to the groove at each edge a haunched barefaced tenon used in similar positions to fig 131 is shown at fig 135 the door or frame in this case would be made of matchboarding nailed on the back as shown in the plan at fig 127 wedgesfig 136 shows the method of cutting wedges which are to be used to wedge the tenons this avoids waste of material some workers cut the wedges from the pieces left out of the haunching of the lock rail or the bottom rail illustration fig 136cutting wedges from waste of haunching illustration fig 137stile and cross rail with horn a stile and cross rail framed together are shown at fig 137 the portion above the rail is called the horn and it is usual to leave sufficient length of stile to project above and below the cross rails so that there will be no tendency for the stile to burst out at the end whilst the cramping and wedging of the frame is in progress on completing the framing the horn is cut away in fig 138 we have a type of joint frequently used for garden gates the illustration shows the method of tenoning the three pieces to the top rail barefaced tenons being employed illustration fig 138joint used for garden gates illustration fig 139sprocket wheel illustration fig 140boring tool sprocket wheelat fig 139 are shown the guide bar and chain of a chainmortising machine two enlarged links of the chain being indicated at a the chain is similar in construction to the driving chain of a bicycle with the exception that it is provided with teeth which cut away the timber as the chain revolves when using a chain mortiser the portion of the machine carrying the chain is fed downwards into the timber thus cutting a clean and true mortise if however a stump mortise is required it is necessary to pare away a certain amount of timber by hand because the machine obviously leaves a semicircular bottom to the mortise to overcome this difficulty the latest types of mortising machines have a square holeboring attachment fixed alongside the chain this tool the working portion of which is illustrated in fig 140 consists of a square hollow chisel e which is sharpened from the inside and a revolving twist bit d fitted with spurs or nickers but without a point one spur can be seen at the bottom of the illustration this bit revolves inside the shell like a chisel and bores away the superfluous timber whilst the pressure exerted on the chisel causes the corners to be cut away dead square a mortise 38 in square by 6 ins in depth may thus be cut the portion marked a is the shank of the chisel fig 140 where it is fixed into the body of the machine and the hole at e allows the boring bit to free itself illustration fig 141method of fitting an interior table leg illustration fig

rail the inlaid leg in this case is stumptenoned into the top rail and the inlaid portion of the leg is allowed to run through the rail thus giving continuity of design fig 142 shows the application of the haunched tenon fig 135 to the making of a skylight or garden frame in this and similar cases the side rails are rebated as shown in the section and the bottom rail is thinner than the side rails to allow the glass to finish level upon it long and short shouldered jointfig 143 shows a haunched mortise and tenon joint having a long and short shoulder this is a fairly common joint in framed partitions for offices framing for greenhouses tool sheds etc and is a frequent source of annoyance to the amateur it is necessary to use this joint when both the stiles and uprights are rebated and it calls for accurate marking out and great care in the making illustration fig 144joint for fencing illustration fig 145example of faulty tenon fig 144 shows the upright and rails of common garden or field fencing the tenons are bevelled to fit and wedge each other in the mortise the illustration gives both cross rails as shouldered but in many cases shoulders are omitted when the rails are not thick enough to carry them fig 145 indicates faulty methods of working a tenon at a the saw has been allowed to run too far when cutting the shoulder thus greatly weakening the tenon at b faulty sawing has again occurred and to remedy this defect the worker has resorted to paring the shoulder with a chisel had the chisel been used vertically an undercut shoulder as at b would not have occurred the trouble now is that the slightest amount of shrinkage in the width of the stile will show an open joint the result will be the same if it is necessary to remove a shaving or two when planing or levelling up the face of the frame illustration fig 146selfwedging japanese tenon joint illustration fig 147tenoned and scribed joint illustration fig 148mitred and moulded tenon joint

to be readily taken apart the tenon is dovetailed on one side and the mortise is made of sufficient width to permit the widest part of the dovetailed tenon to pass into it when the tenon is in its position a hardwood wedge is driven in above the tenon as shown illustration fig 157dovetailed and wedged tenon illustration fig 158method of foxwedging fox wedged tenon fig 158this is the method of securing a stub tenon by small wedges the mortise is slightly dovetailed and two saw cuts are made in the tenon about 316 in from each side into each saw kerf a wedge is inserted and the joint glued up the cramping operation forces the wedges into the saw cuts thus causing the end of the tenon to spread and tightly grip the mortise mortise and tenon with mitred face fig 159this is a useful method of jointing framing which has square edges as shown and it is equally useful even if the face edges have moulds worked upon them if the joint has square edges a rebate may be formed to accommodate a

the usual manner and a 38in twist bit is used to bore a hole through piece a the tenon is driven home and the hole is marked on the side of the tenon b the tenon is then withdrawn and the hole bored about 18 in nearer to the shoulder than as marked on the separate diagram at c when the tenon is finally inserted the holes will not register correctly and if a hardwood pin be driven into the joint it will draw the shoulders of the tenon to a close joint and effectually secure the parts sash barsfig 165 shows how to tenon a moulded sash bar to the rebated cross rail in this illustration both shoulders of the moulded bar are shown square but in the best class work these shoulders may be slightly housed into the cross rail to prevent side play this type of joint is used for horticultural buildings etc if the lower rail be moulded with the same members as the sash bar the end of the sash bar will have to be scribed on to it to make a fit illustration fig 165tenoning moulded sash bar

table framingfig 167 indicates the framing of a rail to a diningtable leg in cases similar to this the tenons run into the leg and almost touch each other they are therefore mitred on the end as shown in the inset chair frames often call for similar treatment twin tenons with haunch as used when the timber is of great thickness are shown in fig 168 an open slot mortise at the end of a rightangled frame is seen in fig 169 fig 170 shows an open slot mortise and tenon joint at the end of a frame of 60 both these joints are occasionally called end bridle joints illustration fig 168twin tenons for

prevent wide surfaces from winding a variation of the joint is shown at the lefthand side the corners in this example not being mitred fig 173 shows the tenoning of a wide to a narrow rail when the joint is at an angle inserted tenons fig 174where two pieces of timber run together at an acute angle it becomes necessary to use inserted tenons both pieces of the timber are mortised and the inserted tenons are secured into the widest piece on the left is shown the inserted tenon secured by the method known as foxwedging on the right the inserted tenon has been let into the wide rail from

stiles and rails for tenoning general rulein practically all cases where a single tenon is used the thickness of the tenon should be onethird the thickness of the timber this leaves the timber at each side of the mortise the same strength as the tenon mortise and tenon joints for inside work may be united with glue if however the work has to stand the weather a better method is to unite the joint with white lead which is run down to the required consistency with good outside varnish setting out the jointthe principal use of the mortise and tenon joint is in the construction of various types of framing such as door and window frames in one or other of its many and varied forms it may be classed as the most important joint in the general woodworking trade the joint may be used as an internal one as shown at the lower rail fig 176 or as an external joint as the upper rail of the same illustration whatever type of framing has to be made it is necessary that the face side of the wood be planed up straight and out of winding and the face mark as shown in fig 176 pencilled upon it the best edge of the timber should next be planed up true in length and square to the face side and the edge mark x clearly placed upon it the marking gauge is now set to the desired width and gauge lines are marked on the wood after which the waste wood is planed off until the timber is the required width the thickness is gauged and treated in a similar manner except in such cases where the finished work is to be of a rough and ready character the two stiles or uprights have their faces turned to touch each other as shown at fig 177 and their length may be anything from 1 in to 3 ins longer than the required finished size this waste wood at each end of the stiles see arrow ho is of importance to the work as it prevents to a great extent the bursting of the mortise whilst cutting the hole or when knocking together the work the small projection is called the horn and it is cut off after the frame has been put together illustration fig 178setting out the stiles with marking knife illustration fig 179how to saw the tenonsfirst operation the two cross rails fig 177 have their faces placed together as shown in the sketch these rails may with advantage be left 12 in longer than the finished size and the portion of the tenon which will protrude through the stile 14 in at each end may be cut off after the work is put together see fig 92 set out the stiles with a marking knife or penknife and a try square as shown at fig 178 in this sketch only one stile is shown for clearness of representation but two or more stiles as at fig 177 may be marked out at the same time provided a 12in try square be used in fact marking out the stiles in pairs is to be recommended as all cross lines will be exact owing to their being marked at the same operation the cut made by the marking knife should be lightly carried all round the work as the mortising is cut from each edge of the stile the cutting of the mortising being finished in the centre the lettering on fig 177 is as followsho horn m position of mortise h position of haunching a inside line or sight size as it is occasionally called set out the cross rails as at fig 177 lower sketch the lettering in this figure is as followst tenons the small piece of the tenon lettered j is called the haunch and the shaded portion h is cut away to allow the haunch j to fit the haunching of the stile the tenons as already stated are generally onethird the thickness of the timber thus leaving the same amount of substance at each side of the tenon as the tenon itself is composed of the mortise gauge is set to the required distance and used as in the case of the marking gauge fig 82 illustration fig 180second operation in sawing tenons illustration fig 181cutting channel at shoulder of tenon before sawing to saw the tenons place the rail in the vice as at fig 179 and with a panel tenon or hand saw according to the size of the work cut down the outside of the tenon line as shown reverse your position and cut as shown at fig 180 then place the rail in a vertical position and you will find little or no difficulty in sawing down square with the shoulder line repeat the above methods of sawing until all the tenons are sawn next saw out the pieces at the side of the tenon by the following procedure place the rail against the bench stop or in the vice and cut a small channel in which to run your tenon saw as shown at fig 181 if you have scored the line deeply with your knife when you were marking out the work you will have little difficulty in removing a small portion with the chisel the amount removed in the illustration is of course exaggerated in the small channel thus made place the tenon saw and guiding the saw blade with the finger so as to keep it upright or square fig 182 saw away the waste material remove the waste material at the sides of the tenons in a similar way and then saw out the portion marked h fig 177 lower sketch the mortising of the stiles may next be taken in hand by putting the stiles edgeways in the vice and boring away the bulk of the waste wood from the mortise with a suitablesized twist bit and brace this method will save a great amount of noise as to a great extent it does away with the use of the mallet take the mallet and chisel and chop down about 38 in as shown at fig 183 then turn the chisel to the position shown at fig 184 and remove the small piece as shown continue these two operations until you are about halfway through the wood and then start in a similar manner at the line a fig 183 after which turn the other edge of the timber uppermost and repeat the methods shown illustration fig 182sawing away waste material illustration fig 183using the chisel and mallet for mortising fig 185 shows the sketch of a mortise which has its side removed so as to show the method of successive cuts with a chisel when removing the core from a mortise this in conjunction with the other sketches clearly shows the methods of working in many woodwork examinations the examiners insist that the mortise shall be removed by successive cuts with the chisel but we certainly advise the removal of much of the waste wood with a boring bit provided the worker can keep straight and well within the limitations of his gauge lines illustration fig 184removing waste of mortise with chisel removing haunchingafter removing the mortise hole the small portion which is called the haunching will require to be removed with a chisel this calls for no special remark as it is clearly shown in figs 187 and 188 fig 186 shows an everyday type of mortise and tenon joint separated it is used in cases where a straight joint is required on the upper or lower edge of the work whereas the upper rail of fig 176 shows the full haunch on the top edge in cases such as figs 187 and 188 where the edges of the frames are grooved to receive panels etc the width of the tenon is reduced by the width of the groove illustration fig 185mortise with side removed illustration fig 186the joint separated illustration fig 187removal of haunching illustration fig 188haunching with groove above this must be remembered by the worker when marking out his stiles with the marking knife fig 187 righthand sketch shows the haunch tenon and groove g at the bottom fig 188 lefthand illustration shows g groove at top and hh the haunch at the bottom tenons may be glued together and wedged as shown at fig 176 if for inside work but if for outside work they are generally smeared with thick paint and wedged up for lightclass cabinet work it is usual to cut the mortise about seveneighths of the distance through the stile and make the tenon to match it the edge of the finished work does not then show any indication of the joint and it leaves a nice clean surface at the edge of the work for polishing or varnishing illustration fig 189interlocking joint for seat rails of chair to leg interlocking chair jointa joint designed with a view to strengthening the construction of chairs at the point where they are weakest is shown in fig 189 the joint is an interlocking one so arranged that once the chair is glued up no motion of the side rail can be possible the groove in the side rail tenon is cut in such a manner that on the insertion of the back rail tenon the joint actually draws up and having done so is locked in position the exact location of this groove is obtained in a similar manner to that used in marking out tenons for drawbore pinning ie the tenon is inserted in its mortise and the position of the back rail mortise transferred to it after which the lines are set back by 164 in approximately to cause the joint to draw from the illustration the construction of the joint should be clear the method is particularly adapted to a section of rectangular form where one side is longer than the other such as the back leg of a chair as this shape allows for the accommodation of the extra length of tenon required the dowelling joint dowelling is the term generally given to the method of jointing timber and other materials by wooden or metal pegs which are called dowels for cabinetmaking and similar work straightgrained beechwood dowels are mostly used these may be bought by the gross in lengths of about 36 ins and of any desired diameter illustration fig 190steel dowel plate making dowelsmany however prefer to make what they require for the work in hand and the following is the method that is generally employed pieces of straightgrained wood are wrought to a square section after which the corners are planed away to form an octagonal section the sharp corners are now planed away and the roughly formed dowel is driven through a steel dowel plate fig 190 by the aid of a heavy hammer thus giving the necessary roundness and finish to the dowels when hammering dowels through a plate the hammer should on no account be allowed to come in contact with the face of the dowel plate or the cutting edge of the hole will be spoilt simply drive the dowel to within 18 in of the plate and knock it out with the next dowel illustration fig 191cradle for planing dowels illustration fig 192dowel with groove illustration fig 193sawing groove in dowel to plane off the corners a cradle fig 191 is made and kept for the purpose the advantage of this cradle is obvious preventing as it does any tendency of the partlyformed dowel to slip or wobble a jig or cradle is easily made by bevelling the edges of two separate pieces of wood and then glueing and screwing them together as at fig 191 a small block of wood is inserted to act as a stop whilst the planing operation is in progress it is usual to bevel both edges of the timber from which the cradle is formed thus accommodating all sizes of dowels from 14 in to 58 in in diameter illustration fig 194pricking the centres ready for boring also showing how brace is used in conjunction with try square fig 192 shows a completed dowel with a small groove running along its entire length the object of this groove is to allow the air and superfluous glue to escape and thus avoid splitting the work on hand the groove also secretes a certain amount of glue which increases its hold on the timber fig 198 illustrates the method of marking out and gauging two boards for dowelling the edges of the boards are first shot to a true joint then the face sides are placed together and the lines for the dowels are marked across the edges with a fine pencil and the aid of a try square the boards are then gauged from the face side thus giving the points indicated in the sketch illustration fig 195countersink illustration fig 196dowel rounder illustration fig 197twist bit to start the twist bit fig 197 it is a good plan to prick the board at the point of intersection of the marked lines with a sharp circularpointed marking awl this obviates any tendency of the boring bit to run out of truth and thus cause unevenness on the face side of the jointed board see fig 194 a safe rule for the spacing of dowels when jointing sideboard tops dressing table and wardrobe ends etc is to place the dowels 9 ins to 10 ins apart and place two dowels at each end as shown at fig 198 the length of the dowels should be about 78 in to 114 in long fig 199 shows the two boards prepared ready for glueing the back one is bored to receive the dowels and the front one shows the dowels glued in position it is customary to warm the edges of the boards before spreading the glue and cramps are required to squeeze the joint tight these should be left on the jointed board from one to four hours according to the state of the weather in cases where thick timber say 2in or 212in boards is to be jointed two rows of dowels may be used the position of the dowels being as fig 200 illustration fig 198marking and gauging boards for dowelling illustration fig 199dowelled joint ready for glueing fig 201 shows the plan of a 3in cornice pole made to fit a bay window the straight portions of the pole are generally turned in the lathe the corner portions being afterwards jointed and worked up to the required shape to avoid any difficulty in the setting out of the dowels a disc of cardboard or sheet metal is made to the same diameter as that of the cornice pole this disc is called a template the positions of the dowels are set out geometrically and the centres are pricked through with a finepointed marking awl see sketch of template a fig 201 the template is put on the ends of the straight pole and the dowel centres are pricked into the wood the process is repeated on the ends of the corner block b fig 201 and if the holes be now bored at the centres indicated a true fit will be obtained illustration fig 200method of dowelling thick timber illustration fig 201method of dowelling cornice pole by means of template fig 201 c shows two portions of the circular pole jointed up to a corner block and the dotted lines p indicate the direct line of pressure and shows the position for the cramp when the glue is thoroughly set the corner block is sawn and spokeshaved to the desired shape as shown by the dotted line this method is illustrated to show that by the use of a suitable template dowels may be exactly set out even when there is no straight or square face from which to use a marking gauge and the method may of course be applied to many other examples of dowelling at the discretion of the workman illustration fig 202dowelling a mitred frame illustration fig 203method of frame dowelling long and short shoulders illustration fig 204table leaf with dowels illustration fig 205block for twist bit illustration fig 206dowelling for moulded frame illustration fig 207cap fig 202 shows one corner of a mitred and dowelled frame it needs little or no explanation beyond the fact that the dowels should be at right angles to the line of joint and consequently the dowel at the outside edge of the frame will have to be much shorter than the others this gives a strong and serviceable joint suitable for many purposes frame dowellingfig 203 shows one corner of a frame with long and short shoulders such as occurs when the upright is rebated through its entire length the holes in both pieces are bored for the dowels before they are rebated this avoids any difficulty in endeavouring to bore with only one side of the twist bit in the wood a similar type of joint is used on nearly all kinds of glass and door frames in cabinet work fig 204 is a leaf for the screw type of table circular dowels are shown at one end and rectangular wooden pegs at the other both methods are equally good and of course the dowels are only glued into one leaf the object of these dowels is to guide the table leaf into its proper position when the leaf engages the table proper and to make the flat surface of the table top and leaf register correctly and thus ensure a level surface fig 205 is a wooden block made in two portions and held together by screws it is used to fasten around a twist bit the object being to ensure that all the dowel holes are of uniform depth it may be adjusted as desired and firmly screwed round the twist bit if the hole is made 14 in in diameter it will clip round a 14in or 38in bit and will answer a dual purpose it is a preventative for bad dowelling fig 206 is an example of dowelling framing when the moulding on the edge has to be mitred it is necessary to cut the shoulders away so as to allow the members of the moulding to intersect the section of the mould is not shown in the sketch for clearness of representation the portion marked h is called the horn and it is not cut off until after the frame is glued up its object is to prevent the rail splitting or bursting when knocking up the frame or during the cramping process fig 207 shows the method of dowelling a moulded cap to the top of a wooden bedstead post or similar pillar where it is desired to avoid any unsightliness fig 208 is a diningtable leg and portion of the framing showing the method of dowelling the frame to the leg chairs couch frames etc are made in a similar manner fig 209 shows the top portion of a table leg and a homemade dowel gauge the gauge is made of any hardwood and steel wire pins are driven through at the required positions and sharpened similar to the spur of a marking gauge the legs are sawn and planed up true and square and the advantage of the gauge is that all legs are marked exactly alike and are therefore interchangeable until glued up a gauge of this type is easily and quickly made and may be kept for its specific purpose or altered for other work fig 210 indicates the queen anne type of leg a sketch of same broken below the knee also being given here we have another type of irregular setting out which is accomplished in the following manner saw and plane the broken portion of the leg true as shown take the timber which is to be jointed and treat it in a similar manner now place four ordinary pins on the lower portion carefully place the top portion to the required position and smartly give it one tap with the hammer this will cause the pinheads to leave indentations and if these be taken as centres for boring accurate work will result the new portion of the leg is afterwards sawn and wrought to the desired shape this is an example of work where it is next to impossible to use a gauge and as only one joint is required it is not worth the time taken to make a template illustration fig 208dowelling a diningtable leg illustration fig 209dowel gauge for legs illustration fig 210dowelling a cabriole leg the tools used in dowelling are brace countersink

countersink glue dowels and complete joints the scarf joint the method known as scarfing is used for the joining of timber in the direction of its length enabling the workman to produce a joint with a smooth or flush appearance on all its faces one of the simplest forms of scarfed joint is known as the half lap in which a portion is cut out at the end of each beam or joist equal in depth to half the full depth of the beam and of equal length to the required scarf the two pieces before they are placed together form a joint as shown at fig 211 the projecting part a fitting into the recessed portion marked b and the two pieces being secured in their respective positions by screws fig 212 shows a dovetailed scarf joint this is a variation of fig 211 the length of the dovetail lap being from 6 ins to 8 ins in length fig 213 is an illustration of a joint designed to resist a cross strain the face side is left flush whilst the underside is assisted by an iron plate the joint is secured with nuts bolts and washers this type of joint is frequently used for joining purlins in roof work the iron plate on the underside is in this case omitted fig 214 is designed to resist both tension and compression and is an excellent joint for all purposes the joint is brought together by using folding wedges as shown in the centre illustration fig 211halflap scarf joint for light timber illustration fig 212dovetailed scarf joint illustration fig 213plated scarf joint used in roof work fig 215 is a variation of fig 214 and it will be noticed that tenons are provided on the face and underside to resist cross strain probably this is one of the best varieties of the scarfed joint unfortunately however its production is somewhat costly and this may be the reason that it is not more universally used folding wedges are used to secure the two pieces in position illustration fig 214tenoned scarf joint illustration fig 215double tenoned scarf joint illustration fig 216scarf joint with veed ends fig 216 is a scarfed joint with undercut veed ends which prevent the joint from lipping up or down or sideways it is a useful joint calling for careful setting out and accurate craftsmanship folding wedges are used in this case to draw up and secure the joint fig 217 is a fished joint and the following difference between a scarfed and fished joint should be noted a fished joint need not necessarily reduce the total length of the beams to be joined and fish plates of wood or iron or a combination of both are fastened at each side of the joint in a scarf joint all surfaces are flush in fig 217 the beams are buttjointed and secured by wooden plates and iron bolts the upper plate is let into each beam and the lower plate is provided with two wooden keys to prevent the beams sliding or creeping upon the lower plate iron nuts bolts and washers are used to complete the joint illustration fig 217fished joint in the case of the scarfed joint at fig 218 used for purlins the length of the scarf is usually made about four times that of the depth of tie beam it has two hardwood keys which force the pieces together and thus tighten the joint illustration fig 218detail of scarfed joint in purlins the methods of scarfing and fishjointing are many and varied and in selecting a joint the nature of the pieces to be joined and the direction and the amount of the load should be carefully taken into consideration the above joints come under the heading of carpentry and the ordinary tools such as the saw plane boringbit and chisels are all that are requisite and necessary to produce a sound and serviceable joint scarfed joints are generally of large size and they are usually made by placing the work upon sawing trestles owing to the bench being too small to accommodate the large timbers illustration fig 219example of tabled joint with straps illustration fig 220lapped scarf joint with bolts for heavy timber fig 219 is a tabled scarf joint which admirably resists tension and compression it is very easy to make and fit and is not materially affected by shrinkage the rectangular wrought iron straps are knocked up over the joint after the two pieces engage the length of the joint should be approximately five times its thickness fig 220 is an example of a lapped scarf joint which is secured with nuts and bolts it effectively resists compressional stress in vertical posts and it may if required be strengthened by the addition of wrought iron fish plates it is quite a serviceable joint for all general purposes such as shed or garage building where fairly heavy timbers are used the hinged joint one of the most common forms of hinged joint in use today is that formed by using the butt hinge and many troubles experienced by the amateur such as hingebound stopbound and screwbound doors etc are due to a lack of knowledge of the principles of hingeing hinges call for careful gauging and accurate fitting otherwise trouble is certain to occur a bound door or box lid is said to be hingebound when the recess which contains the hinge is cut too deep the frame and the body portion engage too tightly when closed the result being that the door has always a tendency to open a little this fault may be in many cases remedied by packing behind the hinge with one or two thicknesses of good stiff brown paper for packing purposes such as this paper will be found to be of much more value than thin strips of wood or knifecut veneer the latter always having a great tendency to split when a screw or bradawl is inserted a stopbound door is the name applied when the door is not finished to exactly the same thickness as originally intended this causes the door to bind on the stops at the back as shown at fig 221 the difficulty may be remedied by thinning the door a little at the back or slightly rounding away the portion which binds screwbound is a common fault often overlooked by the amateur it is caused by using screws of which the heads are too large for the countersunk holes in the hinge and may be avoided by slightly sinking the holes in the brasswork with a countersink or rosebit illustration fig 221stopbound door illustration fig 222butt hinge illustration fig 223gauging illustration fig 224marking for recess illustration fig 225sawing for the recess alignmentanother fault that is fairly common is having the axes of the hinges out of alignment especially is this the case when three hinges are used to hang a wardrobe or other large door it is absolutely necessary in all cases that the exact centres of the pivotpins of the hinges should be in a straight line particular attention to alignment is necessary when the body and the door frame are shaped on the face side a familiar example that every reader may inspect for himself is the curved side of a railway carriage body and railway carriage door where he will notice that a specially wide hinge has to be used at the bottom of the door to give the necessary alignment hinges fixed on work with their centres out of truth are often overlooked by the inexperienced worker and this is a frequent cause of creaking gaugingfig 222 is a sketch of a brass butt hinge open fig 223 illustrates a similar hinge closed and shows the gauge set so that the point of the marker is exactly to the centre of the pivotpin this distance we will call c now turn to fig 224 the distance c has been gauged from the face side of the frame the gauge is then set to the thickness of the hinge at its thickest portion and to prevent hingebind see that the gauge is set on the fine side remember that the tapered point of the steel spur or marking awl will part the fibres of the timber a little more than the fine point and give you a wider gauge line than was anticipated when you set the gauge the inexperienced worker nearly always overlooks this the result is a hingebound door the cause of which is not discovered by the worker because he is so sure that he has set the gauge correctly the distance b fig 226 shows the line gauged for the thickness of the hinge position of hingesanother difficulty to the beginner is the position for his hinges and it may here be stated that the general rule is to carry a line across the face of the work from the inside of the cross rail and place the hinge at e as fig 224 illustration fig 226tool operation when paring out the hinge recess in the door sawing for the recessafter marking out for the hinge as shown at fig 224 take a finetoothed saw a dovetail saw is considered the best and saw down as shown at fig 225 care being taken not to cut beyond the gauge lines in this sketch three intermediate saw kerfs are shown but if the hinge is of great length say 5 or 6 ins the removal of the waste wood will be greatly facilitated by the addition of more intermediate saw kerfs these cuts sever the cross fibres and allow the timber to be easily pared away in short lengths in fig 226 we see the tool operation when paring out the hinge recess at the left of the drawing the recess is shown marked take a 34 in chisel and using it as a knife see a deepen the gauge lines then stab the chisel downwards as at b to deepen the end lines next take the chisel and pare away the back of the recess as at c the work may then be completed by paring neatly till the bottom of the recess is flat illustration fig 227 fig 228 the hingeing of a box lid stopped hinged joints for box workfig 227 is a section through a small box similar to a ladys workbox the back of the box in the illustration is enlarged in thickness to clearly show the position of the hinge in this case the knuckle of the hinge is let into the woodwork until it is flush with the back of the box and the gauge would have to be set to the total width of the hinge the back edges of the lid and the back edge of the lower portion of the box are planed away at an angle of 45 degrees as indicated by the dotted lines fig 228 shows the same box with the lid open and it will be observed that the chamfered edges come together and form a stop which prevents the lid falling backwards and breaking the box this method of lettingin the knuckle flush is a useful one for box work because the ordinary stock brass butt hinge can be used attention may however be called to the stopped butthinge which is specially made to answer the above purpose in its action a similar mechanical principle as the one applied to the box is used illustration fig 229strap hinge illustration fig 230reversible or doublefolding screen hinge illustration fig

will only fold in one direction fig 233 is a back flap hinge with a specially wide wing used for the falldown leaf of small tables and similar articles fig 234 is a card table hinge this is let into the edges of the table so that all is flush or level both above and below the surface centre or pivot hingesfig 235 is a centre or pivot hinge used on the top and bottom of wardrobe doors more particularly the interior door of a threewinged wardrobe where the method of fixing is confined to the cornice and plinth the flange carrying the pins or pivot is let into the top and bottom of the door the remaining flange being let into the cornice and plinth respectively rising butt hingesfig 236 is the rising butt hinge used on dining and drawingroom doors so that when the door is opened the door rises sufficiently to clear the thickness of the carpet this hinge has also an advantage over the ordinary butt hinge in that it is selfclosing ie the weight of the door plus the bevel on the hinge joint causes the door to close band and hook hinges and other ordinary varieties are too well known to require illustrating acute angle hingeingfig 237 is a sectional plan of a corner cupboard showing a good method of hingeing the door the inset a shows an enlarged view of the corner carrying the hinge also the adaptor piece c which is fitted to the inside edge of the cupboard so that the hinged edges are at 90 degrees to the face this is a far better and stronger method than that shown at b which is often attempted with disastrous results the incorrect method b allows insufficient wood for fixing purposes and in nearly all cases the thin edge of the door breaks away during the making and fitting or soon after completion the adaptor piece may have a face mould worked upon it to give a pilasterlike appearance if fancy so dictates illustration fig 237hingeing door of corner cupboard illustration fig 238inside hingeing method of letting butt hinge into door frame and carcase inside hingeingwhen a door is being hung inside the carcase that is not hinged over the ends it is permissible in the case of light work to let the whole thickness of the hinge into the door and when screwing the door to the carcase it is usual to fix the knuckle of the hinge flush with the face of the carcase thus allowing the door frame to stand back making a break of about 18 in with the face the marking gauge should be set to the full width of the hinge the mark gauged on the inside of the carcase end thus forms a line to guide the worker whilst fixing the door to successfully fix a door it generally requires two persons one to hold the door in position whilst the other bores the holes and fixes the screws illustration fig 239showing top and bottom of carcase cut back to allow door to close illustration fig 240outside hingeing illustration fig 241section fig 238 shows the correct method of fitting butt hinges on highclass work one wing of the hinge is let into the door and the other wing is let into the carcase or door jamb thus distributing a proportion of the weight to the carcase end instead of allowing the whole of the weight to be carried by the screws as would be the case in a fig 237 the method of sinking each portion of the hinge into the door and carcase respectively is costly hence it is not the general practice in cheap work in fig 239 the top and bottom of carcase t and b are shown set back to allow the door to close outside hingeingfig 240 illustrates the portion of a door frame and carcase end when the door is hung on the face of the carcase the correct method of letting in the hinge is shown in the enlarged section fig 241 but as previously mentioned the hinge may have its entire thickness let into the door frame where it is of a light character the door frame projects slightly over the carcase end and occasionally a bead mould is worked on the edge of the door so as to give a finish and partly hide the joint the bead would of course be the same size as the diameter of the knuckle of the hinge and the knuckle therefore will form a continuation of the bead and give a workmanshiplike finish fall frontsfig 242 is a sectional view of a fall front writing bureau fitted with centre or pivot hinges and arranged so that the edges form a stop when the desk front is turned to a horizontal position the position for the fitting of the brass plates carrying the pivotpin is somewhat awkward but by first sinking the plates into the carcase ends and then slotting the edges of the fall it will be found that the fall front may be put in from its horizontal position and that sufficient room is left to enable the screwdriver to be manipulated without inconvenience illustration fig 242fall front of writing bureau illustration fig

shown pivoted upon a piece of 14in wire the object of this fly rail is to form a support to the small hinged dropleaf of the table this method is suitable for small occasional tables and similar articles draught screensfig 244 illustrates the end elevation and plan of a draught screen which is constructed of a light framework and covered with baize or american cloth the reversible doublefolding hinge fig 230 would answer admirably for such a screen cases occur however where it is desired to hinge a screen to be used for an invalids bedside and it is then important that all draught should be excluded through the jointed edges the double reversible hinge will not fulfil these conditions and the following method is therefore adopted in the plan fig 244 a and b two laths of hardwood beech birch or mahogany answer splendidly are shown they are made the same length and the same width as the edges of the screen the corners being slightly rounded away a doublefolding draughtproof hinge is then made as follows procure good fine webbing about 114 in wide and the necessary largeheaded tacks lay the laths side by side as shown in fig 244 and proceed to web them as shown commence with the web under the lath a bring it between the laths and over b now take it round the lefthand edge of b and round the back and between the laths and over a continuing this method of wrapping the laths until the lower end is reached and then fastening the webbing as indicated by the dotted lines which represent the tacks this selfcontained hinge is then fixed to the edges of the screen by boring suitable holes through the laths and using countersunk screws this is a cheap and efficient method of overcoming the difficulty a similar method is used for the household clothes

table the small portion is screwed to the table rail and the shaped bracket swings out to support the drop leaf the shaded portion of the bracket shows the timber chamfered away so that the fingers may be easily put behind the bracket to manipulate it note that the corners are slightly rounded off as indicated by the black portion of the sketch and that the mortises are cut about 14 in deeper than the thickness of the timber used this joint has now been almost superseded by a cheap stamped galvanised iron bracket of exactly the same pattern the joint however is still used for repair work and in cases where a stamped metal bracket has not sufficient overhang illustration fig 247open joint hingeing knuckle joint hingefig 246 is a similar type of joint to the above and is called the knuckle joint this arrangement of hingeing allows the table leg to swing in an angle of 180 degrees and is much neater in its appearance it is often used to connect a movable table leg to the framing where it is necessary for the table leg and rail to swing outwards and support a drop leaf the pivot is formed by a piece of 18in or 14in round iron rod running through the centre of the joint illustration fig 248clearing the architrave mould open joint hingeingthe next three illustrations apply more particularly to the hanging of the ordinary household door fig 247 is termed open joint hanging from the fact that when the door is open a certain amount of open space exists between the edge of the door and the doorpost this open space varies according to the position in which the butt hinge is fixed a section is shown at which the pin of the hinge is let in level with the face of the door this will allow the door to open as shown by the dotted line and it will not clear the architrave moulding illustration fig 249close joint hingeing fig 248 indicates the position of the hinge fixed so as to allow the door to open and lay flat back to the architrave moulding in this instance the butts are made with wider wings and they are generally provided to take three screws see fig 233 righthand wing of hinge to determine the position of the centre pin of the hinge the following rule is observed the centre of the pivot pin of the hinge must be half the distance between the face of the door when closed and the outside of the architrave moulding close joint hangingthe method known as close joint hanging ensures the joint at the hanging stile being in close proximity to the hanging rail this is shown at fig 249 the first member of the architrave moulding is generally a bead of the same diameter as the knuckle of the hinge the butt hinge is let in as shown in the illustration and the door when opened forms a closefitting joint illustration fig 250rule joint hinge with leaf open the rule joint hinge is used to connect the top and the drop leaf of a table in cases where continuity of design is desired so that the edge of the top and the leaf will show an ovolo moulding when the table is either open or closed to the inexperienced worker it presents several difficulties and if it is a first effort it is advisable to try out a sample joint on a couple of odd pieces of timber fig 250 illustrates the joint when the leaf is opened or in a horizontal position at fig 252 we have the joint when the leaf is let down to a vertical position it should be observed in the latter figure that the edge a of the drop leaf is in alignment with the axis of the hinge steel or brass backflap hinges fig 233 are generally used and they are sunk into the table as suggested set out the work full size as at fig 251 and mark point 1 which is to be the position of the joint draw 1 2 at right angles to the table top mark point 3 on the vertical line for the

wood and the further it is inserted into the wood the more the joint will overlap at a fig 252 which shows the joint when the flap or leaf is down shutting joints this chapter deals with the joint made by the upright rail of a door frame which carries the lock or handle generally called the slamming stile many and varied are the methods used to make a draught and airtight joint at the meeting of the slamming stile and the carcase end and our sketches illustrate some of the simplest and also some of the best and most expensive methods illustration fig 253shutting stile of cupboard door

illustrates a similar method the stop c is seen as in the previous illustration but it will be noticed also that the carcase end in this case is lined up see b to give a pilasterlike appearance to the end and the moulding is selected on account of its suitability to hide the joint of the lining piece fig 255 is of a more intricate type and is often used on jewellers showcases the end at the right hand is slightly rebated to receive the frame and both the rail and the end are grooved with a plough plane a separate bead is made and glued into the groove of the door frame d engaging the groove in

rebated g to receive the astragal moulding this method is preferred on the best class of work because it shows no unsightly joint at the inside of the door frame fig 258 illustrates the type of joint made by using a brass astragal mould h as employed on highclass work frequently seen on french furniture of the louis periods in fig 259 is shown a piece of brass astragal moulding which may be

rebated joint broken at the front by a bead moulding the illustration shows its application to a circularfronted cupboard and it will be noticed that the hinged rails are received in a rebate which is worked on the carcase ends the rebated joint at the centre of the two doors is worked slightly on the bevel so as to allow for clearance when opening the door two of the commonest meeting joints of doors are seen in figs 261 and 262 in the former case the stiles are rebated as already shown in fig 260 whilst at fig 262 an astragal bead is glued to the righthand stile in fig 261 a bead is worked on the righthand stile to mask the joint fig 263 is the hook joint used on goodclass joinery and cabinet work a pair of special wood planes are required to make the joint in a cheap and efficient manner the cost of a pair of 58in hook joint planes is from 6s to 8s they are of similar size and general appearance to the ordinary ovolo moulding plane illustration fig 263the hook joint

drawer the drawer front is grooved and engages a suitablyformed slip which is screwed to the bearer as indicated in the illustration occasionally some difficulty is experienced when fitting the slip to a narrow drawer but this can always be overcome by putting in the screws from the top of the bearer instead of from underneath illustration fig 266dustproof drawer showing the front grooved to engage a slip which is screwed to the bearer rail shutting joints which are required to be lighttight such as those used in photographic work are generally formed by slightly grooving the frame and inserting a strip of black velvet the friction of the high pile of the velvet prevents the filtration of light through the joint when making airtight showcases one of the best and simplest tests is to place a lighted candle in the case and close all the doors if the candle goes out within three minutes you have accomplished your object the dovetail joint nothing definite is known as to the origin of dovetailing but a quaint and pleasing little story which is well worth repeating runs as follows a farmer had called in the local joyner to do sundry repairs at the homestead one day whilst enjoying a humble meal he sat watching some doves as they hopped about the yard struck by the movement of their wedgeshaped tails it occurred to him to joint his timber by the interlocking method hence we have dovetails illustration fig 267a single through dovetail illustration fig 268through dovetails on carcase work p pins t tails through dovetailingone of the simplest forms of the dovetail joint is shown in fig 267 where two pieces of timber are joined by the method known as through dovetailing this method is used in everyday practice for joining the corners of frames bracket trusses and a hundred and one other articles figs 268 and 269 show the method of through dovetailing as applied to the making of boxes plinths and general carcase work it is used in positions where no objection can be taken to the end grain showing on each side of the finished work in the case of plinths and furniture cornices the foundation frame is made of yellow pine or other cheap wood and the more expensive and rare timbers are glued and mitred around in various thicknesses and shapes thus saving the more costly material and strengthening the construction by the method known as laminating in many cases all that is necessary is to veneer the face sides thus covering and hiding any unsightliness illustration fig 269dovetails for boxes etc illustration fig 270lapdovetailing for drawers lapdovetailingfig 270 is an example of lapdovetailing such as is used where a drawer side joins with the drawer front it is not permissible to allow the end grain of the timber to show at the front of a drawer and this is why resort is had to the lapdovetail as the most general use of the dovetail is for this and similar purposes we shall therefore deal fully with the methods of marking out and the making of this class of joint anglesa most important point in the construction of a dovetail is to avoid having the angles of the pins and tails too acute an inclination of one in eight is considered correct no hard and fast rule need be obeyed but the variation should on no account be less than one in six illustration fig 271how to obtain correct angles for dovetail template illustration fig 272squaring and use of template fig 271 shows a simple method to obtain the correct angle take a piece of timber and plane up the face edge a b true and straight mark out a line c d at right angles to the face edge and space off 8 ins as shown now measure a distance of 1 in d e and join e to point eight this will give the correct angle for the dovetails and it may then be transferred to the joiners bevel many workers who are constantly on dovetail work make a zinc template to the exact angle and keep it specially for the purpose fig 272 squaringanother important point to remember is that the drawer sides must be true and squared to an exact length and planed up to thickness otherwise the finished drawer will be in winding and out of truth to true and square the ends of drawer sides drawer backs and drawer front a most useful little machine is the mitre trimmer failing this excellent results can be obtained by using the shooting board illustration fig 273method of marking with cutting gauge gaugingafter squaring up the timber accurate gauging of the ends is another important point the gauge used should be a cutting gauge so that the line is incised about 132 in in depth thus effectually cutting the cross fibres of the timber fig 273 shows the method of using the cutting gauge the stock of the gauge must be held well up to the end of the timber the gauge is a most difficult tool for the novice to use and his trouble is generally caused by holding it too flat tilt the gauge a little so that the thumbscrew shown in the illustration goes nearer to the floor the blade will then not bite so keenly and better results will be obtained the dotted lines indicate the positions which the dovetails will occupy when marked out the gauge is set a trifle less than the thickness of the drawer sides to allow for the thickness of the steel cutter and a gauge line is marked on the inside of the front and all round the drawer back the gauge is now readjusted so as to leave a 14in lap on the front and a line marked on the ends of the front and all round the ends of the sides which will engage the drawer front a glance at figs 270 and 273 will make this clear illustration fig 274removing the waste wood the dovetail pins on drawer part and back are spaced out and marked on the end with the aid of the joiners bevel the lines being then squared down to the gauge line by the method shown at fig 272that is by using the trysquare and marking awl the drawer front is now put into the bench vice and the pins are cut as indicated in fig 274 the drawer back is treated in a similar manner but of course in this case it is not lap but through dovetailing and the saw kerf goes through the timber and down to the gauge line illustration fig 275cutting away the half dovetails we now come to the point where it is necessary to remove the superfluous material fig 274 shows a method commonly adopted and known as sawing out the waste the saw is held at an angle and part of the inside portion of the dovetail is cut away as shown this is a good plan for the amateur because it shows him at the commencement of his chopping out which will be the pin and which the tail illustration fig 276showing the vertical and horizontal chisel operations in lapdovetailing a the preliminary roughingout b vertical chiselling note that the first stab should be just outside the gauge line c marking the horizontal cut fig 276 a shows another method that answers well for soft woods such as pine american whitewood and satin walnut the drawer front is laid flat on the bench after it has been sawn and with a mallet and sharp chisel the corner of the dovetail is knocked off as shown this takes the bulk of the material away and the dovetail is then pared out square in the usual way the illustration fig 276 also shows how the chisel is held for vertical paring b and for horizontal paring c illustration fig 277roughingout by boring illustration fig 278marking pins on drawer side a third method is shown at fig 277 with hard curly timbers such as tobacco mahogany and satinwood it is a laborious process to carefully chop away the timber in small pieces and to overcome this difficulty we occasionally see the workman take a twistbit and bore a series of holes as shown a great portion of the timber may then be split away by inserting the chisel endway into the grain after which it is pared to a finish as dovetailing is chiefly used for drawer making it will be of interest to give several illustrations of variations of the joint and its uses fig 278 indicates the method of marking the position of the holes in the drawer side when the paring out of the dovetails is completed the drawer front is turned over on to the side as shown and the position of the recesses which will engage the pin portions are marked with the marking awl as illustrated illustration fig 279marking by means of saw blade illustration fig 280gauge lines scores and saw cuts illustration fig 281sawing the drawer side illustration fig 282position of chisel for cutting channel the completed drawer back is marked on the sides in an exactly similar manner another method of marking through dovetails is shown at fig 279 the side is held in position on the end and the dovetail saw is inserted and drawn out of the saw kerf thus leaving the exact mark on the drawerback other workers prefer a pouncebag instead of a saw a pouncebag consists of a piece of fairly open woven muslin filled with a mixture of french chalk and finelypowdered whiting the muslin is tied up with a piece of thin twine like the mouth of a flour sack all that is necessary is to place the timber in position and bang the bag on the top of the sawcuts when sufficient powder will pass through the bag and down the saw kerf to mark the exact positions of the lines sawing the dovetailsafter marking out the pins on the drawer sides we proceed with the next operation that is sawing the dovetails ready for chopping out the waste material the drawer side is taken and firmly secured in the bench screw and sawn as at fig 281 it is most important that the saw kerf is kept inside the line which has been scratched by the marking awl see fig 280 where the dotted line represents the gauge line and the outside lines indicate the scores of the marking awl failure to observe this condition will result in faulty dovetailing and it will also prove the necessity for using a finelytoothed and thinbladed dovetail saw to cut out the waste wood or core the usual procedure is to saw away the halfdovetails as at fig 275 with care this can be accomplished with the dovetail saw thus avoiding unnecessary labour and the use of the paring chisel after sawing the drawer side is placed flat upon the bench one end in contact with the bench to prevent the drawer side from slipping away a chisel preferably bevelled edged of suitable width is now taken and a small channel is cut as at a fig 282 the method of cutting this channel is shown in the same illustration the chiselcut is started about 18 in from the gauge line the cut is made right up to the gauge line which when gauging was made 132 in deep so as to cut the cross fibres of the timber a small piece of waste wood will therefore come away as at a the object of cutting this small channel is so that when the chisel is held vertically on the gauge line and struck with the mallet the chisel will have no tendency to force its way backward and overshoot the gauge line the waste or core is now removed by holding the chisel approximately vertical and applying sufficient power to drive it halfway through the timber the drawer side is now turned over the operation repeated and the core pushed out care must be exercised whilst cutting away the core to ensure the chisel being held nearly perpendicular if too much lead or bevel be given a faulty and undercut dovetail will be the result undercut dovetails prevent a proper grip of the glue they give a weak joint and often cause the face of the drawer side to be splintered whilst driving up the joint if it be necessary to ease one or two shavings from off the drawer side whilst fitting the completed drawer in the carcase the joint will show a greater gap as each succeeding shaving is removed in common work especially in soft timbers many workers allow the pins of a drawer back to run through the sides about 116 in and hammer down the pins of the dovetail this is called bishoping the dovetails and is unnecessary if the work be properly made and fitted an alternative method of dovetailing is that of cutting the dovetails first as shown at fig 283 four or six drawer sides are placed in the vice and the dovetails are sawn at one operation a little lead or bevel from front to back is given whilst sawing and if this method be used care must be taken to see that the parts of the drawer sides which will be on the inside of the completed drawer are towards the worker or the lead will be given to the dovetails in the wrong direction illustration fig 283cutting several dovetails at once after sawing the dovetails in this manner the sides are placed in their respective positions on the drawer fronts or backs and marked with a pouncebag or by using the sawblade method the pins are then cut in the usual way care being taken that the saw kerf be on the outside of the marks otherwise the pins will finish too slack to engage with the tails frame dovetailsfig 284 is a sketch of a constructional frame such as is used for building up a cornice or plinth at the joint marked a an edge barefaced dovetail is shown from the separated sketches of the joint b it will be seen that the dovetail can be put together either from the top or the bottom of the framing as all its edges are parallel glue is relied upon to hold it in position the centre stretcher rail at fig 284 is similar except that in this case it is a complete dovetail in place of a barefaced one illustration fig 284constructional frame as for plinth or cornice showing application of the dovetail joint some workers when making either of the above joints prefer to give a slight bevel to the dovetail so that it drives tightly into the housing when put together a variation of this type of dovetail is frequently used to joint internal uprights to the horizontal shelves of writing desks cabinets and bookcases etc the dovetailed portion is parallel for about threefourths of its width the remaining part is tapered towards the front edge and notched away at the face so as to conceal the method of construction an illustration of the top portion of a division 14 ins wide is shown at fig 284 c the other portion is of course dovetailed to fit it blind lapdovetailingat fig 285 is shown a type of blind lapdovetailing this makes a good sound joint but it has the disadvantage of showing a small portion of the timber of the front rail endway of the grain joints of this kind are used for cornices boxes etc and also for painted furniture illustration fig 285blind lapdovetailing illustration fig 286housed and mitred dovetail housed and mitred dovetailfig 286 is another form of dovetailcommonly called a housed and mitred or rebated and mitred dovetail in this instance we see that a small portion is mitred at top and bottom edges and when used in plinth or cornice work or for making teacaddies etc the edges are when completing the work covered either with the moulding which is planted on the cornice or plinth or with the top and bottom of the box or teacaddy the method of making a housed and mitred dovetail joint is seen in fig 286 the ends to be joined are planed up true and square and then rebated as shown the dotted lines indicate the portion which has been worked away the dovetails are now sawn and pared out in the usual way and the part denoted by the arrow is afterwards cut away with a chisel and finally finished to a smooth surface with a rebate plane the method of working is shown at fig 287 where the dovetail pins are seen with the waste portions cut away illustration fig 287working a housed and mitred dovetail joint fig 287 also shows the method of cutting away the mitred part a temporary piece of wood is planed to a true mitre and placed underneath the dovetailed piece to form a template both pieces of the timber are now secured to the bench with a handscrew or cramp the template a will form a guide for the chisel and rebate plane and allow a sharp edge or arris to be worked on the mitre a secret mitred dovetail joint is illustrated at

a dovetail joint at the corner of a frame as fig 300 it is necessary at the outset to trim up the ends of the timber square and true this may be accomplished by neatly sawing to the line and paring the end of the wood with a sharp chisel or by bringing the wood to a finish with a finelyset plane such as an ironfaced smoothing plane the ends of the wood must be perfectly square when tested from either the face side or from the marked edge illustration fig 300corner dovetail illustration fig 301squaring take a cutting gauge and set it to equal the thickness of the timber and holding it as already shown at fig 273 strike the gauge lines on the wood as illustrated at fig 302 g proceed to mark out the dovetail pins as at fig 303 in this illustration g again shows the gauge line the inclination of the lines across the end of the wood should not be too great or the joint will be a weak one and the edges of the dovetails will be liable to crumble away when the work is knocked together dovetailing templatemany workers who are constantly engaged upon dovetail joints make a small wooden template as shown at fig 304 this template is generally of hardwood such as beech or walnut the method of obtaining the correct angles of such a template has already been given on p 134 notice that the lines bb fig 303 of the dovetail pins do not bevel they are parallel to the sides of the wood and at right angles to the end of the wood as shown illustration fig 302gauging illustration fig 303marking the pins chisel workafter marking out as shown at fig 303 place the wood on the bench and proceed to chop away the centre portion in the following manner hold the chisel on the bevel and cut out a small piece to form a channel at the gauge line now hold the chisel in a vertical position and with a mallet strike it so as to make a cut about 18 in deep then hold the chisel on the bevel again and cut away more waste wood proceed alternately first forcing the chisel down vertically and then paring the wood away with the chisel held obliquely until you have cut halfway through the thickness of the wood illustration fig 304handmade template for marking dovetails

index finger of the left hand cut away the small piece at the side see fig 275 repeat the operation as may be necessary and the completed joint will be similar to that shown at fig 300 if the sawing is not neatly done it may be found necessary to pare the shoulder with a sharp chisel drawerswhen dovetailing drawers or boxes it is necessary to square up the ends of all the stock and gauge them as shown at fig 273 this illustration shows how to gauge the lines on a drawer side the dovetailed joint in this case however does not run through the drawer front and leave the work unsightly as the joint at fig 300 would do the method used is shown at fig 309 and it is commonly known as lapdovetailing most workers cut the dovetail pins on the drawer fronts and the drawer backs first after which they mark the drawer sides with the marking awl the dovetailing of the drawer back is shown at fig 310 this is the type known as through dovetailing the method being similar in regard to tool operations as the single joint shown at fig 300 illustration fig 308sawing the dovetails illustration fig 309lapdovetailing drawer front to drawer side illustration fig 310through dovetailing illustration fig 311chipping waste of lap dovetail when the pins on the drawer front have been sawn the waste material is cut away as at fig 311 first stab down with the vertical chisel which must make the cut about 132 in in front of the gauge line see illustration this commencing of the cut slightly in front of the gauge line is a very important feature the chisel may be likened to a wedge and if the chisel edge be placed exactly upon the gauge line and force be applied to the handle it will force the timber away equally on each side of the gauge line and the finished depth of the hole will therefore be too deep for the thickness of the drawer side in other words it will press itself over the gauge line on both sides by taking the first vertical cut on the waste side of the gauge line and then removing a small piece with the chisel held obliquely as at fig 311 the wood is removed and less resistance is offered to the chisel when the next vertical cut is made this overshooting the gauge line is a common fault with the beginner who is puzzled at the result because he is certain he had his chisel exactly on the gauge line when he commenced his vertical cut it is especially noticeable in softgrained woods to cut away the waste of a lapdovetail fig 311 the vertical and oblique cuts are repeated until the final trimming up is required and now is the time to finish both the vertical and the horizontal cuts exactly on the gauge lines some workers prefer to cut the drawer sides first and if this method is preferred and it has its advantages for cheap work several drawer sides are cut at once by placing four or six behind one another in the vice and sawing them all at one operation the drawer front is placed in the vice and the drawer side held upon it whilst the saw blade is placed in the saw kerf and drawn smartly forward this will give the required marks at the exact position desired it must be remembered however to saw just inside these dovetailpin lines otherwise the finished joint will be too slack owing to the removal of the sawdust which is practically equal to the thickness of the saw blade machinemade dovetailsas a general rule machinemade drawer and box dovetails show both the pins and the tails of exactly the same size the reason is obvious after an inspection of fig 314 which shows the position in which the pieces are held during the machining operations in spite of a certain amount of prejudice they are satisfactory and thoroughly reliable and have their place in modern shop and office fittings illustration fig 312machinemade drawer front and side apart illustration fig 313the parts together illustration fig 314position when machined dovetail grooving the dovetail housing joint should first be carefully marked out with a marking knife so as to cut across the fibres of the wood for obtaining the bevel on the edge of the wood a joiners bevel may be used and the angle should not be too acute see previous chapter take a chisel and pare away a small channel as at a fig 315 to form a small shoulder to guide the saw illustration fig 315paring away channel for dovetail grooving with a fine tenon or dovetail saw cut the saw kerf as at fig 316 if any difficulty is experienced in cutting the kerf true and square you may resort to the method shown at c fig 315 a small temporary piece of timber has been screwed on the top of the work to form a guide for the saw illustration fig 316cutting the saw kerf illustration fig 317old womans tooth plane illustration fig 318guide block for bevelling fig 315 b shows the small channel formed by the chisel prior to the sawing operation the sawing of the bevelled side is worked in a similar manner but occasionally we find amateurs who adopt the method shown at fig 318 a block of wood h is first made by boring a 114in hole through its entire length and afterwards making a saw cut at the desired bevel the object of this block which is kept specially for the purpose is to form a guide for those who have not full control of the dovetail saw the back of the saw clears the hole and the required bevel is obtained when a saw cut has been made at each side of the groove the surplus timber is pared away in the following manner cut away portion e fig 319 then cut away portion f and lastly cut away the apex portion marked g continue by this method of paring until the approximate depth is reached to ensure a correct depth throughout the entire groove the router plane or as it is often called the old womans tooth plane fig 317 is used illustration fig 319showing method of paring illustration fig 320channelling the alternate piece with regard to cutting the alternate piece it is necessary to first plane the end of the shelf true and square with a cutting gauge strike the line k fig 320 the required bevel on the edge j is then set out and with the chisel a small channel is again formed with the tenon or dovetail saw cut down the line k to the required depth and carefully pare away the wood with a sharp chisel to the correct shape the mitred joint although mitreing is used in everyday woodwork it comes last in our list of regular joints simply because it has been partly dealt with in almost every previous chapter for example we have mitre halving in fig 34 a mitre bridle joint in fig 74 a tongued and grooved mitre in fig 116 mitred mortise and tenon joints in figs 148 and 159 a dowelled mitre frame in fig 202 and a mitred dovetail in fig 286 illustration fig 321mitred skirting illustration fig 322curved mitre illustration fig 323halving the angle mitreingthe term mitreing is generally used to denote the type of joint used at the corner of a picture frame or where two pieces of wood are bevelled away so as to fit each other as the skirting or plinth mould at fig 321 in these cases the timber is cut so that the joint is at 45 degrees to the face and the two pieces when placed together form an angle of 90 degrees a right angle the term mitreing however is not confined to the fitting of timber around a right angle it may be justly applied to the fitting of a moulding around an angle irrespective of the number of its degrees one often hears such terms as a half mitre used to denote the fitting of a moulding around an octagonal column or pedestal and probably it would be more correct to describe the joint as a mitre cut at 2212 degrees mitreing consists of halving the angle and making each piece to fit the line of bisection should the angle be bounded by straight lines as at fig 321 then the mitred joint will be a straight line but should the angle be bounded by a curved and a straight line as at fig 322 a or by two curved lines then the mitred joint will have to be a curved line if the mouldings are to be of the same section illustration fig 324sawing block for mitreing finding the anglefor straight mitres the mitre joint line is found by bisecting the angle as shown in the various examples and the following instructions are given to enable the reader to follow the diagram fig 323 take a pair of compasses or dividers and with any convenient opening strike out the arc a b put the point of the compasses on a and mark another arc c then without altering the distance between the points of the compass put the point on b and mark the arc d draw the line e from the corner so that it cuts through the intersection made by the arcs c and d the angle a b is now halved by the line e and this method may be applied to any angle sawing blockfor sawing mouldings etc to their approximate shape a homemade sawing block is generally used as shown at fig 324 two pieces of wood are glued one on the top of the other the required angle is transferred thereto and the saw kerf made in the sketch the saw kerfs are shown at 45 degrees right and left and other angles and kerfs may be made where desired planingafter sawing the piece to approximately the correct angle it is necessary on highclass work to plane the cut end so as to give a perfect finish and enable a glued joint to be made this may be accomplished by using the plane on the shooting board as shown at fig 325 and if the worker is constantly using mitres of various angles it is an easy matter to make new angle blocks and fix them on to the board other workers prefer the screw mitre trap shown at fig 326 this apparatus takes wide plinth or cornice moulds and the angle may be altered by fitting temporary packing pieces under the work so as to tilt the moulding to the desired angle the method of using the plane is indicated in the illustration another method in everyday use by those workers who are constantly mitreing wide pieces of stock at 45 degrees is the donkeys ear shooting board illustrated at fig 327 the plane is laid on its side on the surface of the board marked a and used in a similar manner to that shown at fig 325 illustration fig 325use of plane and shooting board for mitreing illustration fig 326the screw mitre trap a simple method and one that should always be remembered because it is handy when working without a shooting board is shown at fig 328 set the marking or cutting gauge to the thickness of the wood to be mitred at 45 degrees then gauge this distance on the wood as shown at b draw from the line to the edge as shown and saw and plane to a finish the diagonals of a square give 45 degrees and this is the method used to mark out the work the end of the wood must of course be square with its edges before marking out in this manner illustration fig 327donkeys ear shooting board illustration fig 328gauging for mitres illustration fig 329narrow inner moulding illustration fig 330wide mitred moulding fig 329 shows a bevelled framing into which has been mitred a narrow moulding m so as to show a correct margin around the panel illustration fig 331door with curved mitres illustration fig 332method of setting out for a curved mitre fig 330 shows a similar framing but with a wide moulding m mitred around it to obtain a correct intersection of this moulding the angles a and b are bisected the bisection of the angles meets before the width of the moulding is cleared therefore the angle c will again have to be bisected and the finished joint will appear as shown one of the simplest of mouldings with a large flat face has been chosen to illustrate this the moulding could be all in one width as shown or it could be built into the framing in separate pieces the wide flat and the piece carrying the mould curved mitreswe now come to what are probably the most difficult of all mitres viz curved mitres and the writer well remembers in his apprenticeship days his first experience of attempting to fit the mouldings around the door shown at fig 331 by using straight mitres at a this of course is impossible if the mouldings are of the same section and it is desired to make all the members correctly intersect if straight mitres are used the section of the curved moulding will have to be of a different shape from the section of the straight moulding and in these days of machinemade mouldings this method is seldom resorted to it is better cheaper and easier to make curved mitres when the necessary machinery is at hand to set out a curved mitre see fig 332draw a section of the moulding full size a as shown at the left hand of the illustration and project lines round the framing as shown v w x y and z where the lines v w x y and z intersect at the corner d it clearly shows that a straight mitre will not cut all the points of intersection a curved line will cut all the intersections and a template made of cardboard sheet zinc or veneer should be made to this shape at the lefthand side the geometrical setting out is shown for obtaining the curve without having to resort to drawing it freehand take half the width of the moulding as shown by dotted line a and where it cuts the approximation of the curved mitre place the point of the compasses and strike out a circle as shown with the same radius place the compass point on bthat is the inside point of the mitre and cut the circle on the right and left with the small arcs shown at aa with the same radius put the compass point at the junction of the circle and mitre line c v and cut the circle at right and left viz ee illustration fig 333template for mitreing now rule a line through aa and another line through ee and where these lines cut each other it will give the correct radius of the curved mitre the advantage of knowing the correct radius of a curved mitre is of great benefit to the skilled machinist as it enables him to set up his machine so as to give a definite result mitreing a moulded door framefig 333 illustrates the method of mitreing the moulded portion of a door frame where the joint is dowelled not tenoned a small wooden template is made out of beech or other hardwood having its ends cut at 45 degrees this template is placed on the rail as shown and held in position by placing both the rail and the template in the vice the face of the template forms a guide for a wide chisel and enables the worker to gradually pare away the moulding to the correct angle illustration fig 334using panel saw in mitre box for sawing the mitres on large mouldings such as are used on the lid of a gramophone or wireless cabinet a mitre sawing box and a panel saw may be used as indicated at fig 334 joints for curved work fig 335 shows a circular frame made up in two thicknesses the segments being screwed to each other and the joints crossed in two layers this is a very strong method and it is used for making circular frames and curbs up to 15 ft in diameter the segments can be either long or short the only important condition being that they must be marked out and sawn to the correct radius fig 337 shows a board marked out in segments for this class of work the longer the boards the better will they cut up as it gives more opportunities of cutting one piece out of the other as at a a illustration fig 335circular frame in two thicknesses illustration fig 336circular rim in halved segments fig 338 shows how to begin to put the work together to continue this fit other segments in position and screw them to d and e respectively the completed work is illustrated at fig 335 illustration fig 337board marked for circular jointing

halved together this method is suitable for heavy work where the timbers are of considerable size the halvings are cut on the ends of the segments to any convenient shape or bevel each one being marked so as to fit its fellow illustration fig 341part of laminated table frame illustration fig 342half of laminated core box when extra length is required semicircular or circular work is built up out of four or five thicknesses of wood and the method is called laminating the method of building up the semicircular head of a door frame by this method is shown at figs 339 and 340 the shaped framing for kidneyshaped writing tables and similar classes of work is built up by laminating pieces of 34in or 1in wood after which the face side is veneered so as to hide the glued joints fig 341 shows a sketch of one quarter of an elliptical table frame levelled up and ready for applying the veneer laminationif we apply to the dictionary for the word lamination we find that lamellar structure is the arrangements in thin plates or layers one over the other usually having the end joints alternating and it is a condition which allows of cleavage in one direction only this method is used for nearly all descriptions of free or irregular curves such as sweeps bends ogee shapes and segments of circles the timber is marked out in suitable lengths roughsawn and then planed true on the face glued together and when set the sides are cleaned up to the required shape it is one of the strongest methods of construction and necessarily costly pulleys pulley rims and a hundred and one other jobs are built by this method fig 342 shows one half of a core box built by this method ready to be worked to the required shape miscellaneous joints weather boardsfor outdoor buildings such as garages garden sheds toolhouses etc weatherboarding is often preferred to ordinary matchboarding chiefly because of the facility with which it throws off the rain the boarding can be bought ready prepared three methods of jointing are shown in the sections at fig 343 the method indicated at a shows one of the most satisfactory types its boards being planed and moulded as shown the other two examples are more common the boarding at b is rebated whilst at c each board overhangs its lower neighbour the boards for c and d are always cut tapered as indicated illustration fig 343weather boards

ladder to the side at a the common method is shown the stave being simply driven into the hole and wedged at b a much better but more expensive method of construction is given the stave here is socketed and the pin turned to a smaller diameter in both cases the rung or stave is painted before being driven into the side and wedged illustration fig 345cornice pole joint illustration fig 346veneer keying ladder sides are made in two distinct ways one method is known as a plank side the side being cut from a plank as shown at the section d the other method is called a pole side and is constructed by cutting a straight larch pole in half and using half of the pole for each side of the ladder as at section c hinged cornice polesfig 345 shows a hinged joint for cornice poles and should be of interest to those who are frequently removing from house to house the joint will adapt itself to fit any bay window even a square bay and it is formed by turning and cutting the two pieces shown to fix a cornice pole to a bay window one of these joints is required for each angle of the bay the pole being cut into suitable lengths and fixed to the hinged joints by the use of the dowel screw and a little hot glue it is perhaps needless to remark that the diameter of the joint should be of the same diameter as the cornice pole to enable the rings to easily slide over the surface for fastening a turned ornament or finial to the end of a cornice pole a double pointed screw known in the trade as a dowel screw is used one half of which is screwed into each part of the pieces to be joined veneer keyingfig 346 illustrates the method of strengthening the corners of boxes which are made of 14in or 38in timber by securing the corners with veneer keys the box is mitred and glued in the usual manner and after allowing sufficient time for the glue to set saw kerfs are made as shown at a a a piece of thin sawcut veneer is afterwards glued into the saw kerfs and when dry the face is levelled off flush this method is often used previous to veneering the face side of the box with rare veneers and it is also useful for repair work note that the saw cuts are made at an angle small picture frames are sometimes keyed instead of nailed muntin and skirting jointin the case of panelled rooms it is usually necessary to scribe the muntins or uprights to the skirting the method is shown in fig 347 the bead moulding of the skirting is only partly removed as indicated leaving a solid portion to which the muntin is skewnailed cot jointat fig 348 is shown an interesting joint used largely in the making of indian cots the illustrations indicate how the cross bar and end bar are mortised into the leg a turned hardwood peg fits into a suitably provided hole and locks

homemade cot sideboard pillars etc fig 349for economy sideboard pillars are sometimes built up as indicated the shaft the base and the swell being made up of three distinct pieces turned pins are left on the shaft and the base and these are secured at the joint by the use of a doublepointed screw called a dowel screw this does away with the necessity of reducing the squares at the top of the wood and thus getting the turning out of a large piece of wood notched jointsfig 350 is a notched joint where two joists or scantlings cross each other the object of the joint being to prevent the joists moving from their position without materially weakening them for an end notch see fig 352 illustration fig 349method of building up turnings illustration fig 350notched joint illustration fig 351the saddle joint the saddle joint fig 351 is used for connecting upright posts to heads or sills of framing and undoubtedly takes its name from its similarity to the way in which the saddle fits the horse it does not weaken the framing as does a mortise and tenon joint and shrinkage has little effect upon the joint the cogged joint used for connecting purlins to rafter and joists to girders is illustrated in fig 353 illustration fig 352end notch illustration fig 353cogged joint illustration fig 354birdsmouth joint illustration fig 355another type of birdsmouth joint birdsmouth jointsfig 354

the spar runs over the outside of the wall plate thus allowing a fixing for an ornamental finish illustration fig 356rafter and tie beam joint rafter jointfig 356 shows an everyday joint as used at the juncture of the principal rafter and the tiebeam in roof truss work a sketch of piece a is shown separated and it should be noted that the depth of the cut portion b should not be more than onefourth of the total width of the tiebeam illustration fig 357method of pelleting the corner of a mitred picture frame pelletingfig 357 indicates the method of pelleting and screwing the corner of a picture frame the mitre joint is first screwed and a pellet of the same timber is made to fill the hole which has been bored to receive the screw head the pellet is glued in position and levelled off illustration fig 358patera covers to hide screws patera coversin cases where the style of ornament permits of it patera covers are used instead of pelleting fig 358 shows the jointing of shaped spandrails etc to carcase ends of light portable cabinet work etc a hole is bored about 38 in deep into the end and a screw is used to hold the shaping in position after fixing the rail a small turned button called a turned patera is inserted in the hole thus giving an ornamental finish as shown in the front view the turned patera is driven fairly tightly into the hole but not glued when it is required to take the article apart a chisel is carefully inserted under the edge of the patera to remove it and the screw can then be taken out this method is often used for the construction of light hanging bookcases and similar objects for a bookcase having an end 8 ins wide three of these turned buttons and three screws would be used to secure the shelf to the end pateras in different styles may be purchased from any dealer in woodworking sundries buttoningthe tops of tables sideboards etc should not be fixed with screws in the ordinary way at the front screws can be driven upwards through the top rail but at the sides and back buttons should be employed as in fig 359 so that the top is free to shrink it is otherwise liable to split if immovably fixed the tops of kitchen tables are usually fixed in this way to allow for shrinkage illustration fig 359method of buttoning a table top frames for oil paintingsthe method of making joints for frames on which the canvas is stretched for oil paintings is shown at fig 360 they are generally mitred at the corners and fitted with loose wedges the four parts of the frame can be held temporarily by a piece of thin board while the canvas is being tacked to the edges of the frame in the accompanying illustrations fig 360 shows the action of the wedges when tightening up the frame the result being to open the mitre joint fig 361 shows the position of the saw cuts for receiving the hardwood wedges note that the parallel groove is carried the full length of the material for greater convenience in cutting the other groove is taken from the outer angle of the mitre joint inwards the cut finishes with due regard to the necessary taper see the dotted lines showing taper in fig 360 the grooves will be wide enough after being cut with an ordinary handrip saw but for large work they are usually grooved on the circular saw bench illustration fig 360 fig 361 joint and method of wedging the frames of oil paintings corrugated steel fastenersit is now many years ago since the steel sawedge fastener first appeared on the market but probably 80 per cent of amateur woodworkers have never yet sampled its advantages in appearance it resembles a miniature corrugated galvanised sheet such as is used for roofing purposes with the exception however that the corrugations are divergent instead of being parallel and that one end is ground down to a cutting edge see fig 363 a they are made in various sizes from 14 in to 1 in in length whilst in regard to width they are classed by the number of corrugations and not by their measurement illustration fig 362jointing boards illustration fig 363jointing a frame illustration the use of sawedge corrugated steel fasteners to use the fastener no special tools are required it is simply driven in with a hammer exactly as though it were a nail once in position however to get it out is worse than drawing teeth the corrugations add to the strength of the device the wood fibres closing around them age and rust but emphasising their grip wall plugsat fig 364 four types of wall plugs are shown a the ordinary rectangular tapered wall plug to drive between the joints of the brickwork b the circular tapered wall plug as used to plug a wall after a starshaped brick drill has been used d a twisted wall plug used for similar purposes to the wedge a but considered to be superior in holding power owing to its twisted formation c is another type of wall plug considered to have great tenacity by reason of its corrugations wall plugs are required in nearly all cases where it is necessary to joint woodwork to brickwork as for instance heavilyframed silvered mirrors to the walls of shops illustration fig 364wall plugs four varieties illustration fig 365slot screwing illustration fig 366slot screwing a bracket slot screwing or keyhole screwing is a most useful way of joining light woodwork in such a manner that the fixing method is not exposed to the eye a stout screw is inserted to within 38 in of the head as at fig 365 in the adjoining piece a hole is bored with a centre bit and a slot is cut with an 18in chisel the two pieces of timber are placed together and by sliding the upper piece forward the screw runs up into the slot or keyhole and secures the joint fig 366 shows the application of the joint fixing a shaped bracket to the shaped shelf the bracket and shelf are inverted in the illustration to clearly show the method of jointing for heavy work special brass plates are obtainable for this purpose one plate is let flush into the upper piece and the other plate into the lower piece battening fig 367a good method of joining cross battens to drawing boards and other wide surfaces is shown here after boring for the screws slots are cut so as to allow the screws to move along the slots when shrinkage takes place in fig 368 a similar method is applied to secure the drawer bottom to the drawer back if shrinkage takes place in the drawer bottom and it leaves the groove in the drawer front the screws are slackened the drawer bottom is knocked up into the groove and the screws again inserted for drawing boards etc specially made ellipticalshaped slotted brass socket cups are made to receive the screw heads illustration fig 367battening illustration fig 368drawer bottom joint puzzle joints puzzle joints are not only interesting in themselves but are often excellent studies in craftsmanship the majority of them if to be satisfactory as puzzles call for very careful setting out and cutting entailing the same degree of skill that is demanded for highclass cabinet work for this reason several examples may well find a place in a volume dealing with woodwork joints as a rule these puzzles should be made in hardwood such as dark walnut or beech as in whitewood the joints are soon liable to wear illustration fig 369sketch of the completed chinese puzzle chinese puzzlethe ingenious puzzle of the chinese type shown in fig 369 is probably older than many of us could guess but as it is one that can be made by any woodworker we give full directions as to how it may be constructed the complete article may be called in form a sixpointed pyramid it is made up of twentyone different pieces each cut from wood 12 in wide and 12 in thick 38 in wood may be used if preferred for the purpose either sycamore or white maple is the most useful illustration fig 370 fig 371 fig 372 the three cross pieces illustration fig 373key piece the pieces required are as follows fig 370six pieces 312 ins long with a half slot cut in the centre as shown this slot must be exactly the width of the woods thickness and cut exactly half way through so that if two pieces are placed across by means of the halved joint their surfaces will be flush the slot must also be exactly in the centre fig 371six pieces size 212 ins long with a halfcut centre slot similar to that of fig 370 fig 372six required these being 112 ins in length and with slots in the middle as before fig 373one of these last six requires special treatment as it forms the key block of the puzzle after its slot has been cut one half of the narrow part must be sawn away as shown in fig 373 the inner edge must also be gently rounded the special use of this vital piece which we will call the key will be fully explained presently fig 374then in addition to these there are three central bars to make like the other parts they are 12 in by 12 in but are each 412 ins long and are cut as shown in fig 374 the end projections a are 12 in long and the cutaway part is exactly half the depth of the wood two of the three pieces x and y in fig 374 are similar but the slot b of the third one z is only 14 in wide instead of 12 in as will be noticed this 14in slot is not in the centre but corresponds with the righthand half of the larger slots of x and y illustration fig 374the central bars in making these twentyone pieces what should be borne in mind is that the different parts fit closely into each other consequently the slots in width must be cut so as to grip the thickness of the wood in depth they must be exactly half this thickness fitting the puzzlethe three central bars must first be joined as those form the skeleton framework of the structure fig 375 shows them in position but as it is a puzzle in itself as to how they can be got thus some explanation is necessary illustration fig 375the three central bars in position illustration fig 376how to adjust the bars note position of projecting ends a first stagefirst take the bars x and y see fig 374 and arrange them as shown in fig 376 it is most important that the projections a of x face upwards and that the projections a of y face towards the centre then take the bar z and bring it flat into the slot of x the little slot of z however must remain above the slot of x then slide the bar y along to the centre so that the part lettered c slips into the little slot of bar z this may seem confusing to read but it is easy to follow when the pieces are in ones hand the result of this rather clever arrangement is that the six arms of fig 375 are all exactly the same length width and thickness they are also arranged so that in each arm may be clasped one piece each of figs 370 371 and 372 the three central arms may of course be set up in a different order and here we have merely chosen the way that is the most simple to describe and illustrate illustration fig 377beginning to place on the cross pieces illustration fig 378placing the key piece to overlap end projection of central bar second stagein the remaining part of the work the chief difficulty is to keep the puzzle from falling to pieces before the key finally locks it take the longer cross parts fig 370 and clasp one to each arm the six need not all be put on meanwhile but only those which are most easily handled the next size fig 371 may then be put on in the ordinary course each arm could be completed with its three cross pieces till the sixth was attempted and here the reader would find that at the last moment his attempt was frustrated he could not get the last small piece in as other bars lock the puzzle here it is that the key comes in the key piecewhen the writer fits up the puzzle he finds that three of the arms may straight away be fitted complete with their three cross parts these are the ones where the longer cross piece fig 370 lies flush with the back of the central bar see fig 377 this is easily found out when at work on the puzzle in the case of the other three arms there is of course a gap caused by the long slots of the central bars adjust the parts on the firstnamed three arms and then deal with the fourth arm putting in all three cross parts for the little one here use the key by placing the key so that it overlaps the end projection of the arm see fig 378 a space is left at the centre and means is thus afforded for getting in the three cross parts on the remaining two arms this practically ends the puzzle while the key is in its overlapping position the parts may be separated but if it is turned round on its narrow neck so that it is in exactly the same position as the other five small cross parts it locks the whole thing so tightly that nothing but sheer force could loosen the twentyone pieces so far as the order of putting together is concerned there are many equally satisfactory ways these being determined by the ease or difficulty that one experiences in holding the halffinished puzzle it all comes to the same in the end and the key must be placed on one bar before the last three arms can be completed the key moreover must be on one of the bars where a gap is left at the centre and not on one where fig 370 lies flush against the central arm as in fig 377 undoing the puzzleto take the puzzle to pieces all that is required is to turn the key half round and push the other two cross bars on that arm towards the outer point the cross bars below may then be removed and the whole structure falls to pieces the double dovetail puzzle fig 379 consists of two pieces of wood usually one dark and the other light which upon examination appear to be dovetailed together from each face this interlocking arrangement is obviously impossible and the solution of the puzzle is only apparent on examining fig 380 where it will be seen that the joint fits together diagonally at fig 381 are given the diagrams for setting out draw the outline of the elevation plan and end view the end view in the first instance is indicated by 3 4 5 and 6 and it measures 178 ins square a 178ins square is simply used because 2ins wood generally finishes this size after it is planed up set out a square a b c d which stands cornerways in the larger square 3 4 5 6 project the lines d a and c b upwards as at 1 and on to this drawing 1 set out the dovetail according to your own idea of length width and bevel project the four points of your dovetail downwards into the end view and where these lines cut a b and d c draw them downwards and rebate them into your original plan this will give the true shape of the two dovetails and it is to this shape that you will cut your joint the joint is in due course glued up and next day you will plane and waste off the four corners of your model the end view shows one corner shaded d 3 a this and the other three corners are wasted away the result is that the dovetails are thrown into a plane different from that in which they were made showing as fig 379 illustration fig 379double dovetail puzzle illustration fig 380the two parts separated illustration fig 381elevation plan and end view showing how the puzzle joint may be correctly set out illustration fig 382dovetail puzzle the finished joint illustration fig 383sketch of dovetail piece note that dovetail is cut on slant the thickness at front being less than at back see dotted line on plan below illustration fig 384plan looking upwards illustration fig 385afront elevation illustration fig 385bback elevation the model calls for very accurate workmanship and the joints must not be undercut during the sawing and chiselling operations the completed model measures 6 to 7 ins the dovetail puzzle joint illustrated at fig 382 has perhaps caused more argument and controversy amongst woodworkers than any wooden joint it may be neatly made in maple walnut or mahogany and afterwards glued up the question everyone asks is how was it put together illustration fig 386variation of the dovetail puzzle take two pieces of wood such as mahogany walnut or birch about 6 ins long by 178 ins wide and 114 ins thick truly plane them up and then set out and make the tenon and dovetailed piece fig 383 next mark out and cut the cross bar to fit its corresponding piece the joint will go together in a somewhat diagonal direction as it is pushed into position from the back when closed it will appear as at fig 382 for guidance a plan part elevation and back elevation are added an improvement after you have gained experience in the making of this joint is to make a similar joint leaving the face b fig 386 blind it then does not show the bevelling of the dovetail at the end c in other words keep the line c say 14 in back from the face of b the joint should be glued up and it will then appear to the average worker that it is an impossible proposition see fig 401 page 208 illustration fig 387a simple variation of the dovetail puzzle carefully note that the edges a a are parallel to each other in spite of the fact that they slope in one direction a further variation of the puzzle is seen in fig 387 here the joint is much simpler and can easily be followed from the illustration illustration fig 388sixpiece joint puzzle cross puzzlefig 388 illustrates a sixpiece puzzle joint similar in some respects to fig 369 but very much simpler both a back and front view of the piece d is shown for clearness of illustration the method of assembling the pieces is as follows hold piece b upright and fit piece d across at the same time note that the small x marks are opposite each other take piece e and holding it as shown slide it up the piece b see arrow until e engages d and the small o marks are opposite each other piece c is now fitted behind d and then piece f will slide in position and push downwards the keypiece a is now put in position and the puzzle is completed illustration fig 389mortising puzzle showing how the parts fit mortising puzzlethe ordinary mortising exercise is after the first two or three attempts generally voted as uninteresting but although the simple puzzle shown in fig 389 is practically an exercise in mortising yet forming as it does a puzzle it becomes a fascinating piece of work the puzzle is composed of three pieces of wood each 4 ins long 112 ins wide and 12 in thick in each piece a mortise 112 ins by 12 in should be cut as shown at 1 fig 390 in one piece marked 2 a groove is cut on one side 38 in wide and in another piece 3 a similar slot but 12 in wide is cut and this is continued on the other side of the groove to a depth of 18 in the three pieces should be set out on a 13ins by 112ins by 12in length of wood as shown at fig 391 and when ready sawn apart illustration fig 390the three parts with sizes marked illustration fig 391how to cut the parts the puzzle is put together as shown at fig 389 in the first place hold no 1 piece upright as shown at a then take no 2 piece with slot uppermost and push it through the opening in no 1 piece until the nearest side of the slot projects 18 in as indicated at b next place no 3 piece on with the slot at the back as shown at c and push it down until it touches the bottom of the opening in no 2 piece as illustrated at d the only thing to do now is to push no 2 piece as far as it will go to make the figure as shown at e in this puzzle the parts should fit together fairly tight but should not be too stiff illustration fig 392chinese cross puzzle illustration fig 393method of putting together illustration fig 394the six pieces each 4 ins by 1 in square chinese crossfig 392 shows a variation of the chinese cross which is perhaps the most fascinating of all woodwork puzzles take six pieces of hardwood fig 394 and accurately plane and saw them so that each piece will measure 4 ins by 1 in by 1 in bearing in mind that all the cuts are multiples of 12 in set out saw and chisel five of the pieces to agree with the sketches 1 1a 2 2a and 3 leave the key piece intact the puzzle is of course to fit all the six pieces together so as to form the chinese cross or block given at fig 392 as a clue to the method of assembly we give another sketch fig 393 showing four of the pieces fixed together the reader can if he so desires make the puzzle to a smaller scale by using six pieces of wood each measuring 2 ins long by 12 in by 12 in illustration fig 395diagonal chinese cross puzzle two pieces required of a three of b and one of c diagonal chinese crossat fig 395 is given a sketch of a completed chinese block or cross puzzle in which the various pieces of wood go together diagonally plane up a piece of hardwood which may be about 14 ins or 15 ins long so that it measures on its end 12 in square cut the wood into six pieces which measure about 214 ins long and then proceed to mark out saw and pare up with the chisel two pieces like sketch a three pieces like b and one key piece as c now fit these together to make the completed cross the solution is left to the reader fig 396 shows a combination of six pieces which when fitted together will make the chinese cross similar to fig 392 plane up the strip of hardwood birch preferred so that it measures 12 in square at the end and proceed to mark out and make two pieces like d two like e one like f and one piece like g put the pieces together to form the chinese cross again the reader is left to solve the problem of fitting illustration fig 396another chinese cross two pieces required of d two of e and one each of f and g square puzzles are of endless variety four of these are shown all simple to make but not equally simple to solve the only material required for each is a 5ins square piece of 18in fretwood or plywood or if preferred pieces of different colour may be used the diagrams are given exactly half size and the lines may be set out direct on the wood it will be noticed that all four puzzles are strictly geometrical in character illustration fig 397sixpiece square puzzle for guidance in setting out the centre of top line is marked at a illustration fig 398fivepiece square puzzle in setting out note that the angles b b are right angles illustration fig 399tenpiece square puzzle for guidance in setting out the centre of the four outlines are lettered at c c c c illustration fig 400sixpiece square puzzle the centres of the four outlines are lettered at d d d d fig 397 is made up of six pieces and is the simplest of the group to solve although containing only five pieces fig 398 will be found to give more trouble fig 399 with ten pieces is undoubtedly the most trying puzzle and will be found as baffling as many jigsaw pictures fig 400 again presents only moderate difficulties if the reader prefers he may cut the squares to the size illustrated instead of enlarging them
