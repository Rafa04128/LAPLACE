scripture by e walter maunder fras author of the royal observatory greenwich its history and work and astronomy without a telescope with thirtyfour illustrations new york mitchell kennerley richard clay sons limited bread street hill ec and bungay suffolk to my wife my helper in this book and in all things preface why should an astronomer write a commentary on the bible because commentators as a rule are not astronomers and therefore either pass over the astronomical allusions of scripture in silence or else annotate them in a way which from a scientific point of view leaves much to be desired astronomical allusions in the bible direct and indirect are not few in number and in order to bring out their full significance need to be treated astronomically astronomy further gives us the power of placing ourselves to some degree in the position of the patriarchs and prophets of old we know that the same sun and moon stars and planets shine upon us as shone upon abraham and moses david and isaiah we can if we will see the unchanging heavens with their eyes and understand their attitude towards them it is worth while for us so to do for the immense advances in science made since the canon of holy scripture was closed and especially during the last three hundred years may enable us to realize the significance of a most remarkable fact even in those early ages when to all the nations surrounding israel the heavenly bodies were objects for divination or idolatry the attitude of the sacred writers toward them was perfect in its sanity and truth astronomy has a yet further part to play in biblical study the dating of the several books of the bible and the relation of certain heathen mythologies to the scripture narratives of the worlds earliest ages have received much attention of late years literary analysis has thrown much light on these subjects but hitherto any evidence that astronomy could give has been almost wholly neglected although from the nature of the case such evidence so far as it is available must be most decisive and exact i have endeavoured in the present book to make an astronomical commentary on the bible in a manner that shall be both clear and interesting to the general reader dispensing as far as possible with astronomical technicalities since the principles concerned are for the most part quite simple i trust also that i have taken the first step in a new inquiry which promises to give results of no small importance e walter maunder st johns london se january 1908 contents book i the heavenly bodies chapter i the hebrew and

astronomy modern astronomy began a little more than three centuries ago with the invention of the telescope and galileos application of it to the study of the heavenly bodies this new instrument at once revealed to him the mountains on the moon the satellites of jupiter and the spots on the sun and brought the celestial bodies under observation in a way that no one had dreamed of before in our view today the planets of the solar system are worlds we can examine their surfaces and judge wherein they resemble or differ from our earth to the ancients they were but points of light to us they are vast bodies that we have been able to measure and to weigh the telescope has enabled us also to penetrate deep into outer space we have learnt of other systems besides that of our own sun and its dependents many of them far more complex clusters and clouds of stars have been revealed to us and mysterious nebul which suggest by their forms that they are systems of suns in the making more lately the invention of the spectroscope has informed us of the very elements which go to the composition of these numberless stars and we can distinguish those which are in a similar condition to our sun from those differing from him and photography has recorded for us objects too faint for mere sight to detect even when aided by the most powerful telescope too detailed and intricate for the most skilful hand to depict galileos friend and contemporary kepler laid the foundations of another department of modern astronomy at about the same time he studied the apparent movements of the planets until they yielded him their secret so far that he was able to express them in three simple laws laws which two generations later sir isaac newton demonstrated to be the outcome of one grand and simple law of universal range the law of gravitation upon this law the marvellous mathematical conquests of astronomy have been based all these wonderful results have been attained by the free exercise of mens mental abilities and it cannot be imagined that god would have intervened to hamper their growth in intellectual power by revealing to men facts and methods which it was within their own ability to discover for themselves mens mental powers have developed by their exercise they would have been stunted had men been led to look to revelation rather than to diligent effort for the satisfaction of their curiosity we therefore do not find any reference in the bible to that which modern astronomy has taught us yet it may be noted that some expressions appropriate at any time have become much more appropriate much more forcible in the light of our presentday knowledge the age of astronomy which preceded the modern and may be called the classical age was almost as sharply defined in its beginning as its successor it lasted about two thousand years and began with the investigations into the movements of the planets made by some of the early greek mathematicians classical like modern astronomy had its two sidesthe instrumental and the mathematical on the instrumental side was the invention of graduated instruments for the determination of the positions of the heavenly bodies on the mathematical the development of geometry and trigonometry for the interpretation of those positions when thus determined amongst the great names of this period are those of eudoxus of knidus bc 408355 and hipparchus of bithynia who lived rather more than two centuries later under its first leaders astronomy in the classical age began to advance rapidly but it soon experienced a deadly blight men were not content to observe the heavenly bodies for what they were they endeavoured to make them the sources of divination the great school of alexandria founded about 300 bc the headquarters of astronomy became invaded by the spirit of astrology the bastard science which has always triedparasiteliketo suck its life from astronomy thus from the days of claudius ptolemy to the end of the middle ages the growth of astronomy was arrested and it bore but little fruit it will be noticed that the classical age did not commence until about the time of the completion of the last books of the old testament so we do not find any reference in holy scripture to the astronomical achievements of that period amongst which the first attempts to explain the apparent motions of sun moon stars and planets were the most considerable we have a complete history of astronomy in the modern and classical periods but there was an earlier astronomy not inconsiderable in amount of which no history is preserved for when eudoxus commenced his labours the length of the year had already been determined the equinoxes and solstices had been recognized the ecliptic the celestial equator and the poles of both great circles were known and the five principal planets were familiar objects this early astronomy must have had its history its stages of development but we can only with difficulty trace them out it cannot have sprung into existence fullgrown any more than the other sciences it must have started from zero and men must have slowly fought their way from one observation to another with gradually widening conceptions before they could bring it even to that stage of development in which it was when the observers of the museum of alexandria began their work the books of the old testament were written at different times during the progress of this early age of astronomy we should therefore naturally expect to find the astronomical allusions written from the standpoint of such scientific knowledge as had then been acquired we cannot for a moment expect that any supernatural revelation of purely material facts would be imparted to the writers of sacred books two or three thousand years before the progress of science had brought those facts to light and we ought not to be surprised if expressions are occasionally used which we should not ourselves use today if we were writing about the phenomena of nature from a technical point of view it must further be borne in mind that the astronomical references are not numerous that they occur mostly in poetic imagery and that holy scripture was not intended to give an account of the scientific achievements if any of the hebrews of old its purpose was wholly different it was religious not scientific it was meant to give spiritual not intellectual enlightenment an exceedingly valuable and interesting work has recently been brought out by the most eminent of living italian astronomers prof g v schiaparelli on this subject of astronomy in the old testament to which work i should like here to acknowledge my indebtedness yet i feel that the avowed object of his book71to discover what ideas the ancient jewish sages held regarding the structure of the universe what observations they made of the stars and how far they made use of them for the measurement and division of timeis open to this criticismthat sufficient material for carrying it out is not within our reach if we were to accept implicitly the argument from the silence of scripture we should conclude that the hebrewsthough their calendar was essentially a lunar one based upon the actual observation of the new moonhad never noticed that the moon changed its apparent form as the month wore on for there is no mention in the bible of the lunar phases the references to the heavenly bodies in scripture are not numerous and deal with them either as timemeasurers or as subjects for devout allusion poetic simile or symbolic use but there is one characteristic of all these references to the phenomena of nature that may not be ignored none of the ancients ever approached the great hebrew writers in spiritual elevation none equalled them in poetic sublimity and few if any surpassed them in keenness of observation or in quick sympathy with every work of the creator these characteristics imply a natural fitness of the hebrews for successful scientific work and we should have a right to believe that under propitious circumstances they would have shown a preeminence in the field of physical research as striking as is the superiority of their religious conceptions over those of the surrounding nations we cannot of course conceive of the average jew as an isaiah any more than we can conceive of the average englishman as a shakespeare yet the one man like the other is an index of the advancement and capacity of his race nor could isaiahs writings have been preserved more than those of shakespeare without a true appreciation of them on the part of many of his countrymen but the necessary conditions for any great scientific development were lacking to israel a small nation planted between powerful and aggressive empires their history was for the most part the record of a struggle for bare existence and after three or four centuries of the unequal conflict first the one and then the other of the two sister kingdoms was overwhelmed there was but little opportunity during these years of storm and stress for men to indulge in any curious searchings into the secrets of nature once only was there a long interval of prosperity and peace viz from the time that david had consolidated the kingdom to the time when it suffered disruption under his grandson rehoboam and it is significant that tradition has ascribed to solomon and to his times just such a scientific activity as the ability and temperament of the hebrew race would lead us to expect it to display when the conditions should be favourable for it thus in the fourth chapter of the first book of kings not only are the attainments of solomon himself described but other men contemporaries either of his father david or himself are referred to as distinguished in the same direction though to a less degree and god gave solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much and largeness of heart even as the sand that is on the seashore and solomons wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east country and all the wisdom of egypt for he was wiser than all men than ethan the ezrahite and heman and chalcol and darda the sons of mahol and his fame was in all nations round about and he spake three thousand proverbs and his songs were a thousand and five and he spake of trees from the cedartree that is in lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall he spake also of beasts and of fowl and of creeping things and of fishes and there came of all people to hear the wisdom of solomon from all kings of the earth which had heard of his wisdom the tradition of his great eminence in scientific research is also preserved in the words put into his mouth in the book of the wisdom of solomon now included in the apocrypha for god himself gave me an unerring knowledge of the things that are to know the constitution of the world and the operation of the elements the beginning and end and middle of times the alternations of the solstices and the changes of seasons the circuits of years and the positions margin constellations of stars the natures of living creatures and the ragings of wild beasts the violences of winds and the thoughts of men the diversities of plants and the virtues of roots all things that are either secret or manifest i learned for she that is the artificer of all things taught me even wisdom two great names have impressed themselves upon every part of the eastthe one that of solomon the son of david as the master of every secret source of knowledge and the other that of alexander the great as the mightiest of conquerors it is not unreasonable to believe that the traditions respecting the first have been founded upon as real a basis of actual achievement as those respecting the second but to such scientific achievements we have no express allusion in scripture other than is afforded us by the two quotations just made natural objects natural phenomena are not referred to for their own sake every thought leads up to god or to mans relation to him nature as a whole and in its every aspect and detail is the handiwork of jehovah that is the truth which the heavens are always declaringand it is his power his wisdom and his goodness to man which it is sought to illustrate when the beauty or wonder of natural objects is described when i consider thy heavens the work of thy fingers the moon and the stars which thou hast ordained what is man that thou art mindful of him and the son of man that thou visitest him the first purpose therefore of the following study of the astronomy of the bible isnot to reconstruct the astronomy of the hebrews a task for which the material is manifestly incompletebut to examine such astronomical allusions as occur with respect to their appropriateness to the lesson which the writer desired to teach following this it will be of interest to examine what connection can be traced between the old testament scriptures and the constellations the arrangement of the stars into constellations having been the chief astronomical work effected during the centuries when those scriptures were severally composed the use made of the heavenly bodies as timemeasurers amongst the hebrews will form a third division of the subject whilst there are two or three incidents in the history of israel which appear to call for examination from an astronomical point of view and may suitably be treated in a fourth and concluding section footnotes 71 astronomy in the old testament p 12 chapter ii the creation a few years ago a great eclipse of the sun seen as total along a broad belt of country right across india drew thither astronomers from the very ends of the earth not only did many english observers travel thither but the united states of america in the far west and japan in the far east sent their contingents and the entire length of country covered by the path of the shadow was dotted with the temporary observatories set up by the men of science it was a wonderful sight that was vouchsafed to these travellers in pursuit of knowledge in a sky of unbroken purity undimmed even for a moment by haze or cloud there shone down the fierce indian sun gradually a dark mysterious circle invaded its lower edge and covered its brightness coolness replaced the burning heat slowly the dark covering crept on slowly the sunlight diminished until at length the whole of the suns disc was hidden then in a moment a wonderful starlike form flashed out a noble form of glowing silver light on the deep purplecoloured sky there was however no time for the astronomers to devote to admiration of the beauty of the scene or indulgence in rhapsodies two short minutes alone were allotted them to note all that was happening to take all their photographs to ask all the questions and obtain all the answers for which this strange veiling of the sun and still stranger unveiling of his halolike surroundings gave opportunity it was two minutes of intensest strain of hurried though orderly work and then a sudden rush of sunlight put an end to all the mysterious vision had withdrawn itself the colour rushed back to the landscape so corpselike whilst in the shadow the black veil slid rapidly from off the sun the heat returned to the air the eclipse was over but the astronomers from distant lands were not the only people engaged in watching the eclipse at their work they could hear the sound of a great multitude a sound of weeping and wailing a people dismayed at the distress of their god it was so at every point along the shadow track but especially where that track met the course of the sacred river along a hundred roads the pilgrims had poured in unceasing streams towards holy mother gunga towards benares the sacred city towards buxar where the eclipse was central at the river bank it is always meritoriousso the hindoo holdsto bathe in that sacred river but such a time as this when the sun is in eclipse is the most propitious moment of all for such lustration could there be a greater contrast than that offered between the millions trembling and dismayed at the signs of heaven and the little companies who had come for thousands of miles over land and sea rejoicing in the brief chance that was given them for learning a little more of the secrets of the wonders of nature the contrast between the heathen and the scientists was in both their spiritual and their intellectual standpoint and as we shall see later the intellectual contrast is a result of the spiritual the heathen idea is that the orbs of heaven are divine or at least that each expresses a divinity this does not in itself seem an unnatural idea when we consider the great benefits that come to us through the instrumentality of the sun and moon it is the sun that morning by morning rolls back the darkness and brings light and warmth and returning life to men it is the sun that rouses the earth after her winter sleep and quickens vegetation it is the moon that has power over the great world of waters whose pulse beats in some kind of mysterious obedience to her will natural then has it been for men to go further and to suppose that not only is power lodged in these and in the other members of the heavenly host but that it is living intelligent personal power that these shining orbs are beings or the manifestations of beings exalted mighty immortalthat they are gods but if these are gods then it is sacrilegious it is profane to treat them as mere things to observe them minutely in the microscope or telescope to dissect them as it were in the spectroscope to identify their elements in the laboratory to be curious about their properties influences relations and actions on each other and if these are gods there are many gods not one god and if there are many gods there are many laws not one law thus scientific observations cannot be reconciled with polytheism for scientific observations demand the assumption of one universal law the wise king expressed this law thus the thing that hath been it is that which shall be the actual language of science as expressed by professor thiele a leading continental astronomer states that everything that exists and everything that happens exists or happens as a necessary consequence of a previous state of things if a state of things is repeated in every detail it must lead to exactly the same consequences any difference between the results of causes that are in part the same must be explainable by some difference in the other part of the causes151 the law stated in the above words has been called the law of causality it cannot be proved but must be believed in the same way as we believe the fundamental assumptions of religion with which it is closely and intimately connected the law of causality forces itself upon our belief it may be denied in theory but not in practice any person who denies it will if he is watchful enough catch himself constantly asking himself if no one else why this has happened and not that but in that very question he bears witness to the law of causality if we are consistently to deny the law of causality we must repudiate all observation and particularly all prediction based on past experience as useless and misleading if we could imagine for an instant that the same complete combination of causes could have a definite number of different consequences however small that number might be and that among these the occurrence of the actual consequence was in the old sense of the word accidental no observation would ever be of any particular value161 so long as men hold as a practical faith that the results which attend their efforts depend upon whether jupiter is awake and active or neptune is taking an unfair advantage of his brothers sleep upon whether diana is bending her silver bow for the battle or flying weeping and discomfited because juno has boxed her earsso long is it useless for them to make or consult observations but as professor thiele goes on to say if the law of causality is acknowledged to be an assumption which always holds good then every observation gives us a revelation which when correctly appraised and compared with others teaches us the laws by which god rules the world by what means have the modern scientists arrived at a position so different from that of the heathen it cannot have been by any process of natural evolution that the intellectual standpoint which has made scientific observation possible should be derived from the spiritual standpoint of polytheism which rendered all scientific observation not only profane but useless in the old days the heathen in general regarded the heavenly host and the heavenly bodies as the heathen do today but by one nation the hebrews the truth that in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth was preserved in the first words of their sacred book that nation declared all the gods of the people are idols but the lord made the heavens for that same nation the watchword was hear o israel the lord our god is one lord from these words the hebrews not only learned a great spiritual truth but derived intellectual freedom for by these words they were taught that all the host of heaven and of earth were created thingsmerely things not divinitiesand not only that but that the creator was one god not many gods that there was but one lawgiver and that therefore there could be no conflict of laws these first words of genesis then may be called the charter of all the physical sciences for by them is conferred freedom from all the bonds of unscientific superstition and by them also do men know that consistent law holds throughout the whole universe it is the intellectual freedom of the hebrew that the scientist of today inherits he may not indeed be able to rise to the spiritual standpoint of the hebrew and consciously acknowledge that thou even thou art lord alone thou hast made heaven the heaven of heavens with all their host the earth and all things that are therein the seas and all that is therein and thou preservest them all and the host of heaven worshippeth thee but he must at least unconsciously assent to it for it is on the first great fundamental assumption of religion as stated in the first words of genesis that the fundamental assumption of all his scientific reasoning depends scientific reasoning and scientific observation can only hold good so long and in so far as the law of causality holds good we must assume a preexisting state of affairs which has given rise to the observed effect we must assume that this observed effect is itself antecedent to a subsequent state of affairs science therefore cannot go back to the absolute beginnings of things or forward to the absolute ends of things it cannot reason about the way matter and energy came into existence or how they might cease to exist it cannot reason about time or space as such but only in the relations of these to phenomena that can be observed it does not deal with things themselves but only with the relations between things science indeed can only consider the universe as a great machine which is in going order and it concerns itself with the relations which some parts of the machine bear to other parts and with the laws and manner of the going of the machine in those parts the relations of the various parts one to the other and the way in which they work together may afford some idea of the design and purpose of the machine but it can give no information as to how the material of which it is composed came into existence nor as to the method by which it was originally constructed once started the machine comes under the scrutiny of science but the actual starting lies outside its scope men therefore cannot find out for themselves how the worlds were originally made how the worlds were first moved or how the spirit of man was first formed within him and this not merely because these beginnings of things were of necessity outside his experience but also because beginnings as such must lie outside the law by which he reasons by no process of research therefore could man find out for himself the facts that are stated in the first chapter of genesis they must have been revealed science cannot inquire into them for the purpose of checking their accuracy it must accept them as it accepts the fundamental law that governs its own working without the possibility of proof and this is what has been revealed to manthat the heaven and the earth were not selfexistent from all eternity but were in their first beginning created by god as the writer of the epistle to the hebrews expresses it through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear and a further fact was revealed that man could not have found out for himself viz that this creation was made and finished in six divine actings comprised in what the narrative denominates days it has not been revealed whether the duration of these days can be expressed in any astronomical units of time since under these conditions science can afford no information it is not to be wondered at that the hypotheses that have been framed from time to time to explain the first chapter of genesis or to express it in scientific terms are not wholly satisfactory at one time the chapter was interpreted to mean that the entire universe was called into existence about 6000 years ago in six days of twentyfour hours each later it was recognized that both geology and astronomy seemed to indicate the existence of matter for untold millions of years instead of some six thousand it was then pointed out that so far as the narrative was concerned there might have been a period of almost unlimited duration between its first verse and its fourth and it was suggested that the six days of creation were six days of twentyfour hours each in which after some great cataclysm 6000 years ago the face of the earth was renewed and replenished for the habitation of man the preceding geological ages being left entirely unnoticed some writers have confined the cataclysm and renewal to a small portion of the earths surfaceto eden and its neighbourhood other commentators have laid stress on the truth revealed in scripture that one day is with the lord as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day and have urged the argument that the six days of creation were really vast periods of time during which the earths geological changes and the evolution of its varied forms of life were running their course others again have urged that the six days of creation were six literal days but instead of being consecutive were separated by long ages and yet again as no man was present during the creation period it has been suggested that the divine revelation of it was given to moses or some other inspired prophet in six successive visions or dreams which constituted the six days in which the chief facts of creation were set forth all such hypotheses are based on the assumption that the opening chapters of genesis are intended to reveal to man certain physical details in the material history of this planet to be in fact a little compendium of the geological and zoological history of the world and so a suitable introduction to the history of the early days of mankind which followed it it is surely more reasonable to conclude that there was no purpose whatever of teaching us anything about the physical relationships of land and sea of tree and plant of bird and fish it seems indeed scarcely conceivable that it should have been the divine intention so to supply the ages with a condensed manual of the physical sciences what useful purpose could it have served what man would have been the wiser or better for it who could have understood it until the time when men by their own intellectual strivings had attained sufficient knowledge of their physical surroundings to do without such a revelation at all but although the opening chapters of genesis were not designed to teach the hebrew certain physical facts of nature they gave him the knowledge that he might lawfully study nature for he learnt from them that nature has no power nor vitality of its own that sun and sea and cloud and wind are not separate deities nor the expression of deities that they are but things however glorious and admirable that they are the handiwork of god and the works of the lord are great sought out of all them that have pleasure therein his work is honour and majesty and his righteousness endureth for ever he hath made his wonderful works to be remembered what then is the significance of the detailed account given us of the works effected on the successive days of creation why are we told that light was made on the first day the firmament on the second dry land on the third and so on probably for two reasons first that the rehearsal as in a catalogue of the leading classes of natural objects might give definiteness and precision to the teaching that each and all were creatures things made by the word of god the bald statement that the heaven and the earth were made by god might still have left room for the imagination that the powers of nature were coeternal with god or were at least subordinate divinities or that other powers than god had worked up into the present order the materials he had created the detailed account makes it clear that not only was the universe in general created by god but that there was no part of it that was not fashioned by him the next purpose was to set a seal of sanctity upon the sabbath in the second chapter of genesis we read on the seventh day god ended his work which he had made and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made and god blessed the seventh day and sanctified it because that in it he had rested from all his work which god created and made in this we get the institution of the week the first ordinance imposed by god upon man for in the fourth of the ten commandments which god gave through moses it is said the seventh day is the sabbath of the lord thy god in it thou shalt not do any work for in six days the lord made heaven and earth the sea and all that in them is and rested the seventh day wherefore the lord blessed the sabbath day and hallowed it and again when the tabernacle was being builded it was commanded the children of israel shall keep the sabbath to observe the sabbath throughout their generations for a perpetual covenant it is a sign between me and the children of israel for ever for in six days the lord made heaven and earth and on the seventh day he rested and was refreshed god made the sun moon and stars and appointed them for signs and for seasons and for days and years the sun marks out the days the moon by her changes makes the months the sun and the stars mark out the seasons and the years these were divisions of time which man would naturally adopt but there is not an exact number of days in the month nor an exact number of days or months in the year still less does the period of seven days fit precisely into month or season or year the week is marked out by no phase of the moon by no fixed relation between the sun the moon or the stars it is not a division of time that man would naturally adopt for himself it runs across all the natural divisions of time what are the six days of creative work and the seventh daythe sabbathof creative rest they are not days of man they are days of god and our days of work and rest our week with its sabbath can only be the figure and shadow of that week of god something by which we may gain some faint apprehension of its realities not that by which we can comprehend and measure it our week therefore is gods own direct appointment to us and his revelation that he fulfilled the work of creation in six acts or stages dignifies and exalts the toil of the labouring man with his six days of effort and one of rest into an emblem of the creative work of god footnotes 151 t n thiele director of the copenhagen observatory theory of observations p 1 161 t n thiele director of the copenhagen observatory theory of

tiamat by merodach chapter iii the deep the second verse of genesis states and the earth was without form and void i e waste and empty and darkness was upon the face of the deep the word tehom here translated deep has been used to support the theory that the hebrews derived their creation story from one which when exiles in babylon they heard from their conquerors if this theory were substantiated it would have such an important bearing upon the subject of the attitude of the inspired writers towards the objects of nature that a little space must be spared for its examination the purpose of the first chapter of genesis is to tell us that in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth from it we learn that the universe and all the parts that make it upall the different forms of energy all the different forms of matterare neither deities themselves nor their embodiments and expressions nor the work of conflicting deities from it we learn that the universe is not selfexistent nor even as the pantheist thinks of it the expression of one vague impersonal and unconscious but allpervading influence it was not selfmade it did not exist from all eternity it is not god for god made it but the problem of its origin has exercised the minds of many nations beside the hebrews and an especial interest attaches to the solution arrived at by those nations who were near neighbours of the hebrews and came of the same great semitic stock from the nature of the case accounts of the origin of the world cannot proceed from experience or be the result of scientific experiment they cannot form items of history or arise from tradition there are only two possible sources for them one divine revelation the other the invention of men the account current amongst the babylonians has been preserved to us by the syrian writer damascius who gives it as follows but the babylonians like the rest of the barbarians pass over in silence the one principle of the universe and they constitute two tavth and apasn making apasn the husband of tavth and denominating her the mother of the gods and from these proceeds an onlybegotten son mumis which i conceive is no other than the intelligible world proceeding from the two principles from them also another progeny is derived lakh and lakhos and again a third kissar and assros from which last three others proceed anos and illinos and aos and of aos and dakh is born a son called blos who they say is the fabricator of the world261 the actual story thus summarized by damascius was discovered by mr george smith in the form of a long epic poem on a series of tablets brought from the royal library of kouyunjik or nineveh and he published them in 1875 in his book on the chaldean account of genesis none of the tablets were perfect and of some only very small portions remain but portions of other copies of the poem have been discovered in other localities and it has been found possible to piece together satisfactorily a considerable section so that a fair idea of the general scope of the poem has been given to us it opens with the introduction of a being tiamtuthe tavth of the account of damasciuswho is regarded as the primeval mother of all things when on high the heavens were unnamed beneath the earth bore not a name the primeval ocean was their producer mummu tiamtu was she who begot the whole of them their waters in one united themselves and the plains were not outlined marshes were not to be seen when none of the gods had come forth they bore no name the fates had not been determined there were produced the gods all of them271 the genealogy of the gods follows and after a gap in the story tiamat or tiamtu is represented as preparing for battle she who created everything produced giant serpents she chose one of the gods kingu to be her husband and the general of her forces and delivered to him the tablets of fate the second tablet shows the god anvsar angered at the threatening attitude of tiamat and sending his son anu to speak soothingly to her and calm her rage but first anu and then another god turned back baffled and finally merodach the son of ea was asked to become the champion of the gods merodach gladly consented but made good terms for himself the gods were to assist him in every possible way by entrusting all their powers to him and were to acknowledge him as first and chief of all the gods in their extremity were nothing loth they feasted merodach and when swollen with wine endued him with all magical powers and hailed him merodach thou art he who is our avenger over the whole universe have we given thee the kingdom281 at first the sight of his terrible enemy caused even merodach to falter but plucking up courage he advanced to meet her caught her in his net and forcing an evil wind into her open mouth he made the evil wind enter so that she could not close her lips the violence of the winds tortured her stomach and her heart was prostrated and her mouth was twisted he swung the club he shattered her stomach he cut out her entrails he overmastered her heart he bound her and ended her life he threw down her corpse he stood upon it282 the battle over and the enemy slain merodach considered how to dispose of the corpse he strengthens his mind he forms a clever plan and he stripped her of her skin like a fish according to his plan283 of one half of the corpse of tiamat he formed the earth and of the other half the heavens he then proceded to furnish the heavens and the earth with their respective equipments the details of this work occupying apparently the fifth sixth and seventh tablets of the series under ordinary circumstances such a legend as the foregoing would not have attracted much attention it is as barbarous and unintelligent as any myth of zulu or fijian strictly speaking it is not a creation myth at all tiamat and her serpentbrood and the gods are all existent before merodach commences his work and all that the god effects is a reconstruction of the world the method of this reconstruction possesses no features superior to those of the creation myths of other barbarous nations our own scandinavian ancestors had a similar one the setting of which was certainly not inferior to the grotesque battle of merodach with tiamat the prose edda tells us that the first man bur was the father of br who was in turn the father of odin and his two brothers vili and ve these sons of br slew ymir the old frost giant they dragged the body of ymir into the middle of ginnungagap and of it formed the earth from ymirs blood they made the sea and waters from his flesh the land from his bones the mountains and his teeth and jaws together with some bits of broken bones served them to make the stones and pebbles it will be seen that there is a remarkable likeness between the babylonian and scandinavian myths in the central and essential feature of each viz the way in which the world is supposed to have been built up by the gods from the fragments of the anatomy of a huge primval monster yet it is not urged that there is any direct genetic connection between the two that the babylonians either taught their legend to the scandinavians or learnt it from them under ordinary circumstances it would hardly have occurred to any one to try to derive the monotheistic narrative of gen i from either of these pagan myths crowded as they are with uncouth and barbarous details but it happened that mr george smith who brought to light the assyrian creation tablets brought also to light a babylonian account of the flood which had a large number of features in common with the narrative of gen viix the actual resemblance between the two deluge narratives has caused a resemblance to be imagined between the two creation narratives it has been well brought out in some of the later comments of assyriologists that so far from there being any resemblance in the babylonian legend to the narrative in genesis the two accounts differ in toto mr t g pinches for example points out that in the babylonian account there is no direct statement of the creation of the heavens and the earth no systematic division of the things created into groups and classes such as is found in genesis no reference to the days of creation no appearance of the deity as the first and only cause of the existence of things301 indeed in the babylonian account the heavens and the earth are represented as existing though in a chaotic form from the first yet on this purely imaginary resemblance between the biblical and babylonian creation narratives the legend has been founded that the introductory chapters of the book of genesis present to us the hebrew version of a mythology common to many of the semitic peoples and the legend has been yet further developed until writers of the standing of prof friedrich delitzsch have claimed that the genesis narrative was borrowed from the babylonian though the priestly scholar who composed genesis chapter i endeavoured of course to remove all possible mythological features of this creation story311 if the hebrew priest did borrow from the babylonian myth what was it that he borrowed not the existence of sea and land of sun and moon of plants and animals of birds and beasts and fishes for surely the hebrew may be credited with knowing this much of himself without any need for a transportation to babylon to learn it in writing an account of the creation statements as to what are the things created must of necessity be inserted312 whenever wherever and by whomsoever that account is written what else then is there common to the two accounts tiamat is the name given to the babylonian mother of the universe the dragon of the deep and in genesis it is written that darkness was upon the face of the deep tehom here and here only is a point of possible connection but if it be evidence of a connection what kind of a connection does it imply it implies that the babylonian based his barbarous myth upon the hebrew narrative there is no other possible way of interpreting the connectionif connection there be the hebrew word would seem to mean etymologically surges stormtossed watersdeep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts our word deep is apt to give us the idea of stillnesswe have the proverb still waters run deepwhereas in some instances tehom is used in scripture of waters which were certainly shallow as for instance those passed through by israel at the red sea pharaohs chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea his chosen captains also are drowned in the red sea the depths have covered them in other passages the words used in our authorized version deep or depths give the correct signification but deep waters or waters in commotion are in either case natural objects we get the word tehom used continually in scripture in a perfectly matteroffact way where there is no possibility of personification or myth being intended tiamat on the contrary the babylonian dragon of the waters is a mythological personification now the natural object must come first it never yet has been the case that a nation has gained its knowledge of a perfectly common natural object by demythologizing one of the mythological personifications of another nation the israelites did not learn about tehom the surging water of the red sea that rolled over the egyptians in their sight from any babylonian fable of a dragon of the waters read by their descendants hundreds of years later yet further the babylonian account of creation is comparatively late the hebrew account as certainly comparatively early it is not merely that the actual cuneiform tablets are of date about 700 bc coming as they do from the kouyunjik mound the ruins of the palace of sennacherib and assurbanipal built about that date the poem itself as prof sayce has pointed out indicates by the peculiar preeminence given in it to merodach that it is of late composition it was late in the history of babylon that merodach was adopted as the supreme deity the astronomical references in the poem are more conclusive still for as will be shown later on they point to a development of astronomy that cannot be dated earlier than 700 bc on the other hand the first chapter of genesis was composed very early the references to the heavenly bodies in verse 16 bear the marks of the most primitive condition possible of astronomy the heavenly bodies are simply the greater light the lesser light and the starsthe last being introduced quite parenthetically it is the simplest reference to the heavenly bodies that is made in scripture or that indeed could be made there may well have been babylonians who held higher conceptions of god and nature than those given in the tiamat myth it is certain that very many hebrews fell short of the teaching conveyed in the first chapter of genesis but the fact remains that the one nation preserved the tiamat myth the other the narrative of genesis and each counted its own creation story sacred we can only rightly judge the two nations by what they valued thus judged the hebrew nation stands as high above the babylonian in intelligence as well as in faith as the first chapter of genesis is above the tiamat myth footnotes 261 records of the past vol i p 124 271 the old testament in the light of the

in the light of the historical records of assyria and babylonia by t g pinches p 48 chapter iv the firmament the sixth verse of the first chapter of genesis presents a difficulty as to the precise meaning of the principal word viz that translated firmament and god said let there be a raqia in the midst of the waters and let it divide the waters from the waters and god made the raqia and divided the waters which were under the raqia from the waters which were above the raqia and it was so and god called the raqia shamayim and the evening and the morning were the second day it is of course perfectly clear that by the word raqia in the preceding passage it is the atmosphere that is alluded to but later on in the chapter the word is used in a slightly different connection god said let there be lights in the firmament of heaven as we look upward from the earth we look through a twofold medium near the earth we have our atmosphere above that there is interstellar space void of anything so far as we know except the ether we are not able to detect any line of demarcation where our atmosphere ends and the outer void begins both therefore are equally spoken of as the firmament and yet there is a difference between the two the lower supports the clouds in the upper are set the two great lights and the stars the upper therefore is emphatically reqia hasshamayim the firmament of heaven of the uplifted it is in the face ofthat is before or under the eyes of beneaththis higher expanse that the fowls of the air fly to and fro the firmament then is that which tennyson sings of as the central blue the seeming vault of the sky which we can consider as at any height above us that we please the clouds are above it in one sense yet in another sun moon and stars which are clearly far higher than the clouds are set in it there is no question therefore as to what is referred to by the word firmament but there is a question as to the etymological meaning of the word and associated with that a question as to how the hebrews themselves conceived of the celestial vault the word raqia translated firmament properly signifies an expanse or extension something stretched or beaten out the verb from which this noun is derived is often used in scripture both as referring to the heavens and in other connections thus in job xxxvii 18 the question is asked canst thou with him spread out the sky which is strong as a molten mirror eleazar the priest after the rebellion of korah dathan and abiram took the brazen censers of the rebels and they were made broad plates for a covering of the altar the goldsmith described by isaiah as making an idol spreadeth it over with gold whilst jeremiah says silver spread into plates is brought from tarshish again in psalm cxxxvi in the account of creation we have the same word used with reference to the earth to him that stretched out the earth above the waters in this and in many other passages the idea of extension is clearly that which the word is intended to convey but the seventy in making the greek version of the old testament were naturally influenced by the views of astronomical science then held in alexandria the centre of greek astronomy here and at this time the doctrine of the crystalline spheresa misunderstanding of the mathematical researches of eudoxus and othersheld currency these spheres were supposed to be a succession of perfectly transparent and invisible solid shells in which the sun moon and planets were severally placed the seventy no doubt considered that in rendering raqia by stereoma i e firmament thus conveying the idea of a solid structure they were speaking the last word of uptodate science there should be no reluctance in ascribing to the hebrews an erroneous scientific conception if there is any evidence that they held it we cannot too clearly realize that the writers of the scriptures were not supernaturally inspired to give correct technical scientific descriptions and supposing they had been so inspired we must bear in mind that we should often consider those descriptions wrong just in proportion to their correctness for the very sufficient reason that not even our own science of today has yet reached finality in all things there should be no reluctance in ascribing to the hebrews an erroneous scientific conception if there is any evidence that they held it in this case there is no such evidence indeed there is strong evidence to the contrary the hebrew word raqia as already shown really signifies extension just as the word for heaven shamayim means the uplifted in these two words therefore significant respectively of a surface and of height there is a recognition of the three dimensionsin other words of space when we wish to refer to superterrestrial space we have two expressions in modern english by which to describe it we can speak of the vault of heaven or of the canopy of heaven the vault of heaven is most used it has indeed been recently adopted as the title of a scientific work by a wellknown astronomer but the word vault certainly gives the suggestion of a solid structure whilst the word canopy calls up the idea of a slighter covering probably of some textile fabric the reasons for thinking that the hebrews did not consider the firmament a solid structure are first that the word does not necessarily convey that meaning next that the attitude of the hebrew mind towards nature was not such as to require this idea the question what holds up the waters above the firmament would not have troubled them it would have been sufficient for them as for the writer to the hebrews to consider that god was upholding all things by the word of his power and they would not have troubled about the machinery but besides this there are many passages in scripture some occurring in the earliest books which expressly speak of the clouds as carrying the water so that the expressions placing waters above the firmament or above the heavens can mean no more than in the clouds indeed as we shall see quite a clear account is given of the atmospheric circulation such as could hardly be mended by a modern poet it is true that david sang that the foundations of heaven moved and shook because he was wroth and job says that the pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof but not only are the references to foundations and pillars evidently intended merely as poetic imagery but they are also used much more frequently of the earth and yet at the same time job expressly points out that god stretcheth out the north over the empty place and hangeth the earth upon nothing the hebrew formed no ideas like those of the hindus who thought the earth supported by elephants the elephants by a tortoise the tortoise by a snake in scripture in most cases the word earth eretz does not mean the solid mass of this our planet but only its surface the dry land as opposed to the seas the countries the dwelling place of man and beast the pillars or foundations of the earth in this sense are the great systems of the rocks and these were conceived of as directly supported by the power of god without any need of intermediary structures the hebrew clearly recognized that it is the will of god alone that keeps the whole secure thus hannah sang the pillars of the earth are the lords and he hath set the world upon them and asaph represents the lord as saying the earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved i bear up the pillars of it yet again just as we speak of the celestial canopy so psalm civ describes the lord as he who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain and isaiah gives the image in a fuller formthat stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in the same expression of stretching out the heavens is repeatedly used in isaiah it is indeed one of his typical phrases here beyond question extension spreading out is the idea sought to be conveyed not that of solidity the prophet amos uses yet another parallel it is he that buildeth his stories in the heaven while isaiah speaks of the entire stellar universe as the tent or pavilion of jehovah amos likens the height of the heavens as the steps up to his throne the stories are the ascent as moses speaks of the ascent of akrabbim and david makes the ascent of the mount of olives the hebrews cannot have regarded the heavens as literally both staircase and reservoir the firmament i e the atmosphere is spoken of as dividing between the waters that are under the firmament i e oceans seas rivers etc from the waters that are above the firmament i e the masses of water vapour carried by the atmosphere seen in the clouds and condensing from them as rain we get the very same expression as this of the waters which were above in the psalm of praise praise him ye heavens of heavens and ye waters that be above the heavens and again in the song of the three children o all ye waters that be above the heaven bless ye the lord in the later books of the bible the subject of the circulation of water through the atmosphere is referred to much more fully twice over the prophet amos describes jehovah as he that calleth for the waters of the sea and poureth them out upon the face of the earth this is not merely a reference to the tides for the preacher in the book of ecclesiastes expressly points out that all the rivers run into the sea yet the sea is not full unto the place from whence the rivers come thither they return again and isaiah seems to employ something of the same thought for as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven and returneth not thither but watereth the earth and maketh it bring forth and bud and giveth seed to the sower and bread to the eater schiaparelli indeed argues that this very passage from isaiah expressly excludes any idea of an atmospheric circulation of waters411 on the ground that the water so falling is thought to be transmuted into seeds and fruits but surely the image is as true as it is beautiful the rain is absorbed by vegetation and is transmuted into seeds and fruit and it would go hard to say that the same particles of rain are again evaporated and taken up afresh into the clouds besides if we complete the quotation we find that what is stated is that the rain does not return until it has accomplished its purpose so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which i please and it shall prosper in the thing whereto i sent it elihu describes the process of evaporation precisely behold god is great and we know him not the number of his years is unsearchable for he draweth up the drops of water which distil in rain from his vapour which the skies pour down and drop upon man abundantly throughout the books of holy scripture the connection between the clouds and the rain is clearly borne in mind deborah says in her song the clouds dropped water in the psalms there are many references in lxxvii 17 the clouds poured out water in cxlvii 8 who covereth the heaven with clouds who prepareth rain for the earth proverbs xvi 15 his favour is as a cloud of the latter rain the preacher says that clouds return after the rain and isaiah i will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it and jude clouds they are without water carried about of winds the clouds too were not conceived as being heavy nahum says that the clouds are the dust of his feet and isaiah speaks of a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest the preacher clearly understood that the waters above were not pent in by solid barriers that they were carried by the clouds for if the clouds be full of rain they empty themselves upon the earth and job says of jehovah he bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds and the cloud is not rent under them and later jehovah himself asks canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds that abundance of waters may cover thee who can number the clouds by wisdom or who can pour out the bottles of heaven the hebrews therefore were quite aware that the waters of the sea were drawn up into the atmosphere by evaporation and were carried by it in the form of clouds no doubt their knowledge in this respect as in others was the growth of time but there is no need to suppose that even in the earlier stages of their development the hebrews thought of the waters that be above the heavens as contained in a literal cistern overhead still less is there reason to adopt prof schiaparellis strange deduction considering the spherical and convex shape of the firmament the upper waters could not remain above without a second wall to hold them in at the sides and the top so a second vault above the vault of the firmament closes in together with the firmament a space where are the storehouses of rain hail and snow431 there seems to be nowhere in scripture the slightest hint or suggestion of any such second vault certainly not in the beautiful passage to which prof schiaparelli is here referring where is the way to the dwelling of light and as for darkness where is the place thereof that thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof and that thou shouldst discern the paths to the house thereof hast thou entered the treasuries of the snow or hast thou seen the treasuries of the hail which i have reserved against the time of trouble against the day of battle and war by what way is the light parted or the east wind scattered upon the earth who hath cleft a channel for the waterflood or a way for the lightning of the thunder hath the rain a father or who hath begotten the drops of dew out of whose womb came the ice and the hoary frost of heaven who hath gendered it the song of david psalm xviii clearly shows that its writer held no fantasy of a solidly built cistern of waters in the sky but thought of the dark waters in the heavens as identical with the thick clouds the passage is worth quoting at some length not merely as supplying a magnificent word picture of a storm but as showing the free and courageous spirit of the hebrew poet a spirit more emancipated than can be found in any other nation of antiquity it was not only the gentler aspect of nature that attracted him even for its most terrible he had a sympathy rising under the influence of his strong faith in god into positive exultation in it in my distress i called upon the lord and cried unto my god he heard my voice out of his temple and my cry before him came into his ears then the earth shook and trembled the foundations also of the mountains moved and were shaken because he was wroth there went up a smoke out of his nostrils and fire out of his mouth devoured coals were kindled by it he bowed the heavens also and came down and thick darkness was under his feet and he rode upon a cherub and did fly yea he flew swiftly upon the wings of the wind he made darkness his hiding place his pavilion round about him darkness of waters thick clouds of the skies at the brightness before him his thick clouds passed hailstones and coals of fire the lord also thundered in the heavens and the most high uttered his voice hailstones and coals of fire and he sent out his arrows and scattered them yea lightnings manifold and discomfited them then the channels of waters appeared and the foundations of the world were laid bare at thy rebuke o lord at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils he sent from on high he took me he drew me out of many waters he delivered me from my strong enemy and from them that hated me for they were too mighty for me two other passages point to the circulation of water vapour upward from the earth before its descent as rain one in the prophecy of jeremiah the other almost identical with it in psalm cxxxv 7 when he uttereth his voice there is a tumult of waters in the heavens and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth he maketh lightnings for the rain and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasuries here we get a hint of a close observing of nature among the hebrews for by the foreshortening that clouds undergo in the distance they inevitably appear to form chiefly on the horizon at the ends of the earth whence they move upwards towards the zenith a further reference to clouds reveals not observation only but acute reflection though it leaves the mystery without solution dost thou know the balancings of the clouds the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge there is a deep mystery here which science is far from having completely solved how it is that the clouds float each in its own place at its own level each perfectly balanced in the thin air that mist which lies in the morning so softly in the valley level and white through which the tops of the trees rise as if through an inundationwhy is it so heavy and why does it lie so low being yet so thin and frail that it will melt away utterly into splendour of morning when the sun has shone on it but a few moments more those colossal pyramids huge and firm with outlines as of rocks and strength to bear the beating of the high sun full on their fiery flankswhy are they so lighttheir bases high over our heads high over the heads of alps why will these melt away not as the sun rises but as he descends and leave the stars of twilight clear while the valley vapour gains again upon the earth like a shroud461 the fact of the balancing has been brought home to us during the past hundred years very vividly by the progress of arial navigation balloons are objects too familiar even to our children to cause them any surprise and every one knows how instantly a balloon when in the air rises up higher if a few pounds of ballast are thrown out or sinks if a little of the gas is allowed to escape we know of no balancing more delicate than this of a body floating in the air illustration cirrus from south kensington 1906 may 29 illustration cumuli from tunbridge wells 1906 may 20 photographs of clouds taken by dr w j s lockyer dost thou know the balancing of the clouds the spreadings of the clouds mentioned by elihu are of the same nature as their balancings but the expression is less remarkable the spreading is a thing manifest to all but it required the mind both of a poet and a man of science to appreciate that such spreading involved a delicate poising of each cloud in its place the heavy rain which fell at the time of the deluge is indeed spoken of as if it were water let out of a reservoir by its floodgatesthe windows of heaven were opened but it seems to show some dulness on the part of an objector to argue that this expression involves the idea of a literal stone built reservoir with its sluices those who have actually seen tropical rain in full violence will find the scriptural phrase not merely appropriate but almost inevitable the rain does indeed fall like hitherto pentup waters rushing forth at the opening of a sluice and it seems unreasonable to try to place too literal an interpretation upon so suitable a simile there is the less reason to insist upon this very matteroffact rendering of the windows of heaven that in two out of the three connections in which it occurs the expression is certainly used metaphorically on the occasion of the famine in the city of samaria elisha prophesied that tomorrow about this time shall a measure of fine flour be sold for a shekel and two measures of barley for a shekel in the gate of samaria then a lord on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of god and said behold if the lord would make windows in heaven might this thing be so again malachi exhorted the jews after the return from babylon bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse that there may be meat in mine house and prove me now herewith saith the lord of hosts if i will not open you the windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive it in neither case can the windows of heaven have been meant by the speaker to convey the idea of the sluicegates of an actual solidlybuilt reservoir in the sky one other cloud facttheir dissipation as the sun rises high in the heavensis noticed in one of the most tender and pathetic passages in all the prophetic scriptures the lord by the mouth of hosea is mourning over the instability of his people o ephraim what shall i do unto thee o judah what shall i do unto thee for your goodness is as a morning cloud and as the early dew it goeth away the winds of heaven were considered as four in number corresponding to our own four cardinal points thus the great horn of daniels hegoat was broken and succeeded by four notable horns toward the four winds of heaven as the empire of alexander the great was divided amongst his four generals in ezekiels vision of the dry bones the prophet prays come from the four winds o breath and breathe upon these slain and jeremiah foretells that the four winds from the four quarters of heaven shall be brought upon elam and scatter its outcasts into every nation the circulation of the winds is clearly set forth by the preacher in the book of ecclesiastes the wind goeth toward the south and turneth about unto the north it whirleth about continually and the wind returneth again according to his circuits of the four quarters the hebrews reckoned the east as first it was to the east that they supposed themselves always looking the chief word for east therefore kedem means that which is before the front and the word next in use is naturally mizrach the rising of the sun the west is as naturally mebo hasshemesh the going down of the sun but as the mediterranean sea lay to the westward of palestine the sea yam is frequently put instead of that point of the compass with the east in front the south becomes the right and the north the left the south also was negeb the desert since the desert shut in palestine to the south as the sea to the west in opposition to tsaphon the dark or hidden north the south is darom the bright and sunny region the phrase four corners of the earth does not imply that the hebrews thought of the earth as square several expressions on the contrary show that they thought of it as circular the lord sitteth upon the circle of the earth and in another passage the same form is applied to the ocean he set a compass margin circle upon the face of the depth this circle is no doubt the circle of the visible horizon within which earth and sea are spread out apparently as a plain above it the vault of heaven job xxii 14 rv margin is arched there does not appear to be allusion anywhere in scripture to the spherical form of the earth the hebrew knowledge of the extent of the terrestrial plain was of course very limited but it would seem that like many other nations of antiquity they supposed that the ocean occupied the outer part of the circle surrounding the land which was in the centre this may be inferred from jobs statement he hath described a boundary upon the face of the waters unto the confines of light and darkness the boundary of the world is represented as being described or more properly circumscribed drawn as a circle upon the ocean this ocean is considered as essentially one exactly as by actual exploration we now know it to belet the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one placeall the oceans and seas communicate beneath the earth there are the waters the lord hath founded the world upon the seas and established it upon the floods and psalm cxxxvi 6 stretched out the earth above the waters this for the most part means simply that the water surface lies lower than the land surface but there are watersother than those of the oceanwhich are in a strict sense beneath the earth the subterranean waters which though in the very substance of the earth and existing there in an altogether different way from the great masses of water we see upon the surface form a water system which may legitimately be termed a kind of ocean underground from these subterranean waters our springs issue forth and it is these waters we tap in our wells of the cedar in lebanon ezekiel spoke the waters made him great the deep set him up on high with her rivers running round about his plants and sent out her little rivers margin conduits unto all the trees of the field the deep tehom applies therefore not merely to the restless waters of the ocean but to these unseen waters as well and means not merely surging waters but depths of any kind when in the great deluge the floodgates of heaven were opened these fountains of the great deep were broken up as well and later both fountains and windows were stopped so the lord asks job hast thou entered into the springs of the sea or hast thou walked in the search of the depth and in proverbs it is said of the lord by his knowledge the depths are broken up and the clouds drop down the dew the tides upon the seacoast of palestine are very slight but some have seen a reference to them in jer v 22 where the lord says i have placed the sand for the bound of the sea by a perpetual decree that it cannot pass it and though the waves thereof toss themselves yet can they not prevail though they roar yet can they not pass over it more probably the idea to be conveyed is merely that of the restraint of the sea to its proper basin as in the passage where the lord asks job who shut up the sea with doors when it brake forth as if it had issued out of the womb and the writer of proverbs sums all up when he prepared the heavens i wisdom was there when he set a compass upon the face of the depth when he established the clouds above when he strengthened the fountains of the deep when he gave to the sea his decree that the waters should not pass his commandment when he appointed the foundations of the earth footnotes 411 astronomy in the old testament p 33 note 431 astronomy in the old testament p 32 461 ruskin modern painters part vii chap i chapter v the ordinances of the heavens as has been already pointed out the astronomical references in scripture are not numerous and probably give but an inadequate idea of the actual degree of progress attained by the hebrews in astronomical science yet it is clear even from the record which we have that there was one great astronomical fact which they had observed and that it had made a deep impression upon them that fact was the sublime order of the heavenly movements first amongst these was the order of the daily progress of the sun rising in the east and moving slowly majestically and resistlessly upward to the meridianthe midst or bisection of heaven of josh x 13and then passing downwards as smoothly and unfalteringly to his setting in the west this motion of the sun inspires the simile employed by the psalmist in the astronomical psalm the nineteenth he sings the heavens declare the glory of god in them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber and rejoiceth as a strong man to run his course his going forth is from the end of the heaven and his circuit unto the ends of it and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof the night revealed another order in its way more majestic still as the twilight faded away the bright and silent watchers of the heavens mustered each in his place and each like the sun during the day was moving slowly majestically resistlessly without haste without rest each had its appointed place its appointed path some moved in small circles in the north some rose in the east and swept in long curves over towards their setting in the west some scarcely lifted themselves above the southern horizon but each one kept its own place none jostled another or hurried in advance or lagged behind it is no wonder that as the multitude of the stars was observed and the unbroken order of their going that the simile suggested itself of an army on the marchthe host of heaven and the sight of the unbroken order of these bright celestial orbs suggested a comparison with the unseen army of exalted beings the angels the army or host of heaven in another sense marshalled like the stars in perfect obedience to the divine will so in the vision of micaiah the son of imlah the host of heaven are the thousands of attendant spirits waiting around the throne of god to fulfil his bidding i saw the lord sitting on his throne and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left but more frequently it is the starry not the angelic army to which reference is made so jeremiah prophesies as the host of heaven cannot be numbered neither the sand of the sea measured so will i multiply the seed of david my servant and the levites that minister unto me the prophets of israel recognized clearly that the starry host of heaven and the angelic host were distinct that the first in their brightness order and obedience formed fitting comparison for the second but that both were created beings neither were divinities the heathen nations around recognized also the hosts both of the stars and of spiritual beings but the first they took as the manifestations of the second whom they counted as divinities there was often a great confusion between the two and the observance or worship of the first could not be kept distinguished from the recognition or worship of the other the very ideogram for a god was an 8rayed star the hebrews were warned again and again lest confusing in their minds these two great hosts of stars and angels they should deem the one the divine manifestation of the other the divinity not accounting them both fellowservants the handiwork of god thus in the wilderness the lord commands them through moses take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven and when thou seest the sun and the moon and the stars even all the host of heaven shouldest be driven to worship them and serve them which the lord thy god hath divided distributed unto all nations under the whole heaven but the one celestial army continually suggests the other and the two are placed in the closest parallelism when reference is made to the time when the foundations of the earth were fastened and the corner stone thereof was laid when the morning stars sang together and all the sons of god shouted for joy so when deborah sings of the deliverance which the lord gave to israel at the battle of the kishon she puts the stars for the angelic legions that she feels assured were engaged in warring in their support they fought from heaven the stars in their courses fought against sisera the courses of the stars are the paths which they appear to follow as they move round the pole of the heavens as the night proceeds whilst the stars themselves stand for the heavenly helpers who unseen had mingled in the battle and discomforted the squadrons of siseras warchariots it almost reads as if to deborah had been vouchsafed such a vision as elisha prayed might be given to his servant therefore sent the king of syria thither horses and chariots and a great host and they came by night and compassed the city about and when the servant of the man of god was risen early and gone forth behold an host compassed the city both with horses and chariots and his servant said unto him alas my master how shall we do and he answered fear not for they that be with us are more than they that be with them and elisha prayed and said lord i pray thee open his eyes that he may see and the lord opened the eyes of the young man and he saw and behold the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about elisha the solemn procession of the starry host through the long nightthe rising in the east the southing and the setting in the westis not the only ordered movement of the stars of heaven that may be recognized as night by night brightens to its dawn if we watch the eastern horizon and note what stars are the last to rise above it before the growing daylight overpowers the feeble stellar rays then we see that some bright star invisible on the preceding mornings shines out for a few moments low down in the glimmer of the dawn as morning succeeds morning it rises earlier until at last it mounts when it is yet dark and some other star takes its place as the herald of the rising sun we recognize today this heliacal rising of the stars though we do not make use of it in our system of timemeasuring it played an important part in the calendarmaking of the ancients such heralds of the rising sun were called morning stars by the hebrews and they used them for seasons and for years one star or constellation of stars would herald by its heliacal rising the beginning of spring another the coming of winter the time to plough the time to sow the time of the rains would all be indicated by the successive morning stars as they appeared and after an interval of three hundred and sixtyfive or three hundred and sixtysix days the same star would again show itself as a morning star for a second time marking out the year whilst the other morning stars would follow each in its due season so we read in job that god led forth the mazzaroth in their season this wonderful procession of the midnight sky is not known and admired by those who live in walled cities and ceiled houses as it is by those who live in the open in the wilderness it is not therefore to be wondered at that we find praise of these works of the lord sought out of all them that have pleasure therein mostly amongst the shepherds the herdsmen the wanderers in the openin the words and prophecies of job of jacob moses david and amos the thought that each new day beginning with a new outburst of light was in its degree a kind of new creation an emblem of the original act by which the world was brought into being renders appropriate and beautiful the ascription of the term morning stars to those sons of god the angels as the stars in the eastern sky are poetically thought of as singing together to herald the creation of each new day so in the verses already quoted from the book of job the angels of god are represented as shouting for joy when the foundations of the earth were laid the morning star again stands as the type and earnest of that new creation which god has promised to his servants the epistle to thyatira concludes with the promisehe that overcometh and keepeth my works unto the end i will give him the morning star the brightest of these heralds of the sun is the planet venus and such a morning star for power glory and magnificence the king of babylon had once been like one of the angels of god but as addressed in isaiahs prophecy he has been brought down to sheol how art thou fallen from heaven o lucifer son of the morning for thou hast said in thine heart i will ascend into heaven i will exalt my throne above the stars of god i will ascend above the heights of the clouds i will be like the most high but the morning star is taken as a higher type even of our lord himself and of his future coming in glory st peter bids the disciples to whom he writes take heed unto the word of prophecy as unto a lamp shining in a dark place until the day dawn and the day star arise in your hearts in almost the last words of the bible the lord uses the same image himself i jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches i am the root and the offspring of david the bright and morning star in the sublime and ordered movements of the various heavenly bodies the hebrews recognized the ordinances of god the point of view always taken in scripture is the theocentric one the relation sought to be brought out is not the relation of thing to thingwhich is the objective of physical sciencebut the relation of creature to creator we have no means of knowing whether they made attempt to find any mechanical explanation of the movements such inquiry would lie entirely outside the scope of the books of holy scripture and other ancient hebrew literature has not been transmitted to us the lesson which the psalmists and the prophets desired to teach was not the daily rotation of the earth upon its axis nor its yearly revolution round the sun but that if those ordinances depart from before me saith the lord then the seed of israel also shall cease from being a nation before me for ever in the bible all intermediate steps are omitted and the result is linked immediately to the first cause god himself is the theme and trust in him the lesson lift up your eyes on high and see who hath created these that bringeth out their host by number he calleth them all by name by the greatness of his might and for that he is strong in power not one is lacking why sayest thou o jacob and speakest o israel my way is hid from the lord and my judgment is passed away from my god hast thou not known hast thou not heard the everlasting god the lord the creator of the ends of the earth fainteth not neither is weary there is no searching of his understanding he giveth power to the faint and to him that hath no might he increaseth strength even the youths shall faint and be weary and the young men shall utterly fall but they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint chapter vi the sun and god said let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth and it was so and god made two great lights the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night he made the stars also and god set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth and to rule over the day and over the night and to divide the light from the darkness and god saw that it was good and the evening and the morning were the fourth day a double purpose for the two great heavenly bodies is indicated herefirst the obvious one of giving light next that of time measurement these from the human and practical point of view are the two main services which the sun and moon render to us and naturally sufficed for the object that the writer had before him there is no evidence that he had any idea that the moon simply shone by reflecting the light of the sun still less that the sun was a light for worlds other than our own but if he had known these facts we can hardly suppose that he would have mentioned them there would have been no purpose to be served by so doing but it is remarkable that no reference is made either to the incalculable benefits conferred by the action of the sun in ripening the fruits of the earth or to the services of the moon as a timemeasurer in dividing off the months both these actions are clearly indicated later on in the scriptures where moses in the blessing which he pronounced upon the tribe of joseph prayed that his land might be blessed for the precious things of the fruits of the sun so that we may take their omission here together with the omission of all mention of the planets and the slight parenthetical reference to the stars as indicating that this chapter was composed at an exceedingly early date the chief purpose of the sun is to give light it rules or regulates the day and divides the light from the darkness as such it is the appropriate emblem of god himself who is light and in him is no darkness at all these images are frequently repeated in the scriptures and it is only possible to give a few instances david sings the lord is my light and my salvation the lord shall be unto thee an everlasting light is the promise made to zion st john expressly uses the term of the son of god our lord that was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world whilst the more concrete emblem is used as often in the eightyfourth psalm the psalm of pilgrimage we read the lord god is a sun and shield malachi predicts that the sun of righteousness shall arise with healing in his wings and st james with the same thought of the sun in his mind speaks of god as the father of lights but in none of these or the other parallel passages is there the remotest approach to any deification of the sun or even of that most ethereal of influences light itself both are creatures both are made by god they are things and things only and are not even the shrines of a deity they may be used as emblems of god in some of his attributes they do not even furnish any indication of his special presence for he is equally present where sun and light are not the darkness hideth not from thee but the night shineth as the day the darkness and the light are both alike to thee the worship of the sun and of other heavenly bodies is one of the sins most unsparingly denounced in scripture it was one of the first warnings of the book of deuteronomy that israel as a people were to take heed lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven and when thou seest the sun and the moon and the stars even all the host of heaven shouldest be driven to worship them and serve them and the utter overthrow of the nation was foretold should they break this law and as for the nation so for the individual any man or woman that hath wrought wickedness in the sight of the lord thy god in transgressing his covenant and hath gone and served other gods and worshipped them either the sun or moon or any of the host of heaven was when convicted of working such abomination unsparingly to be put to death yet with all this sunworship prevailed in israel again and again two of the reforming kings of judah asa and josiah found it necessary to take away the sunimages indeed the latter king found that the horses and chariots which his predecessors manasseh and amon had dedicated to sun worship were kept at the very entrance to the temple in spite of his reformation however the evil spread until the final corruption of jerusalem was shown in vision to ezekiel seventy men of the ancientsthat is the complete sanhedrimoffered incense to creeping things and abominable beasts the women wept for tammuz probably the sungod in his decline to winter death and deepest apostasy of all five and twenty men the highpriest and the chief priests of the twentyfour courses with their backs toward the temple of the lord and their faces toward the east and they worshipped the sun toward the east the entire nation as represented in its chief members in state society and church was apostate and its ruin followed five years more and the temple was burned and jerusalem destroyed and in captivity and exile the nation learned to abhor the idolatry that had brought about its overthrow four words are translated sun in our authorized version of these one used job xxxi 26 should really be light as in the marginif i beheld the light when it shinedthough the sun is obviously meant the second word is one used in poetry chiefly in conjunction with a poetical word for the moon and refers to the suns warmth as the other does to the whiteness of the moon thus the bride in the song of solomon is described as fair as the moon clear as the sun the third word has given use to some ambiguity in the eighth chapter of judges in the authorized version it is stated that gideon the son of joash returned from the battle before the sun was up but in the revised version that he returned from the battle from the ascent of heres there was a mount heres a mount of the sun in the portion of the danites held by the amorites but that cannot have been the heres of gideon still the probability is that a mount sacred to the sun is meant here as well as in the reference to the danites though heres as meaning the sun itself occurs in the story of samsons riddle for the men of the city gave him the answer to it which they had extorted from his wife before the sun heres went down shemesh the samas of the babylonians is the usual word for the sun and we find it in bethshemesh the house of the sun a levitical city within the tribe of judah the scene of the return of the ark after its captivity amongst the philistines there was another bethshemesh in naphtali on the borders of issachar and jeremiah prophesies that nebuchadnezzar shall break also the images of bethshemesh that is in the land of egypt probably the obelisks of the sun in on or heliopolis it was from this city that joseph when vizier of egypt took his wife the daughter of the high priest there the images of the sun and of baal as the sungod seem to have been obelisks or pillars of stone and hence had to be broken down whilst the asherah the groves of the authorized version the images of ashtoreth as the moongoddess were wooden pillars to be cut or hewn down another city of the sun in the land of egypt is also mentioned by isaiah in his prophecy of the conversion and restoration of the egyptians five cities in the land of egypt shall speak the language of canaan and swear to the lord of hosts one shall be called the city of destruction lit of heres or of the sun it was upon the strength of this text that onias the son of onias the high priest appealed to ptolemy philometer to be allowed to build a temple to jehovah in the prefecture of heliopolis the city of the sun and obtained his permission to do so bc 149681 the epithet applied to the sun in cant vi already quoted clear as the sun may be taken as equivalent to spotless that is its ordinary appearance to the naked eye though from time to timefar more frequently than most persons have any ideathere are spots upon the sun sufficiently large to be seen without any optical assistance thus in the twenty years from 1882 to 1901 inclusive such a phenomenon occurred on the average once in each week no reference to the existence of sunspots occurs in scripture nor is this surprising for it would not have fallen within the purpose of scripture to record such a fact but it is surprising that whilst the chinese detected their occasional appearance there is no distinct account of such an observation given either on babylonian tablets or by classical or medival writers the achievement of the chinese in this direction is very notable for the difficulty of looking directly at the sun under ordinary circumstances is so great and the very largest sunspots are so small as compared with the entire disc that it argues great perseverance in watching such appearances on the part of the chinese for them to have assured themselves that they were not due to very small distant clouds in our own atmosphere it has often been the subject of comment that light is mentioned in gen i as having been created on the first day but the sun not until the fourth the order is entirely appropriate from an astronomical point of view for we know that our sun is not the only source of light since it is but one out of millions of stars many of which greatly exceed it in splendour further most astronomers consider that our solar system existed as a luminous nebula long ages before the sun was formed as a central condensation but the true explanation of the creation of light being put first is probably thisthat there might be no imagining that though gross solid bodies like earth and sea sun and moon might require a creator yet something so ethereal and allpervading as light was selfexistent and by its own nature eternal this was a truth that needed to be stated first god is light but light is not god the other references to the sun in scripture do not call for much comment its apparent unchangeableness qualifies it for use as an expression for eternal duration as in the seventysecond the royal psalm they shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon endure and again his name shall endure for ever his name shall be continued as long as the sun and again in the eightyninth psalm it is said of david his seed shall endure for ever and his throne as the sun before me the daily course of the sun from beyond the eastern horizon to beyond the western gives the widest expression for the compass of the whole earth the mighty god even the lord hath spoken and called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof from the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same the lords name is to be praised the suns rays penetrate everywhere his going forth is from the end of the heaven and his circuit unto the ends of it and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof whilst in the book of ecclesiastes the melancholy words of the preacher revert over and over again to that which is done under the sun what profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun it should be noted that this same book of ecclesiastes shows a much clearer idea of the suns daily apparent motion than was held by many of the writers of antiquity there is of course nowhere in scripture any mention of the rotation of the earth on its axis as the mechanical explanation of the suns daily apparent motion any more than we should refer to it ourselves today except when writing from a purely technical point of view as said already the hebrews had probably not discovered this explanation and would certainly have not gone out of their way to mention it in any of their scriptures if they had one passage of great beauty has sometimes been quoted as if it contained a reference to the earths rotation but when carefully examined it is seen to be dealing simply with the apparent motion of the sun in the course of the year and of the day hast thou commanded the morning since thy days and caused the dayspring to know his place that it might take hold of the ends of the earth that the wicked might be shaken out of it it is turned as clay to the seal and they stand as a garment the earth appears to be spoken of as being turned to the sun the dayspring and this we know takes place morning by morning in consequence of the diurnal rotation but the last two lines are better rendered in the revised version it is changed as clay under the seal and all things stand forth as a garment the ancient seals were cylinders rolled over the clay which formless before took upon it the desired relief as the seal passed over it so a garment laid aside and folded up during the night is shapeless but once again takes form when the wearer puts it on and the earth formless in the darkness gains shape and colour and relief with the impress upon it of the morning light it is quite clear that the hebrews did not suppose that it was a new sun that came up from the east each morning as did xenophanes and the epicureans amongst the greeks it was the same sun throughout nor is there any idea of his hiding himself behind a mysterious mountain during the night the sun the preacher tells us ariseth and the sun goeth down and hasteth to his place where he arose the hebrew was quite aware that the earth was unsupported in space for he knew that the lord stretcheth out the north over the empty place and hangeth the earth upon nothing there was therefore nothing to hinder the sun passing freely under the earth from west to east and thus making his path not a mere march onward ending in his dissolution at sunset but a complete circuit as noted by the writer of the nineteenth psalm the fierceness of the suns heat in palestine rendered sunstroke a serious danger the little son of the shunammite was probably so smitten as he watched his father at work with the reapers so the promise is given to gods people more than once the sun shall not smite thee by day they shall not hunger nor thirst neither shall the heat nor sun smite them the martyrs who pass through the great tribulation shall hunger no more neither thirst any more neither shall the sun light on them nor any heat there are fewer references in scripture to the vivifying effects of sunlight upon vegetation than we might have expected the explanation is possibly to be found in the terrible perversion men had made of the benefits which came to them by means of this action of sunlight by using them as an excuse for plunging into all kinds of natureworship yet there are one or two allusions not without interest as already mentioned the precious fruits brought forth by the sun were promised to the tribe of joseph whilst the great modern discovery that nearly every form of terrestrial energy is derived ultimately from the energy of the suns rays gives a most striking appropriateness to the imagery made use of by st james every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and cometh down from the father of lights with whom is no variableness neither shadow of turning god that is to say is the true sun the true origin of all lights the true bestower of every good and perfect gift the word rendered variableness is a technical word used by ourselves in modern english as parallax and employed in the septuagint version to denote the revolutions of the heavenly bodies described in the thirtyeighth chapter of the book of job as the ordinances of the heavens with the natural sun therefore there is variableness that is to say real or apparent change of place there is none with god neither is there with him any darkness of eclipse any shadow caused as in the case of the material sun by the turning of earth and moon in their orbits the knowledge of the alternations of the turning of the sun described in the book of wisdom as a feature of the learning of solomon was a knowledge of the laws of this variableness and turning especially of the turning of its rising and setting points at the two solstices and st james may well have had that passage in his mind when he wrote for science deals with the knowledge of things that change as they change and of their changes but faith with the knowledge of him that abideth for ever and it is to this higher knowledge that st james wished to point his readers science deals with the knowledge of things that change as they change and of their changes the physical facts that we have learned in the last years about that changeful body the sun are briefly these its core or inner nucleus is not accessible to observation its nature and constitution being a mere matter of inference the photosphere is a shell of incandescent cloud surrounding the nucleus but the depth or thickness of this shell is quite unknown the outer surfacewhich we seeof the photosphere is certainly pretty sharply defined though very irregular rising at points into whiter aggregations called facul and perhaps depressed at other places in the dark spots immediately above the photosphere lies the reversing layer in which are found the substances which give rise to the gaps in the suns spectrumthe fraunhofer lines above the reversing layer lies the scarlet chromosphere with prominences of various forms and dimensions rising high above the solar surface and over and embracing all is the corona with its mysterious petallike forms and rodlike rays the great body of the sun is gaseous though it is impossible for us to conceive of the condition of the gaseous core subjected as it is at once to temperature and pressure both enormously great probably it is a gas so viscous that it would resist motion as pitch or putty does nor do we know much of the nature of either the sunspots or the solar corona both seem to be produced by causes which lie within the sun both undergo changes that are periodical and connected with each other they exercise some influence upon the earths magnetism but whether this influence extends to terrestrial weather to rainfall and storms is still a matter of controversy the sun itself is distant from the earth in the mean about 92885000 miles but this distance varies between january and june by 3100000 miles the diameter of the sun is 866400 miles but perhaps this is variable to the extent of some hundreds of miles it would contain 1305000 times the bulk of the earth but its mean density is but onequarter that of the earth the force of gravity at its surface is 2712 times that at the surface of the earth and it rotates on its axis in about 25 days but the suns surface does not appear to rotate as a whole so this time of rotating varies by as much as two days if we consider a region on the suns equator or at a distance from it of 45 the intensity of sunlight at the surface of the sun is about 190000 times that of a candleflame and the effective temperature of the solar surface is eight or ten thousand degrees centigrade such are some of the facts about the sun that are received or as it would be technically expressed adopted today doubtless a very few years will find them altered and rendered more accurate as observations accumulate in a few hundred years knowledge of the constitution of the sun may have so increased that these data and suggestions may seem so erroneous as to be absurd it is little more than a century since one of the greatest of astronomers sir william herschel contended that the central globe of the sun might be a habitable world sheltered from the blazing photosphere by a layer of cool nonluminous clouds such an hypothesis was not incompatible with what was then known of the constitution of the heavenly bodies though it is incompatible with what we know now it was simply a matter on which more evidence was to be accumulated and the holding of such a view does not and did not detract from the scientific status of sir william herschel the hypotheses of science require continual restatement in the light of new evidence and as to the weight and interpretation to be given to such evidence there is continual conflictif it may so be calledbetween the old and the new science between the science that is established and the science that is being established it is by this conflict that knowledge is rendered sure such a conflict took place rather more than 300 years ago at the opening of the modern era of astronomy it was a conflict between two schools of sciencebetween the disciples of aristotle and claudius ptolemy on the one hand and the disciples of copernicus on the other it has often been represented as a conflict between religion and science whereas that which happened was that the representatives of the older school of science made use of the powers of the church to persecute the newer school as represented by galileo that persecution was no doubt a flagrant abuse of authority but it should be impossible at the present day for any one to claim a theological standing for either theory whether copernican or ptolemaic so long as evidence sufficient to demonstrate the copernican hypothesis was not forthcoming it was possible for a man to hold the ptolemaic without detracting from his scientific position just as it is thought no discredit to sir william herschel that he held his curious idea of a cool sun under the conditions of knowledge of a hundred years ago even at the present day we habitually use the ptolemaic phraseology not only do we speak of sunrise and sunset but astronomers in strictly technical papers use the expression acceleration of the suns motion when acceleration of the earths motion is meant the question as to whether the earth goes round the sun or the sun goes round the earth has been decided by the accumulation of evidence it was a question for evidence to decide it was an open question so long as the evidence available was not sufficient to decide it it was perfectly possible at one time for a scientific or a religious man to hold either view neither view interfered with his fundamental standing or with his mental attitude towards either sun or earth in this respectimportant as the question is in itselfit might be said to be a mere detail almost a matter of indifference but it is not a mere detail a matter of indifference to either scientist or religious man as to what the sun and earth arewhether he can treat them as things that can be weighed measured compared analyzed as a few pages back we have shown has been done or whether as one of the chief astrologers of today puts it he believes that the sun is the body of the logos of this solar system in him we live and move and have our being the planets are his angels being modifications in the consciousness of the logos and that the sun stands as power having love and will united the difference between these two points of view is fundamental and one of root principle the foundation the common foundation on which both the believer and the scientist build is threatened by this false science and false religion the calling the very existence of both is assailed and they must stand or fall together the believer in one god cannot acknowledge a sungod a solar logos these planetary angels the astronomer cannot admit the intrusion of planetary influences that obey no known laws and the supposed effects of which are in no way proportional to the supposed causes the law of causality does not run within the borders of astrology it is the old antithesis restated of the hebrew and the heathen the believer in one god and the scientist alike derive their heritage from the hebrew whilst the modern astrologer claims that the astrology of today is once more a revelation of the chaldean and assyrian religions but polytheismwhether in its gross form of many gods of planetary angels or in the more subtle form of pantheismis the very negation of sane religion and astrology is the negation of sane astronomy for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even his eternal power and godhead so that they are without excuse because that when they knew god they glorified him not as god neither were thankful but became vain in their imaginations and their foolish heart was darkened professing themselves to be wise they became fools and changed the glory of the uncorruptible god into an image made like to corruptible man and to birds and fourfooted beasts and creeping things footnotes 681 josephus antiquities xiii iii 1 chapter vii the moon the balmy moon of blessed israel floods all the deepblue gloom with beams divine all night the splintered crags that wall the dell with spires of silver shine so in tennysons words sang jephthahs daughter as she recalled the days of her mourning before she accomplished her selfsacrifice it is hard for modern dwellers in towns to realize the immense importance of the moon to the people of old the night cometh when no man can work fitly describes their condition when she was absent in subtropical countries like palestine twilight is short and the sun once set deep darkness soon covers everything such artificial lights as men then had would now be deemed very inefficient there was little opportunity when once darkness had fallen for either work or enjoyment but when the moon was up how very different was the case then men might say this night methinks is but the daylight sick it looks a little paler tis a day such as the day is when the sun is hid in the long moonlit nights travelling was easy and safe the labours of the field and house could still be carried on the friendly feast need not be interrupted but of all men the shepherd would most rejoice at this season all his toils all his dangers were immeasurably lightened during the nights near the full as in the beautiful rendering which tennyson has given us of one of the finest passages in the iliad in heaven the stars about the moon look beautiful when all the winds are laid and every height comes out and jutting peak and valley and the immeasurable heavens break open to their highest and all the stars shine and the shepherd gladdens in his heart a large proportion of the people of israel long after their settlement in palestine maintained the habits of their forefathers and led the shepherds life to them therefore the full of the moon must have been of special importance yet there is no single reference in scripture to this phase as such nor indeed to any change of the moons apparent figure in two cases in our revised version we do indeed find the expression at the full moon but if we compare these passages with the authorized version we find them there rendered in the time appointed or at the day appointed this latter appears to be the literal meaning though there can be no question as is seen by a comparison with the syriac that the period of the full moon is referred to no doubt it was because travelling was so much more safe and easy than in the moonless nights that the two great spring and autumn festivals of the jews were held at the full moon indeed the latter feast when the israelites camped out for a week in booths was held at the time of the harvest moon the phenomenon of the harvest moon may be briefly explained as follows at the autumnal equinox when the sun is crossing from the north side of the equator to the south the full moon is crossing from the south side of the equator to the north it is thus higher in the sky when it souths on each succeeding night and is therefore up for a greater length of time this counterbalances to a considerable extent its movement eastward amongst the stars so that for several nights in succession it rises almost at sundown these nights of the feast of tabernacles when all israel was rejoicing over the ingathered fruits each family in its tent or arbour of green boughs were therefore the fullest of moonlight in the year811 modern civilization has almost shut us off from the heavens at least in our great towns and cities these offer many conveniences but they remove us from not a few of the beauties which nature has to offer and so it comes that taking the population as a whole there is perhaps less practically known of astronomy in england today than there was under the plantagenets a very few are astronomers professional and amateur and know immeasurably more than our forefathers did of the science then there is a large more or less cultured public that know something of the science at secondhand through books but the great majority know nothing of the heavenly bodies except of the sun they need to look in the almanack to find out moonshine but to simpler peoples the difference between the light half of the month from the first quarter to the last quarter through the full of the moon and the dark half from the last quarter to the first quarter through new is very great indian astronomers so divide the month to this day in one passage of holy scripture the description which isaiah gives of the city of the lord the zion of the holy one of israel there is a reference to the dark part of the month thy sun shall no more go down neither shall thy moon literally month withdraw itself for the lord shall be thine everlasting light and the days of thy mourning shall be ended the parallelism expressed in the verse lies between the darkness of night whilst the sun is below the horizon and the special darkness of those nights when the moon being near conjunction with the sun is absent from the sky during the greater part or whole of the night hours and has but a small portion of her disc illuminated just as half the day is dark because the sun has withdrawn itself so half the nights of the month are dark because the moon has withdrawn itself the hebrew month was a natural one determined by actual observation of the new moon they used three words in their references to the moon the first of which chodesh derived from a root meaning to be new indicates the fact that the new moon as actually observed governed their calendar the word therefore signifies the new moonthe day of the new moon and thus a month that is a lunar month beginning at the new moon this is the hebrew word used in the deluge story in the seventh chapter of genesis and in all references to feasts depending on a day in the month as when the lord spake to moses saying also in the day of your gladness and in your solemn days and in the beginnings of your months ye shall blow with your trumpets over your burnt offerings and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings and again in the psalm of asaph to the chief musician upon gittith blow up the trumpet in the new moon in the time appointed on our solemn feast day this is the word also that isaiah uses in describing the bravery of the daughters of zion the tinkling ornaments about their feet and their cauls and their round tires like the moon the chains and the bracelets the round tires were not discs like the full moon but were round like the crescent generally speaking chodesh is employed where either reference is made to the shape or newness of the crescent moon or where month is used in any precise way this is the word for month employed throughout by the prophet ezekiel who is so precise in the dating of his prophecies when the moon is mentioned as the lesser light of heaven without particular reference to its form or when a month is mentioned as a somewhat indefinite period of time then the hebrew word yareach is used here the word has the root meaning of paleness it is the silver moon yareach is the word always used where the moon is classed among the heavenly bodies as when joseph dreamed of the sun the moon and the eleven constellations or in jer viii 2 where the lord says that they shall bring out the bones of the kings princes priests prophets and inhabitants of jerusalem and they shall spread them before the sun and the moon and all the host of heaven whom they have loved and whom they have served and after whom they have walked and whom they have sought and whom they have worshipped the same word is used for the moon in its character of making ordinances thus we have it several times in the psalms he the lord appointed the moon for seasons his seed shall endure for ever and his throne as the sun before me it shall be established for ever as the moon and as a faithful witness in heaven and again the moon and stars rule by night whilst jeremiah says thus saith the lord which giveth the sun for a light by day and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night in all passages where reference seems to be made to the darkening or withdrawing of the moons light eccl xii 2 isa xiii 10 ezek xxxii 7 joel ii 10 31 and iii 15 and hab iii 11 the word yareach is employed a slight variant of the same word indicates the month when viewed as a period of time not quite defined and not in the strict sense of a lunar month this is the term used in exod ii 2 for the three months that the mother of moses hid him when she saw that he was a goodly child by moses in his prophecy for joseph of blessed of the lord be his land for the precious fruits brought forth by the sun and for the precious things put forth by the months such a full month of days did shallum the son of jabesh reign in samaria in the nine and thirtieth year of uzziah king of judah such also were the twelve months of warning given to nebuchadnezzar king of babylon before his madness fell upon him the same word is once used for a true lunar month viz in ezra vi 15 when the building of the house was finished on the third day of the month adar which was in the sixth year of the reign of darius the king in all other references to the months derived from the babylonians such as the month chisleu in neh i 1 the term chodesh is used since these like the hebrew months were defined by the observation of the new moon but for the tyrian months zif bul ethanim we find the term yerach in three out of the four instances in three instances a third word is used poetically to express the moon this is lebanah which has the meaning of whiteness in song of sol vi 10 it is asked who is she that looketh forth as the morning fair as the moon clear as the sun and terrible as an army with banners isaiah also says then the moon shall be confounded and the sun ashamed when the lord of hosts shall reign in mount zion and in jerusalem and before his ancients gloriously and yet again moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold as the light of seven days in the day that the lord bindeth up the breach of his people and healeth the stroke of their wound it may not be without significance that each of these three passages wherein the moon is denominated by its name of whiteness or purity looks forward prophetically to the same great event pictured yet more clearly in the revelation and i heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and as the voice of many waters and as the voice of mighty thunderings saying alleluia for the lord god omnipotent reigneth let us be glad and rejoice and give honour to him for the marriage of the lamb is come and his wife hath made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints chodesh and yareach are masculine words lebanah is feminine but nowhere throughout the old testament is the moon personified and in only one instance is it used figuratively to represent a person this is in the case of jacobs reading of josephs dream already referred to where he said behold i have dreamed a dream more and behold the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me and his father quickly rebuked him saying what is this dream that thou hast dreamed shall i and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth here jacob understands that the moon yareach stands for a woman his wife but in mesopotamia whence his grandfather abraham had come out sin the moongod was held to be a male god high indeed among the deities at that time and superior even to samas the sungod terah the father of abraham was held by jewish tradition to have been an especial worshipper of the moongod whose great temple was in haran where he dwelt wherever the land of uz may have been at whatever period job may have lived there and then it was an iniquity to worship the moon or the moongod in his final defence to his friends when the three men ceased to answer job because he was righteous in his own eyes job justifying his life said if i beheld the sun when it shined or the moon walking in brightness and my heart hath been secretly enticed and my mouth hath kissed my hand this also were an iniquity to be punished by the judges for i should have lied to god that is above the hebrews too were forbidden to worship the sun the moon or the stars the host of heaven and disobeyed the commandment both early and late in their history when moses spake unto all israel on this side jordan in the wilderness in the plain over against the red sea he said to them the lord spake unto you out of the midst of the fire ye heard the voice of the words but saw no similitude only ye heard a voice take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves for ye saw no manner of similitude on the day that the lord spake unto you in horeb out of the midst of the fire lest ye corrupt yourselves and make you a graven image the similitude of any figure the likeness of male or female and lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven and when thou seest the sun and the moon and the stars even all the host of heaven shouldst be driven to worship them and serve them which the lord thy god hath divided unto all nations under the whole heaven we know what the similitude of the sun and the moon were like among the surrounding nations we see their hieroglyphs on numberless seals and images from the ruins of nineveh or babylon that of the sun was first a rayed star or disc later a figure rayed and winged that of the moon was a crescent one lying on its back like a bowl or cup the actual attitude of the new moon at the beginning of the new year just such moon similitudes did the soldiers of gideon take from off the camels of zebah and zalmunna just such were the round tires like the moon that isaiah condemns among the bravery of the daughters of zion the similitude or token of ashtoreth the paramount goddess of the zidonians was the ashera the grove of the authorized version probably in most cases merely a wooden pillar this goddess the abomination of the zidonians was a moongoddess concerning whom eusebius preserves a statement by the phoenician historian sanchoniathon that her images had the head of an ox in the wars in the days of abraham we find chedorlaomer and the kings that were with him smiting the rephaim in ashteroth karnaim that is in the ashtoreths of the horns it is impossible to decide at this date whether the horns which gave the distinctive title to this shrine of ashtoreth owed their origin to the horns of the animal merged in the goddess or to the horns of the crescent moon with which she was to some extent identified possibly there was always a confusion between the two in the minds of her worshippers the cult of ashtoreth was spread not only among the hebrews but throughout the whole plain of mesopotamia in the times of the judges and in the days of samuel we find continually the statement that the people served baalim and ashtaroththe plurals of baal and ashtoreththese representing the sun and moon and reigning as king and queen in heaven when the philistines fought with saul at mount gilboa and he was slain they stripped off his armour and put it in the house of ashtaroth yet later we find that solomon loved strange women of the zidonians who turned his heart after ashtoreth the goddess of the zidonians and he built a high place for her on the right hand of the mount of olives which remained for some three and a half centuries until josiah the king defiled it nevertheless the worship of ashtoreth continued and the prophet jeremiah describes her cult the children gather wood and the fathers kindle the fire and the women knead their dough to make cakes to the queen of heaven this was done in the cities of judah and streets of jerusalem but the jews carried the cult with them even when they fled into egypt and whilst there they answered jeremiah we will certainly do whatsoever thing goeth forth out of our own mouth to burn incense unto the queen of heaven and to pour out drink offerings unto her as we have done we and our fathers our kings and our princes in the cities of judah and in the streets of jerusalem for then had we plenty of victuals and were well and saw no evil but since we left off to burn incense to the queen of heaven and to pour out drink offerings unto her we have wanted all things and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine ashtoreth according to pinches901 is evidently a lengthening of the name of the assyriobabylonian goddess ivstar and the babylonian legend of the descent of ivstar may well have been a myth founded on the varying phases of the moon but it must be remembered that though ashtoreth or ivstar might be the queen of heaven the moon was not necessarily the only aspect in which her worshippers recognized her in others the planet venus may have been chosen as her representative in others the constellation taurus at one time the leader of the zodiac in others yet again the actual form of a material bull or cow the hebrews recognized the great superiority in brightness of the sun over the moon as testified in their names of the greater and lesser lights and in such passages as that already quoted from isaiah xxx 26 the word here used for moon is the poetic one lebanah of course no argument can be founded on the parallelism employed so as to lead to the conclusion that the hebrews considered that the solar light exceeded the lunar by only seven times instead of the 600000 times indicated by modern photometric measurement in only one instance in scripturethat already quoted of the moon withdrawing itselfis there even an allusion to the changing phases of the moon other than that implied in the frequent references to the new moons the appointment of certain feasts to be held on the fifteenth day of the month is a confirmation of the supposition that their months were truly lunar for then the moon is fully lighted and rides the sky the whole night long from sunset to sunrise it is clear therefore that the hebrews not only noticed the phases of the moon but made regular use of them yet if we adopted the argument from silence we should suppose that they had never observed its changes of shape for there is no direct allusion to them in scripture we cannot therefore argue from silence as to whether or no they had divined the cause of those changes namely that the moon shines by reflecting the light of the sun nor are there any references to the markings on the moon it is quite obvious to the naked eye that there are grey stains upon her silver surface that these grey stains are always there most of them forming a chain which curves through the upper hemisphere of the bright parts of the moon some shine out with greater lustre than others particularly one spot in the lower lefthand quadrant not far from the edge of the full disc the edges of the moon gleam more brightly as a rule than the central parts all this was apparent to the hebrews of old as it is to our unassisted sight today the moons influence in raising the tides is naturally not mentioned the hebrews were not a seafaring race nor are the tides on the coast of palestine pronounced enough to draw much attention one influence is ascribed to the moon an influence still obscure or even disputed for the promise that the sun shall not smite thee by day nor the moon by night quite obvious in its application to the sun with the moon seems to refer to its supposed influence on certain diseases and in causing moonblindness the chief function of the moon as indicated in scripture is to regulate the calendar and mark out the times for the days of solemnity in the words of the 104th psalm he god appointed the moon for seasons the sun knoweth his going down thou makest darkness and it is night wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth the young lions roar after their prey and seek their meat from god the sun ariseth they get them away and lay them down in their dens man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening o lord how manifold are thy works in wisdom hast thou made them all the earth is full of thy riches footnotes 811 how the little children must have revelled in that yearly holiday 901 t g pinches the old testament in the light of the historical records of assyria and babylonia p 278 illustration a corner of the milky way the america nebula photographed by dr max wolf at heidelberg chapter viii the stars the stars and the heaven whose host they are were used by the hebrew writers to express the superlatives of number of height and of expanse to an observer watching the heavens at any particular time and place not more than some two thousand stars are separately visible to the unassisted sight but it was evident to the hebrew as it is to any one today that the stars separately visible do not by any means make up their whole number on clear nights the whole vault of heaven seems covered with a tapestry or curtain the pattern of which is formed of patches of various intensities of light and sprinkled upon this patterned curtain are the brighter stars that may be separately seen the most striking feature in the pattern is the milky way and it may be easily discerned that its texture is made up of innumerable minute points of light a granulation of which some of the grains are set more closely together forming the more brilliant patches and some more loosely giving the darker shades the mind easily conceives that the minute points of light whose aggregations make up the varying pattern of the milky way though too small to be individually seen are also stars differing perhaps from the stars of the pleiades or the bears only in their greater distance or smaller size it was of all these that the lord said to abram look now toward heaven and tell the stars if thou be able to number them and he said unto him so shall thy seed be the first catalogue of the stars of which we have record was that of hipparchus in 129 bc it contained 1025 stars and ptolemy brought this catalogue up to date in the almagest of 137 ad tycho brah in 1602 made a catalogue of 777 stars and kepler republished this in 1627 and increased the number to 1005 these were before the invention of the telescope and consequently contained only nakedeye stars since astronomers have been able to sound the heavens more deeply catalogues have increased in size and number flamsteed the first astronomer royal made one of 3310 stars from the observations of bradley the third a yet more famous catalogue has been compiled in our own day more than three hundred thousand stars have been catalogued in the bonn durchmusterung and the great international photographic chart of the heavens will probably show not less than fifty millions of stars and in this it has limited itself to stars exceeding the fourteenth magnitude in brightness thus leaving out of its pages many millions of stars that are visible through our more powerful telescopes so when abraham moses job or jeremiah speaks of the host of heaven that cannot be numbered it does not mean simply that these men had but small powers of numeration to uswho can count beyond that which we can conceiveas to the psalmist it is a sign of infinite power wisdom and knowledge that he telleth the number of the stars he calleth them all by their names isaiah describes the lord as he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in and many others of the prophets use the same simile of a curtain which we have seen to be so appropriate to the appearance of the starry sky nowhere however have we any indication whether or not they considered the stars were all set on this curtain that is to say were all at the same distance from us we now know that they are not equidistant from us but this we largely base on the fact that the stars are of very different orders of brightness and we judge that on an average the fainter a star appears the further is it distant from us to the hebrews as to us it was evident that the stars differ in magnitude and the writer of the epistle to the corinthians expressed this when he wrote there is one glory of the sun and another glory of the moon and another glory of the stars for one star differeth from another star in glory the ancient greek astronomers divided the stars according to their brightness into six classes or six magnitudes to use the modern technical term the average star of any particular magnitude gives about two and a half times as much light as the average star of the next magnitude more exactly the average first magnitude star gives one hundred times the light of the average star of the sixth magnitude in a few instances we have been able to measure in the very roughest degree the distances of stars not a hundred stars have their parallaxes known and these have all been measured in the course of the last century and so far away are these stars even the nearest of them that we do not express their distance from us in millions of miles we express it in the time that their light takes in travelling from them to us now it takes light only one second to traverse 186300 miles and yet it requires four and a third years for the light from the nearest star to reach us this is a star of the first magnitude alpha in the constellation of the centaur the next nearest star is a faint one of between the seventh and eighth magnitudes and its light takes seven years to come from a sixth magnitude star in the constellation of the swan the light requires eight years and from sirius the brightest star in the heavens light requires eight and a half years these four stars are the nearest to us from no other star that we know of does light take less than ten years to travel from the majority of those whose distance we have succeeded in measuring the light takes at least twenty years to get some conception of what a lightyear means let us remember that light could travel right round the earth at its equator seven times in the space of a single second and that there are 31556925 seconds in a year light then could girdle the earth a thousand million times whilst it comes from alpha centauri or we may put it another way the distance from alpha centauri exceeds the equator of the earth by as much as this exceeds an inch and a half or by as much as the distance from london to manchester exceeds the hundredth of an inch of all the rest of the innumerable stars as far as actual measurement is concerned for us as for the hebrews they might all actually lie on the texture of a curtain at practically the same distance from us we have measured the distances of but a very few stars the restas every one of them was for the hebreware at a greater distance than any effort of ours can reach be our telescopes ever so great and powerful our measuring instruments ever so precise and delicate for them as for us the heaven of stars is for height for a height which is beyond measure and therefore the only fitting image for the immensity of god so zophar the naamathite said canst thou find out the almighty unto perfection it is as high as heaven what canst thou do and eliphaz the temanite reiterated still more strongly is not god in the height of heaven and behold the height of the stars how high they are god himself is represented as using the expanse of heaven as a measure of the greatness of his fidelity and mercy the prophet jeremiah writes thus saith the lord if heaven above can be measured and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath i will also cast off all the seed of israel for all that they have done saith the lord as if he were using the figure of a great cross whose height was that of the heavens whose arms stretched from east to west david testifies of the same mercy and forgiveness for as the heaven is high above the earth so great is his mercy toward them that fear him as far as the east is from the west so far hath he removed our transgressions from us illustration the great comet of 1843 running like a road through the constellations see p 105 chapter ix comets great comets are almost always unexpected visitors there is only one great comet that we know has been seen more than once and expect with reasonable certainty to see again this is halleys comet which has been returning to a near approach to the sun at somewhat irregular intervals of seventyfive to seventyeight years during the last centuries indeed it is possible that it was this comet that was coincident with the invasion of england by william the conqueror there are other small comets that are also regular inhabitants of the solar system but as with halleys comet so with these two circumstances are to be borne in mind first that each successive revolution round the sun involves an increasing degradation of their brightness since there is a manifest waste of their material at each near approach to the sun until at length the comet is seen no more not because it has left the warm precincts of the sun for the outer darkness but because it has spent its substance halleys comet was not as brilliant or as impressive in 1835 as it was in 1759 in 1910 it may have become degraded to an appearance of quite the second order next we have no knowledge no evidence that any of these comets have always been members of the solar family some of them indeed we know were adopted into it by the influence of one or other of the greater planets uranus we know is responsible for the introduction of one jupiter of a considerable number the vast majority of comets great or small seem to blunder into the solar system anyhow anywhere from any direction they come within the attractive influence of the sun obey his laws whilst within that influence make one close approach to him passing rapidly across our sky and then depart in an orbit which will never bring them to his neighbourhood again some chance of direction some compelling influence of a planet that it may have approached so modified the path of halleys comet when it first entered the solar system that it has remained a member ever since and may so remain until it has ceased to be a comet at all it follows therefore that as to the number of great comets that may be seen in any age we can scarcely even apply the laws of probability during the last couple of thousand years since chronicles have been abundant we know that many great comets have been seen we may suppose therefore that during the preceding age that in which the scriptures were written there were also many great comets seen but we do not know and most emphatically we are not able to say from our knowledge of comets themselves and of their motions that in the days of this or that writer a comet was flaming in the sky if a comet had been observed in those ages we might not recognize the description of it thus in the fourth year of the 101st olympiad the greeks were startled by a celestial portent they did not draw fine distinctions and posterity might have remained ignorant that the terrifying object was possibly a comet had not aristotle who saw it as a boy at stagira left a rather more scientifically worded description of it it flared up from the sunset sky with a narrow definite tail running like a road through the constellations in recent times the great comet of 1843 may be mentioned as having exactly such an appearance so we cannot expect to find in the scriptures definite and precise descriptions that we can recognize as those of comets at the most we may find some expressions some descriptions that to us may seem appropriate to the forms and appearances of these objects and we may therefore infer that the appearance of a comet may have suggested these descriptions or expressions the head of a great comet is brilliant sometimes starlike but its tail often takes on the most impressive appearance donatis comet in 1858 assumed the most varied shapessometimes its tail was broad with one bright and curving edge the other fainter and finer the whole making up a stupendous semicircular bladelike object later the tail was shaped like a scimitar and later again it assumed a duplex form though the bulk of comets is huge they contain extraordinarily little substance their heads must contain some solid matter but it is probably in the form of a loose aggregation of stones enveloped in vaporous material there is some reason to suppose that comets are apt to shed some of these stones as they travel along their paths for the orbits of the meteors that cause some of our greatest star showers are coincident with the paths of comets that have been observed but it is not only by shedding its loose stones that a comet diminishes its bulk it loses also through its tail as the comet gets close to the sun its head becomes heated and throws off concentric envelopes much of which consists of matter in an extremely fine state of division now it has been shown that the radiations of the sun have the power of repelling matter whilst the sun itself attracts by its gravitational force but there is a difference in the action of the two forces the lightpressure varies with the surface of the particle upon which it is exercised the gravitational attraction varies with the mass or volume if we consider the behaviour of very small particles it follows that the attraction due to gravitation depending on the volume of the particle will diminish more rapidly than the repulsion due to lightpressure depending on the surface of the particle as we decrease continually the size of the particle since its volume diminishes more rapidly than its surface a limit therefore will be reached below which the repulsion will become greater than the attraction thus for particles less than the 125000 part of an inch in diameter the repulsion of the sun is greater than its attraction particles in the outer envelope of the comet below this size will be driven away in a continuous stream and will form that thin luminous fog which we see as the comets tail we cannot tell whether such objects as these were present to the mind of joel when he spoke of blood and fire and pillars of smoke possibly these metaphors are better explained by a sand or thunderstorm especially when we consider that the hebrew expression for the pillars of smoke indicates a resemblance to a palmtree as in the spreading out of the head of a sand or thundercloud in the sky the suggestion has been madefollowing the closing lines of paradise lost for milton is responsible for many of our interpretations of scripture high in front advanced the brandished sword of god before them blazed fierce as a comet that a comet was indeed the flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life there is less improbability in the suggestion made by several writers that when the pestilence wasted jerusalem and david offered up the sacrifice of intercession in the threshing floor of ornan the jebusite the king may have seen in the scimitarlike tail of a comet such as donatis gods ministera flame of firethe angel of the lord stand between the earth and the heaven having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over jerusalem the late r a proctor describes the wanderings of a comet thus a comet is seen in the far distant depths of space as a faint and scarcely discernible speck it draws nearer and nearer with continually increasing velocity growing continually larger and brighter faster and faster it rushes on until it makes its nearest approach to our sun and then sweeping round him it begins its long return voyage into infinite space as it recedes it grows fainter and fainter until at length it passes beyond the range of the most powerful telescopes made by man and is seen no more it has been seen for the first and last time by the generation of men to whom it has displayed its glories it has been seen for the first and last time by the race of man itself1081 these are wandering stars to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever footnotes 1081 r a proctor the expanse of heaven p 134 illustration fall of an aerolite there fell a great star from heaven burning as it were a lamp see p 116 chapter x meteors great meteoritesaerolites as they are calledare like great comets chance visitors to our world now and then they come but we cannot foretell their coming such an aerolite exploded some fifteen miles above madrid at about 9h 29m on the morning of february 10 1896 a vivid glare of blinding light was followed in 112 minutes by a loud report the concussion being such as not merely to create a panic but to break many windows and in some cases to shake down partitions the sky was clear and the sun shining brightly when a white cloud bordered with red was seen rushing from southwest to northeast leaving behind it a train of fine white dust a redtinted cloud was long visible in the east many fragments were picked up and analyzed and like other aerolites were found to consist of materials already known on the earth the outer crust showed the signs of firethe meteoric stone had been fused and ignited by its very rapid rush through the airbut the interior was entirely unaffected by the heat the manner in which the elements were combined is somewhat peculiar to aerolites the nearest terrestrial affinity of the minerals aggregated in them is to be found in the volcanic products from great depths thus aerolites seem to be brokenup fragments from the interior parts of globes like our own they do not come from our own volcanoes for the velocities with which they entered our atmosphere prove their cosmical origin had our atmosphere not entangled them many circuiting the sun in a parabolic or hyperbolic curve would have escaped for ever from our system the swift motions which they had on entering our atmosphere are considerably greater on the average than those of comets and probably their true home is not in our solar system but in interstellar space the aerolites that reach the surface are not always exploded into very small fragments but every now and then quite large masses remain intact most of these are stony some have bits of iron scattered through them others are almost pure iron or with a little nickel alloy or have pockets in them laden with stone there are hundreds of accounts of the falls of aerolites during the past 2500 years the greeks and romans considered them as celestial omens and kept some of them in temples one at mecca is revered by the faithful mohammedans and jehangir the great mogul is said to have had a sword forged from an iron aerolite which fell in 1620 in the panjab diana of ephesus stood on a shapeless block which tradition says was a meteoric stone and reference may perhaps be found to this in the speech of the townclerk of the city to appease the riot stirred up against st paul by demetrius the silversmith and his companions ye men of ephesus what man is there who knoweth not how that the city of the ephesians is templekeeper of the great diana and of the image which fell down from jupiter aerolites come singly and unexpectedly falling actually to earth on land or sea shooting stars come usually in battalions they travel together in swarms and the earth may meet the same swarm again and again they are smaller than aerolites probably mere particles of dust and for the most part are entirely consumed in our upper atmosphere so that they do not actually reach the earth the swarms travel along paths that resemble cometary orbits they are very elongated ellipses inclined at all angles to the plane of the ecliptic indeed several of the orbits are actually those of known comets and it is generally held that these meteorites or shooting stars are the dbris that a comet sheds on its journey we can never see the same shooting star twice its visibility implies its dissolution for it is only as it is entrapped and burnt up in our atmosphere that we see it or can see it its companions in a great meteoric swarm are however as the sand on the seashore and we recognize them as members of the same swarm by their agreement in direction and date the swarms move in a closed orbit and it is where this orbit intersects that of the earth that we get a great star shower if both earth and swarm are present together at the intersection if the swarm is drawn out so that many meteorites are scattered throughout the whole circuit of its orbit then we get a shower every year if the meteor swarm is more condensed so as to form a cluster then the shower only comes when the gem of the ring as it is termed is at the intersection of the orbits and the earth is there too such a conjunction may present the most impressive spectacle that the heavens can afford the leonid meteor shower is perhaps the most famous it has been seen at intervals of about thirtythree years since early in the tenth century when ibrahim ben ahmed lay dying in the year 902 ad it was recorded that an infinite number of stars were seen during the night scattering themselves like rain to the right and left and that year was known as the year of stars when the earth encountered the same system in 1202 ad the mohammedan record runs that on the night of saturday on the last day of muharram stars shot hither and thither in the heavens eastward and westward and flew against one another like a scattering swarm of locusts to the right and left there are not records of all the returns of this meteoric swarm between the thirteenth century and the eighteenth but when the earth encountered it in 1799 humboldt reported that from the beginning of the phenomenon there was not a space in the firmament equal in extent to three diameters of the moon that was not filled every instant with bolides and falling stars and mr andrew ellicott an agent of the united states cruising off the coast of florida watched this same meteoric display and made the drawing reproduced on the opposite page in 1833 a planter in south carolina wrote of a return of this same system never did rain fall much thicker than the meteors fell towards the earth east west north south it was the same in 1866 the shower was again heavy and brilliant but at the end of the nineteenth century when the swarm should have returned the display was meagre and ineffective illustration meteoric shower of 1799 november 12 seen off cape florida by mr andrew ellicott the leonid system of meteorites did not always move in a closed orbit round our sun tracing back their records and history we find that in ad 126 the swarm passed close to uranus and probably at that time the planet captured them for the sun but we cannot doubt that some such similar sight as they have afforded us suggested the imagery employed by the apostle st john when he wrote the stars of heaven fell unto the earth even as a figtree casteth her untimely figs when she is shaken of a mighty wind and the heavens departed as a scroll when it is rolled together and the prophet isaiah used a very similar figure all the host of heaven shall be dissolved and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll and all their host shall fall down as the leaf falleth off from the vine and as a falling fig from the figtree whilst the simile of a great aerolite is that employed by st john in his description of the star wormwood the third angel sounded and there fell a great star from heaven burning as it were a lamp and it fell upon the third part of the rivers and upon the fountains of waters st judes simile of the wandering stars to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever may have been drawn from meteors rather than from comets but as has been seen the two classes of objects are closely connected the word meteor is sometimes used for any unusual light seen in the sky the zodiacal light the pale conical beam seen after sunset in the west in the spring and before sunrise in the east in the autumn and known to the arabs as the false dawn does not appear to be mentioned in scripture some commentators wrongly consider that the expression the eyelids of the morning occurring twice in the book of job is intended to describe it but the metaphor does not in the least apply the aurora borealis on the other hand seldom though it is seen on an impressive scale in palestine seems clearly indicated in one passage out of the north cometh golden splendour would well fit the gleaming of the northern lights seen as they often are as sheaves of golden rays chapter xi eclipses of the sun and moon we do not know what great comets or aerolites or starshowers were seen in palestine during the centuries in which the books of the bible were composed but we do know that eclipses both of the sun and moon must have been seen for these are not the results of chance conjunctions we know more that not only partial eclipses of the sun but total eclipses fell within the period so covered there is no phenomenon of nature which is so truly impressive as a total eclipse of the sun the beautiful pageants of the evening and the morning are too often witnessed to produce the same effect upon us whilst the storm and the earthquake and the volcano in eruption by the confusion and fear for personal safety they produce render men unfit to watch their developments but the eclipse awes and subdues by what might almost be called moral means alone no noise no danger accompanies it the body is not tortured nor the mind confused by the rush of the blast the crash of the thunderpeal the rocking of the earthquake or the fires of the volcano the only sense appealed to is that of sight the movements of the orbs of heaven go on without noise or confusion and with a majestic smoothness in which there is neither hurry nor delay this impression is felt by every one no matter how perfectly acquainted not only with the cause of the phenomenon but also with the appearances to be expected and scientific men have found themselves awestruck and even overwhelmed but if such are the feelings called forth by an eclipse nowadays in those who are expecting it who are prepared for it knowing perfectly what will happen and what brings it about how can we gauge aright the unspeakable terror such an event must have caused in ages long ago when it came utterly unforeseen and it was impossible to understand what was really taking place and so in olden time an eclipse of the sun came as an omen of terrible disaster nay as being itself one of the worst of disasters it came so to all nations but one but to that nation the word of the prophet had come learn not the way of the heathen and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven for the heathen are dismayed at them god did not reveal the physical explanation of the eclipse to the hebrews that in process of time they could learn by the exercise of their own mental powers but he set them free from the slavish fear of the heathen they could look at all these terrorstriking signs without fear they could look with calmness with confidence because they looked in faith it is not easy to exaggerate the advantage which this must have given the hebrews over the neighbouring nations from a scientific point of view the word of god gave them intellectual freedom and so far as they were faithful to it there was no hindrance to their fully working out the scientific problems which came before them they neither worshipped the heavenly bodies nor were dismayed at their signs we have no record as to how far the hebrews made use of this freedom for as already pointed out the holy scriptures were not written to chronicle their scientific achievements but there can be no doubt that given the leisure of peace it is a priori more likely that they should have taught astronomy to their neighbours than have learnt it even from the most advanced there must have been numberless eclipses of the moon seen in the ages during which the canon of holy scripture was written of eclipses of the sun total or very nearly total over the regions of palestine or mesopotamia in the times of the old testament we know of four that were actually seen whose record is preserved in contemporaneous history and a fifth that was nearly total in juda about midday the first of the four is recorded on a tablet from babylon lately deciphered in which it states that on the 26th day of sivan day was turned into night and fire appeared in the midst of heaven this has been identified with the eclipse of july 31 1063 bc and we do not find any reference to it in scripture the second is that of aug 15 831 bc no specific record of this eclipse has been found as yet but it took place during the lifetime of the prophets joel and amos and may have been seen by them and their recollection of it may have influenced the wording of their prophecies the third eclipse is recorded on a tablet from nineveh stating the coincidence of an eclipse in sivan with a revolt in the city of assur this has been identified with the eclipse of june 15 763 bc the fourth is that known as the eclipse of larissa on may 18 603 bc which was coincident with the final overthrow of the assyrian empire and the fifth is that of thales on may 28 585 bc the earth goes round the sun once in a year the moon goes round the earth once in a month and sometimes the three bodies are in one straight line in this case the intermediate bodyearth or moondeprives the other wholly or partially of the light from the sun thus causing an eclipse if the orbits of the earth and moon were in the same plane an eclipse would happen every time the moon was new or full that is to say at every conjunction and every opposition or about twentyfive times a year but the plane of the moons orbit is inclined to the plane of the earths orbit at an angle of about 5 and so an eclipse only occurs when the moon is in conjunction or opposition and is at the same time at or very near one of the nodesthat is one of the two points where the plane of the earths orbit intersects the moons orbit if the moon is in opposition or full then under these conditions an eclipse of the moon takes place and this is visible at all places where the moon is above the horizon at the time if however the moon is in conjunction or new it is the sun that is eclipsed and as the shadow cast by the moon is but small only a portion of the earths surface will experience the solar eclipse the nodes of the moons orbit are not stationary but have a daily retrograde motion of 3 1064 it takes the moon therefore 27d 5h 5m 36s 2721222d to perform a journey in its orbit from one node back to that node again this is called a draconic period but it takes the moon 29d 12h 44m 287s 2953059d to pass from new to new or from full to full i e to complete a lunation now 242 draconic periods very nearly equal 223 lunations being about 18 years 1013 days and both are very nearly equal to 19 returns of the sun to the moons node so that if the moon is new or full when at a node in 18 years and 10 or 11 days it will be at that node again and again new or full and the sun will be also present in very nearly its former position if therefore an eclipse occurred on the former occasion it will probably occur on the latter this recurrence of eclipses after intervals of 1803 years is called the saros and was known to the chaldeans we do not know whether it was known to the hebrews prior to their captivity in babylon but possibly the statement of the wise king already quoted from the apocryphal wisdom of solomon may refer to some such knowledge our calendar today is a purely solar one our months are twelve in number but of purely arbitrary length divorced from all connection with the moon and to us the saros cycle does not readily leap to the eye for eclipses of sun or moon seem to fall haphazard on any day of the month or year but with the hebrews assyrians and babylonians it was not so their calendar was a lunisolar onetheir year was on the average a solar year their months were true lunations the first day of their new month began on the evening when the first thin crescent of the moon appeared after its conjunction with the sun this observation is what is meant in the bible by the new moon astronomers now by new moon mean the time when it is actually in conjunction with the sun and is therefore not visible nations whose calendar was of this description were certain to discover the saros much sooner than those whose months were not true lunations like the egyptians greeks and romans there are no direct references to eclipses in scripture they might have been used in the historical portions for the purpose of dating events as was the great earthquake in the days of king uzziah but they were not so used but we find not a few allusions to their characteristic appearances and phenomena in the books of the prophets god in the beginning set the two great lights in the firmament for signs as well as for seasons and the prophets throughout use the relations of the sun and moon as types of spiritual relations the messiah was the sun of righteousness the chosen people the church was as the moon which derives her light from him the signs of heaven were symbols of great spiritual events not omens of mundane disasters the prophets joel and amos are clear and vivid in their descriptions probably because the eclipse of 831 bc was within their recollection joel says first the sun and the moon shall be dark and again more plainly i will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth blood and fire and pillars of smoke the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the great and the terrible day of the lord come this prophecy was quoted by st peter on the day of pentecost and in the apocalypse st john says that when the sixth seal was opened the sun became black as sackcloth of hair and the moon became as blood in these references the two kinds of eclipses are referred tothe sun becomes black when the moon is new and hides it the moon becomes as blood when it is full and the earths shadow falls upon it its deep copper colour like that of dried blood being due to the fact that the light falling upon it has passed through a great depth of the earths atmosphere these two eclipses cannot therefore be coincident but they may occur only a fortnight aparta total eclipse of the sun may be accompanied by a partial eclipse of the moon a fortnight earlier or a fortnight later a total eclipse of the moon may be accompanied by partial eclipses of the sun both at the preceding and following new moons writing at about the same period the prophet amos says saith the lord god i will cause the sun to go down at noon and i will darken the earth in the clear day and seems to refer to the fact that the eclipse of 831 bc occurred about midday in juda later micah writes the sun shall go down over the prophets and the day shall be dark over them isaiah says that the sun shall be darkened in his going forth and jeremiah that her sun is gone down while it was yet day whilst ezekiel says i will cover the sun with a cloud and the moon shall not give her light all the bright lights of heaven will i make dark over thee and set darkness upon thy land saith the lord god but a total eclipse is not all darkness and terror it has a beauty and a glory all its own scarcely has the dark moon hidden the last thread of sunlight from view than spurs of rosy light are seen around the black disc that now fills the place so lately occupied by the glorious king of day and these rosy spurs of light shine on a background of pearly glory as impressive in its beauty as the swift march of the awful shadow and the seeming descent of the darkened heavens were in terror there it shines pure lovely serene radiant with a light like molten silver wreathing the darkened sun with a halo like that round a saintly head in some noble altarpiece so that while in some cases the dreadful shadow has awed a laughing and frivolous crowd into silence in others the radiance of that halo has brought spectators to their knees with an involuntary exclamation the glory as if god himself had made known his presence in the moment of the suns eclipse and this indeed seems to have been the thought of both the babylonians and egyptians of old both nations had a specially sacred symbol to set forth the divine presencethe egyptians a disc with long outstretched wings the babylonians a ring with wings the latter symbol on assyrian monuments is always shown as floating over the head of the king and is designed to indicate the presence and protection of the deity illustration the assyrian ring with wings we may take it for granted that the egyptians and chaldeans of old as modern astronomers today had at one time or another presented to them every type of coronal form but there would no doubt be a difficulty in grasping or remembering the irregular details of the corona as seen in most eclipses sometimes however the corona shows itself in a striking and simple formwhen sunspots are few in number it spreads itself out in two great equatorial streamers at the eclipse of algiers in 1900 already referred to one observer who watched the eclipse from the sea said the sky was blue all round the sun and the effect of the silvery corona projected on it was beyond any one to describe i can only say it seemed to me what angels wings will be like1291 illustration corona of minimum type drawing made by w h wesley from photographs of the 1900 eclipse it seems exceedingly probable that the symbol of the ring with wings owed its origin not to any supposed analogy between the ring and the wings and the divine attributes of eternity and power but to the revelations of a total eclipse with a corona of minimum type moreover the assyrians when they insert a figure of their deity within the ring give him a kiltlike dress and this kilted or feathered characteristic is often retained where the figure is omitted this gives the symbol a yet closer likeness to the corona whose polar rays are remarkably like the tail feathers of a bird perhaps the prophet malachi makes a reference to this characteristic of the eclipsed sun with its corona like angels wings when he predicts but unto you that fear my name shall the sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings but if this be so it must be borne in mind that the prophet uses the corona as a simile only no more than the sun itself is it the deity or the manifestation of the deity in the new testament we may find perhaps a reference to what causes an eclipseto the shadow cast by a heavenly body in its revolutionits turning every good gift and every perfect boon is from above coming down from the father of lights with whom can be no variation neither shadow that is cast by turning footnotes 1291 the total solar eclipse of may 1900 p 22 chapter xii saturn and astrology the planets as such are nowhere mentioned in the bible in the one instance in which the word appears in our versions it is given as a translation of mazzaloth better rendered in the margin as the twelve signs or constellations the evidence is not fully conclusive that allusion is made to any planet even in its capacity of a god worshipped by the surrounding nations of planets besides the earth modern astronomy knows mercury venus mars many planetoids jupiter saturn uranus and neptune and of satellites revolving round planets there are at present known the moon which owns our earth as primary two satellites to mars seven satellites to jupiter ten to saturn four to uranus and one to neptune the ancients counted the planets as seven numbering the moon and the sun amongst them the rest were mercury venus mars jupiter and saturn they recognized no satellites to any planet we have no evidence that the ancient semitic nations considered that the moon was more intimately connected with the earth than any of the other six but though the planets were sometimes regarded as seven in number the ancients perfectly recognized that the sun and moon stood in a different category altogether from the other five and though the heathen recognized them as deities confusion resulted as to the identity of the deity of which each was a manifestation samas was the sungod and baal was the sungod but samas and baal or bel were not identical and both were something more than merely the sun personified again merodach or marduk is sometimes expressly identified with bel as sungod sometimes with the divinity of the planet jupiter similarly ashtoreth or ivstar is sometimes identified with the goddess of the moon sometimes with the planet venus it would not be safe therefore to assume that reference is intended to any particular heavenly body because a deity is mentioned that has been on occasions identified with that heavenly body still less safe would it be to assume astronomical allusions in the description of the qualities or characteristics of that deity though ashtoreth or ivstar may have been often identified with the planet venus it is ridiculous to argue as some have done from the expression ashterothkarnaim ashteroth of the horns that the ancients had sight or instruments sufficiently powerful to enable them to observe that venus like the moon had her phases her horns though nebo has been identified with the planet mercury we must not see any astronomical allusion to its being the nearest planet to the sun in isaiahs coupling the two together where he says bel boweth down nebo stoopeth isaiah speaks of the king of babylon how art thou fallen from heaven o lucifer son of the morning the word here translated lucifer lightbearer is the word helel from the root halal and means spreading brightness in the assyriobabylonian the planet venus is sometimes termed mustelel from the root elil and she is the most lustrous of all the morning stars of the stars that herald the dawn but except that her greater brilliancy marks her as especially appropriate to the expression sirius or any other in its capacity of morning star would be suitable as an explanation of the term st peter uses the equivalent greek expression phosphorus in his second epistle a light that shineth in a dark place until the day dawn and the daystar lightbringer arise in your hearts isaiah again says ye are they that forsake the lord that forget my holy mountain that prepare a table for that troop and that furnish the drink offering unto that number gad and meni here literally translated as troop and number are in the revised version rendered as fortune and destiny a reference to this god meni has been suggested in the mysterious inscription which the king of babylon saw written by a hand upon the wall which daniel interpreted as god hath numbered thy kingdom and brought it to an end by some commentators meni is understood to be the planet venus and gad to be jupiter for these are associated in arabian astrology with fortune or fate in the sense of good luck or from the similarity of meni with the greek mene moon that number might be identified with the moon and that troop by analogy with the sun it is more probable if any astrological deities are intended that the two little star clustersthe pleiades and the hyadessituated on the back and head of the bull may have been accounted the manifestations of the divinities which are by their names so intimately associated with the idea of multitude the number seven has been held a sacred number and has been traditionally associated with both the little star groups in one instance alone does there seem to be any strong evidence that reference is intended to one of the five planets known to the ancients when worshipped as a god and even that is not conclusive the prophet amos charging the israelites with idolatry even in the wilderness asks have ye offered unto me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years o house of israel but ye have borne the tabernacle of your moloch and chiun your images the star of your god which ye made to yourselves but the septuagint version makes the accusation run thus ye took up the tabernacle of moloch and the star of your god remphan figures which ye made to worship them this was the version which st stephen quoted in his defence before the high priest it is quite clear that it was star worship to which he was referring for he prefaces his quotation by saying god turned and gave them up to serve the host of heaven as it is written in the book of the prophets the difference between the names chiun and remphan is explained by a probable misreading on the part of the septuagint translators into the greek who seemed to have transcribed the initial of the word as resh where it should have been caphr instead of kthus the real word should be transliterated kaivan which was the name of the planet saturn both amongst the ancient arabs and syrians and also amongst the assyrians whilst kevan is the name of that planet in the sacred books of the parsees on the other hand there seems to be some difficulty in supposing that a deity is intended of which there is no other mention in scripture seeing that the reference both by amos and st stephen would imply that the particular object of idolatry denounced was one exceedingly familiar to them gesenius therefore after having previously accepted the view that we have here a reference to the worship of saturn finally adopted the rendering of the latin vulgate that the word chiun should be translated statue or image the passage would then become ye have borne the booth of your moloch and the image of your idols the star of your god which ye made for yourselves if we accept the view that the worship of the planet saturn is indeed referred to it does not necessarily follow that the prophet amos was stating that the israelites in the wilderness actually observed and worshipped him as such the prophet may mean no more than that the israelites whilst outwardly conforming to the worship of jehovah were in their secret desires hankering after sabismthe worship of the heavenly host and it may well be that he chooses moloch and saturn as representing the cruellest and most debased forms of heathenism the planet saturn gives its name to the seventh day of our week saturns day the sabbath of the week of the jews and the coincidence of the two has called forth not a few ingenious theories why do the days of our week bear their present names and what is the explanation of their order the late wellknown astronomer r a proctor gives the explanation as follows the twentyfour hours of each day were devoted to those planets in the order of their supposed distance from the earthsaturn jupiter mars the sun venus mercury and the moon the outermost planet saturn which also travels in the longest period was regarded in this arrangement as of chief dignity as encompassing in his movement all the rest jupiter was of higher dignity than mars and so forth moreover to the outermost planet partly because of saturns gloomy aspect partly because among halfsavage races the powers of evil are always more respected than the powers that work for good a maleficent influence was attributed now if we assign to the successive hours of a day the planets as abovenamed beginning with saturn on the day assigned to that powerful deity it will be found that the last hour of that day will be assigned to marsthe lesser infortune as saturn was the greater infortune of the old system of astrologyand the first hour of the next day to the next planet the sun the day following saturday would thus be sunday the last hour of sunday would fall to mercury and the first of the next to the moon so monday the moons day follows sunday the next day would be the day of mars who in the scandinavian theology is represented by tuisco so tuiscos day or tuesday mardi follows monday then by following the same system we come to mercurys day mercredi wodens day or wednesday next to jupiters day joves day jeudi thors day or thursday to venuss day vendredi veneris dies freyas day or friday and so to saturday again that the day devoted to the most evil and most powerful of all the deities of the sabdans sic should be set apartfirst as one on which it was unlucky to work and afterwards as one on which it was held to be sinful to workwas but the natural outcome of the superstitious belief that the planets were gods ruling the fates of men and nations1361 this theory appears at first sight so simple so plausible that many are tempted to say it must be true and it has accordingly gained a wide acceptance yet a moments thought shows that it makes many assumptions some of which rest without any proof and others are known to be false when were the planets discovered not certainly at the dawn of astronomy the fixed stars must have become familiar and have been recognized in their various groupings before it could have been known that there were others that were not fixedwere planets i e wanderers thus amongst the greeks no planet is alluded to by hesiod and homer mentions no planet other than venus and apparently regarded her as two distinct objects according as she was seen as a morning and as an evening star pythagoras is reputed to have been the first of the greek philosophers to realize the identity of phosphorus and hesperus that is venus at her two elongations so that the greeks did not know this until the sixth century before our era we are yet without certain knowledge as to when the babylonians began to notice the different planets but the order of discovery can hardly have been different from what it seems to have been amongst the greeksthat is to say first venus as two separate objects then jupiter and mars and probably much later saturn and mercury this last again would originally be considered a pair of planets just as venus had been later these planets as morning stars would be identified with their appearances as evening stars after this obscurity had been cleared up there was a still further advance to be made before the astrologers could have adopted their strange grouping of the sun and moon as planets equally with the other five this certainly is no primitive conception for the sun and moon have such appreciable dimensions and are of such great brightness that they seem to be marked off as in the first chapter of genesis as of an entirely different order from all the other heavenly bodies the point in common with the other five planets namely their apparent periodical movements could only have been brought out by very careful and prolonged observation the recognition therefore of the planets as being seven two of the seven being the sun and moon must have been quite late in the history of the world the connection of the seven planets with the seven days of the week was something much later still it implies as we have seen the adoption of a particular order for the planets and this order further implies that a knowledge had been obtained of their relative distances and involves a particular theory of the solar system that which we now know as the ptolemaic it is not the order of the babylonians for they arranged them moon sun mercury venus saturn jupiter mars there are further considerations which show that the babylonians could not have given these planetary names to the days of the week the order of the names implies that a twentyfour hour day was used but the babylonian hours were twice the length of those which we use hence there were only twelve of them further the babylonian week was not a true week running on continuously it was tied to the month and hence did not lend itself to such a notation but the order adopted for the planets is that current amongst the greek astronomers of alexandria who did use a twentyfour hour day hence it was certainly later than 300 bc but the greeks and egyptians alike used a week of ten days not of seven how then did the planetary names come to be assigned to the sevenday week it was a consequence of the power which the jews possessed of impressing their religious ideas and particularly their observance of the sabbath day upon their conquerors they did so with the romans we find such writers as cicero horace juvenal and others remarking upon the sabbath and indeed in the early days of the empire there was a considerable observance of it much more then must the alexandrian greeks have been aware of the jewish sabbathwhich involved the jewish weekat a time when the jews of that city were both numerous and powerful having equal rights with the greek inhabitants and when the ptolemies were sanctioning the erection of a jewish temple in their dominions and the translation of the jewish scriptures into greek it was after the alexandrian greeks had thus learned of the jewish week that they assigned the planets to the seven days of that week since it suited their astrological purposes better than the egyptian week of ten days that allotment could not possibly have brought either week or sabbath into existence both had been recognized many centuries earlier it was foisted upon that which had already a venerable antiquity as professor schiaparelli well remarks we are indebted for these names to mathematical astrology the false science which came to be formed after the time of alexander the great from the strange intermarriage between chaldean and egyptian superstitions and the mathematical astronomy of the greeks1391 there is a widespread notion that early astronomy whether amongst the hebrews or elsewhere took the form of astrology that the fortunetelling came first and the legitimate science grew out of it indeed a claim is not infrequently made that no small honour is due to the early astrologers since from their efforts the most majestic of all the sciences is said to have arisen these ideas are the exact contrary of the truth mathematical or perhaps as we might better call it planetary astrology as we have it today concerns itself with the apparent movements of the planets in the sense that it uses them as its material just as a child playing in a library might use the books as building blocks piling it may be a book of sermons on a history and a novel on a mathematical treatise astrology does not contribute has not contributed a single observation a single demonstration to astronomy it owes to astronomy all that it knows of mathematical processes and planetary positions in astronomical language the calculation of a horoscope is simply the calculation of the azimuths of the different planets and of certain imaginary points on the ecliptic for a given time this is an astronomical process carried out according to certain simple formul the calculation of a horoscope is therefore a straightforward business but as astrologers all admit its interpretation is where the skill is required and no real rules can be given for that here is the explanation why the sun and moon are classed together with such relatively insignificant bodies as the other five planets and are not even ranked as their chief the ancient astrologer like the modern cared nothing for the actual luminary in the heavens all he cared for was its written symbol on his tablets and there sun and saturn could be looked upon as equal or saturn as the greater it is a rare thing for a modern astrologer to introduce the place of an actual star into a horoscope the calculations all refer to the positions of the signs of the zodiac which are purely imaginary divisions of the heavens not to the constellations of the zodiac which are the actual stargroups until astronomers had determined the apparent orbits of the planets and drawn up tables by which their apparent places could be predicted for some time in advance it was impossible for astrologers to cast horoscopes of the present kind all they could do was to divide up time amongst the deities supposed to preside over the various planets to have simply given a planet to each day would have allowed the astrologer a very small scope in which to work for his prophecies the ingenious idea of giving a planet to each hour as well gave a wider range of possible combinations there seems to have been deliberate spitefulness in the assignment of the most evil of the planetary divinities to the sacred day of the jewstheir sabbath it should be noticed at the same time that whilst the jewish sabbath coincides with the astrological saturns day that particular day is the seventh day of the jewish week but the first of the astrological for the very nature of the reckoning by which the astrologers allotted the planets to the days of the week implies as shown in the extract quoted from proctor that they began with saturn and worked downwards from the highest planetas they called itto the lowest this detail of itself should have sufficed to have demonstrated to proctor or any other astronomer that the astrological week had been foisted upon the already existing week of the jews before astrology took its present mathematical form astrologers used as their material for prediction the stars or constellations which happened to be rising or setting at the time selected or were upon the same meridian or had the same longitude as such constellations one of the earliest of these astrological writers was zeuchros of babylon who lived about the time of the christian era some of whose writings have been preserved to us from these it is clear that the astrologers found twelve signs of the zodiac did not give them enough play they therefore introduced the decans that is to say the idea of thirtysix divinitiesthree to each monthborrowed from the egyptian division of the year into thirtysix weeks of ten days each under the rule of a separate god of course this egyptian year bore no fixed relation to the actual lunar months or solar year nor therefore to the jewish year which was related to both but even with this increase of material the astrologers found the astronomical data insufficient for their fortunetelling purposes additional figures quite unrepresented in the heavens were devised and were drawn upon as needed to supplement the genuine constellations and as it was impossible to recognize these additions in the sky the predictions were made not from observation of the heavens but from observations on globes often very inaccurate earlier still we have astrological tablets from assyria and babylon many of which show that they had nothing to do with any actual observation and were simply invented to give completeness to the tables of omens thus an assyrian tablet has been found upon which are given the significations of eclipses falling upon each day of the month tammuz right up to the middle of the month it is amusing to read the nave comment of a distinguished assyriologist that tablets such as these prove how careful and how long continued had been the observations upon which they were based it was not recognized that no eclipses either of sun or moon could possibly occur on most of the dates given and that they could never occur in the north which is one of the quarters indicated they were no more founded on actual observation than the portent mentioned on another tablet of a woman giving birth to a lion which after all is not more impossible than that an eclipse should occur in the north on the second day of tammuz in all ages it has been the same the astrologer has had nothing to do with science as such even in its most primitive form he has cared nothing for the actual appearance of the heavens upon which he pretended to base his predictions an imaginary planet an imaginary eclipse an imaginary constellation were just as good for his fortunetelling as real ones such fortunetelling was forbidden to the hebrews necessarily forbidden for astrology had no excuse unless the stars and planets were gods or the vehicles and engines of gods further all attempts to extort from spirits or from inanimate things a glimpse into the future was likewise forbidden them they were to look to god and to his revealed will alone for all such light when they shall say unto you seek unto them that have familiar spirits and unto wizards that peep and that mutter should not a people seek unto their god the hebrews were few in number their kingdoms very small compared with the great empires of egypt assyria or babylon but here in this question of divination or fortunetelling they stand on a plane far above any of the surrounding nations there is just contempt in the picture drawn by ezekiel of the king of babylon great though his military power might be the king of babylon stood at the parting of the way at the head of the two ways to use divination he shook the arrows to and fro he consulted the teraphim he looked in the liver and isaiah calls upon the city of babylon stand now with thine enchantments and with the multitude of thy sorceries wherein thou hast laboured from thy youth if so thou shalt be able to profit if so be thou mayest prevail thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels let now the astrologers the stargazers the monthly prognosticators stand up and save thee from these things that shall come upon thee isaiah knew the lord to be he that frustrateth the tokens of the liars and maketh diviners mad and the word of the lord to israel through jeremiah was thus saith the lord learn not the way of the heathen and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven for the heathen are dismayed at them it is to our shame that even today in spite of all our enlightenment and scientific advances astrology still has a hold upon multitudes astrological almanacs and treatises are sold by the tens of thousands and astrological superstitions are still current the star of the god chiun is not indeed openly worshipped but saturn is still looked upon as the planet bringing such diseases as toothache agues and all that proceeds from cold consumption the spleen particularly and the bones rheumatic gouts jaundice dropsy and all complaints arising from fear apoplexies etc and charms made of saturns metal lead are still worn upon saturns finger in the belief that these will ward off the threatened evil a tradition of the time when by so doing the wearers would have proclaimed themselves votaries of the god and therefore under his protection astrology is inevitably linked with heathenism and both shut up spirit and mind against the knowledge of god himself which is religion and against the knowledge of his works which is science and though a man may be religious without being scientific or scientific without being religious religion and science alike both rest on one and the same basisthe belief in one god maker of heaven and earth that belief was the reason why israel of old so far as it was faithful to it was free from the superstitions of astrology it is no small honour for this nation to have been wise enough to see the inanity of this and all other forms of divination of what other ancient civilized nation could as much be said1451 footnotes 1361 r a proctor the great pyramid pp 274276 1391 g v schiaparelli astronomy in the old testament p 137

own poets have said for we are also his offspring book ii the constellations chapter i the origin of the constellations the age of classical astronomy began with the labours of eudoxus and others about four centuries before the christian era but there was an earlier astronomy whose chief feature was the arrangement of the stars into constellations the best known of all such arrangements is that sometimes called the greek sphere because those constellations have been preserved to us by greek astronomers and poets the earliest complete catalogue of the stars as thus arranged that has come down to us was compiled by claudius ptolemy the astronomer of alexandria and completed 137 ad in this catalogue each star is described by its place in the supposed figure of the constellation whilst its celestial latitude and longitude are added so that we can see with considerable exactness how the astronomers of that time imagined the star figures the earliest complete description of the constellations apart from the places of the individual stars is given in the poem of aratus of solithe phenomena published about 270 bc were these constellations known to the hebrews of old we can answer this question without hesitation in the case of st paul for in his sermon to the athenians on mars hill he quotes from the opening verses of this constellation poem of aratus god that made the world and all things therein seeing that he is lord of heaven and earth dwelleth not in temples made with hands neither is worshipped with mens hands as though he needed anything seeing he giveth to all life and breath and all things and hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth and hath determined the times before appointed and the bounds of their habitation that they should seek the lord if haply they might feel after him and find him though he be not far from every one of us for in him we live and move and have our being as certain also of your own poets have said for we are also his offspring the poem of aratus begins thus to god above we dedicate our song to leave him unadored we never dare for he is present in each busy throng in every solemn gathering he is there the sea is his and his each crowded port in every place our need of him we feel for we his offspring are aratus like st paul himself was a native of cilicia and had been educated at athens his poem on the constellations came in the opinion of the greeks next in honour to the poems of homer so that st pauls quotation from it appealed to his hearers with special force the constellations of ptolemys catalogue are fortyeight in number those of aratus correspond to them in almost every particular but one or two minor differences may be marked according to ptolemy the constellations are divided into three setstwentyone northern twelve in the zodiac and fifteen southern the northern constellations areto use the names by which they are now familiar to us1

centaur 12 lupus the beast 13 ara the altar 14 corona australis the southern crown 15 piscis australis the southern fish aratus living four hundred years earlier than ptolemy differs only from him in that he reckons the cluster of the pleiadescounted by ptolemy in taurusas a separate constellation but he has no constellation of equuleus the total number of constellations was thus still fortyeight aratus further describes the southern crown but gives it no name and in the constellation of the little dog he only mentions one star procyon the dogs forerunner he also mentions that the two bears were also known as two wagons or chariots were these constellations so familiar to us today known before the time of aratus and if so by whom were they devised and when and where they were certainly known before the time of aratus for his poem was confessedly a versification of an account of them written by eudoxus more than a hundred years previous at a yet earlier date panyasis uncle to the great historian herodotus incidentally discusses the name of one of the constellations which must therefore have been known to him earlier still hesiod in the second book of his works and days refers to several orion and the dog each other nigh together mounted to the midnight sky when in the rosy morn arcturus shines then pluck the clusters from the parent vines next in the round do not to plough forget when the seven virgins and orion set much the same constellations are referred to by homer thus in the fifth book of the odyssey and now rejoicing in the prosperous gales with beating heart ulysses spreads his sails placed at the helm he sate and marked the skies nor closed in sleep his everwatchful eyes there viewd the pleiads and the northern team and great orions more refulgent beam to which around the axle of the sky the bear revolving points his golden eye thus it is clear that several of the constellations were perfectly familiar to the greeks a thousand years before the christian era that is to say about the time of solomon we have other evidence that the constellations were known in early times we often find on greek coins a bull a ram or a lion represented these may well be references to some of the signs of the zodiac but offer no conclusive evidence but several of the constellation figures are very unusual in form thus the seagoat has the head and forelegs of a goat but the hinder part of a fish and the archer has the head and shoulders of a man but the body and legs of a horse pegasus the horse with wings not only shows this unnatural combination but the constellation figure only gives part of the animalthe head neck wings breast and forelegs now some of these characteristic figures are found on quite early greek coins and yet earlier on what are known as boundary stones from babylonia these are little square pillars covered with inscriptions and sculptures and record for the most part the gift transfer or sale of land they are dated according to the year of the reigning king so that a clear idea can be formed as to their age a great many symbols which appear to be astronomical occur upon them amongst these such very distinguishing shapes as the archer seagoat and scorpion see p 318 so that just as we know from homer and hesiod that the principal constellations were known of old by the same names as those by which we know them today we learn from babylonian boundary stones that they were then known as having the same forms as we now ascribe to them the date of the earliest boundary stones of the kind in our possession would show that the babylonians knew of our constellations as far back as the twelfth century bc that is to say whilst israel was under the judges we have direct evidence thus far back as to the existence of the constellations but they are older than this so much older that tradition as well as direct historical evidence fails us the only earlier evidence open to us is that of the constellations themselves a modern celestial globe is covered over with figures from pole to pole but the majority of these are of quite recent origin and belong to the modern period of astronomy they have been framed since the invention of the telescope and since the progress of geographical discovery brought men to know the southern skies if these modern constellations are cleared off and only those of aratus and ptolemy suffered to remain it becomes at once evident that the ancient astronomers were not acquainted with the entire heavens for there is a large space in the south left free from all the old constellations and no explanation why it should have been so left free is so simple and satisfactory as the obvious one that the ancient astronomers did not map out the stars in that region because they never saw them those stars never rose above their horizon illustration the ancient constellations south of the ecliptic thus at the present time the heavens for an observer in england are naturally divided into three parts as shown in the accompanying diagram in the north round the polestar are a number of constellations that never set they wheel unceasingly around the pole on every fine night we can see the great bear the little bear the dragon cepheus and cassiopeia but the stars in the larger portion of the sky have their risings and settings and the seasons in which they are visible or are withdrawn from sight thus we see orion and the pleiades and sirius in the winter not in the summer but the scorpion and sagittarius in the summer similarly there is a third portion of the heavens which never comes within our range we never see the southern cross and hardly any star in the great constellation of the ship though these are very familiar to new zealanders illustration the celestial sphere zenith north pole stars always visible visible hemisphere earth surface earth surface south north celestial equator invisible hemisphere stars never visible south pole the celestial sphere the outline of this unmapped region must therefore correspond roughly to the horizon of the place where the constellations were originally designed or at least be roughly parallel to it since we may well suppose that stars which only rose two or three degrees above that horizon might have been neglected from this we learn that the constellations were designed by people living not very far from the 40th parallel of north latitude not further south than the 37th or 36th this is important as it shows that they did not originate in ancient egypt or india nor even in the city of babylon which is in latitude 32121571 but this vacant space reveals another fact of even more importance it gives us a hint as to the date when the constellations were designed an observer in north latitude 40 at the present time would be very far from seeing all the stars included in the fortyeight constellations he would see nothing at all of the constellation of the altar and a good deal of that of the centaur would be hidden from him on the other hand there are some bright constellations such as the phoenix and the crane unknown to the ancients which would come within his range of vision this is due to what is known as precession a slow movement of the axis upon which the earth rotates in consequence of this the pole of the heavens seems to trace out a circle amongst the stars which it takes 25800 years to complete it is therefore a matter of very simple calculation to find the position of the south pole of the heavens at any given date past or future and we find that the centre of the unmapped space was the south pole of the heavens something like 4600 years ago that is to say about 2700 bc it is of course not possible to fix either time or latitude very closely since the limits of the unmapped space are a a little vague but it is significant that if we take a celestial globe arranged so as to represent the heavens for the time 2700 bc and for north latitude 40 we find several striking relations first of all the great dragon then linked together the north pole of the celestial equator and the north pole of the ecliptic it was as nearly as possible symmetrical with regard to the two it occupied the very crown of the heavens with the single exception of the little bear which it nearly surrounds the dragon was the only constellation that never set next the watersnake see diagram p 200 lay at this time right along the equator extending over 105 of right ascension or to put it less technically it took seven hours out of the twentyfour to cross the meridian it covered nearly onethird of the equatorial belt thirdly the intersection of the equator with one of the principal meridians of the sky was marked by the serpent which is carried by the serpentholder in a very peculiar manner the meridian at midnight at the time of the spring equinox is called a colurethe autumnal colure because the sun crosses it in autumn now the serpent was so arranged as to be shown writhing itself for some distance along the equator and then struggling upwards along the autumnal colure marking the zenith with its head the lower part of the autumnal colure was marked by the scorpion and the foot of the serpentholder pressed down the creatures head just where the colure the equator and the ecliptic intersected see diagram p 164 it is scarcely conceivable that this fourfold arrangement not suggested by any natural grouping of the stars should have come about by accident it must have been intentional for some reason the equator the colure the zenith and the poles were all marked out by these serpentine or draconic forms the unmapped space gives us a clue only to the date and latitude of the designing of the most southerly constellations we now see that a number of the northern hold positions which were specially significant under the same conditions indicating that they were designed at about the same date there is therefore little room for doubt that some time in the earlier half of the third millennium before our era and somewhere between the 36th and 40th parallels of north latitude the constellations were designed substantially as we have them now the serpent forms being intentionally placed in these positions of great astronomical importance it will have been noticed that ptolemy makes the ram the first constellation of the zodiac it was so in his days but it was the bull that was the original leader as we know from a variety of traditions the sun at the spring equinox being in the centre of that constellation about 3000 bc at the time when the constellations were designed the sun at the spring equinox was near aldebaran the brightest star of the bull at the summer solstice it was near regulus the brightest star of the lion at the autumnal equinox it was near antares the brightest star of the scorpion at the winter solstice it was near fomalhaut the brightest star in the neighbourhood of the waterpourer these four stars have come down to us with the name of the royal stars probably because they were so near to the four most important points in the apparent path of the sun amongst the stars there is also a celebrated passage in the first of virgils georgics which speaks of the white bull with golden horns that opens the year so when the mithraic religion adopted several of the constellation figures amongst its symbols the bull as standing for the spring equinox the lion for the summer solstice were the two to which most prominence was given and they are found thus used in mithraic monuments as late as the second or third century ad long after the ram had been recognized as the leading sign it is not possible to push back the origin of the constellations to an indefinite antiquity they cannot at the very outside be more than 5000 years old they must be considerably more than 4000 but during the whole of this millennium the sun at the spring equinox was in the constellation of the bull there is therefore no possible doubt that the bulland not the twins nor the ramwas the original leader of the zodiac the constellations therefore were designed long before the nation of israel had its origin indeed before abraham left ur of the chaldees the most probable date2700 bcwould take us to a point a little before the flood if we accept the hebrew chronology a few centuries after the flood if we accept the septuagint chronology just as the next great age of astronomical activity which i have termed the classical began after the close of the canon of the old testament scriptures so the constellation age began before the first books of those scriptures were compiled broadly speaking it may be said that the knowledge of the constellation figures was the chief asset of astronomy in the centuries when the old testament was being written seeing that the knowledge of these figures was preserved in mesopotamia the country from which abraham came out and that they were in existence long before his day it is not unreasonable to suppose that both he and his descendants were acquainted with them and that when he and they looked upward to the glories of the silent stars and recalled the promise so shall thy seed be they pictured round those glittering points of light much the same forms that we connect with them today footnotes 1571 delitzsch is therefore in error when he asserts that when we divide the zodiac into twelve signs and style them the ram bull twins etc the sumerianbabylonian culture is still living and operating even at the present day babel and bible p 67 the constellations may have been originally designed by the akkadians but if so it was before they came down from their native highlands into the mesopotamian valley chapter ii genesis and the constellations as we have just shown the constellations evidently were designed long before the earliest books of the old testament received their present form but the first nine chapters of genesis give the history of the world before any date that we can assign to the constellations and are clearly derived from very early documents or traditions when the constellations are compared with those nine chapters several correspondences appear between the two remarkable when it is borne in mind how few are the events that can be plainly set forth in a group of fortyeight figures on the one hand and how condensed are the narratives of those nine chapters on the other look at the six southern constellations see pp 164 165 which were seen during the nights of spring in that distant time the largest of these six is a great ship resting on the southern horizon just above a raven is perched on the stretchedout body of a reptile a figure of a centaur appears to have just left the ship and is represented as offering up an animal on an altar the animal is now shown as a wolf but aratus our earliest authority states that he did not know what kind of animal it was that was being thus offered up the cloud of smoke from the altar is represented by the bright coiling wreaths of the milky way and here in the midst of that cloud is set the bowthe bow of sagittarius the archer is it possible that this can be mere coincidence or was it indeed intended as a memorial of the covenant which god made with noah and with his children for everi do set my bow in the cloud and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth close by this group was another made up of five constellations towards the south near midnight in spring the observer in those ancient times saw the scorpion the figure of a man was standing upon that venomous beast with his left foot pressed firmly down upon its head but the scorpions tail was curled up to sting him in the right heel ophiuchus the serpentholder the man treading on the scorpion derives his name from the serpent which he holds in his hands and strangles the serpent that as we have seen in the preceding chapter marked the autumnal colure the head of ophiuchus reached nearly to the zenith and there close to it was the head of another hero so close that to complete the form of the two heads the same stars must be used to some extent twice over facing north this second hero now known to us as hercules but to aratus simply as the kneeler was seen kneeling with his foot on the head of the great northern dragon this great conflict between the man and the serpent therefore was presented in a twofold form looking south there was the picture of ophiuchus trampling on the scorpion and strangling the snake yet wounded in the heel by the scorpions sting looking north the corresponding picture of the kneeling figure of hercules treading down the dragons head here there seems an evident reference to the word spoken by god to the serpent in the garden in eden i will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel illustration the midnight constellations of spring bc 2700 these two groups of starfigures seem therefore to point to the two great promises made to mankind and recorded in the early chapters of genesis the promise of the deliverer who seed of the woman should bruise the serpents head and the promise of the bow set in the cloud the pledge that the world should not again be destroyed by a flood illustration the midnight constellations of winter bc 2700 one or two other constellations appear less distinctly to refer to the first of these two promises the virgin the woman of the zodiac carries in her hand a bright star the ear of corn the seed whilst immediately under her the great watersnake hydra is drawn out at enormous length going on its belly not writhing upwards like the serpent nor twined round the crown of the sky like the dragon yet again the narrative in genesis tells us that god drove out the man i e adam and he placed at the east of the garden of eden the cherubim and the flame of a sword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life no description is given of the form of the cherubim in that passage but they are fully described by ezekiel who saw them in vision when he was by the river chebar as the likeness of four living creatures the same beings were also seen in vision by st john and are described by him in the apocalypse as four living creatures zoa the first creature was like a lion and the second creature like a calf and the third creature had a face as of a man and the fourth creature was like a flying eagle ezekiel gives a fuller and more complex description but agreeing in its essential elements with that given by the apostle and at the close of one of these descriptions he adds this is the living creature that i saw under the god of israel by the river of chebar and i knew that they were cherubimno doubt because as a priest he had been familiar with the cherubic forms as they were embroidered upon the curtains of the temple and carved upon its walls and doors the same four forms were seen amongst the constellation figures not placed at random amongst them but as far as possible in the four most important positions in the sky for the constellations were originally so designed that the sun at the time of the summer solstice was in the middle of the constellation leo the lion at the time of the spring equinox in the middle of taurus the bull and at the time of the winter solstice in the middle of aquarius the man bearing the waterpot the fourth point that held by the sun at the autumnal equinox would appear to have been already assigned to the foot of the serpentholder as he crushes down the scorpions head but a flying eagle aquila is placed as near the equinoctial point as seems to have been consistent with the ample space that it was desired to give to the emblems of the great conflict between the deliverer and the serpent thus as in the vision of ezekiel so in the constellation figures the lion the ox the man and the eagle stood as the upholders of the firmament as the pillars of heaven they looked down like watchers upon all creation they seemed to guard the four quarters of the sky if we accept an old jewish tradition the constellations may likewise give us some hint of an event recorded in the tenth chapter of genesis for it has been supposed that the great stellar giant orion is none other than nimrod the mighty hunter before the lord and the founder of the babylonian kingdom identified by some assyriologists with merodach the tutelary deity of babylon and by others with gilgamesh the tyrant of erech whose exploits have been preserved to us in the great epic now known by his name possibly both identifications may prove to be correct more than one third of the constellation figures thus appear to have a close connection with some of the chief incidents recorded in the first ten chapters of genesis as having taken place in the earliest ages of the worlds history if we include the hare and the two dogs as adjuncts of orion and the cup as well as the raven with hydra then no fewer than twentytwo out of the fortyeight are directly or indirectly so connected but the constellation figures only deal with a very few isolated incidents and these are necessarily such as lend themselves to graphic representation the points in common with the genesis narrative are indeed striking but the points of independence are no less striking the majority of the constellation figures do not appear to refer to any incidents in genesis the majority of the incidents in the genesis narrative find no record in the sky even in the treatment of incidents common to both there are differences which make it impossible to suppose that either was directly derived from the other but it is clear that when the constellations were devisedthat is to say roughly speaking about 2700 bcthe promise of the deliverer the seed of the woman who should bruise the serpents head was well known and highly valued so highly valued that a large part of the sky was devoted to its commemoration and to that of the curse on the serpent the story of the flood was also known and especially the covenant made with those who were saved in the ark that the world should not again be destroyed by water the token of which covenant was the bow set in the cloud the fourfold cherubic forms were known the keepers of the way of the tree of life the symbols of the presence of god and they were set in the four parts of the heaven marking it out as the tabernacle which he spreadeth abroad for he dwelleth between the cherubim chapter iii the story of the deluge beside the narrative of the flood given to us in genesis and the pictorial representation of it preserved in the star figures we have deluge stories from many parts of the world but in particular we have a very striking one from babylonia in the epic of gilgamesh already alluded to the eleventh tablet is devoted to an interview between the hero and pirnapistim the babylonian noah who recounts to him how he and his family were saved at the time of the great flood this babylonian story of the deluge stands in quite a different relation from the babylonian story of creation in its bearing on the account given in genesis as we have already seen the stories of creation have practically nothing in common the stories of the deluge have many most striking points of resemblance and may reasonably be supposed to have had a common origin prof friedrich delitzsch in his celebrated lectures babel and bible refers to this babylonian deluge story in the following terms the babylonians divided their history into two great periods the one before the other after the flood babylon was in quite a peculiar sense the land of deluges the alluvial lowlands along the course of all great rivers discharging into the sea are of course exposed to terrible floods of a special kindcyclones and tornadoes accompanied by earthquakes and tremendous downpours of rain after referring to the great cyclone and tidal wave which wrecked the sunderbunds at the mouths of the ganges in 1876 when 215000 persons met their death by drowning prof delitzsch goes on it is the merit of the celebrated viennese geologist eduard suess to have shown that there is an accurate description of such a cyclone line for line in the babylonian deluge story the whole story precisely as it was written down travelled to canaan but owing to the new and entirely different local conditions it was forgotten that the sea was the chief factor and so we find in the bible two accounts of the deluge which are not only scientifically impossible but furthermore mutually contradictorythe one assigning to it a duration of 365 days the other of 40 3 x 7 61 days science is indebted to jean astruc that strictly orthodox catholic physician of louis xiv for recognizing that two fundamentally different accounts of a deluge have been worked up into a single story in the bible1711 the importance of the babylonian deluge story does not rest in anything intrinsic to itself for there are many deluge stories preserved by other nations quite as interesting and as well told it derives its importance from its points of resemblance to the genesis story and from the deduction that some have drawn from these that it was the original of that storyor rather of the two storiesthat we find imperfectly recombined in genesis the suggestion of jean astruc that two fundamentally different accounts of a deluge have been worked up into a single story in the bible has been generally accepted by those who have followed him in the minute analysis of the literary structure of holy scripture and the names of the priestly narrative and of the jehovistic narrative have for the sake of distinctness been applied to them the former is so called because the chapters in exodus and the two following books which treat with particular minuteness of the various ceremonial institutions of israel are considered to be by the same writer the latter has received its name from the preference shown by the writer for the use as the divine name of the word jehovahso spelt when given in our english versions but generally translated the lord there is a very close accord between different authorities as to the way in which genesis chapters viix should be allotted to these two sources the following is dr drivers arrangement priestly narrative jehovistic narrative chap verse chap verse genesis vi 922 genesis vii 15 vii 6 710 11 12 1316a 16b 17a 17b 1821 2223 24 viii 2b3a viii 12a 612 3b5 13b 13a 2022 1419 ix 117 the priestly narrative therefore tells us the cause of the floodthat is to say the corruption of mankind describes the dimensions of the ark and instructs noah to bring of every living thing of all flesh two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark to keep them alive with thee they shall be male and female it further supplies the dates of the chief occurrences during the flood states that the waters prevailed above the tops of the mountains that when the flood diminished the ark rested upon the mountains of ararat and gives the account of noah and his family going forth from the ark and of the covenant which god made with them of which the token was to be the bow seen in the cloud the most striking notes of the jehovistic narrative arethe incident of the sending out of the raven and the dove the account of noahs sacrifice and the distinction made between clean beasts and beasts that are not cleanthe command to noah being of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens the male and his female and of beasts that are not clean by two the male and his female the significant points of distinction between the two accounts are that the priestly writer gives the description of the ark the flood prevailing above the mountains the grounding on mount ararat and the bow in the cloud the jehovistic gives the sending out of the raven and the dove and the account of noahs sacrifice which involves the recognition of the distinction between the clean and unclean beasts and the more abundant provision of the former he also lays emphasis on the lords smelling a sweet savour and promising never again to smite everything living for the imagination of mans heart is evil from his youth the chief features of the babylonian story of the deluge are as followsthe god ae spoke to pirnapistim the babylonian noah destroy the house build a ship leave what thou hast see to thy life destroy the hostile and save life take up the seed of life all of it into the midst of the ship the ship which thou shalt make even thou let its size be measured let it agree as to its height and its length the description of the building of the ship seems to have been very minute but the record is mutilated and what remains is difficult to translate as in the priestly narrative it is expressly mentioned that it was pitched within and without the narrative proceeds in the words of pirnapistim all i possessed i collected it all i possessed i collected it of silver all i possessed i collected it of gold all i possessed i collected it the seed of life the whole i caused to go up into the midst of the ship all my family and relatives the beasts of the field the animals of the field the sons of the artificersall of them i sent up the god vsamavs appointed the time muir kukkiin the night i will cause the heavens to rain destruction enter into the midst of the ship and shut thy door that time approached muir kukkiin the night the heavens rained destruction i saw the appearance of the day i was afraid to look upon the day i entered into the midst of the ship and shut my door at the appearance of dawn in the morning there arose from the foundation of heaven a dark cloud the first day the storm swiftly it swept and like a battle against the people it sought brother saw not brother the people were not to be recognized in heaven the gods feared the flood and they fled they ascended to the heaven of anu the gods kenneled like dogs crouched down in the enclosures the gods had crouched down seated in lamentation covered were their lips in the assemblies six days and nights the wind blew the deluge and flood overwhelmed the land the seventh day when it came the storm ceased the raging flood which had contended like a whirlwind quieted the sea shrank back and the evil wind and deluge ended i noticed the sea making a noise and all mankind had turned to corruption i noted the regions the shore of the sea for twelve measures the region arose the ship had stopped at the land of nisir the mountain of nisir seized the ship and would not let it pass the first day and the second day the mountains of nisir seized the ship and would not let it pass the seventh day when it came i sent forth a dove and it left the dove went it turned about but there was no restingplace and it returned i sent forth a swallow and it left the swallow went it turned about but there was no restingplace and it returned i sent forth a raven and it left the raven went the rushing of the waters it saw it ate it waded it croaked it did not return i sent forth the animals to the four winds i poured out a libation i made an offering on the peak of the mountain seven and seven i set incensevases there in their depths i poured cane cedar and rosewood the gods smelled a savour the gods smelled a sweet savour the gods gathered like flies over the sacrificer then the goddess srtu when she came raised the great signets that anu had made at her wish these godsby the lapisstone of my necklet me not forget these days let me remember nor forget them for ever let the gods come to the sacrifice but let not bl come to the sacrifice for he did not take counsel and made a flood and consigned my people to destruction then bl when he came saw the ship and bl stood still filled with anger on account of the gods and the spirits of heaven what has a soul escaped let not a man be saved from the destruction ninip opened his mouth and spake he said to the warrior bl who but ae has done the thing and ae knows every event ae opened his mouth and spake he said to the warrior bl thou sage of the gods warrior verily thou hast not taken counsel and hast made a flood the sinner has committed his sin the evildoer has committed his misdeed be mercifullet him not be cut offyield let not perish why hast thou made a flood let the lion come and let men diminish why hast thou made a flood let the hyena come and let men diminish why hast thou made a flood let a famine happen and let the land be why hast thou made a flood let ura pestilence come and let the land be 1761 of the four records before us we can only date one approximately the constellations as we have already seen were mapped out some time in the third millennium before our era probably not very far from 2700 bc when was the babylonian story written does it itself afford any evidence of date it occurs in the eleventh tablet of the epic of gilgamesh and the theory has been started that as aquarius a watery constellation is now the eleventh sign of the zodiac therefore we have in this epic of twelve tablets a series of solar myths founded upon the twelve signs of the zodiac the eleventh giving us a legend of a flood to correspond to the stream of water which the man in aquarius pours from his pitcher if this theory be accepted we can date the epic of gilgamesh with much certainty it must be later probably much later than 700 bc for it cannot have been till about that time that the present arrangement of the zodiacal signsthat is to say with aries as the first and aquarius as the eleventhcan have been adopted we have then to allow for the growth of a mythology with the twelve signs as its motif had this supposed series of zodiacal myths originated before 700 bc before aries was adopted as the leading sign then the bull taurus would have given rise to the myth of the first tablet and aquarius to the tenth not to the eleventh where we find the story of the flood assyriologists do not assign so late a date to this poem and it must be noted that the theory supposes not merely that the tablet itself but that the poem and the series of myths upon which it was based were all later in conception than 700 bc one conclusive indication of its early date is given by the position in the pantheon of ae and bl ae has not receded into comparative insignificance nor has bl attained to that full supremacy which as merodach he possesses in the babylonian creation story we may therefore put on one side as an unsupported and unfortunate guess the suggestion that the epic of gilgamesh is the setting forth of a series of zodiacal myths any legends any mythology any pantheon based upon the zodiac must necessarily be more recent than the zodiac any system involving aries as the first sign of the zodiac must be later than the adoption of aries as the first sign that is to say later than 700 bc systems arising before that date would inevitably be based upon taurus as first constellation we cannot then from astronomical relationships fix the date of the babylonian story of the flood is it possible however to form any estimate of the comparative ages of the babylonian legend and of the two narratives given in genesis or of either of these two does the babylonian story connect itself with one of the genesis narratives rather than the other the significant points in the babylonian story are thesethe command to pirnapistim to build a ship with detailed directions the great rise of the flood so that even the gods in the heaven of anu feared it the detailed dating of the duration of the flood the stranding of the ship on the mountain of nisir the sending forth of the dove the swallow and their return the sending forth of the raven and its nonreturn the sacrifice the gods smelling its sweet savour the vow of remembrance of the goddess by the lapisstone necklace the determination of the gods not to send a flood again upon the earth since sin is inevitable from the sinner to all these points we find parallels in the account as given in genesis but it is in the priestly narrative that we find the directions for the building of the ship the great prevalence of the flood even to the height of the mountains the stranding of the ship on a mountain and the bow in the clouds as a covenant of remembrancethis last being perhaps paralleled in the babylonian story by the mottled blueandwhite lapis necklace of the goddess which she swore by as a remembrancer there is therefore manifest connection with the narrative told by the priestly writer but it is in the jehovistic narrative on the other hand that we find the sending forth of the raven and its nonreturn the sending forth of the dove and its return the sacrifice and the sweet savour that was smelled of the lord and the determination of the lord not to curse the earth any more for mans sake nor smite any more every living thing for the imagination of mans heart is evil from his youth there is therefore no less manifest connection with the narrative told by the jehovistic writer but the narrative told by the writer of the babylonian story is one single account even if it were a combination of two separate traditions they have been so completely fused that they cannot now be broken up so as to form two distinct narratives each complete in itself the whole story precisely as it was written down travelled to canaanso we are told and therewe are asked to believetwo hebrew writers of very different temperaments and schools of thought each independently worked up a complete story of the deluge from this gilgamesh legend they chose out different incidents one selecting what the other rejected and vice versa so that their two accounts were mutually contradictory they agreed however in cleansing it from its polytheistic setting and giving it a strictly monotheistic tone later an editor put the two narratives together with all their inconsistencies and contradictions and interlocked them into one which presents all the main features of the original gilgamesh story except its polytheism in other words two hebrew scribes each told in his own way a part of the account of the deluge which he had derived from babylon and a third unwittingly so recombined them as to make them represent the babylonian original the two accounts of the deluge supposed to be present in genesis therefore cannot be derived from the gilgamesh epic nor be later than it seeing that what is still plainly separable in genesis is inseparably fused in the epic on the other hand can the babylonian narrative be later than and derived from the genesis account since so many of the same circumstances are represented in both this is a more reasonable proposition if we assume that the babylonian narrator had the genesis account as it now stands and did not have to combine two separate statements for surely if he had the separate priestly and jehovistic narratives we should now be able to decompose the babylonian narrative just as easily as we do the one in genesis the babylonian adapter of the genesis story must have either been less astute than ourselves and did not perceive that he had really two distinct and contradictory narratives to deal with or he did not consider this circumstance of the slightest importance and had no objection to merging them inextricably into one continuous account it is therefore possible that the babylonian account was derived from that in genesis but it is not probable the main circumstances are the same in both but the details the presentment the attitude of mind are very different we can better explain the agreement in the general circumstances and even in many of the details by presuming that both are accountsgenuine traditionsof the same actual occurrence the differences in detail presentment and attitude are fully and sufficiently explained by supposing that we have traditions from two if not three witnesses of the event we have also the pictorial representation of the flood given us in the constellations what evidence do they supply here the significant points are the ship grounded upon a high rock the raven above it eating the flesh of a stretchedout reptile a sacrifice offered up by a person who has issued forth from the ship upon an altar whose smoke goes up in a cloud in which a bow is set in this grouping of pictures we have two characteristic features of the priestly narrative in the ship grounded on a rock and in the bow set in the cloud we have also two characteristic features of the jehovistic narrative in the smoking altar of sacrifice and in the carrion bird there is therefore manifest connection between the constellation grouping and both the narratives given in genesis but the constellational picture story is the only one of all these narratives that we can date it must have been designedas we have seenabout 2700 bc the question again comes up for answer were the genesis and babylonian narratives any or all of them derived from the pictured story in the constellations or on the other hand was this derived from any or all of them the constellations were mapped out near the north latitude of 40 far to the north of babylonia so the pictured story cannot have come from thence we do not know where the genesis narratives were written but if the flood of the constellations was pictured from them then they must have been already united into the account that is now presented to us in genesis very early in the third millennium before christ could the account in genesis have been derived from the constellations if it is a double account most decidedly not since the pictured story in the constellations is one and presents impartially the characteristic features of both the narratives and as in comparing the genesis and the babylonian narratives we see that though the main circumstances are the samein so far as they lend themselves to pictorial representationsthe details the presentment the attitude are different in the genesis narrative the bow set in the cloud is a rainbow in a cloud of rain in the constellation picture the bow set in the cloud is the bow of an archer and the cloud is the pillar of smoke from off the altar of sacrifice in the narratives of genesis and babylonia noah and pirnapistim are men no hint is given anywhere that by their physical form or constitution they were marked off from other men in the storied picture he who issues from the ship is a centaur his upper part is the head and body of a man his lower part is the body of a horse as before there is no doubt that we can best explain the agreement in circumstance of all the narratives by presuming that they are independent accounts of the same historical occurrence we can at the same time explain the differences in style and detail between the narratives by presuming that the originals were by men of different qualities of mind who each wrote as the occurrence most appealed to him the babylonian narrator laid hold of the promise that though beast or famine or pestilence might diminish men a flood should not again sweep away every living thing and connected the promise with the signetsthe lapis necklace of the goddess srtu that she touched as a remembrancer the picturer of the constellations saw the pledge in the smoke of the sacrifice in the spirit of the words of the lord as given by asaph gather my saints together unto me those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice the writer in genesis saw the promise in the raincloud for the rainbow can only appear with the shining of the sun the writer in genesis saw in noah a righteous man worthy to escape the flood of desolation that swept away the wickedness around there is no explanation apparent at least on the surface as to why the designer of the constellations made him who issued from the ship and offered the sacrifice a centaurone who partook of two natures the comparison of the deluge narratives from genesis from the constellations and from babylonia presents a clear issue if all the accounts are independent and if there are two accounts intermingled into one in genesis then the chief facts presented in both parts of that dual narrative must have been so intermingled at an earlier date than 2700 bc the editor who first united the two stories into one must have done his work before that date but if the accounts are not independent histories and the narrative as we have it in genesis is derived either in whole or in part from babylonia or from the constellationsif in short the genesis story came from a babylonian or a stellar myththen we cannot escape from this conclusion that the narrative in genesis is not and never has been two separable portions that the scholars who have so divided it have been entirely in error but we cannot so lightly put on one side the whole of the results which the learning and research of so many scholars have given us in the last centuryandahalf we must therefore unhesitatingly reject the theory that the genesis deluge story owes anything either to star myth or to babylonian mythology and if the genesis deluge story is not so derived certainly no other portion of holy scripture footnotes 1711 babel and bible johns translation pp 4246 1761 t g pinches the old testament in the light of the historical records of assyria and babylonia pp 102107 chapter iv the tribes of israel and the zodiac the earliest reference in scripture to the constellations of the zodiac occurs in the course of the history of joseph in relating his second dream to his brethren he said behold i have dreamed a dream more and behold the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me the word kochab in the hebrew means both star and constellation the significance therefore of the reference to the eleven stars is clear just as josephs eleven brethren were eleven out of the twelve sons of jacob so joseph saw eleven constellations out of the twelve come and bow down to him and the twelve constellations can only mean the twelve of the zodiac there can be no reasonable doubt that the zodiac in question was practically the same as we have now the one transmitted to us through aratus and ptolemy it had been designed quite a thousand years earlier than the days of joseph it was known in mesopotamia from whence his ancestors had come it was known in egypt that is to say it was known on both sides of canaan there have been other zodiacs thus the chinese have one of their own but we have no evidence of any zodiac except the one transmitted to us by the greeks as having been at any time adopted in canaan or the neighbouring countries there is no need to suppose that each of the brethren had a zodiacal figure already assigned to him as a kind of armorial bearing or device the dream was appropriate and perfectly intelligible to jacob to joseph and his brethren without supposing that any such arrangement had then been made it is quite true that there are jewish traditions assigning a constellation to each of the tribes of israel but it does not appear that any such traditions can be distinctly traced to a great antiquity and they are mostly somewhat indefinite josephus for instance makes a vague assertion about the twelve precious stones of the high priests breastplate each of which bore the name of one of the tribes connecting them with the signs of the zodiac now the names of all those sons of jacob were engraven in these stones whom we esteem the heads of our tribes each stone having the honour of a name in the order according to which they were born and for the twelve stones whether we understand by them the months or whether we understand the like number of the signs of that circle which the greeks call the zodiac we shall not be mistaken in their meaning1871 but whilst there is no sufficient evidence that each of the sons of jacob had a zodiacal figure for his coatofarms nor even that the tribes deriving their names from them were so furnished there is strong and harmonious tradition as to the character of the devices borne on the standards carried by the four divisions of the host in the march through the wilderness the four divisions or camps each contained three tribes and were known by the name of the principal tribe in each the camp of judah was on the east and the division of judah led on the march the camp of reuben was on the south the camp of ephraim was on the west the camp of dan was on the north and the division of dan brought up the rear and the traditional devices shown on the four standards were thesefor judah a lion for reuben a man and a river for ephraim a bull for dan an eagle and a serpent in these four standards we cannot fail to see again the four cherubic forms of lion man ox and eagle but in two cases an addition was made to the cherubic form an addition recalling the constellation figure for just as the crest of reuben was not a man only but a man and a river so aquarius is not a man only but a man pouring out a stream of water and as the crest of dan was not an eagle only but an eagle and a serpent so the great group of constellations clustering round the autumnal equinox included not only the eagle but also the scorpion and the serpent see diagram p 189 there appears to be an obvious connection between these devices and the blessings pronounced by jacob upon his sons and by moses upon the tribes indeed it would seem probable that it was the former that largely determined the choice of the devices adopted by the four great divisions of the host in the wilderness the blessing pronounced by jacob on judah runs judah is a lions whelp from the prey my son thou art gone up he stooped down he couched as a lion and as an old lion who shall rouse him up the lion of the tribe of judah is the title given to our lord himself in the apocalypse of st john illustration ophiuchus and the neighbouring constellations the blessing pronounced upon joseph by moses bears as emphatic a reference to the bull the firstling of his bullock majesty is his and his horns are the horns of the wildox jacobs blessing upon joseph does not show any reference to the ox or bull in our authorized version but in our revised version jacob says of simeon and levi in their anger they slew a man and in their selfwill they houghed an ox the first line appears to refer to the massacre of the shechemites the second is interpreted by the jerusalem targum in their wilfulness they sold joseph their brother who is likened to an ox and in the blessing of joseph it is said that his branches margin daughters run over the wall some translators have rendered this the daughters walk upon the bull wall and bull being only distinguishable in the original by a slight difference in the pointing of reuben his father said unstable as water thou shalt not excel and of dan dan shall be a serpent by the way an adder in the path that biteth the horse heels so that his rider shall fall backward these two last prophecies supply the water and the serpent which added to the man and eagle of the cherubic forms are needed to complete the traditional standards and are needed also to make them conform more closely to the constellation figures no such correspondence can be traced between the eight remaining tribes and the eight remaining constellations different writers combine them in different ways and the allusions to constellation figures in the blessings of those tribes are in most cases very doubtful and obscure even if it can be supposed that any such allusions are present at all the connection cannot be pushed safely beyond the four chief tribes and the four cherubic forms as represented in the constellations of the four quarters of the sky these four standards or rather three of them meet us again in a very interesting connection when israel reached the borders of moab balak the king of moab sent for a seer of great reputation balaam the son of beor to come curse me jacob and come defy israel balaam came but instead of cursing jacob blessed the people in four prophecies wherein he made what would appear to be distinct references to the standards of judah joseph and reuben behold the people riseth up as a lioness and as a lion doth he lift himself up then again he couched he lay down as a lion and as a lioness who shall rouse him up and in two passages god bringeth him forth out of egypt he hath as it were the strength of the wild ox the wild ox and lion are obvious similes to use concerning a powerful and warlike people these two similes are therefore not sufficient by themselves to prove that the tribal standards are being referred to but the otherwise enigmatical verse water shall flow from his buckets appears more expressly as an allusion to the standard of reuben the man with the river aquarius pouring water from his pitcher and if one be a reference to a standard the others may also well be illustration aquarius and the neighbouring constellations it is surely something more than coincidence that joseph who by his fathers favour and his own merit was made the leader of the twelve brethren should be associated with the bull or wild ox seeing that taurus was the leader of the zodiac in those ages it may also well be more than coincidence that when moses was in the mount and the people gathered themselves unto aaron and said unto him up make us gods which shall go before us for as for this moses the man that brought us up out of the land of egypt we wot not what is become of him aaron fashioned the golden earrings given him into the form of a molten calf into the similitude that is to say of taurus then prince of the zodiac if we turn to st stephens reference to this occurrence we find that he says and they made a calf in those days and offered sacrifice unto the idol and rejoiced in the works of their own hands then god turned and gave them up to worship the host of heaven in other words their worship of the golden calf was star worship it has been often pointed out that this sin of the israelites deep as it was was not in itself a breach of the first commandment thou shalt have no other gods before me it was a breach of the second thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above or that is in the earth beneath or that is in the water under the earth thou shalt not bow down thyself to them nor serve them the israelites did not conceive that they were abandoning the worship of jehovah they still considered themselves as worshipping the one true god they were monotheists still not polytheists but they had taken the first false step that inevitably leads to polytheism they had forgotten that they had seen no manner of similitude on the day that the lord spake unto them in horeb out of the midst of the fire and they had worshipped this golden calf as the similitude of god they had changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass and that was treason against him therefore st stephen said god turned and gave them up to worship the host of heaven the one sin inevitably led to the other indeed involved it in a later day when jeroboam who had been appointed by solomon ruler over all the charge of the house of joseph led the rebellion of the ten tribes against rehoboam king of judah he set up golden calves at dan and bethel and said unto his people it is too much for you to go up to jerusalem behold thy gods o israel which brought thee up out of the land of egypt there can be little doubt that in this case jeroboam was not so much recalling the transgression in the wildernessit was not an encouraging precedentas he was adopting the wellknown cognizance of the tribe of joseph that is to say of the two tribes of ephraim and manasseh which together made up the more important part of his kingdom as the symbol of the presence of jehovah the southern kingdom would naturally adopt the device of its predominant tribe judah and it was as the undoubted cognizance of the kingdom of judah that our richard i the crusader placed the lion on his shield more definitely still we find this one of the cherubic forms applied to set forth christ himself as the root of david prince of the house of judah behold the lion of the tribe of juda the root of david hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof footnotes 1871 josephus antiquities of the jews iii vii 57 chapter v leviathan there are amongst the constellations four great draconic or serpentlike forms chief of these is the great dragon coiled round the pole of the ecliptic and the pole of the equator as the latter was observed some 4600 years ago this is the dragon with which the kneeler hercules is fighting and whose head he presses down with his foot the second is the great watersnake hydra which 4600 years ago stretched for 105 along the celestial equator of that day its head was directed towards the ascending node that is to say the point where the ecliptic the suns apparent path crosses the equator at the spring equinox and its tail stretched nearly to the descending node the point where the ecliptic again meets the equator at the autumn equinox the third was the serpent the one held in the grip of the serpentholder its head erected itself just above the autumn equinox and reached up as far as the zenith its tail lay along the equator the fourth of these draconic forms was the great seamonster stretched out along the horizon with a double rivereridanusproceeding from it just below the spring equinox illustration hercules and draco none of these four figures was suggested by the natural grouping of the stars very few of the constellationfigures were so suggested and these four in particular as so high an authority as prof schiaparelli expressly points out were not amongst that few their positions show that they were designed some 4600 years ago and that they have not been materially altered down to the present time though no forms or semblances of forms are there in the heavens yet we still seem to see as we look upwards not merely the stars themselves but the same snakes and dragons first imagined so many ages ago as coiling amongst them the tradition of these serpentine forms and of their peculiar placing in the heavens was current among the babylonians quite 1500 years after the constellations were devised for the little boundary stones often display amongst many other astronomical symbols the coiled dragon round the top of the stone the extended snake at its base see p 318 and at one or other corner the serpent bent into a right angle like that borne by the serpentholderthat is to say the three out of the four serpentine forms that hold astronomically important positions in the sky the positions held by these three serpents or dragons have given rise to a significant set of astronomical terms the dragon marked the poles of both ecliptic and equator the watersnake marked the equator almost from node to node the serpent marked the equator at one of the nodes the dragons head and the dragons tail therefore have been taken as astronomical symbols of the ascending and descending nodes of the suns apparent paththe points where he seems to ascend above the equator in the spring and to descend below it again in the autumn the moons orbit likewise intersects the apparent path of the sun in two points its two nodes and the interval of time between its passage through one of these nodes and its return to that same node again is called a draconic month a month of the dragon the same symbols are applied by analogy to the moons nodes indeed the dragons head symbol is the general sign for the ascending node of any orbit whether of moon planet or comet and the dragons tail symbol for the descending node we not only use these signs in astronomical works today but the latter sign frequently occurs figured exactly as we figure it now on babylonian boundary stones 3000 years old but an eclipse either of the sun or of the moon can only take place when the latter is near one of its two nodesis in the dragons head or in the dragons tail this relation might be briefly expressed by saying that the dragonthat is of the nodescauses the eclipse hence the numerous myths found in so many nations which relate how a dragon devours the sun or moon at the time of an eclipse illustration hydra and the neighbouring constellations the dragon of eclipse finds its way into hindoo mythology in a form which shows clearly that the myth arose from a misunderstanding of the constellations the equatorial watersnake stretching from one node nearly to the other has resting upon it crater the cup combining this with the expression for the two nodes the hindu myth has taken the following form the gods churned the surface of the sea to make the amrita cup the cup of the water of life and while the gods were drinking that nectar after which they had so much hankered a danava named rahu was drinking it in the guise of a god and when the nectar had only reached rahus throat the sun and the moon discovered him and communicated the fact to the gods rahus head was at once cut off but as the nectar had reached thus far it was immortal and rose to the sky from that time hath arisen a longstanding quarrel between rahus head and the sun and moon and the head swallows them from time to time causing eclipses rahus head marks the ascending ketu the tail the descending node this myth is very instructive before it could have arisen not only must the constellations have been mapped out and the equator and ecliptic both recognized but the inclination of the moons orbit to that of the sun must also have been recognized together with the fact that it was only when the moon was near its node that the eclipses either of the sun or moon could take place in other words the cause of eclipses must have been at one time understood but that knowledge must have been afterwards lost we have seen already in the chapter on the deep that the hebrew idea of tehom could not possibly have been derived from the babylonian myth of tiamat since the knowledge of the natural object must precede the myth founded upon it if therefore gen i and the babylonian story of creation be connected the one as original the other as derived from that original it is the babylonian story that has been borrowed from the hebrew and it has been degraded in the borrowing so in this case the myth of the dragon whose head and tail cause eclipses must have been derived from a corruption and misunderstanding of a very early astronomical achievement the myth is evidence of knowledge lost of science on the downgrade some may object that the myth may have brought about the conception of the draconic constellations a very little reflection will show that such a thing was impossible if the superstition that an eclipse is caused by an invisible dragon swallowing the sun or moon had really been the origin of the constellational dragons they would certainly have all been put in the zodiac the only region of the sky where sun or moon can be found not outside it where neither can ever come and in consequence where no eclipse can take place nor could such a superstition have led on to the discoveries abovementioned that the moon caused eclipses of the sun the earth those of the moon that the moons orbit was inclined to the ecliptic and that eclipses took place only near the nodes the idea of an unseen spiritual agent being at work would prevent any search for a physical explanation since polytheism is necessarily opposed to science there is a word used in scripture to denote a reptilian monster which appears in one instance at least to refer to this dragon of eclipse and so to be used in an astronomical sense job in his first outburst of grief cursed the day in which he was born and cried let them curse it that curse the day who are ready margin skilful to rouse up leviathan let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark let it look for light but have none neither let it behold the eyelids of the morning leviathan denotes an animal wreathed gathering itself in coils hence a serpent or some great reptile the description in job xli is evidently that of a mighty crocodile though in psalm civ leviathan is said to play in the great and wide sea which has raised a difficulty as to its identification in the minds of some commentators in the present passage it is supposed to mean one of the stellar dragons and hence the mythical dragon of eclipse job desired that the day of his birth should have been cursed by the magicians so that it had been a day of complete and entire eclipse not even the stars that preceded its dawn being allowed to shine the astronomical use of the word leviathan here renders it possible that there may be in isa xxvii an allusionquite secondary and indirect howeverto the chief stellar dragons in that day the lord with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent even leviathan that crooked serpent and he shall slay the dragon that is in the sea the marginal reading gives us instead of piercing crossing like a bar a most descriptive epithet for the longdrawnout constellation of hydra the watersnake which stretched itself for one hundred and five degrees along the primitive equator and crossed the meridian like a bar for seven hours out of every twentyfour the crooked serpent would denote the dragon coiled around the poles whilst the dragon which is in the sea would naturally refer to cetus the seamonster the prophecy would mean then that in that day the lord will destroy all the powers of evil which have as it were laid hold of the chief places even in the heavens in one passage the crooked serpent here used as a synonym of leviathan distinctly points to the dragon of the constellations in jobs last answer to bildad the shuhite he says he divideth the sea with his power and by his understanding he smiteth through the proud rv rahab by his spirit he hath garnished the heavens his hand hath formed the crooked serpent the passage gives a good example of the parallelism of hebrew poetry the repetition of the several terms of a statement term by term in a slightly modified sense a rhyme if the expression may be used not of sound but of signification thus in the four verses just quoted we have three terms in eachagent action objecteach appears in the first statement each appears likewise in the second the third statement in like manner has its three terms repeated in a varied form in the fourth thus his power his understanding divideth smiteth through the sea rahab the proud and his spirit his hand hath garnished hath formed the heavens the crooked serpent there can be no doubt as to the significance of the two parallels in the first dividing the sea i e the red sea is the correlative of smiting through rahab the proud one the name often applied to egypt as in isa xxx 7 for egypt helpeth in vain and to no purpose therefore have i called her rahab that sitteth still in the second adorning the heavens is the correlative of forming the crooked serpent the great constellation of the writhing dragon emphatically a crooked serpent placed at the very crown of the heavens is set for all the constellations of the sky there are several references to rahab as the dragon which is in the sea all clearly referring to the kingdom of egypt personified as one of her own crocodiles lyinginwait in her own river the nile or transferred by a figure of speech to the red sea which formed her eastern border thus in chapter li isaiah apostrophizes the arm of the lord art thou not it that cut rahab in pieces that pierced the dragon art thou not it that dried up the sea the waters of the great deep that made the depths of the sea a way for the redeemed to pass over and in psalm lxxxix we have thou rulest the raging of the sea when the waves thereof arise thou stillest them thou hast broken rahab in pieces as one that is slain thou hast scattered thine enemies with thy strong arm so the prophet ezekiel is directed son of man take up a lamentation for pharaoh king of egypt and say unto him thou wast likened unto a young lion of the nations yet art thou as a dragon in the seas in all these passages it is only in an indirect and secondary sense that we can see any constellational references in the various descriptions of the dragon that is in the sea it is the crocodile of egypt that is intended egypt the great oppressor of israel and one of the great powers of evil standing as a representative of them all the serpent or dragon forms in the constellations also represented the powers of evil especially the great enemy of god and man the dragon that old serpent which is the devil and satan so there is some amount of appropriateness to the watery dragons of the skyhydra and cetusin these descriptions of rahab the dragon of egypt without there being any direct reference thus it is said of the egyptian dragon in the seas i have given thee for meat to the beasts of the earth and to the fowls of the heaven and again i will cause all the fowls of the heaven to settle upon thee just as corvus the raven is shown as having settled upon hydra the watersnake and is devouring its flesh again pharaoh the egyptian dragon says my river is mine own and i have made it for myself just as cetus the seamonster is represented as pouring forth eridanus the river from its mouth illustration andromeda and cetus but a clear and direct allusion to this last grouping of the constellations occurs in the apocalypse in the twelfth chapter the proud oppressor dragon from the sea is shown us again with much fulness of detail there the apostle describes his vision of a woman who evidently represents the people of god being persecuted by a dragon there is still a reminiscence of the deliverance of israel in the exodus from egypt for the woman fled into the wilderness where she hath a place prepared of god that there they may nourish her a thousand two hundred and threescore days and the vision goes on and the serpent cast out of his mouth after the woman water as a river that he might cause her to be carried away by the stream and the earth helped the woman and the earth opened her mouth and swallowed up the river which the dragon cast out of his mouth this appears to be precisely the action which is presented to us in the three constellations of andromeda cetus and eridanus andromeda is always shown as a woman in distress and the seamonster though placed far from her in the sky has always been understood to be her persecutor thus aratus writes andromeda though far away she flies dreads the seamonster low in southern skies the latter baffled in his pursuit of his victim has cast the river eridanus out of his mouth which flowing down below the southern horizon is apparently swallowed up by the earth it need occasion no surprise that we should find imagery used by st john in his prophecy already set forth in the constellations nearly 3000 years before he wrote just as in this same book st john repeated daniels vision of the fourth beast and ezekiels vision of the living creatures as he used the wellknown details of the jewish temple the candlesticks the laver the altar of incense so he used a group of stellar figures perfectly well known at the time when he wrote in so doing the beloved disciple only followed the example which his master had already set him for the imagery in the parables of our lord is always drawn from scenes and objects known and familiar to all men in two instances in which leviathan is mentioned a further expression is used which has a distinct astronomical bearing in the passage already quoted where job curses the day of his birth he desires that it may not behold the eyelids of the morning and in the grand description of leviathan the crocodile in chapter xli we have his neesings flash forth light and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning canon driver considers this as an allusion probably to the reddish eyes of the crocodile which are said to appear gleaming through the water before the head comes to the surface this is because of the position of the eyes on the animals head not because they have any peculiar brilliancy it is an idea exclusively egyptian and is another link in the chain of evidence which connects the author of the poem with egypt the crocodiles head is so formed that its highest points are the eyes and when it rises obliquely to the surface the eyes are the first part of the whole animal to emerge the egyptians observing this compared it to the sun rising out of the sea and made it the hieroglyphic representative of the idea of sunrise thus horus apollo says when the egyptians represent the sunrise they paint the eye of the crocodile because it is first seen as that animal emerges from the water2091 in this likening of the eyes of the crocodile to the eyelids of the morning we have the comparison of one natural object with another such comparison when used in one way and for one purpose is the essence of poetry when used in another way and for another purpose is the essence of science both poetry and science are opposed to myth which is the confusion of natural with imaginary objects the mistaking the one for the other thus it is poetry when the psalmist speaks of the sun as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber for there is no confusion in his thought between the two natural objects the sun is like the bridegroom in the glory of his appearance the psalmist does not ascribe to him a bride and children it is science when the astronomer compares the spectrum of the sun with the spectra of various metals in the laboratory he is comparing natural object with natural object and is enabled to draw conclusions as to the elements composing the sun and the condition in which they there exist but it is myth when the babylonian represents bel or merodach as the solar deity destroying tiamat the dragon of darkness for there is confusion in the thought the imaginary god is sometimes given solar sometimes human sometimes superhuman characteristics there is no actuality in much of what is asserted as to the sun or as to the wholly imaginary being associated with it the mocking words of elijah to the priests of baal were justified by the intellectual confusion of their ideas as well as by the spiritual degradation of their idolatry cry aloud for he is a god either he is talking or he is pursuing or he is in a journey or peradventure he sleepeth and must be awakened such naturemyths are not indications of the healthy mental development of a primitive people they are the clear signs of a pathological condition the symptoms of intellectual disease it is well to bear in mind this distinction this opposition between poetry and myth for ignoring it has led to not a little misconception as to the occurrence of myth in scripture especially in connection with the names associated with the crocodile thus it has been broadly asserted that the original mythical signification of the monsters tehm livyathan tannim rahb is unmistakably evident of these names the first signifies the world of waters the second and third real aquatic animals and the last the proud one is simply an epithet of egypt applied to the crocodile as the representation of the kingdom there is no more myth in setting forth egypt by the crocodile or leviathan than in setting forth great britain by the lion or russia by the bear the hebrews in setting forth their enemies by crocodile and other ferocious reptiles were not describing any imaginary monsters of the primval chaos but real oppressors the egyptian with his house of bondage the assyrian which smote with a rod the chaldean who made havoc of israel altogether were not dreams and in beseeching god to deliver them from their latest oppressor the hebrews naturally recalled not some idle tale of the fabulous achievements of babylonian deities but the actual deliverance god had wrought for them at the red sea there the egyptian crocodile had been made meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness when the corpses of pharaohs bodyguard cast up on the shore supplied the children of israel with the weapons and armour of which they stood in need so in the day of their utter distress they could still cry in faith and hope yet god is my king of old working salvation in the midst of the earth thou didst divide the sea by thy strength thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces and gavest him to be meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood thou driedst up mighty rivers the day is thine the night also is thine thou hast prepared the light and the sun thou hast set all the borders of the earth thou hast made summer and winter footnotes 2091 p h gosse in the imperial bibledictionary chapter vi the pleiades the translators of the bible from time to time find themselves in a difficulty as to the correct rendering of certain words in the original this is especially the case with the names of plants and animals some sort of clue may be given by the context as for instance if the region is mentioned in which a certain plant is found or the use that is made of it or in the case of an animal whether it is clean or unclean what are its habits and with what other animals it is associated but in the case of the few scripture references to special groups of stars we have no such help we are in the position in which macaulays new zealander might be if long after the english nation had been dispersed and its language had ceased to be spoken amongst men he were to find a book in which the rivers thames trent tyne and tweed were mentioned by name but without the slightest indication of their locality his attempt to fit these names to particular rivers would be little more than a guessa guess the accuracy of which he would have no means for testing this is somewhat our position with regard to the four hebrew names kimah kesil ayish and mazzaroth yet in each case there are some slight indications which have given a clue to the compilers of our revised version and have in all probability guided them correctly the constellations are not all equally attractive a few have drawn the attention of all men however otherwise inattentive northamerican indians and australian savages have equally noted the flashing brilliancy of orion and the compact little swarm of the pleiades all northern nations recognize the seven bright stars of the great bear and they are known by a score of familiar names they are the plough or charless wain of northern europe the seven plough oxen of ancient rome the bier and mourners of the arabs the chariot or waggon of the old chaldeans the big dipper of the prosaic new england farmer these three groups are just the three which we find mentioned in the earliest poetry of greece so homer writes in the fifth book of the odyssey that ulysses there viewd the pleiads and the northern team and great orions more refulgent beam to which around the axle of the sky the bear revolving points his golden eye it seems natural to conclude that these constellations the most striking or at all events the most universally recognized would be those mentioned in the bible the passages in which the hebrew word kimah is used are the following god maketh arcturus orion and pleiades kimah and the chambers of the south job ix 9 canst thou bind the sweet influences of pleiades kimah or loose the bands of orion job xxxviii 31 seek him that maketh the seven stars kimah and orion amos v 8 in our revised version kimah is rendered pleiades in all three instances and of course the translators of the authorized version meant the same group by the seven stars in their free rendering of the passage from amos the word kimah signifies a heap or a cluster and would seem to be related to the assyrian word kimtu family from a root meaning to tie or bind a family being a number of persons bound together by the very closest tie of relationship if this be so we can have no doubt that our translators have rightly rendered the word there is one cluster in the sky and one alone which appeals to the unaided sight as being distinctly and unmistakably a family of starsthe pleiades the names ash or ayish kesil and kimah are peculiar to the hebrews and are not so far as we have any evidence at present allied to names in use for any constellation amongst the babylonians and assyrians they have as yet not been found on any cuneiform inscription amos the herdsman of tekoa living in the eighth century bc two centuries before the jews were carried into exile to babylon evidently knew well what the terms signified and the writer of the book of job was no less aware of their signification but the seventy who translated the hebrew scriptures into greek were not at all clear as to the identification of these names of constellations though they made their translation only two or three centuries after the jews returned to jerusalem under ezra and nehemiah when oral tradition should have still supplied the meaning of such astronomical terms had these names been then known in babylon they could not have been unknown to the learned men of alexandria in the second century before our era since at that time there was a very direct scientific influence of the one city upon the other this hebrew astronomy was so far from being due to babylonian influence and teaching that though known centuries before the exile after the exile we find the knowledge of its technical terms was lost on the other hand kima was the term used in all syriac literature to denominate the pleiades and we accordingly find in the peschitta the ancient syriac version of the bible made about the second century ad the term kima retained throughout but kesil and ayish were reduced to their supposed syriac equivalents whatever uncertainty was felt as to the meaning of kimah by the early translators it is not now seriously disputed that the pleiades is the group of stars in question the word kimah means as we have seen cluster or heap so also the word pleiades which we use today is probably derived from the greek pleiones many several greek poetsathenus hesiod pindar and simonideswrote the word peleiades i e rock pigeons considered as flying from the hunter orion others made them the seven doves who carried ambrosia to the infant zeus darcy thompson says the pleiad is in many languages associated with birdnames and i am inclined to take the bird on the bulls back in coins of eretria dica and thurii for the associated constellation of the pleiad2171the pleiades being situated on the shoulder of taurus the bull the hyades were situated on the head of the bull and in the euphrates region these two little groups of stars were termed together mastabbagalgalla the great twins of the ecliptic as castor and pollux were the twins of the zodiac in one tablet mina bi the sevenfold one and gutda the bullinfront are mentioned side by side thus agreeing well with their interpretation of pleiades and hyades the semitic name for the pleiades was also tmennu and these groups of stars worshipped as gods by the babylonians may possibly have been the gad and meni that troop and that number referred to by the prophet isaiah lxv 11 on many babylonian cylinder seals there are engraved seven small discs in addition to other astronomical symbols these seven small stellar discs are almost invariably arranged in the form or much as we should nowadays plot the cluster of the pleiades when mapping on a small scale the constellations round the bull it is evident that these seven little stellar discs do not mean the seven planets for in many cases the astronomical symbols which accompany them include both those of the sun and moon it is most probable that they signify the pleiades or perhaps alternatively the hyades possibly reference is made to the worship of the pleiades when the king of assyria in the seventh century bc brought men from babylon and other regions to inhabit the depopulated cities of samaria and the men of babylon made succothbenoth the rabbis are said to have rendered this by the booths of the maidens or the tents of the daughtersthe pleiades being the maidens in question generally they are the seven sisters hesiod calls them the seven virgins and the virgin stars the names given to the individual stars are those of the seven daughters of atlas and pleione thus milton terms them the seven atlantic sisters as we have seen p 189 the device associated expressly with joseph is the bull and jacobs blessing to his son has been sometimes rendered joseph is a fruitful bough even a fruitful bough by a well the daughters walk upon the bull that is the seven sisters the pleiades are on the shoulder of taurus aratus wrote of the number of the pleiades seven paths aloft men say they take yet six alone are viewed by mortal eyes from zeus abode no star unknown is lost since first from birth we heard but thus the tale is told illustration stars of the pleiades euripides speaks of these seven paths and eratosthenes calls them the sevenstarred pleiad although he describes one as allinvisible there is a surprisingly universal tradition that they were seven who now are six we find it not only in ancient greece and italy but also among the black fellows of australia the malays of borneo and the negroes of the gold coast there must be some reason to account for this widespread tradition some of the stars are known to be slightly variable and one of the fainter stars in the cluster may have shone more brightly in olden timethe gaseous spectrum of pleione renders it credible that this star may once have had great brilliancy alcyone now the brightest star in the cluster was not mentioned by ptolemy among the four brightest pleiads of his day the six now visible to ordinary sight are alcyone electra atlas maia merope and taygeta celoeno is the next in brightness and the present candidate for the seventh place by good sight several more may be made out thus maestlin the tutor of kepler mapped eleven before the invention of the telescope and in our own day carrington and denning have counted fourteen with the naked eye in clear mountain atmosphere more than seven would be seen by any keensighted observer usually six stars may be made out with the naked eye in both the pleiades and the hyades or if more than six then several more though with both groups the number of seven has always been associated in the new testament we find the seven stars also mentioned in the first chapter of the revelation the apostle st john says that he saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man and he had in his right hand seven stars later in the same chapter it is explained that the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches the seven stars in a single compact cluster thus stand for the church in its many diversities and its essential unity this beautiful little constellation has become associated with a foolish fable when it was first found that not only did the planets move round the sun in orbits but that the sun itself also was travelling rapidly through space a german astronomer mdler hazarded the suggestion that the centre of the suns motion lay in the pleiades it was soon evident that there was no sufficient ground for this suggestion and that many clearly established facts were inconsistent with it nevertheless the idea caught hold of the popular mind and it has acquired an amazing vogue nonastronomical writers have asserted that alcyone the brightest pleiad is the centre of the entire universe some have even been sufficiently irreverent to declare that it is the seat of heaven the throne of god a popular london divine having noticed a bright ring round alcyone on a photograph of the group took that halo which every photographer would at once recognize as a mere photographic defect as a confirmation of this baseless fancy foolishness of this kind has nothing to support it in science or religion it is an offence against both we have no reason to regard the pleiades as the centre of the universe or as containing the attracting mass which draws our sun forward in its vast mysterious orbit r h allen in his survey of the literature of the pleiades mentions that drach surmised that their midnight culmination in the time of moses ten days after the autumnal equinox may have fixed the day of atonement on the 10th of tishri2211 this is worth quoting as a sample of the unhappy astronomical guesses of commentators drach overlooked that his suggestion necessitated the assumption that in the time of moses astronomers had already learned first to determine the actual equinox next to observe the culmination of stars on the meridian rather than their risings and settings and third and more important to determine midnight by some artificial measurement of time none of these can have been primitive operations we have no knowledge that any of the three were in use in the time of moses certainly they were not suitable for a people on the march like the israelites in the wilderness above all drach ignored in this suggestion the fact that the jewish calendar was a lunarsolar one and hence that the tenth day of the seventh month could not bear any fixed relation either to the autumnal equinox or to the midnight culmination of the pleiades any more than our easter sunday is fixed to the spring equinox on march 22 the pleiades were often associated with the late autumn as aratus writes men mark them rising with sols setting light forerunners of the winters gloomy night this is what is technically known as the acronical rising of the pleiades their rising at sunset in contrast to their heliacal rising their rising just before daybreak which ushered in the spring time this acronical rising has led to the association of the group with the rainy season and with floods thus statius called the cluster pliadum nivosum sidus and valerius flaccus distinctly used the word pliada for the showers josephus says that during the siege of jerusalem by antiochus epiphanes in 170 bc the besieged wanted for water until relieved by a large shower of rain which fell at the setting of the pleiades r h allen in his starnames and their meanings states that the pleiades are intimately connected with traditions of the flood found among so many and widely separated nations and especially in the delugemyth of chalda but he does not cite authorities or instances the talmud gives a curious legend connecting the pleiades with the flood when the holy one blessed be he wished to bring the deluge upon the world he took two stars out of pleiades and thus let the deluge loose and when he wished to arrest it he took two stars out of arcturus and stopped it2231 it would seem from this that the rabbis connected the number of visible stars with the number of the family in the arkwith the few that is eight souls saved by water of whom st peter speaks six pleiades only are usually seen by the naked eye traditionally seven were seen but the rabbis assumed that two not one were lost perhaps we may trace a reference to this supposed association of kimah with the flood in the passage from amos already quoted seek him that maketh the seven stars and orion that calleth for the waters of the sea and poureth them out upon the face of the earth the lord is his name many ancient nations have set apart days in the late autumn in honour of the dead no doubt because the year was then considered as dead this season being marked by the acronical rising of the pleiades that group has become associated with such observances there is however no reference to any custom of this kind in scripture what is the meaning of the inquiry addressed to job by the almighty canst thou bind the sweet influences of pleiades what was the meaning which it possessed in the thought of the writer of the book what was the meaning which we should now put on such an inquiry looking at the constellations from the standpoint which the researches of modern astronomy have given us the first meaning of the text would appear to be connected with the apparent movement of the sun amongst the stars in the course of the year we cannot see the stars by daylight or see directly where the sun is situated with respect to them but in very early times men learnt to associate the seasons of the year with the stars which were last seen in the morning above the place where the sun was about to rise in the technical term once in use with the heliacal risings of stars when the constellations were first designed the pleiades rose heliacally at the beginning of april and were the sign of the return of spring thus aratus in his constellation poem writes men mark them i e the pleiades rising with the solar ray the harbinger of summers brighter day they heralded therefore the revival of nature from her winter sleep the time of which the kingly poet sang so alluringly for lo the winter is past the rain is over and gone the flowers appear on the earth the time of the singing of birds is come and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land the figtree ripeneth her green figs and the vines are in blossom they give forth their fragrance the constellation which thus heralded the return of this genial season was poetically taken as representing the power and influence of spring their sweet influences were those that had rolled away the gravestone of snow and ice which had lain upon the winter tomb of nature theirs was the power that brought the flowers up from under the turf earths constellations of a million varied stars to shine upwards in answer to the constellations of heaven above their influences filled copse and wood with the songs of happy birds theirs stirred anew the sap in the veins of the trees and drew forth their reawakened strength in bud and blossom theirs was the bleating of the newborn lambs theirs the murmur of the reviving bees upon this view then the question to job was in effect what control hast thou over the powers of nature canst thou hold back the sun from shining in springtimefrom quickening flower and herb and tree with its gracious warmth this is gods work year by year over a thousand lands on a million hills in a million valleys what canst thou do to hinder it the question was a striking one one which must have appealed to the patriarch evidently a keen observer and lover of nature and it was entirely in line with the other inquiries addressed to him in the same chapter where wast thou when i laid the foundations of the earth the revised version renders the question canst thou bind the cluster of the pleiades reading the hebrew word maanaddoth instead of maadannoth following in this all the most ancient versions on this view job is in effect asked canst thou gather together the stars in the family of the pleiades and keep them in their places the expression of a chain or band is one suggested by the appearance of the group to the eye but it is no less appropriate in the knowledge which photography and great telescopes have given us to quote from miss clerkes description of the nebula discovered round the brighter stars of the pleiadesalcyone asterope celoeno electra maia merope and taygeta besides the maia vortex the paris photographs depicted a series of nebulous bars on either side of merope and a curious streak extending like a fingerpost from electra towards alcyone streamers and fleecy masses of cosmical fog seem almost to fill the spaces between the stars as clouds choke a mountain valley the chief points of its concentration are the four stars alcyone merope maia and electra but it includes as well celoeno and taygeta and is traceable southward from asterope over an arc of 1 10 the greater part of the constellation is shown as veiled in nebulous matter of most unequal densities in some places it lies in heavy folds and wreaths in others it barely qualifies the darkness of the skyground the details of its distribution come out with remarkable clearness and are evidently to a large extent prescribed by the relative situations of the stars their lines of junction are frequently marked by nebulous rays establishing between them no doubt relations of great physical importance and masses of nebula in numerous instances seem as if pulled out of shape and drawn into festoons by the attractions of neighbouring stars but the strangest exemplification of this filamentous tendency is in a fine threadlike process 3 or 4 wide but 35 to 40 long issuing in an easterly direction from the edge of the nebula about maia and stringing together seven stars met in its advance like beads on a rosary the largest of these is apparently the occasion of a slight deviation from its otherwise rectilinear course a second similar but shorter streak runs likewise east and west through the midst of the formation2291 illustration nebulosities of the pleiades photographed by dr max wolf heidelberg later photographs have shown that not only are the several stars of the pleiades linked together by nebulous filaments but the whole cluster is embedded in a nebulous net that spreads its meshes far out into space not only is the group thus tied or bound together by nebulous clouds it has other tokens of forming but a single family the movements of the several stars have been carefully measured and for the most part the entire cluster is drifting in the same direction a few stars do not share in the common motion and are probably apparent members seen in perspective projected on the group but in reality much nearer to us the members of the group also show a family likeness in constitution when the spectroscope is turned upon it the chief stars are seen to closely resemble each other the principal lines in their spectra being those of hydrogen and these are seen as broad and diffused bands so that the spectrum we see resembles that of the brightest star of the heavens sirius there can be little doubt but that the leaders of the group are actually greater brighter suns than sirius itself we do not know the exact distance of the pleiades they are so far off that we can scarcely do more than make a guess at it but it is probable that they are so far distant that our sun at like distance would prove much too faint to be seen at all by the naked eye the pleiades then would seem to be a most glorious starsystem not yet come to its full growth from the standpoint of modern science we may interpret the chain or the sweet influences of the pleiades as consisting in the enfolding wisps of nebulosity which still as it were knit together those vast young suns or and in all probability more truly as that mysterious force of gravitation which holds the mighty system together and in obedience to which the group has taken its present shape the question if asked us today would be in effect canst thou bind together by nebulous chains scores of suns far more glorious than thine own and scattered over many millions of millions of miles of space or canst thou loosen the attraction which those suns exercise upon each other and move them hither and thither at thy will footnotes 2171 glossary of greek birds pp 28 29 2211 r h allen star names and their meanings p 401 2231 berachoth fol 59 col 1 2291 the system of the

that maketh and transformeth all things once in job it is rendered hesperus the evening star and in the other two instances it is given as orion the tradition of the real meaning of the word as an astronomical term had been lost or at least much confused before the septuagint version was undertaken the jews had not so far as there is any present evidence learned the term in babylon for the word has not yet been found as a starname on any cuneiform inscription it was well known before the exile for amos and isaiah both use it and the fact that the author of job also uses it indicates that he did not gain his knowledge of the constellation during the babylonian captivity the majority of translators and commentators have however agreed in believing that the brightest and most splendid constellation in the sky is intendedthe one which we know as orion this constellation is one of the very few in which the natural grouping of the stars seems to suggest the figure that has been connected with it four bright stars in a great trapezium are taken to mark the two shoulders and the two legs of a gigantic warrior a row of three bright stars midway between the four first named suggest his gemmed belt another row of stars straight down from the centre star of the belt presents his sword a compact cluster of three stars marks his head a gigantic warrior armed for the battle seems thus to be outlined in the heavens as longfellow describes him begirt with many a blazing star stood the great giant algebar orion hunter of the beast his sword hung gleaming by his side and on his arm the lions hide scattered across the midnight air the golden radiance of its hair in accord with the form naturally suggested by the grouping of the stars the syrians have called the constellation gabbara and the arabs al jabbar and the jews gibbor the brightest star of the constellation the one in the left knee now generally known as rigel is still occasionally called algebar a corruption of al jabbar though one of the fainter stars near it now bears that name the meaning in each case is the giant the mighty one the great warrior and no doubt from the first formation of the constellations this the most brilliant of all was understood to set forth a warrior armed for the battle there were gibborim before the flood we are told that after the sons of god came in unto the daughters of men and they bare children to them the same became mighty men gibborim which were of old men of renown but according to jewish tradition this constellation was appropriated to himself by a particular mighty man we are told in gen x that cush begat nimrod he began to be a mighty one gibbor in the earth and it is alleged that he or his courtiers in order to flatter him gave his name to this constellation just as thousands of years later the university of leipzic proposed to call the belt stars of orion stell napoleonis the constellation of napoleon2341 there was at one time surprise felt that deeply as the name of nimrod had impressed itself upon eastern tradition his name as such was nowhere found in the extensive literature which has come down to us from babylon it is now considered that the word nimrod is simply a hebrew variant of merodach the wellknown head of the babylonian pantheon he was probably the first king of babylonia or the first really great ruler of the country it is significant as mr t g pinches points out in his old testament in the light of the records from assyria and babylonia that just as in genesis it is stated that the beginning of his nimrods kingdom was babel and erech and accad and calneh so merodach is stated in the cuneiform records to have built babel and erech and niffer which last is probably calneh the hebrew scribes would seem to have altered the name of merodach in two particulars they dropped the last syllable thus suggesting that the name was derived from marad the rebellious one and they prefixed the syllable ni just as nisroch was written for assur from a linguistic point of view therefore the identification of nimrod as a changed form of merodach is fully justified illustration orion and the neighbouring constellations the attitude of orion in the sky is a striking one the warrior is represented as holding a club in the right hand and a skin or shield in the left his left foot is raised high as if he were climbing a steep ascent he seems to be endeavouring to force his way up into the zodiac andas longfellow expresses itto be beating the forehead of the bull his right leg is not shown below the knee for immediately beneath him is the little constellation of the hare by the early arabs sometimes called al kursiyy al jabbar the chair of the giant from its position behind orion are the two dogs each constellation distinguished by a very brilliant star the greater dog by sirius the brightest star in the heavens the lesser dog by procyon ie the dogs forerunner not far above orion on the shoulder of the bull is the little cluster of the pleiades there areas we have seenonly three passages where kimah literally the cluster or companythe group we know as the pleiadesis mentioned in scripture and in each case it is associated with kesil the foolorion several greek poets give us the same association likening the stars to rockpigeons flying from the hunter orion and hesiod in his works and days writes do not to plough forget when the seven virgins and orion set thus an advantage always shall appear in evry labour of the various year if oer your mind prevails the love of gain and tempts you to the dangers of the main yet in her harbour safe the vessel keep when strong orion chases to the deep the virgin stars there is a suggestion of intense irony in this position of orion amongst the other constellations he is trampling on the haremost timid of creatures he is climbing up into the zodiac to chase the little company of the pleiadesbe they seven doves or seven maidensand he is thwarted even in this unheroic attempt by the determined attitude of the guardian bull a similar irony is seen in the hebrew name for the constellation the mighty hunter the great hero whom the babylonians had deified and made their supreme god the hebrews regarded as the fool the impious rebel since orion is nimrod that is merodach there is small wonder that kesil was not recognized as his name in babylonia2381 the attitude of orionattempting to force his way upward into the zodiacand the identification of merodach with him gives emphasis to isaiahs reproach many centuries later against the king of babylon the successor of merodach thou hast said in thine heart i will ascend into heaven i will exalt my throne above the stars of god i will sit also upon the mount of the congregation in the sides of the north i will ascend above the heights of the clouds i will be like the most high in the sight of the hebrew prophets and poets merodach in taking to himself this group of stars published his shame and folly he had ascended into heaven but his glittering belt was only his fetter he was bound and gibbeted in the sky like a captive a rebel and who could loose his bands in the thirteenth chapter of isaiah we have the plural of kesilkesilim it is usually understood that we have here orion as the most splendid constellation in the sky put for the constellations in general but if we remember that kesil stands for nimrod or merodach the first proud tyrant mentioned by name in scripture the particular significance of the allusion becomes evident behold the day of the lord cometh cruel both with wrath and fierce anger to lay the land desolate and he shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it for the stars of heavens and the constellationsthat is the kesilim the nimrods or merodachs of the skythereof shall not give their light the sun shall be darkened in his going forth and the moon shall not cause her light to shine and i will punish the world for their evil and the wicked for their iniquity and i will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible the strictly astronomical relations of orion and the pleiades seem to be hinted at in amos and in job seek him that maketh the seven stars and orion and turneth the shadow of death into the morning and maketh the day dark with night in this passage the parallelism seems to be between the seven stars the pleiades with sunrise and orion with sunset now at the time and place when the constellations were mapped out the pleiades were the immediate heralds of sunrise shortly after the spring equinox at the season which would correspond to the early part of april in our present calendar the rising of orion at sunsethis acronical risingwas early in december about the time when the coldest season of the year begins the astronomical meaning of the bands of orion would therefore be the rigour in which the earth is held during the cold of winter it is possible that the two great stars which follow orion sirius and procyon known to the ancients generally and to us today as the dogs were by the babylonians known as the bowstar and the lancestar the weapons that is to say of orion or merodach jensen identifies sirius with the bowstar but considers that the lancestar was antares hommel however identifies the lancestar with procyon in the fifth tablet of the babylonian creation epic as translated by dr l w king there is an interesting account of the placing of the bowstar in the heavens after merodach had killed tiamat 75 the gods his fathers beheld the net which he had made 76 they beheld the bow and how its work was accomplished 77 they praised the work which he had done 78 then anu raised the in the assembly of the gods 79 he kissed the bow saying it is 80 and thus he named the names of the bow saying 81 longwood shall be one name and the second name shall be 82 and its third name shall be the bowstar in heaven shall it 83 then he fixed a station for it dr cheyne even considers that he has found a reference to these two stars in job xxxviii 36 who hath put wisdom in the inward parts lancestar or who hath given understanding to the heart bowstar but this interpretation does not appear to have been generally accepted the same high authority suggests that the astronomical allusions in amos may have been inserted by a postexilic editor thus accounting for the occurrence of the same astronomical terms as are found in job which he assigns to the exilic or postexilic period this seems a dangerous expedient as it might with equal reason be used in many other directions further it entirely fails to explain the real difficulty that kimah and kesil have not been found as babylonian constellation names and that their astronomical signification had been lost by the time that the seventy undertook their labours quite apart from the fact that the babylonians could not give the name of fool to the representation in the sky of their supreme deity the hebrews and the babylonians regarded the constellation in different ways several assyriologists consider that the constellations orion and cetus represent the struggle between merodach and tiamat and this conjecture is probably correct so far as babylonian ideas of the constellations are concerned for tiamat is expressly identified on a babylonian tablet with a constellation near the ecliptic2411 but this means that the myth originated in the star figures and was the babylonian interpretation of them in this case cetusthat is tiamatmust have been considered as a goddess and as directly and immediately the ancestress of all the gods orionmerodachmust have been likewise a god the greatgreatgrandson of tiamat whom he destroys the hebrew conception was altogether different neither merodach nor tiamat nor the constellations of orion and cetus nor the actual stars of which they are composed are anything but creatures jehovah has made orion as well as the seven stars as his hand hath formed the crooked serpent by the mouth of isaiah he says i form the light and create darkness i make peace and create evil i the lord do all these things the babylonian view was of two divinities pitted against each other and the evil divinity was the original and the originator of the good in the hebrew view even the powers of evil are created things they are not selfexistent and the hebrews took a different view from the babylonians of the story told by these constellations the hebrews always coupled orion with the pleiades the babylonians coupled orion with cetusthat is merodach with tiamat the view that has come down to us through the greeks agrees much better with the association of the constellations as held amongst the hebrews rather than amongst the babylonians the hunter orion according to the greeks chased the pleiadesthe little company of seven virgins or seven dovesand he was confronted by the bull in their view too the seamonster was not warring against orion but against the chained woman andromeda footnotes 2341 but the fact that napoleons name was thus coupled with this constellation does not warrant us in asserting that napoleon had no historical existence and that his long contest with the great seapower england with its capital on the river thames tehom was only a stellar myth arising from the nearness of orion to the seamonster in the skya variant in fact of the great babylonian myth of marduk and tiamat the dragon of the deep it seems necessary to make this remark since the process of astrologizing history whether derived from the bible or from secular writers has been carried very far thus dr h winckler writes down the account of the first three persian kings given us by herodotus as myths of aries taurus and gemini david and goliath too are but marduk and tiamat or orion and cetus but david has become the giant and goliath the dragon for goliath is claimed as a wordplay on the babylonian galittu ocean examining an arabic globe of date 1279 adthat is to say some 4000 years after the constellations were deviseddr winckler found that orion was represented as lefthanded he therefore used this lefthanded orion as the link of identification between ehud the lefthanded judge of israel and tyr the lefthanded mars of the scandinavian pantheon dr winckler seems to have been unaware of the elementary fact that a celestial globe necessarily shows its figures inside out we look up to the sky to see the actual constellations from within the sphere we look down upon a celestial globe from without and hence see the designs upon it as in the lookingglass 2381 dr cheyne says in a note on p 52 of job and solomon heb ksil the name of the foolhardy giant who strove with jehovah the chaldeoassyrian astrology gave the name kisiluv to the ninth month connecting it with the zodiacal sign sagittarius but there are valid reasons for attaching the hebrew popular myth to orion so col conder in p 179 of the hittites and their language translates the name of the assyrian ninth month cisleu as giant now sagittarius is in the heavens just opposite to orion so when in the ninth month the sun was in conjunction with sagittarius orion was in opposition in cisleu therefore the giant orion was riding the heavens all night occupying the chamber of the south at midnight so that the ninth month might well be called the month of the giant 2411 dr l w king tablets of creation appendix iii p 208 chapter viii mazzaroth we have no assistance from any cuneiform inscriptions as to the astronomical significance of ayish kimah and kesil but the case is different when we come to mazzaroth in the fifth tablet of the babylonian creation epic we read 1 he marduk made the stations for the great gods 2 the stars their images as the stars of the zodiac he fixed 3 he ordained the year and into sections mizrata he divided it 4 for the twelve months he fixed three stars 5 after he had the days of the year images 6 he founded the station of nibir to determine their bounds 7 that none might err or go astray 8 he set the station of bel and ea along with him in the third line mizrata cognate with the hebrew mazzaroth means the sections or divisions of the year corresponding to the signs of the zodiac mentioned in the second line there can therefore be little doubt that the translators who gave us our english versions are practically correct in the rendering of job xxxviii 32 which they give in the margin canst thou bring forth mazzaroth or the twelve signs in his season the foregoing extract from the fifth tablet of creation has no small astronomical interest merodach is represented as setting in order the heavenly bodies first of all he allots their stations to the great gods dividing to them the constellations of the zodiac and the months of the year so that the arrangement by which every month had its tutelary deity or deities is here said to be his work next he divides up the constellations of the zodiac not merely arranging the actual stars but appropriating to each constellation its special design or image third he divides up the year to correspond with the zodiac making twelve months with three stars or constellations to each in other words he carries the division of the zodiac a step further and divides each sign into three equal parts the decans of the astrologers each containing 10 deka of the ecliptic the statement made in line 4 refers to an important development of astronomy the constellations of the zodiac that is the groups made up of the actual stars are very unequal in size and irregular in shape the numerous theories ancient or modern in which the constellations are supposed to owe their origin to the distinctive weather of the successive months each constellation figure being a sort of hieroglyph for its particular month are therefore all manifestly erroneous for there never could have been any real fixed or steady correlation between the constellations and the months similarly the theories which claim that the ancient names for the months were derived from the constellations are equally untenable some writers have even held both classes of theory overlooking the fact that they mutually contradict each other but there came a time when the inconvenience of the unequal division of the zodiac by the constellations was felt to be an evil and it was remedied by dividing the ecliptic into twelve equal parts each part being called after the constellation with which it corresponded most nearly at the time such division was made these equal divisions have been called the signs of the zodiac it must be clearly understood that they have always and at all times been imaginary divisions of the heavens that they were never associated with real stars they were simply a picturesque mode of expressing celestial longitude the distance of a star from the place of the sun at the spring equinox as measured along the eclipticthe suns apparent path during the year the signs once arranged the next step was an easy one each sign was equivalent to 30 degrees of longitude a third of a sign a decan was 10 degrees of longitude corresponding to the week of ten days used in egypt and in greece this change from the constellations to the signs cannot have taken place very early the place of the spring equinox travels backwards amongst the stars at the rate of very little more than a degree in 72 years when the change was made the spring equinox was somewhere in the constellation aries the ram and therefore aries was then adopted as the first sign and must always remain such since the signs move amongst the stars with the equinox illustration position of spring equinox bc 2700 we cannot fix when this change was made within a few years but it cannot have been before the time when the sun at the spring equinox was situated just below hamal the brightest star of the ram this was about 700 bc the equal division of the zodiac must have taken place not earlier than this and with it the bull must have been deposed from the position it had always held up to that time of leader of the zodiac it is probable that some direct method of determining the equinox itself was introduced much about the same time this new system involved nothing short of a revolution in astronomy but the babylonian creation story implies that this revolution had already taken place when it was composed and that the equal division of the zodiac was already in force it is possible that the sixth and seventh lines of the poem indicate that the babylonians had already noticed a peculiar fact viz that just as the moon passes through all the signs in a month whilst the sun passes through only one sign in that time so the sun passes through all the signs in a year whilst jupiter passes through but one sign nibir was the special babylonian name of the planet jupiter when on the meridian and merodach as the deity of that planet is thus represented as pacing out the bounds of the zodiacal signs by his movement in the course of the year the planet also marks out the third part of a sign i e ten degrees for during onethird of each year it appears to retrograde moving from east to west amongst the stars instead of from west to east during this retrogression it covers the breadth of one decan ten degrees illustration position of spring equinox ad 1900 the babylonian creation epic is therefore quite late for it introduces astronomical ideas not current earlier than 700 bc in babylonia or anywhere else this new development of astronomy enables us also to roughly date the origin of the different orders of systematic astrology astrology like astronomy has passed through successive stages it began at zero an unexpected event in the heavens was accounted portentous because it was unexpected and it was interpreted in a good or bad sense according to the state of mind of the beholder there can have been at first no system no order no linking up of one specific kind of prediction with one kind of astronomical event it can have been originally nothing but a crude jumble of omens just on a level with the superstitions of some of our peasantry as to seeing hares or cats or magpies and the earliest astrological tablets from mesopotamia are precisely of this character but the official fortunetellers at the courts of the kings of nineveh or babylon must speedily have learned the necessity of arranging some systems of prediction for their own protectionsystems definite enough to give the astrologer a groundwork for a prediction which he could claim was dependent simply upon the heavenly bodies and hence for which the astrologer could not be held personally responsible and at the same time elastic enough to enable him to shape his prediction to fit in with his patrons wishes the astrology of today shows the same essential features this necessity explains the early babylonian tablets with catalogues of eclipses on all days of the month and in all quarters of the sky the great majority of the eclipses could never happen but they could be nonetheless made use of by a court magician if an eclipse of the sun took place on the 29th day and in the south he could always point out how exceedingly unpleasant things might have been for the king and the country if he the magician had not by his diligence prevented its happening say on the 20th and in the north a zulu witchdoctor is quite equal to analogous subterfuges today and no doubt his babylonian congeners were not less ingenious 3000 years ago such subterfuges were not always successful when a chaka or a nebuchadnezzar had to be dealt with but with kings of a more ordinary type either in zululand or mesopotamia they would answer well enough coming down to times when astronomy had so far advanced that a catalogue of the stars had been drawn up with their positions determined by actual measurement it became possible for astrologers to draw up something like a definite system of prediction based upon the constellations or parts of a constellation that happened to be rising at any given moment and this was the system employed when zeuchros of babylon wrote in the first century of our era his system must have been started later than 700 bc for in it aries is considered as the leader of the zodiac the constellations are already disestablished in favour of the signs and the signs are each divided into three a practical drawback to this particular astrological system was that the aspect presented by the heavens on one evening was precisely the same as that presented on the next evening four minutes earlier the field for prediction therefore was very limited and repeated itself too much for the purpose of fortunetellers the introduction of the planets into astrology gave a greater diversity to the material used by the fortunetellers an early phase of planetary astrology consisted in the allotment of a planet to each hour of the day and also to each day of the week it has been already shown in the chapter on saturn and astrology that this system arose from the ptolemaic idea of the solar system grafted on the egyptian division of the day into twentyfour hours and applied to the week of seven days it probably originated in alexandria and arose not earlier than the third century before our era mathematical astrologythe complex system now in vogueinvolves a considerable knowledge of the apparent movements of the planets and a development of mathematics such as did not exist until the days of hipparchus it also employs the purely imaginary signs of the zodiac not the constellations and reckons the first point of aries as at the spring equinox so far as we can ascertain the spring equinox marked the first point of the constellation aries about bc 110 all these varied forms of astrology are therefore comparatively recent before that it was of course reckoned ominous if an eclipse took place or a comet was seen or a bright planet came near the moon just as spilling salt or crossing knives may be reckoned ominous today the omens had as little to do with observation or with anything that could be called scientific in the one case as in the other it is important to realize that astrology as anything more than the crude observance of omens is younger than astronomy by at least 2000 years mazzaroth occurs only once in the bible viz in job xxxviii 32 already so often quoted but a similar word mazzaloth occurs in 2 kings xxiii 5 where it is said that josiah put down the idolatrous priests them also that burned incense unto baal to the sun and to the moon and to the planets mazzaloth and to all the host of heaven the context itself as well as the parallel passage in deuteronomywhen thou seest the sun and the moon and the stars even all the host of heaven shouldst be driven to worship themshows clearly that celestial luminaries of some kind are intended probably certain groups of stars distinguished from the general host of heaven comparing job ix 9 with job xxxviii 31 32 we find ash or ayish kimah and kesil common to the two passages if we take ash and ayish as identical this leaves the chambers of the south as the equivalent of mazzaroth the same expression occurs in the singular in job xxxvii 9out of the south marg chamber cometh the whirlwind there need be but little question as to the significance of these various passages the correspondence of the word mazzaroth with the babylonian mizrata the divisions of the year answering to the twelve signs of the zodiac points in exactly the same direction as the correspondence in idea which is evident between the chambers of the south and the arabic al manazil the mansions or restingplaces of the moon in the lunar zodiac mazzaroth are therefore the divisions of the zodiac the chambers through which the sun successively passes in the course of the year his restingplace for a month they are the chambers of the south since that is their distinctive position in palestine the sun even at rising or setting at midsummer passes but little to the north of east or west roughly speaking the south is the suns quarter and therefore it is necessarily the quarter of the constellation in which the sun is placed it has been made an objection to this identification that the israelites are said to have worshipped mazzaloth and we have no direct evidence that the signs or constellations of the zodiac were worshipped as such but this is to make a distinction that is hardly warranted the creation tablets as we have seen distinctly record the allocation of the great gods to the various signs merodach himself being one of the three deities associated with the month adar just as in egypt a god presided over each one of the thirtysix decades of the year again it is probable that the golden calf worshipped by the israelites in the wilderness and after the disruption at bethel and at dan was none other than an attempt to worship jehovah under the symbol of taurus the leader of the zodiac and cognizance of the tribe of joseph regarded as a type of him who had been the leader of the people out of egypt and the giver of the blessings associated with the return of the sun to taurus the revival of nature in springtime it was intended as a worship of jehovah it was in reality dire rebellion against him and a beginning of the worship of mazzaloth and the heavenly host an idolatry that was bound to bring other idolatries in its train a threefold symbol found continually on babylonian monuments the triad of stars undoubtedly at one time set forth sin the moongod samas the sungod and ivstar in this connection possibly the planet venus it has therefore been suggested by prof schiaparelli that mazzaloth is the planet venus and since the word is plural in form venus in her double capacitysometimes an evening sometimes a morning star the sun and the moon and mazzaloth would then set forth the three brightest luminaries whilst the general congress of stars would be represented by the host of heaven but though venus is sometimes the brightest of the planets she is essentially of the same order as jupiter or mars and is not of the same order as the sun and moon with whom on this supposition she is singled out to be ranked moreover if ivstar or ashtoreth were intended in this passage it does not appear why she should not be expressly named as such especially as baal so often coupled with her is named the triad of stars too had originally quite a different meaning as will be seen later moreover the parallelism between job ix and job xxxviii is destroyed by this rendering since the planet venus could not be described as the chambers of the south these are therefore referred by professor schiaparelli to the glorious mass of stars in the far south shining in the constellations that set forth the deluge storythe ship and the centaur much the most brilliant region of the whole sky another interpretation of mazzaroth is given by dr cheyne on grounds that refute professor schiaparellis suggestion but it is itself open to objection from an astronomical point of view he writes mazzaroth is probably not to be identified with mazzaloth 2 kings xxiii 5 in spite of the authority of the sept and the targum mazzaroth ass mazarati mazzaloth ie the zodiacal signs seems to be the plural of mazzala ass manzaltu station2541 dr cheyne therefore renders the passage thus dost thou bring forth the moons watches at their season and the bear and her offspringdost thou guide them knowest thou the laws of heaven dost thou determine its influence upon the earth mazzaloth are therefore the zodiacal signs but mazzaroth the watches or stations of the moon which marked the progress of the month2542 or in other words the lunar zodiac but the lunar and the solar zodiac are only different ways of dividing the same belt of stars consequently when as in the passage before us reference is made to the actual belt of stars as a whole there is no difference between the two so that we are obliged as before to consider mazzaroth and mazzaloth as identical and both as setting forth the stars of the zodiac so far as the two zodiacs differ it is the solar and not the lunar zodiac that is intended this is evident when we consider the different natures of the apparent motions of the sun and the moon the sun passes through a twelfth part of the zodiac each month and month by month the successive constellations of the zodiac are brought out each in its own season each having a period during which it rises at sunset is visible the whole night and sets at sunrise the solar mazzaroth are therefore emphatically brought out each in its season not so the lunar mazzaroth the expression the watches or stations of the moon which marked the progress of the month is unsuitable when astronomically considered watches refer strictly to divisions of the day and night the stations of the moon refer to the twentyseven or twentyeight divisions of the lunar zodiac the progress of the month refers to the complete sequence of the lunar phases these are three entirely different matters and dr cheyne has confused them the progress of the moon through its complete series of stations is accomplished in a siderial monththat is twentyseven days eight hours but from the nature of the case it cannot be said that these stations are brought out each in his season in that time as a month makes but a small change in the aspect of the sky the moon passes through the complete succession of its phases in the course of a synodical month which is in the mean twentynine days thirteen hoursthat is to say from new to new or full to fullbut no particular star or constellation or station has any fixed relation to any one given phase of the moon in the course of some four or five years the moon will have been both new and full in every one of the lunar stations knowest thou the ordinances of heaven canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth he who has lived out under the stars in contact with the actual workings of nature knows what it is to watch mazzaroth brought out in his season the silent return to the skies of the constellations month by month simultaneous with the changes on the face of the earth overhead the glorious procession so regular and unfaltering of the silent unapproachable stars below in unfailing answer the succession of spring and summer autumn and winter seedtime and harvest cold and heat rain and drought if there be but eyes to see this majestic order so smooth in working so magnificent in scale will impress the most stolid as the immediate acting of god and the beholder will feel at the same a reverent awe and an uplifting of the spirit as he sees the action of the ordinances of heaven and the evidence of the dominion thereof in the earth dr cheyne however only sees in these beautiful and appropriate lines the influence upon the sacred writer of the physical theology of babylonia2561 in other words its idolatrous astrology the influence of the sky upon the earth but what would job understand by the question canst thou bring forth mazzaroth in his season just this canst thou so move the great celestial sphere that the varied constellations of the zodiac shall come into view each in their turn and with them the earth pass through its proper successive seasons the question therefore embraced and was an extension of the two that preceded it canst thou bind the sweet influences of the pleiades canst thou prevent the revival of all the forces of nature in the springtime and canst thou loose the bands of orion canst thou free the ground from the numbing frosts of winter the question to us would not greatly differ in its meaning except that we should better understand the mechanism underlying the phenomena the question would mean canst thou move this vast globe of the earth weighing six thousand million times a million million tons continually in its orbit more than 580 millions of miles in circuit with a speed of nearly nineteen miles in every second of time thus bringing into view different constellations at different times of the year and presenting the various zones of the earth in different aspects to the suns light and heat to us as to job the question would come as knowest thou the ordinances of heaven canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth it is going beyond astronomy yet it may be permitted to an astronomer to refer for comparison to a parallel thought not couched in the form of a question but in the form of a prayer thy will be done as in heaven so in earth footnotes 2541 rev

one of the constellations of the sky but the identification of which is doubtful in our authorized version the first passage is rendered thus god which maketh arcturus ash orion and pleiades and the chambers of the south and the second canst thou bind the sweet influences of pleiades or loose the bands of orion canst thou bring forth mazzaroth in his season or canst thou guide arcturus ayish with

rendered by the seventy as arktouros in the first passage as hesperos in the second passage and their rendering was followed by the vulgate the rendering hesper or vesper is absurd as the sons of hesper has no meaning arktouros is not improbably a misrendering of arktos the north which would give a free but not a literal translation of the meaning of the passage in another passage from job xxxvii 9 where the south wind is contrasted with the cold from another quarter of the sky the seventyagain followed by the vulgaterendered it as cold from arcturus now cold came to the jews as it does

version of the bible made about the second century after christ gives as the syriac equivalent for ash or ayish the word iyutha but it also renders kesil by the same word in amos v 8 so that the translators were evidently quite at sea as to the identity of these constellations we are also in doubt as to what star or constellation the syrians meant by iyutha and apparently they were in some doubt themselves for in the talmud we are told that there was a disputation held in the presence of the great teacher rabbi jehuda about 150 years after christ whether iyutha was situated in the head of the bull or in the tail of the ram oriental scholars now assign it either to aldebaran in the head of the bull the sons being in this case the other members of the hyades group of which aldebaran is the brightest star or else identifying it with the arabic elaiyuq the name of the star which the greeks call aix and we call capella the sons on this inference being the three small stars near called by the greeks and by ourselves the kids the word ash is used several times in scripture but without any astronomical signification and is there rendered moth as in isaiah where it says lo they all shall wax old as a garment the moth ash shall eat them up this literal significance of the word does not help as we know of no constellation figured as a moth or bearing any resemblance to one but the word ash or ayish does not differ importantly from the word nash in hebrew assembly in arabic bier which has been the word used by the arabs from remote antiquity to denote the four bright stars in the hindquarters of the great bear those which form the body of the plough moreover the three stars which form the tail of the great bear or the handle of the plough have been called by the arabs benat nash the daughters of nash the bear is the great northern constellation which swings constantly round the pole always visible throughout the changing seasons of the year there should be no hesitation then in accepting the opinion of the rabbi aben ezra who saw in ash or ayish the quadrilateral of the great bear whose four points are marked by the bright stars alpha beta gamma and delta and in the sons of ayish the three stars epsilon zeta and eta our revised version therefore renders the word as bear in both passages of job then we get the four quarters of the sky marked out as being under the dominion of the lord in the ninth chapter they are given in the order the bear which is in the north orion in its acronical rising with the sun setting in the west the pleiades in their heliacal rising with the sun rising in the east and the chambers of the south in the later passage they are given with fuller illustration and in the order the pleiades whose sweet influences are given by their heliacal rising in spring time with the sun rising in the east orion whose bands are those of winter heralded by his acronical rising with the sun setting in the west mazzaroth the constellations of the zodiac corresponding to the chambers of the south which the sun occupies each in its season the bear with its sons who always visible are unceasingly guided round the pole in the north the parallelism in the two passages in job gives us the right to argue that ash and ayish refer to the same constellation and are variants of the same name possibly their vocalization was the same and they are but two divergent ways of writing the word we must therefore reject prof schiaparellis suggestion made on the authority of the peschitta version of the scriptures and of rabbi jehuda who lived in the second century ad that ash is iyutha which is aldebaran but that ayish and his sons may be capella and her kids equally we must reject prof sterns argument that kimah is sirius kesil is orion mazzaroth is the hyades and ayish is the pleiades he bases his argument on the order in which these names are given in the second passage of job and on the contention of otfried mller that there are only four out of the remarkable groups of stars placed in the middle and southern regions of the sky which have given rise to important legends in the primitive mythology of the greeks these groups follow one after the other in a belt in the sky in the order just given and their risings and settings were important factors in the old greek meteorological and agricultural calendars prof stern assumes that kesil means orion and from this identification deduces the others neglecting all etymological or traditional evidences to the contrary he takes no notice of the employment of the same names in passages of scripture other than that in the thirtyeighth chapter of job here he would interpret the chain or sweet influences of kimah sirius the dog by assuming that the jews considered that the dog was mad and hence was kept chained up more important still he fails to recognize that the jews had a continental climate in a different latitude from the insular climate of greece and that both their agricultural and their weather conditions were different and would be associated with different astronomical indications in the 9th verse of the 37th chapter of job we get an antithesis which has already been referred to out of the south cometh the whirlwind and cold out of the north the hebrew word here translated north is mezarim a plural word which is taken literally to mean the scatterings for its interpretation prof schiaparelli makes a very plausible suggestion he says we may first observe that the five hebrew letters with which this name was written in the original unpointed text could equally well be read with a somewhat different pointing as mizrim or also as mizrayim of which the one is the plural the other the dual of mizreh now mizreh means a winnowingfan the instrument with which grain is scattered in the air to sift it and it has its root like mezarim in the word zarah which besides the sense dispersit bears also the sense expandit ventilavit2631 illustration stars of the plough as the winnowing fan if prof schiaparelli is correct in his supposition then the word translated north in our versions is literally the two winnowing fans names which from the form suggested by the stars we may suppose that the jews gave to the two bears in the sky just as the chinese called them the ladles and the americans call them the big dipper and the little dipper the sense is still that of the north but we may recognize in the word employed another jewish name of the constellation alternative with ash or ayish or perhaps used in order to include in the region the lesser as well as the greater bear we should not be surprised at finding an alternative name for this great northern constellation for we ourselves call it by several different appellations using them indiscriminately perhaps even in the course of a single paragraph what to job did the question mean which the lord addressed to him canst thou guide the bear and his sons to job it meant canst thou guide this great constellation of stars in the north in their unceasing round as a charioteer guides his horses in a wide circle each keeping to his proper ring none entangling himself with another nor falling out of his place what would the same question mean to us if addressed to us today in the first place we might put it shortly as canst thou turn the earth on its axis regularly and continuously so as to produce this motion of the stars round the pole and to make day and night but modern astronomy can ask the question in a deeper and a wider sense it was an ancient idea that the stars were fixed in a crystal sphere and that they could not alter their relative positions and indeed until the last century or two instruments were not delicate enough to measure the small relative shift that stars make it is within the last seventy years that we have been able to measure the annual parallax of certain starsthat is the difference in the position of a star when viewed by the earth from the opposite ends of a diameter of the earths orbit round the sun besides their yearly shift due to annual parallax most stars have a proper or peculiar motion of their own which is in most cases a very small amount indeed but can be determined more easily than annual parallax because its effect accumulates year after year if therefore we are able to observe a star over a period of fifty or a hundred or more years it may seem to have moved quite an appreciable amount when examined by the powerful and delicate instruments that we have now at our disposal observations of the exact positions of stars have been made ever since the founding of greenwich observatory so that now we have catalogues giving the proper motions of several hundreds of stars when these are examined it is seen that some groups of stars move in fellowship together through space having the same direction and moving at the same rate and of these companies the most striking are the stars of the plough that is ayish and his sons not all the stars move together out of the seven the first and the last have a different direction but the other five show a striking similarity in their paths and not only are their directions of movement and the amounts of it the same for the five stars but spectroscopic observations of their motion in the line of sight show that they are all approaching us with a speed of about eighteen miles a second that is to say with much the same speed as the earth moves in her orbit round the sun another indication of their family likeness is that all their spectra are similar a german astronomer dr hffler has found for this system a distance from us so great that it would take light 192 years to travel from them to us yet so vast is this company of five stars that it would take light seventy years travelling at the rate of 186000 miles in every second of time to go from the leading star merakbeta of the bearto mizarzeta of the bearthe final brilliant of the five so bright and great are these suns that they shine to us as gems of the second magnitude and yet if our sun were placed amongst them at their distance from us he would be invisible to the keenest sight dr hfflers estimate may be an exaggerated one but it still remains true that whilst the cluster of the pleiades forms a great and wonderful family group it is dwarfed into insignificance by the vast distances between these five stars of the great bear yet these also form one family though they are united by no nebulous bands and are at distances so great from each other that the bonds of gravitation must cease to show their influence yet all are alike all are marshalled together in their march under some mysterious law we cannot answer the question by what means are ayish and his sons guided much more are we speechless when we are asked canst thou guide them footnotes 2631 astronomy in the old testament p 69 illustration blow up the trumpet in the new moon book iii times and seasons chapter i the day and its divisions there is a difference of opinion at the present day amongst astronomers as to the time in which the planet venus rotates upon her axis this difference arises through the difficulty of perceiving or identifying any markings on her brilliantly lighted surface she is probably continually cloudcovered and the movements of the very faint shadings that are sometimes seen upon her have been differently interpreted the older observers concurred in giving her a rotation period of 23h 21m which is not very different from that of the earth many astronomers amongst them schiaparelli assign a rotation period of 225 days that is to say the same period as that in which she goes round the sun in her orbit the axis on which she rotates is almost certainly at right angles to the plane in which she moves round the sun and she has no moon we do not know if the planet is inhabited by intelligent beings but assuming the existence of such it will be instructive to inquire as to the conditions under which they must live if this view be correct and the rotation period of venus and her revolution period be the same venus would then always turn the same face to the sun just as our moon always turns the same face to us and so never appears to turn round venus would therefore have no days for on her one hemisphere there would be eternal light and on the other eternal darkness since she has no moon she has no month since she moves round the sun in a circle and the axis through her north and south poles lies at right angles to her ecliptic she has no seasons she can have no year on her daylight side the sun remains fixed in one spot in the sky so long as the observer does not leave his locality it hangs overhead or near some horizon north south east or west continually there are no hours therefore no divisions of time it might be almost said no time itself there are no points of the compass even no north south east or west no directions except towards the place where the sun is overhead or away from it there could be no history in the sense we know it for there would be no natural means of dating time must there be artificial uncertain and arbitrary on the night side of venus if her men can see the stars at all for cloud they would perceive the slow procession of stars coming out for venus turns continually to the heavensthough not to the sun mazzaroth would still be brought out in his season but there would be no answering change on venus her men might still know the ordinances of heaven but they could not know the dominion thereof set upon their earth this imaginary picture of the state of our sister planet may illustrate the fourteenth verse of the first chapter of genesis and god said let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years the making of the calendar is in all nations an astronomical problem it is the movements of the various heavenly bodies that give to us our most natural divisions of time we are told in deuteronomy the sun and the moon and the stars even all the host of heaven the lord thy god hath divided unto all nations under the whole heaven this is the legitimate use of the heavenly bodies just as the worship of them is their abuse for the division of timein other words the formation of a calendaris a necessity but as there are many heavenly bodies and several natural divisions of time the calendars in use by different peoples differ considerably one division however is common to all calendarsthe day the day is the first and shortest natural division of time at present we recognize three kinds of daysthe sidereal day which is the interval of time between successive passages of a fixed star over a given meridian the apparent solar day which is the interval between two passages of the suns centre over a given meridian or the interval between two successive noons on a sundial and the mean solar day which is the interval between the successive passages of a fictitious sun moving uniformly eastward in the celestial equator and completing its annual course in exactly the same time as that in which the actual sun makes the circuit of the ecliptic the mean solar days are all exactly the same length they are equal to the length of the average apparent solar day and they are each four minutes longer than a sidereal day we divide our days into 24 hours each hour into 60 minutes each minute into 60 seconds this subdivision of the day requires some mechanical means of continually registering time and for this purpose we use clocks and watches the sidereal day and the mean solar day necessitate some means of registering time such as clocks therefore the original day in use must have been the apparent solar day it must then have been reckoned either from sunset to sunset or from sunrise to sunrise later it might have been possible to reckon it from noon to noon when some method of fixing the moment of noon had been invented some method that is to say of fixing the true north and south and of noting that the sun was due south or the shadow due north our own reckoning from midnight to midnight is a late method midnight is not marked by the peculiar position of any visible heavenly body it has in general to be registered by some mechanical timemeasurer in the old testament scriptures the ecclesiastical reckoning was always from one setting of the sun to the next in the first chapter of genesis the expressions for the days run the evening and the morning as if the evening took precedence of the morning when the passover was instituted as a memorial feast the command ran in the first month on the fourteenth day of the month at even ye shall eat unleavened bread until the one and twentieth day of the month at even seven days shall there be no leaven and again for the sabbath of rest in the seventh month in the ninth day of the month at even from even unto even shall ye celebrate your sabbath the ecclesiastical day of the jews therefore began in the evening with sunset it does not by any means follow that their civil day began at this time it would be more natural for such business contracts as the hiring of servants or labourers to date from morning to morning rather than from evening to evening naturally any allusion in the scriptures to the civil calendar as apart from the ecclesiastical would be indirect but that common custom was not entirely in agreement with the ecclesiastical formula we may perhaps gather from the fact that in the old testament there are twentysix cases in which the phrases day and night day or night are employed and only three where night comes before day we have a similar divergence of usage in the case of our civil and astronomical days the first beginning at midnight and the second at the following noon since the daylight is the time for work in ordinary business life but the night for the astronomers the babylonians at least at a late date in their history had also a twofold way of determining when the day began epping and strassmaier have translated and elucidated a series of babylonian lunar calendars of dates between the first and second centuries before our era in one column of these was given the interval of time which elapsed between the true new moon and the first visible crescent curious to relate at first all father eppings calculations to establish this result were out by a mean interval of six hours the solution was found in the fact that the babylonian astronomers were not content with such a variable instant of time as sunset for their calculations as indeed they ought not to have been but used as the origin of the astronomical day at babylon the midnight which followed the setting of the sun marking the beginning of the civil day it may be mentioned that the days as reckoned from sunset to sunset sunrise to sunrise and noon to noon would give intervals of slightly different lengths this would however be imperceptible so long as their lengths were not measured by some accurate mechanical timemeasurer such as a clepsydra sandglass pendulum or spring clock the first obvious and natural division of the whole dayinterval is into the light part and the dark part as we have seen in genesis the evening and the morning are the day since palestine is a subtropical country these would never differ very greatly in length even at midsummer or midwinter the next subdivision of the light part of the day is into morning noon and evening as david says in the fiftyfifth psalm evening and morning and at noon will i pray none of these three subdivisions were marked out definitely in their beginning or their ending but each contained a definite epoch morning contained the moment at which the sun rose noon the moment at which he was at his greatest height and was at the same time due south evening contained the moment at which the sun set in the early scriptures of the old testament the further divisions of the morning and the evening are still natural ones for the progress of the morning we have first the twilight as in job let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark let it look for light but have none neither let it see the eyelids of the morning then daybreak as in the song of solomon until the day break literally breathe and the shadows flee away where the reference is to the cool breezes of twilight so too in genesis in joshua in the judges and in samuel we find references to the break of day literally the rising of the morning or when it became light to them and the dawning of the day or about the spring of the day the progress of the morning is marked by the increasing heat thus as the sun waxed hot the manna melted whilst saul promised to let the men of jabeshgilead have help by that time the sun be hot or as we should put it about the middle of the morning noon is often mentioned ishbosheth was murdered as he lay on a bed at noon and jezebels prophets called on the name of baal from morning even unto noon we find the afternoon lit till the day declined mentioned in the nineteenth chapter of the judges and in the same chapter this period is further described in the day draweth toward evening lit is weak and the day groweth to an end lit it is the pitching time of the day that is to say the time for pitching tents in preparation for the nightly halt as there was no dividing line between the morning and noontide neither was there any between the afternoon and evening the shadows of the night were spoken of as chased away by the cool breezes of the morning so the lengthening shadows cast by the declining sun marked the progress of the evening job speaks of the servant who earnestly desireth the shadow that is to say the intimation from the length of his own shadow that his days work was done and jeremiah says the shadows of the evening are stretched out then came sundown and the remaining part of the evening is described in proverbs in the twilight in the evening in the black and dark night in a country like palestine near the tropics with the days not differing extravagantly in length from one part of the year to another and the sun generally bright and shining and throwing intense shadows it was easy even for the uneducated to learn to tell the time of day from the length of the shadow here in our northern latitude the problem is a more complex one yet we learn from the canterbury tales that englishmen in the time of the plantagenets could read the position of the sun with quite sufficient accuracy for ordinary purposes thus the host of the tabard inn though not a learned man saw wel that the brighte sonne the ark of his artificial day had ronne the fourthe part and half an houre and more and though he was not depe experte in lore he wiste it was the eighte and twenty day of april that is messager to may and saw wel that the shadow of every tree was as in lengthe of the same quantitee that was the body erect that caused it and therfore by the shadow he toke his wit that phebus which that shone so clere and bright degrees was five and fourty clombe on hight and for that day as in that latitude it was ten of the clok he gan conclude2771 in the latter part of the day there is an expression used several times in exodus leviticus and numbers between the two evenings which has given rise to much controversy the lamb of the passover was killed in this period so also was the lamb of the first year offered daily at the evening sacrifice and day by day aaron was then commanded to light the seven lamps and burn incense it is also mentioned once in no connection with the evening sacrifice when the lord sent quails to the children of israel saying at even between the two evenings ye shall eat flesh in deuteronomy where a command is again given concerning the passover it is explained that it is at even at the going down of the sun the samaritans the karaite jews and aben ezra held the two evenings to be the interval between the suns setting and the entrance of total darkness i e between about six oclock and seven or halfpast seven a graphic description of the commencement of the sabbath is given in disraelis novel of alroy and may serve to illustrate this the original idea of between the two evenings the dead were plundered and thrown into the river the encampment of the hebrews completed alroy with his principal officers visited the wounded and praised the valiant the bustle which always succeeds a victory was increased in the present instance by the anxiety of the army to observe with grateful strictness the impending sabbath when the sun set the sabbath was to commence the undulating horizon rendered it difficult to ascertain the precise moment of his fall the crimson orb sunk below the purple mountains the sky was flushed with a rich and rosy glow then might be perceived the zealots proud in their talmudical lore holding the skein of white silk in their hands and announcing the approach of the sabbath by their observation of its shifting tints while the skein was yet golden the forge of the armourers still sounded the fire of the cook still blazed still the cavalry led their steeds to the river and still the busy footmen braced up their tents and hammered at their palisades the skein of silk became rosy the armourer worked with renewed energy the cook puffed with increased zeal the horsemen scampered from the river the footmen cast an anxious glance at the fading light the skein of silk became blue a dim dull sepulchral leaden tinge fell over its purity the hum of gnats arose the bat flew in circling whirls over the tents horns sounded from all quarters the sun had set the sabbath had commenced the forge was mute the fire extinguished the prance of horses and the bustle of men in a moment ceased a deep a sudden an allpervading stillness dropped over that mighty host it was night the sacred lamps of the sabbath sparkled in every tent of the camp which vied in silence and in brilliancy with the mute and glowing heavens in later times on account of ritualistic necessities a different interpretation was held so josephus says so these highpriests upon the coming of their feast which is called the passover slay their sacrifices from the ninth hour till the eleventh2791 and the talmud made the first evening to begin with the visible decline of the sun and the second with sunset or the two evenings to last from three till about six schiaparelli gives the first evening from sunset until the time that the newly visible lunar crescent could be seen in the twilight sky or about half an hour after sunset and the second evening from that until darkness set in basing his argument on the directions to aaron to light the lamps between the two evenings since he argues these would not be made to burn in the daylight probably in the days of moses and aaron the period could not be defined as accurately as this would imply as the opportunity of seeing the new moon could only come once a month and we have no evidence of any mechanical timemeasurer being then in use with them for shorter spaces of time we have the word moment or instant many times mentioned the words may mean the opening or winking of the eye the twinkling of an eye spoken of by st paul in his epistle to the corinthians and do not describe any actual duration of time or division of the day the only timemeasurer mentioned in the bible is the dial of ahaz which will form the subject of a later chapter it need only be noted here that as it depended upon the fall of the shadow it was of use only whilst the sun was shining not during cloudy weather or at night as the day had three main divisions so had also the night there were three watches each like the watches on shipboard about four hours in length so in the psalms the watches are twice put as an equivalent for the night the ancient hebrews would have no difficulty in roughly dividing the night into three equal parts whenever the stars could be seen whether they watched arcturus and his sonsthe circumpolar constellations moving round like a vast dial in the northor the bringing forth of mazzaroth the zodiacal constellations in the south they would soon learn to interpret the signs of night with sufficient accuracy for their purpose the first watch of night is mentioned in the book of lamentations arise cry out in the night in the beginning of the watches pour out thine heart like water before the face of the lord it was in the beginning of the middle watch and they had but newly set the watch that gideon and his gallant three hundred made their onslaught on the host of the midianites it was in the third the morning watch that the lord looked unto the host of the egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud and troubled the host of the egyptians as they pursued israel into the midst of the red sea in this watch also saul surprised the ammonites as they besieged jabeshgilead and scattered them so that two of them were not left together in the new testament the roman method of dividing the night is adopted viz into four watches when the disciples were crossing the sea of galilee in their little boat and they had toiled all night in rowing because the wind was contrary it was in the fourth watch of the night that jesus came unto them there is no mention of any mechanical timemeasurer in the old testament and in only one book is there mention in the english version of the word hour five times it is mentioned in the book of daniel as the rendering of the chaldean word shaah which literally means the instant of time no mention either is made of the differing lengths of the days or nights throughout the yearat midsummer the day is 1414 hours long and the night 934 job speaks however of causing the dayspring to know its place which may well refer to the varying places along the eastern horizon at which the sun rose during the course of the year thus in midwinter the sun rose 28 south of the east point or half a point south of ese similarly in midsummer it rose 28 north of east or half a point north of ene2821 the babylonians divided the whole day interval into twelve kasbu or double hours those again were divided into sixty parts each equal to two of our minutes this being about the time that is required for the disc of the sun to rise or set wholly the babylonian kasbu was not only a division of time but a division of space signifying the space that might be marched in a kasbu of time similarly we find in the old testament the expression a days journey or three days journey to express distance and in the new testament we find the same idea applied to a shorter distance in the sabbathdays journey which was about two miles but the jews in new testament times adopted not the babylonian day of twelve hours but the egyptian of twentyfour so we find in the parable of the labourers in the vineyard mention made of hiring early in the morning and at the third sixth ninth and eleventh hours and since those hired latest worked for but one hour it is evident that there were twelve hours in the daylight our lord alludes to this expressly in the gospel according to st john where he says are there not twelve hours in the day if any man walk in the day he stumbleth not because he seeth the light of this world but if a man walk in the night he stumbleth because there is no light in him footnotes 2771 the man of lawes prologue lines 44214434 2791 josephus wars vi ix 3 2821 see the diagram on p 363 chapter ii the sabbath and the week the present chapter has little if anything to do with astronomy for the week as such is not an astronomical period but the sabbath and the week of seven days are so intimately connected with the laws and customs of israel that it is impossible to leave them out of consideration in dealing with the times and seasons referred to in the bible the day the month and the year are each defined by some specific revolution of one of the great cosmical bodies there is in each case a return of the earth or of the earth and moon together to the same position relative to the sun as that held at the beginning of the period the week stands in a different category it is not defined by any astronomical revolution it is defined by the return of the sabbath the consecrated day a need for the division of time into short periods less than a month has been generally felt amongst civilized men business of state commercial arrangements social intercourse are all more easily carried out when some such period is universally recognized and so what we may loosely term a week has been employed in many ancient nations the aztecs using a short month of 20 days divided it into four quarters of 5 days each the egyptians using a conventional month of 30 days divided it into 3 decades and decades were also used by the athenians whose months were alternately of 29 and of 30 days hesiod tells us that the days regarded as sacred in his day were the fourth fourteenth and twentyfourth of each month the fourth and twentyfourth no grief should prey within thy breast for holy either day pierce on the fourth thy cask the fourteenth prize as holy and when morning paints the skies the twentyfourth is best the babylonians divided the month somewhat differently the seventh fourteenth nineteenth twentyfirst and twentyeighth days being regarded as sabbaths2841 the sabbath enjoined upon the hebrews was every seventh day the week as defined by it was a free week it was tied neither to month nor year but ran its course uninterruptedly quite irrespective of the longer divisions of time it was therefore a different conception from that underlying the usages of the greeks or babylonians and it may be added a more reasonable and practical one four origins have been assigned for the week there are those who assert that it is simply the closest possible approximation to the quartermonth the mean month being 2912 days in length a quartermonth would be 738 days and since fractions of a day cannot be recognized in any practical division of time for general use the week of seven days forms the nearest approach to the quartermonth that could be adopted this is undeniably true but it is far more likely that such an origin would give rise to the babylonian system than to the jewish one for the babylonian system corrected the inequality of quartermonth and week every month and so kept the two in harmony whilst the hebrew disregarded the month altogether in the succession of his weeks next it is asserted that the hebrew sabbath was derived from the babylonian and that it is scarcely possible for us to doubt that we owe the blessings decreed in the sabbath or sunday day of rest in the last resort to that ancient and civilized race on the euphrates and tigris2851 there are two points to be considered here did the babylonians observe their sabbaths as days of rest and were they or the hebrews the more likely to hand on their observances to another nation we can answer both these questions as to the first a large number of babylonian documents on tablets preserved in the british museum have been published by father strassmaier and discussed by prof schiaparelli in all there were 2764 dated documents available for examination nearly all of them commercial and civil deeds and covering practically the whole period from the accession of nebuchadnezzar to the twentythird year of darius hystaspes this number would give an average of 94 deeds for each day of the month the number actually found for the four sabbaths i e for the 7th 14th 21st and 28th days were 100 98 121 and 91 respectively the babylonians evidently did not keep these days as days of rest or of abstinence from business as the jews keep their sabbath or christian countries their sunday they cannot even have regarded it as an unlucky day since we find the average of contracts is rather higher for a sabbath than for a common day the case is a little different with the 19th day of the month this as the 49th day from the beginning of the previous month was a sabbath of sabbaths at the end of a week of weeks in this case only 89 contracts are found which is slightly below the average though twelve common days show a lower record still but in most cases the date is written not as 19 but as 201 as if there were a superstition about the number 19 on the other hand this method of indicating the number may be nothing more than a mode of writing just as in our roman numerals xix one less than xx is written for 19 the babylonians therefore did not observe these days as days of rest though they seem to have marked them in the ritual of temple and court nor did they make every seventh or every fifth a restday for prof schiaparelli has specially examined these documents to see if they gave any evidence of abstention from business either on one day in seven or on one day in five and in both cases with a purely negative result when we inquire which nation has been successful in impressing their particular form of sabbath on the nations around the case is clear we have no evidence of the babylonians securing the adoption of their sabbatic arrangements by the persians greeks and parthians who successively overcame them it was entirely different with the jews the jewish kingdom before the captivity was a very small one compared with its enemies on either sideassyria babylon and egypt it was but a shadow even of its former self after the return and imperial rome was a mightier power than assyria or babylon at their greatest if ever one state was secure from influence by another on the score of its greater magnitude and power rome was safe from any jewish impress yet it is perfectly well known that the impression made upon the romans by the jews in this very matter of sabbathkeeping was widespread and deep jewish influence was felt and acknowledged almost from the time that syria of which juda was but a petty division became a roman province and a generation had not passed away before we find horace making jocular allusion to the spread of the recognition of the jewish sabbath in his ninth satire he describes himself as being buttonholed by a bore and seeing a friend pass by as begging the latter to pretend business with him and so relieve him of his trouble his friend mischievously excuses himself from talking about business todays the thirtieth sabbath can you mean thus to insult the circumcised jews persius in his fifth satire speaks of those who move their lips with silence and with fear the sabbath of the circumcised revere juvenal in his fourteenth satire describes how many romans reverence the sabbath and their sons bettering the example turn jews themselves others there are whose sire the sabbath heeds and so they worship naught but clouds and sky they deem swines flesh from which their father kept no different from a mans and soon indeed are circumcised affecting to despise the laws of rome they study keep and fear the jewish law whateer in mystic book moses has handed downto show the way to none but he who the same rites observes and those athirst to lead unto the spring only if circumcised whereof the cause was he their sire to whom each seventh day was one of sloth whereon he took in hand no part in life ovid tibullus and others also speak of the jewish sabbath not merely as universally known but as largely observed amongst the romans so that it obtained almost a public recognition whilst the success of judaism in making proselytes until christianity came into rivalry with it is known to every one as to the general influence of judaism in securing the recognition of the week with its seventh day of rest the testimony of josephus is emphatic the multitude of mankind itself have had a great inclination of a long time to follow our religious observances for there is not any city of the grecians nor any of the barbarians nor any nation whatsoever whither our custom of resting on the seventh day hath not come and by which our fasts and lighting up lamps and many of our prohibitions as to our food are not observed they also endeavour to imitate our mutual concord with one another and the charitable distribution of our goods and our diligence in our trades and our fortitude in undergoing the distresses we are in on account of our laws and what is here matter of the greatest admiration our law hath no bait of pleasure to allure men to it but it prevails by its own force and as god himself pervades all the world so hath our law passed through all the world also2891 philo the jew bears equally distinct testimony to the fact that wheresoever the jews were carried in their dispersion their laws and religious customs especially their observance of every seventh day attracted attention and even secured a certain amount of acceptance the jews therefore even when as a nation they were ruined and crushed proved themselves possessed of such vital force of such tenacity as to impress their conquerors with interest in and respect for their sabbatic customs of their tenacity and force in general of their power to influence the nations amongst whom they have been scattered the history of the last two thousand five hundred years is eloquent it is not reasonable nor scientific to suppose that this nation steel since it returned from its captivity in babylon was wax before but the third suggestion as to the origin of the week of seven daysthat it was derived from the influence of the planetsmakes the matter clearer still this suggestion has already been noticed in the chapter on saturn and astrology it is sufficient to say here that it presupposes a state of astronomical advancement not attained until long after the sabbath was fully known the babylonians did observe the seven planets but there is no trace of their connection with the babylonian week but when the greek astronomers had worked out that system of the planetary motions which we call after ptolemy and the planets had been fitted by the alexandrian observers to the days of the jewish week and the hours of the egyptian day then the babylonian astrologers also adopted the mongrel combination thus indirectly babylon received the free week from the jews and did not give it the oldest use of the free and uniform week is found among the jews who had only a most imperfect knowledge of the planets the identity of the number of the days in the week with that of the planets is purely accidental and it is not permissible to assert that the former number is derived from the latter2901 carried by the jews into their dispersion adopted by the chaldan astrologers for use in their divinations received by christianity and islam this cycle the free week of seven days so convenient and so useful for chronology has now been adopted throughout the world its use can be traced back for about 3000 years and there is every reason to believe that it will last through the centuries to come resisting the madness of useless novelty and the assaults of present and future iconoclasts2902 the fourth account of the origin of the week is that given us in the bible itself in six days the lord made heaven and earth the sea and all that in them is and rested the seventh day wherefore the lord blessed the sabbath day and hallowed it the institution of the sabbath day is the crown of the work of creation the key to its purpose other times and seasons are marked out by the revolutions and conjunctions of the heavenly bodies this day is set apart directly by god himself it is his express handiworkthe day which the lord hath made the great truth taught in the first chapter of genesis is that god is the one reality all that we can see above or around was made by him he alone is god and his creative work has a definite goal to which its several details all lead upthe creation of man made in the image of god as such man has a higher calling than that of the beasts that perish the chief object of their lives is to secure their food their aspirations extend no further but he is different he has higher wants nobler aspirations how can they be met the earth was created to form an abode suitable for man the varied forms of organic life were brought into existence to prepare the way for and minister to him for what was man himself made and made in the image of god but that he might know god and have communion with him to this the sabbath day gave the call and for this it offered the opportunity for what are men better than sheep or goats that nourish a blind life within the brain if knowing god they lift not hands of prayer footnotes 2841 this is learnt from a single tablet of a babylonian calendar preserved in the british museum which unfortunately contains one month only 2851 babel and bible dr fried delitzsch johns translation pp 40 41 2891 flavius josephus

was pointed out in the chapter on the moon the hebrews used two expressions for monthchodesh from a root meaning to be new and yerach from the root meaning to be pale chodesh is the word most commonly employed and this in itself is sufficient to show that the hebrew calendar month was a lunar one but there are besides too many references to the actual new moons for there to be any doubt on the question every seventh day was commanded to be held as a sabbath of rest and on it were sacrificed four lambs instead of the two offered up the one at the morning and the other at the evening sacrifice of the six working days but the new moons are also mentioned as holy days and are coupled with the sabbaths the husband of the shunamite asked her why she wished to go to elisha as it is neither new moon nor sabbath isaiah speaking in the name of the lord says the new moons and sabbaths the calling of assemblies i cannot away with your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth and again from one new moon to another and from one sabbath to another shall all flesh come to worship amos speaks of degenerate israel that they say when will the new moon be gone that we may sell corn and the sabbath that we may set forth wheat as late as apostolic times st paul refers to the feasts of the new moons saying let no man therefore judge you in respect of the new moon the ordinances respecting the observance of the new moonsthe beginnings of monthswere explicit trumpets were blown over the burnt offerings and over the sacrifices of the peace offerings and the nature of these offerings is given in detail in the twentyeighth chapter of the book of numbers the ordinances were reiterated and emphasized in the days of david solomon hezekiah ezekiel ezra and nehemiah amongst the jews of the present day the trumpets are not blown at new moons extra prayers are read but the burnt and peace offerings are of necessity omitted beside the new moons and the sabbaths the ancient hebrews had three great festivals all defined as to the time of their celebration by the natural months the first was the feast of the passover which lasted a week and began with the killing of a lamb between the two evenings on the 14th day of the month abib the first month of the yearthat is to say on the evening that the first moon of the year became full this feast corresponded to our easter the second was that of pentecost and was bound to the feast of the passover by being appointed to occur seven weeks after the consecration of the harvest season by the offering of the sheaf on the second day of the passover we still celebrate the feast of pentecost or whitsunday keeping it in remembrance of the birthday of the christian church this feast lasted but a single day and did not occur at either the new or the full of the moon but nearly at first quarter the third festival was threefold in its character it began with special sacrifices besides those usually offered at the new moon in the seventh month on the first day of the month ye shall have an holy convocation ye shall do no servile work it is a day of blowing of trumpets unto you this then was especially dependent on the new moon being on the first day of the month on the 10th day of the month was the day of atonement when the people should afflict their souls on the 15th day of the month began the feast of tabernacles which commenced on the night that the moon was full and lasted for a week we have no special religious seasons in the christian church to correspond with these we thus see that with the hebrews all the days of the new moons and two days of full moon in the first and in the seventh months were days for which special ordinances were imposed and there is no doubt that the beginnings of the new months were obtained by direct observation of the moon when weather or other conditions permitted not by any rule of thumb computation the new moon observed was necessarily not the new moon as understood in the technical language of astronomy i e the moment when the moon is in conjunction with the sun having its dark side wholly turned towards the earth and being in consequence completely invisible the new moon as mentioned in the scriptures and as we ordinarily use the term is not this conjunction but the first visible crescent of the moon when it has drawn away from the sun sufficiently to be seen after sunset for a short time in the twilight before it sets for the moon when very slender cannot be seen in daylight it may therefore be first seen any time between about 18 hours and 40 hours after its conjunction with the sun in other words it may be first seen on one of two evenings but for the ecclesiastical rites it was necessary that there should be an authoritative declaration as to the time of the commencement of the month and moreover the great feasts were fixed for certain days in the month and so were dependent on its beginning during the period of the jewish restoration up to the destruction of jerusalem by titus the sanhedrim used to sit in the hall of polished stones to receive the testimony of credible witnesses that they had seen the new moon if the new moon had appeared at the commencement of the 30th daycorresponding to our evening of the 29ththe sanhedrim declared the previous month imperfect or consisting only of 29 days if credible witnesses had not appeared to testify to the appearance of the new moon on the evening of the 29th the next evening i e that of the 30thaccording to our mode of reckoningwas taken as the commencement of the new month and the previous month was then declared to be full or of 30 days early in the christian era it was enacted that no testimony should be received from unknown persons because says the talmud the baithusites wished to impose on the mishnic rabbis and hired two men to do so for four hundred pieces of silver it is clear therefore that about the time of the christian era the beginnings of the months were determined astronomically from the actual observation of the new moons and we may safely conclude that it was the same also from the earliest times it was the actual new moon not any theoretical or fictitious new moon that regulated the great festivals and as we have seen there was often some considerable uncertainty possible in the fixing of the dates the witnesses might give conflicting testimony and the authoritative date might be proved to be in fault we have an instance of such conflicting authority in the different dating on one occasion of the day of atonement by the rabbi yehoshua and rabbon gamaliel the president of the sanhedrim grandson of the gamaliel at whose feet paul sat according to a statement in the mishna dating from the second century of our era the appearance of the new moon at jerusalem was signalled to babylonia during the century preceding the destruction of the holy city by titus and perhaps from earlier times the dispersion of the jews had therefore presented them with an additional difficulty in fixing the beginning of their months the problem is much more intricate today seeing that the jews are dispersed over the whole world and the new moon first visible on one evening at jerusalem might be seen the evening before according to the reckoning of places west of jerusalem or might be invisible until the following evening according to the reckoning of places east of it we have the same problem to solve in finding the date of easter sunday the prayer book rule for finding it runs thus easter day is always the first sunday after the full moon which happens upon or next after the 21st day of march and if the full moon happens on a sunday easter day is the sunday after but the moon we choose for the ecclesiastical calendar is an imaginary body which is so controlled by specially constructed tables as to be full on a day not differing by more than two or three days at most from the date on which the actual moon is full this may seem at first sight a very clumsy arrangement but it has the advantage of defining the date of easter precisely without introducing any question as to the special meridian where the moon might be supposed to be observed thus in 1905 the moon was full at 4h 56m greenwich mean time on the morning of march 21 but easter day was not fixed for march 26 the next sunday following that full moon but a month later for april 23 for the calendar moon the imaginary moon was full on march 20 and it may be added that the actual moon though full on march 21 for european time was full on march 20 for american time there would have been an ambiguity therefore if the actual moon had been taken according to the country in which it was observed an ambiguity which is got rid of by adopting a technical or imaginary moon the names given to the different months in scripture have an interest of their own for the most part the months are simply numbered the month of the passover is the first month and the others follow as the second third fourth etc throughout the year examples of each occurring right up to the twelfth month there is no mention of a thirteenth month but occasionally we find names as well as numbers given to the months the first of these is abib meaning the month of green ears this was the first month the month of the passover and it received its name no doubt from the first green ears of barley offered before the lord during the feast that followed the passover the second month was called zif splendour apparently referring to the splendour of the flowers in full spring time it is mentioned together with two other names ethanim the seventh month and bul the eighth month in the account of the building and dedication of solomons temple the last two are certainly phoenician names having been found on phoenician inscriptions the first is possibly phoenician also their occurrence in this special connection was no doubt a result of the very large part taken in the building of the temple and the construction of its furniture by the workmen of hiram king of tyre the phoenician names of the months would naturally appear in the contracts and accounts for the work side by side with the hebrew equivalents just as an english contractor today in negotiating for a piece of work to be carried out in russia would probably take care to use the dating both of the russian old style calendar and of the english new style the word used for month in these cases is generally not chodesh the month as beginning with the new moon but yerach as if the chronicler did not wish them to be understood as having been determined by jewish authorities or methods in one case however chodesh is used in connection with the month zif the other instances of names for the months are nisan sivan elul chisleu tebeth sebat and adar derived from month names in use in babylonia and employed only in the books of esther ezra nehemiah and zechariah all avowedly postexilic writers the month word used in connection with them is chodeshsince the babylonian months were also lunarexcept in the single case where ezra used a month name terming it yerach the other postexilic writers or editors of the books of holy scripture would seem to have been at some pains to omit all babylonian month names these babylonian month names continue to be used in the jewish calendar of today in four places in scripture mention is made of a month of days the word for month being in two cases chodesh and in two yerach jacob when he came to padanaram abode with laban for the space of a month before his crafty uncle broached the subject of his wages this may either merely mean full thirty days or the term chodesh may possibly have a special appropriateness as laban may have dated jacobs service so as to commence from the second new moon after his arrival again when the people lusted for flesh in the wilderness saying who shall give us flesh to eat the lord promised to send them flesh and ye shall eat ye shall not eat one day nor two days nor five days neither ten days nor twenty days but even a whole month and there went forth a wind from the lord and brought quails from the sea he rained flesh also upon them as dust and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea the whole month in this case was evidently a full period of thirty days irrespective of the particular phase of the moon when it began and ended amongst the babylonians the sign for the word month was xxx expressing the usual number of days that it contained and without doubt amongst the hebrews that was the number of days originally assigned to the month except when the interval between two actually observed new moons was found to be twentynine in later times it was learned that the length for the lunation lay between twentynine and thirty days and that these lengths for the month must be alternate as a general rule but in early times if a long spell of bad weather prevented direct observation of the new moon we cannot suppose that anything less than thirty days would be assigned to each month such a long spell of bad observing weather did certainly occur on one occasion in the very early days of astronomy and we accordingly find that such was the number of days allotted to several consecutive months though the historian was evidently in the habit of observing the new moon for chodesh is the word used to express these months of thirty days we are told that in the six hundreth year of noahs life in the second month the seventeenth day of the month the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up and the windows of heaven were opened and later that after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated and the ark rested in the seventh month on the seventeenth day of the month upon the mountains of ararat the five months during which the waters prevailed upon the earth were therefore reckoned as of thirty days each if all the new moons or even that of the seventh month had been actually observed this event would have been ascribed to the nineteenth day of the month since 150 days is five months and two days but in the absence of such observations a sort of dead reckoning was applied which would of course be corrected directly the return of clear weather gave an opportunity for observing the new moon once again a similar practice was followed at a much later date in babylon where astronomy is supposed to have been highly developed from remote antiquity thus an inscription recently published by dr l w king records that on the 26th day of the month sivan in the seventh year the day was turned into night and fire in the midst of heaven this has been identified by mr p h cowell frs chief assistant at the royal observatory greenwich as the eclipse of the sun that was total at babylon on july 31 bc 1063 the babylonians when bad weather obliged them to resort to dead reckoning were therefore still reckoning the month as precisely thirty days so late as the times of samuel and saul and in this particular instance were two if not three days out in their count had the new moon of sivan been observed or correctly calculated the eclipse must have been reckoned as falling on the 28th or 29th day of the month the athenians in the days of solon five hundred years later than this adopted months alternately twentynine and thirty days in length which gives a result very nearly correct the jews after the dispersion adopted the system of thus alternating the lengths of their months and with some slight modifications it holds good to the present day as will be shown in the following chapter the ordinary years are of twelve months but seven years in every nineteen are embolismic having an extra month the names employed are those learned during the babylonian captivity and the year begins with the month tishri corresponding to septemberoctober of our calendar the lengths of most of the months are fixed as given in the following table but any adjustment necessary can be effected either by adding one day to heshvan which has usually twentynine days or taking away one day from kislev which has usually thirty ordinary year embolismic year days days tishri 30 30 heshvan 29 29 kislev 30 30 tebeth 29 29 shebat 30 30 adar 29 30 veadar 29 nisan 30 30 yiar 29 29 sivan 30 30 tamuz 29 29 ab 30 30 elul 29 29 the jewish month therefore continues to be essentially a true lunar one though the exact definition of each month is to some extent conventional and the words of the son of sirach still apply to the hebrew calendar the moon also is in all things for her season for a declaration of times and a sign of the world from the moon is the sign of the feast day a light that waneth when she is come to the full for so god appointed the moon for seasons chapter iv the year the third great natural division of time is the year and like the day and the month it is defined by the relative apparent movements of the heavenly bodies as the rabbi aben ezra pointed out shanah the ordinary hebrew word used for year expresses the idea of annus or annulus a closed ring and therefore implies that the year is a complete solar one a year that is purely lunar consists of twelve lunations amounting to 354 days such is the year that the mohammedans use and since it falls short of a solar year of 365 days by 10 or 11 days its beginning moves backwards rather rapidly through the seasons the jews used actual lunations for their months but their year was one depending on the position of the sun and their calendar was therefore a lunisolar one but lunations cannot be made to fit in exactly into a solar year12 lunations are some 11 days short of one year 37 lunations are 2 or 3 days too long for three yearsbut an approximation can be made by giving an extra month to every third year or more nearly still by taking 7 years in every 19 as years of 13 months each this thirteenth month is called an intercalary month and in the present jewish calendar it is the month adar which is reduplicated under the name of veadar but though from the necessity of the case this intercalation from time to time of a thirteenth month must have been made regularly from the first institution of the feast of unleavened bread we find no allusion direct or indirect in the hebrew scriptures to any such custom amongst the babylonians a year and a month were termed full when they contained 13 months and 30 days respectively and normal or incomplete when they contained but 12 months or 29 days the succession of full and normal years recurred in the same order at intervals of nineteen years for 19 years contain 6939 days 1412 hours and 235 months 6939 days 1612 hours the two therefore differing only by about a couple of hours the discovery of this cycle is attributed to meton about 433 bc and it is therefore known as the metonic cycle it supplies the golden numbers of the introduction to the book of common prayer there are two kinds of solar years with which we may have to do in a lunisolar calendarthe tropical or equinoctial year and the sidereal year the tropical year is the interval from one season till the return of that season againspring to spring summer to summer autumn to autumn or winter to winter it is defined as the time included between two successive passages of the sun through the vernal equinox hence it is also called the equinoctial year its length is found to be 365 days 5 hours 49 minutes and some ancient astronomers derived its length as closely as 365 days 6 hours by observing the dates when the sun set at exactly the opposite part of the horizon to that where it rose the sidereal year is the time occupied by the sun in apparently completing the circuit of the heavens from a given star to the same star again the length of the sidereal year is 365 days 6 hours 9 minutes in some cases the ancients took the sidereal year from the heliacal risings or settings of stars that is from the interval between the time when a bright star was first seen in the morning just before the sun rose until it was first so seen again or last seen just after the sun set in the evening until it was last so seen again but to connect the spring new moon with the day when the sun has returned to the equinox is a more difficult and complicated matter the early hebrews would seem to have solved the problem practically by simply watching the progress of the growing grain if at one new moon in spring time it appeared clear that some of the barley would be ready in a fortnight for the offering of the green ears at the feast of unleavened bread then that was taken as beginning the new year if it appeared doubtful if it would be ready or certain that it would not be then the next new moon was waited for this method was sufficient in primitive times and so long as the nation of israel remained in its own land in the long run it gave an accurate value for the mean tropical year and avoided all the astronomical difficulties of the question it shows the early hebrews as practical men for the solution adopted was easy simple and efficient this practical method of determining the beginning of the year amongst the early hebrews does not appear to have been the one in use amongst the babylonians either early or late in their history the early babylonians used a sidereal year as will be shown shortly the later babylonians used a tropical year dependent on the actual observation of the spring equinox to those who have no clocks no telescopes no sundials no instruments of any kind there are two natural epochs at which the day might begin at sunrise the beginning of daylight and at sunset the beginning of darkness similarly to all nations which use the tropical year whether their calendar is dependent on the sun alone or on both sun and moon there are two natural epochs at which the year may begin at the spring equinox the beginning of the bright half of the year when the sun is high in the heavens and all nature is reviving under its heat and light and at the autumn equinox the beginning of the dark half of the year when the sun is low in the heavens and all nature seems dying as a nation becomes more highly equipped both in the means of observing and in knowledge it may not retain either of these epochs as the actual beginning of its year but the determination of the year still rests directly or indirectly upon the observation of the equinoxes at the exodus from egypt in the month abib the children of israel were commanded in these words this month shall be unto you the beginning of months it shall be the first month of the year to you this command may have abolished and reversed the previously existing calendar or it may have related solely to the ecclesiastical calendar and the civil calendar may have been still retained with a different epoch of commencement an inquiry into the question as to whether there is evidence in scripture of the use of a double calendar shows that in every case that the passover is mentioned it is as being kept in the first month except when hezekiah availed himself of the regulation which permitted its being kept in the second month since the passover was a spring feast this links the beginning of the year to the spring time similarly the feast of tabernacles which is an autumn festival is always mentioned as being held in the seventh month these feasts would naturally be referred to the ecclesiastical calendar but the slight evidences given in the civil history point the same way thus some men joined david at ziklag during the time of his persecution by saul in the first month this was spring time for it is added that jordan had overflowed all its banks similarly the ninth month fell in the winter for it was as he sat in the winterhouse in the ninth month and there was a fire on the hearth burning before him that king jehoiakim took the prophecy of jeremiah and cut it with the penknife and cast it into the fire that was on the hearth the same ninth month is also mentioned in the book of ezra as a winter month a time of great rain the same result is given by the instances in which a babylonian month name is interpreted by its corresponding jewish month number in each case the jewish year is reckoned as beginning with nisan the month of the spring equinox in one case however two babylonian month names do present a difficulty in the book of nehemiah in the first chapter the writer says it came to pass in the month chisleu in the twentieth year as i was in shushan the palace that hanani one of my brethren came and told him concerning the sad state of jerusalem in consequence of this he subsequently approached the king on the subject in the month nisan in the twentieth year of artaxerxes the king if the twentieth year of king artaxerxes began in the spring nisan which is a spring month could not follow chisleu which is a month of late autumn but artaxerxes may have dated his accession and therefore his regnal years from some month between nisan and chisleu or the civil year may have been reckoned at the court of shushan as beginning with tishri it may be noted that nehemiah does not define either of these months in terms of the jewish elsewhere when referring to the jewish feast of tabernacles he attributes it to the seventh month in accord with its place in the mosaic calendar an alteration of the beginning of the year from the spring to the autumn was brought about amongst the jews at a later date and was systematized in the religious calendar by the rabbis of about the fourth century ad tishri begins the jewish year at the present day the first day of tishri being taken as the anniversary of the creation of the world the mishna the law of the lip was first committed to writing in 191 ad and the compilation of the babylonian talmud based on the mishna was completed about 500 ad in its commentary on the first chapter of genesis there is an allusion to the year as beginning in spring for it says that a king crowned on the twentyninth of adar is considered as having completed the first year of his reign on the first of nisan i e the next day hence follows observes some one that the first of nisan is the new years day of kings and that if one had reigned only one day in a year it is considered as a whole year3111 it is not indicated whether this rule held good for the kings of persia as well as for those of israel if so and this tradition be correct then we cannot explain nehemiahs reckoning by supposing that he was counting from the month of the accession of artaxerxes and must assume that a civil or court year beginning with tishri i e in the autumn was the one in question a further but as it would seem quite an imaginary difficulty has been raised because the feast of ingathering or tabernacles though held in the seventh month is twice spoken of as being in the end of the year or as it is rendered in the margin in one case in the revolution of the year this latter expression occurs again in 2 chron xxiv 23 when it is said that at the end of the year the host of syria came up but in this case it probably means early spring for it is only of late centuries that war has been waged in the winter months down to the middle ages the armies always went into winter quarters and in the spring the kings led them out again to battle one hebrew expression used in scripture means the return of the year as applied to the close of one and the opening of another year this is the expression employed in the second book of samuel and of the first book of chronicles where it is said after the year was expired at the time when kings go forth to battle implying that in the time of david the year began in the spring the same expression no doubt in reference to the same time of the year is also used in connection with the warlike expeditions of benhadad king of syria and of nebuchadnezzar king of babylon it is admitted that the feast of tabernacles was held in the autumn and in the seventh month the difficulty lies in the question of how it could be said to be in the end of the year at the years end although it is clear from the cases just cited that these and similar expressions are merely of a general character as we ourselves might say when the year came round and do not indicate any rigid connection with a specific date of the calendar we ourselves use several years and calendars without any confusion the civil year begins at midnight on january 1 the financial year on april 1 the ecclesiastical year with advent about december 1 the scholastic year about the middle of september and so on as the word year expresses with ourselves many different usages there is no reason to attribute to the jews the extreme pedantry of invariably using nothing but precise definitions drawn from their ecclesiastical calendar the services of the tabernacle and the temple werewith the exception of the slaying of the paschal lambsall comprised within the hours of daylight there was no offering before the morning sacrifice none after the evening sacrifice so too the mosaic law directed all the great feasts to be held in the summer half of the year the light half none in the winter the paschal full moon was just after the spring equinox the harvest moon of the feast of tabernacles as near as possible to the autumn equinox until the introduction after the captivity of the feast of purim in the twelfth month the month adar the ecclesiastical year might be said to end with those seven days of joyous campingout in the booths built of the green boughs just as all the great days of the christian year lie between advent and the octave of pentecost whilst the sundays after trinity stretch their length through six whole months there is therefore no contradiction between the command in exod xii to make abib the month of the passover the first month and the references elsewhere in exodus to the feast of ingathering as being in the end of the year it was at the end of the agricultural year it was also at the end of the period of feasts so if a workman is engaged for a days work he comes in the morning and goes home in the evening and expects to be paid as he leaves no one would ask him to complete the twentyfour hours before payment and dismissal it is the end of his day though like the men in the parable of the labourers in the vineyard he has only worked twelve hours out of the twentyfour in the same way the feast of tabernacles though in the seventh month was in the end of the year both from the point of view of the farmer and of the ordinances of the sacred festivals the method employed in very early times in assyria and babylonia for determining the first month of the year was a simple and effective one the principle of which may be explained thus if we watch for the appearance of the new moon in spring time and as we see it setting in the west notice some bright star near it then 12 months later we should see the two together again but with this difference that the moon and star would be seen together not on the first but on the second evening of the month for since 12 lunar months fall short of a solar year by 11 days the moon on the first evening would be about 11 degrees short of her former position but as she moves about 13 degrees in 24 hours the next evening she would practically be back in her old place in the second year therefore moon and star would set together on the second evening of the first month and in like manner they would set together on the third evening in the third year and roughly speaking on the fourth evening of the fourth year but this last conjunction would mean that they would also set together on the first evening of the next month which would thus be indicated as the true first month of the year thus when moon and star set together on the third evening of a month thirteen months later they would set together on the first evening of a month thus the setting together of moon and star would not only mark which was to be first month of the year but if they set together on the first evening it would show that the year then beginning was to be an ordinary one of 12 months if on the third evening that the year ought to be a full one of 13 months this was precisely the method followed by the akkadians some 4000 years ago for prof sayce and mr bosanquet translate an old tablet in akkadian as follows when on the first day of the month nisan the star of stars or dilgan and the moon are parallel that year is normal when on the third day of the month nisan the star of stars and the moon are parallel that year is full3151 the star of stars of this inscription is no doubt the bright star capella and the year thus determined by the setting together of the moon and capella would begin on the average with the spring equinox about 2000 bc when capella thus marked the first month of the year the twin stars castor and pollux marked the second month of the year in just the same way a reminiscence of this circumstance is found in the signs for the first two months that for the first month being a crescent moon lying on its back that for the second month a pair of stars the significance of the crescent being shown as lying on its back is seen at once when it is remembered that the new moon is differently inclined to the horizon according to the time of the year when it is seen it is most nearly upright at the time of the autumn equinox it is most nearly horizontal lying on its back at the spring equinox it is clear from this symbol therefore that the babylonians began their year in the spring illustration position of the new moon at the equinoxes this method by which the new moon was used as a kind of pointer for determining the return of the sun to the neighbourhood of a particular star at the end of a solar year is quite unlike anything that commentators on the astronomical methods of the ancients have supposed them to have used but we know from the ancient inscription already quoted that it was actually used it was eminently simple it was bound to have suggested itself wherever a lunisolar year starting from the observed new moon was used further it required no instruments or starmaps it did not even require a knowledge of the constellations only of one or two conspicuous stars though rough it was perfectly efficient and would give the mean length of the year with all the accuracy that was then required illustration boundarystone in the louvre approximate date bc 1200 from a photograph by messrs w a mansell but it had one drawback which the ancients could not have been expected to foresee the effect of precession alluded to in the chapter on the origin of the constellations p 158 would be to throw the beginning of the year as thus determined gradually later and later in the seasonsroughly speaking by a day in every seventy yearsand the time came no doubt when it was noticed that the terrestrial seasons no longer bore their traditional relation to the year this probably happened at some time in the seventh or eighth centuries before our era and was connected with the astronomical revolution that has been alluded to before when the ecliptic was divided into twelve equal divisions not associated with the actual stars the signs were substituted for the constellations of the zodiac and the ram was taken as the leader instead of the bull the equinox was then determined by direct measurement of the length of the day and night for a tablet of about this period records on the sixth day of the month nisan the day and night were equal the day was six doublehours kasbu and the night was six doublehours so long as capella was used as the indicator star so long the year must have begun with the sun in taurus the bull but when the readjustment was made and the solar tropical year connected with the equinox was substituted for the sidereal year connected with the return of the sun to a particular star it would be seen that the association of the beginning of the year with the suns presence in any given constellation could no longer be kept up the necessity for an artificial division of the zodiac would be felt and that artificial division clearly was not made until the sun at the spring equinox was unmistakably in aries the ram or about 700 bc the eclipse of 1063 bc incidentally proves that the old method of fixing nisan by the conjunction of the moon and capella was then still in use for the eclipse took place on july 31 which is called in the record the 26th of sivan sivan being the third month its 26th day could not have fallen so late if the year had begun with the equinox but it would have so fallen if the capella method were still in vogue there is a set of symbols repeated over and over again on babylonian monuments and always given a position of eminenceit is the socalled triad of stars a crescent lying on its back and two stars near it they are seen very distinctly at the top of the photograph of the boundarystone from the louvre given on p 318 and also immediately above the head of the sungod in the photograph of the tablet from sippar on p 322 their significance is now clear four thousand years before the christian era the two twin stars castor and pollux served as indicators of the first new moon of the year just as capella did two thousand years later the triad of stars then is simply a picture of what men saw year after year in the sunset sky at the beginning of the first month six thousand years ago it is the earliest record of an astronomical observation that has come down to us illustration worship of the sungod at sippara how simple and easy the observation was and how distinctly the year was marked off by it the month was marked off by the first sight of the new thin crescent in the evening sky the day was marked off by the return of darkness the evening hour in which month by month the new moon was first observed so that the evening and the morning were the first day the year was marked off by the new moon being seen in the evening with a bright pair of stars the stars we still know as the twins and the length of the year was shown by the evening of the month when moon and stars came together if on the first evening it was a year of twelve months if on the third one of thirteen there was a time when these three observations constituted the whole of primitive astronomy in later days the original meaning of the triad of stars would seem to have been forgotten and they were taken as representing sin samas and istarthe moon the sun and the planet venus yet now and again a hint of the part they once played in determining the length of the year is preserved thus on the tablet now in the british museum and shown on p 322 sculptured with a scene representing the worship of the sungod in the temple of sippar these three symbols are shown with the explanatory inscription the moongod the sungod and istar dwellers in the abyss announce to the years what they are to expect possibly an astrological formula but it may well meanannounce whether the years should expect twelve or thirteen months as already pointed out this method had one drawback it gave a sidereal year not a tropical year and this inconvenience must have been discovered and capella substituted for the twin stars long before the giving of the law to israel the method employed by the priests of watching the progress of the ripening of the barley overcame this difficulty and gave a year to israel which on the average was a correct tropical one there is a detail in the history of the flood in gen vii and viii which has been taken by some as meant to indicate the length of the tropical year in the six hundredth year of noahs life in the second month the seventeenth day of the month the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up and the windows of heaven were opened and it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year in the second month on the seven and twentieth day of the month was the earth dried the interval from the commencement of the deluge to its close was therefore twelve lunar months and ten days i e 364 or 365 days the beginning of the rain would no doubt be sharply marked the end of the drying would be gradual and hence the selection of a day exactly so far as we can tell a full tropical year from the beginning of the flood would seem to be intentional a complete year had been consumed by the judgment no such total interruption of the kindly succession of the seasons shall ever occur again while the earth remaineth seedtime and harvest and cold and heat and summer and winter and day and night shall not cease the rain is no longer for judgment but for blessing thou visitest the earth and waterest it thou greatly enrichest it the river of god is

chapter v the sabbatic year and the jubilee the principle of the week with its sabbath of rest was carried partially into the month and completely into the year the seventh month of the year was marked out preeminently by the threefold character of its services though every seventh month was not distinguished but the weekly sabbath was expressed not only in days but in years and was one both of rest and of release the sabbath of years was first enjoined from mount sinai in the third month after the departure from egypt certainly within a day or so if not on the actual day of the second great feast of the year variously known to the hebrews as the feast of firstfruits or the feast of weeks and to us as pentecost that is whitsuntide it is most shortly given in exod xxi 2 and xxiii 10 11 if thou buy an hebrew servant six years he shall serve and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing six years thou shalt sow thy land and shalt gather in the fruits thereof but the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and lie still that the poor of thy people may eat and what they leave the beasts of the field shall eat in like manner thou shalt deal with thy vineyard and with thy oliveyard these laws are given at greater length and with fuller explanation in the twentyfifth chapter of the book of leviticus in addition there is given a promise of blessing for the fulfilment of the laws and in the twentysixth chapter a sign to follow on their breach if ye shall say what shall we eat the seventh year behold we shall not sow nor gather in our increase then i will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year and it shall bring forth fruit for three years and ye shall sow the eighth year and eat yet of old fruit until the ninth year until her fruits come in ye shall eat of the old store ye shall keep my sabbaths and if ye walk contrary unto me i will scatter you among the heathen and will draw out a sword after you and your land shall be desolate and your cities waste then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths as long as it lieth desolate and ye be in your enemies land even then shall the land rest and enjoy her sabbaths as long as it lieth desolate it shall rest because it did not rest in your sabbaths when ye dwelt upon it in the fifteenth chapter of the book of deuteronomy this sabbatic year is called a year of release the specific injunctions here relate to loans made to a hebrew and to a foreigner and to the taking of a hebrew into bondage the laws as to loans had direct reference to the sabbath of the land for since only hebrews might possess the holy land interest on a debt might not be exacted from a hebrew in the sabbatic year as the land did not then yield him wherewith he might pay but loans to foreigners would be necessarily for commercial not agricultural purposes and since commerce was not interdicted in the sabbatic year interest on loans to foreigners might be exacted warning was given that the loans to a poor hebrew should not be withheld because the sabbatic year was close at hand the rules with respect to the hebrew sold for debt into bondage are the same as those given in the book of the exodus in deuteronomy it was also enjoined that at the end of every seven years in the solemnity of the year of release in the feast of tabernacles that is in the feast of the seventh month when all israel is come to appear before the lord thy god in the place which he shall choose thou shalt read this law before all israel in their hearing we find no more mention of the sabbatic year until the reign of zedekiah the last king of judah he had made a covenant with all the people which were at jerusalem to proclaim liberty unto them that every hebrew bondservant should go free but the princes and all the people caused their hebrew bondservants to return and be in subjection to them then jeremiah the prophet was sent to remind them of the covenant made with their fathers when they were brought out from the land of egypt from the house of bondmen and in the second book of chronicles it is said that the sign of the breaking of this covenant already quoted from the book of leviticus was being accomplished the captivity was to fulfil the word of the lord by the mouth of jeremiah until the land had enjoyed her sabbaths for as long as she lay desolate she kept sabbath to fulfil threescore and ten years after the exile we find one reference to the sabbatic year in the covenant sealed by the princes levites and priests and people in the book of nehemiah that we would leave the seventh year and the exaction of every debt just as the feast of weeks was bound to the feast of the passover by numbering seven sabbaths from the day of the waveofferingeven unto the morrow after the seventh sabbath shall ye number fifty daysso the year of jubilee was bound to the sabbatic year thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee seven times seven years and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month in the day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land and ye shall hallow the fiftieth year and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof it shall be a jubile unto you and ye shall return every man unto his possession and ye shall return every man unto his family in this year of jubilee all land and village houses and the houses of the levites were to revert to their original owners these in other words could be leased only and not bought outright the price of the lease depending upon the number of years until the next jubilee a foreigner might not buy a hebrew outright as a bondslave he could but contract with him as a servant hired for a term this contract might be abolished by the payment of a sum dependent on the number of years until the next year of jubilee and in any case the hebrew servant and his family must go out free at the year of jubilee in the last chapter of the book of numbers we get a reference again to the year of jubilee and indirect allusions to it are made by isaiah in the acceptable year of the lord when liberty should be proclaimed and in the year of the redeemed in his prophecy of the restoration of israel ezekiel definitely refers to the year of liberty when the inheritance that has been granted to a servant shall return again to the prince the interpretation of the sabbatic year and the year of jubilee has greatly exercised commentators at what season did the sabbatic year begin was it coterminous with the ecclesiastical year or did it differ from it by six months was the year of jubilee held once in every fortynine years or once in every fifty did it begin at the same season as the sabbatic year did it interrupt the reckoning of the sabbatic year so that a new cycle commenced immediately after the year of jubilee or was the sabbatic year every seventh irrespective of the year of jubilee did the year of jubilee always follow immediately on a sabbatic year or did this only happen occasionally the problem will be much simpler if it is borne in mind that the law as originally proclaimed was eminently practical and for practical men the period of pedantry of hairsplitting of slavery to mere technicalities came very late in jewish history it is clear from what has been already said in the chapter on the year that the only calendar year in the old testament was the sacred one beginning with the month abib or nisan in the spring at the same time the jews like ourselves would occasionally refer vaguely to the beginning or the end or the course of the year without meaning to set up any hard and fast connection with the authorized calendar now it is perfectly clear that the sabbatic year cannot have begun with the first day of the month abib because the first fruits were offered on the fifteenth of that month that being so the ploughing and the sowing must have taken place very considerably earlier it is not possible to suppose that the hebrew farmer would plough and sow his land in the last months of the previous year knowing that he could not reap during the sabbatic year similarly it seems hardly likely that it was considered as beginning with the first of tishri inasmuch as the harvest festival the feast of the ingathering or tabernacles took place in the middle of that month the plain and practical explanation is that after the feast of tabernacles of the sixth year the farmer would not again plough sow or reap his land until after the feast of tabernacles in the sabbatic year the sabbatic year in other words was a simple agricultural year and it did not correspond exactly with the ecclesiastical or with any calendar year for practical purposes the sabbatic year therefore ended with the close of the feast of tabernacles when the law was read before the whole people according to the command of moses and it practically began a year earlier the year of jubilee appears in the directions of lev xxv to have been most distinctly linked to the sabbatic year the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years and ye shall hallow the fiftieth year and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof it shall be a jubile unto you it would seem therefore that just as the week of days ran on continuously uninterrupted by any feasts or fasts so the week of years ran on continuously and as the feast of pentecost was the 49th day from the offering of the firstfruits on the morrow of the passover so the jubilee was the 49th year from the morrow of a sabbatic year it followed immediately after a sabbatic year the jubilee was thus the 49th year from the previous jubilee it was the 50th from the particular sabbatic year from which the original reckoning was made actually the year of jubilee began before the sabbatic year was completed because the trumpet of the jubilee was to be blown upon the day of atonement the 10th day of the seventh monththat is to say whilst the sabbatic year was yet in progress indeed literally speaking this trumpet loud of sound blown on the 10th day of the seventh month was the jubilee that is to say the sound of rejoicing the joyful sound a difficulty comes in here the israelites were commanded ye shall not sow neither reap that which groweth of itself in it nor gather the grapes in it of thy vine undressed for it is the jubile it shall be holy unto you ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field this would appear to mean that the jubilee extended over a whole year following a sabbatic year so that the land lay fallow for two consecutive years but this seems negatived by two considerations it is expressly laid down in the same chapter lev xxv 22 that the israelites were to sow in the eighth yearthat is to say in the year after a sabbatic year and the year of jubilee would be always a year of this character further if the next sabbatic year was the seventh after the one preceding the jubilee then the land would be tilled for only five consecutive years not for six though this is expressly commanded in lev xxv 3 if on the contrary it was tilled for six years then the run of the sabbatic years would be interrupted the explanation of this difficulty may possibly be found in the fact that that which distinguished the year of jubilee was something which did not run through the whole circuit of the seasons the land in that year was to return to its original owners the freehold of the land was never sold the land was inalienable and in the year of jubilee it reverted in the year of this jubile ye shall return every man unto his possession it is quite clear that it could not have been left to the caprice of the owners of property as to when this transfer took place or as to when such hebrews as had fallen through poverty into slavery should be liberated if the time were made optional grasping men would put it off till the end of the year and sooner or later that would be the general rule there can be no doubt that the blowing of the trumpet on the 10th day of the seventh month was the proclamation of liberty throughout all the land and to all the inhabitants thereof and that the transfer of the land must have taken place at the same time the slave would return to the possession of his ancestors in time to keep as a freeman the feast of tabernacles on his own land the four days between the great day of atonement and the feast of tabernacles were sufficient for this change to be carried out the term year of jubilee is therefore not to be taken as signifying that the events of the jubilee were spread over twelve months but simply that it was the year in which the restoration of the jubilee was accomplished we speak of the kings coronation year though his coronation took place on but a single day and the meaning that we should attach to the phrase would depend upon the particular sense in which we were using the word year whilst therefore the jubilee itself was strictly defined by the blowing of trumpets on the 10th day of the seventh month it would be perfectly correct to give the title year of jubilee to any year no matter in what season it commenced that contained the day of that proclamation of liberty it is also correct to say that it was the fiftieth year because it was placed at the very end of the fortyninth year the difficulty still remains as to the meaning of the prohibition to sow or reap in the year of jubilee the command certainly reads as if the land was to lie fallow for two consecutive years but it would seem an impracticable arrangement that the poor man returning to his inheritance should be forbidden to plough or sow until more than a twelvemonth had elapsed and hence that he should be forbidden to reap until nearly two full years had run their course it also as already stated seems directly contrary to the command to sow in the eighth year which would also be the fiftieth it may therefore be meant simply to emphasize the prohibition to sow and reap in the sabbatic year immediately preceding the jubilee the temptation would be great to a grasping man to get the most he could out of the land before parting with it for ever in spite of the strong array of commentators who claim that the jubilees were to be held every fifty years as we moderns should compute it there can be no doubt but that they followed each other at the same interval as every seventh sabbatic year in other words that they were held every 49 years this is confirmed by an astronomical consideration fortynine years make a convenient lunisolar cycle reconciling the lunar month and the tropical solar year though not so good as the metonic cycle of 19 years it is quite a practical one as the following table will show 3 years 109573 days 37 months 109263 days 8 292194 99 292353 11 401766 136 401616 19 693960 235 693969 49 1789687 606 1789554 60 2191453 742 2191170 the cycle of 49 years would therefore be amply good enough to guide the priestly authorities in drawing up their calendar in cases where there was some ambiguity due to the interruption of observations of the moon and this was all that could be needed so long as the nation of israel remained in its own land the cycle of 8 years is added above since it has been stated that the jews of alexandria adopted this at one time from the greeks this was not so good as the cycle of 11 years would have been and not to be compared with the combination of the two cycles in that of 19 years ascribed to meton the latter cycle was adopted by the babylonian jews and forms the basis of the jewish calendar in use today chapter vi the cycles of daniel the cycle of 49 years marked out by the return of the jubilee was a useful and practical one it supplied in fact all that the hebrews in that age required for the purposes of their calendar the babylonian basic number 60 would have givenas will be seen from the table in the last chaptera distinctly less accurate correspondence between the month and the tropical year there is another way of looking at the regulations for the jubilee which brings out a further significant relation on the 10th day of the first month of any year the lamb was selected for the passover on the 10th day of the seventh month of any year was the great day of atonement from the 10th day of the first month of the first year after a jubilee to the next blowing of the jubilee trumpet on the great day of atonement was 600 months that is 50 complete lunar years and the same interval necessarily held good between the passover of that first year and the feast of tabernacles of the fortyninth year the passover recalled the deliverance of israel from the bondage of egypt and in like manner the release to be given to the hebrew slave at the year of jubilee was expressly connected with the memory of that national deliverance for they are my servants which i brought forth out of the land of egypt they shall not be sold as bondmen the day of jubilee fell in the middle of the ecclesiastical year from the close of the year of jubileethat is to say of the ecclesiastical year in which the freeing both of the bondmen and of the land took placeto the next day of jubilee was 4812 solar years oras seen above600 lunations or 50 lunar years so that there can be no doubt that the period was expressly designed to exhibit this cycle a cycle which shows incidentally a very correct knowledge of the true lengths of the lunation and solar year this cycle was possessed by no other nation of antiquity therefore the hebrews borrowed it from none and since they did not borrow the cycle neither could they have borrowed the ritual with which that cycle was interwoven that the hebrews possessed this knowledge throws some light upon an incident in the early life of the prophet daniel in the third year of the reign of jehoiakim king of judah came nebuchadnezzar king of babylon unto jerusalem and besieged it and the king spake unto ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs that he should bring certain of the children of israel and of the kings seed and of the princes children in whom was no blemish but well favoured and skilful in all wisdom and cunning in knowledge and understanding science and such as had ability in them to stand in the kings palace and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the chaldeans now among these were of the children of judah daniel hananiah mishael and azariah unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names for he gave unto daniel the name of belteshazzar and to hananiah of shadrach and to mishael of meshach and to azariah of abednego as for these four children god gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom and daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before nebuchadnezzar and the king communed with them and among them all was found none like daniel hananiah mishael and azariah therefore stood they before the king and in all matters of wisdom and understanding that the king inquired of them he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm the hebrew children that king nebuchadnezzar desired to be brought were to be already possessed of knowledge they were to be further instructed in the learning and tongue of the chaldeans but when the four hebrew children were brought before the king and he communed with them he found them wiser than his own wise men no account is given of the questions asked by the king or of the answers made by the four young hebrews so it is merely a conjecture that possibly some question bearing on the calendar may have come up but if it did then certainly the information within the grasp of the hebrews could not have failed to impress the king we know how highly the greeks esteemed the discovery by meton in the 86th olympiad of that relation between the movements of the sun and moon which gives the cycle of nineteen years and similar knowledge would certainly have given king nebuchadnezzar a high opinion of the young captives but there is evidence from certain numbers in the book which bears his name that daniel was acquainted with lunisolar cycles which quite transcended that of the jubilees in preciseness and indicate a knowledge such as was certainly not to be found in any other ancient nation the numbers themselves are used in a prophetic context so that the meaning of the whole is veiled but astronomical knowledge underlying the use of these numbers is unmistakably there one of these numbers is found in the eighth chapter how long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice and the transgression of desolation to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot and he said unto me unto two thousand and three hundred days then shall the sanctuary be cleansed the twelfth chapter gives the other number but in a more veiled form and i heard the man clothed in linen which was upon the waters of the river when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven and sware by him that liveth for ever that it shall be for a time times and an half and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people all these things shall be finished the numerical significance of the time times and an half or as it is expressed in the seventh chapter of daniel until a time and times and the dividing of time is plainly shown by the corresponding expressions in the apocalypse where a time and times and half a time would appear to be given elsewhere both as forty and two months and a thousand two hundred and threescore days fortytwo conventional monthsthat is of 30 days eachmake up 1260 days whilst 312 conventional years of 360 daysthat is twelve months of 30 days eachmake up the same period the word times is expressly used as equivalent to years in the eleventh chapter of daniel where it is said that the king of the north shall come on at the end of the times even of years with a great army and with much substance then again in the vision which nebuchadnezzar had previous to his madness he heard the watcher and the holy one cry concerning him let his heart be changed from mans and let a beasts heart be given unto him and let seven times pass over him it has been generally understood that the seven times in this latter case meant seven years the time times and an half are obviously meant as the half of seven times the two numbers 2300 and 1260 whatever be their significance in their particular context in these prophecies have an unmistakable astronomical bearing as the following table will show 2300 solar years 840057 days 1 hour 28447 lunar months 840056 16 hours difference 9 1260 solar years 460205 4 15584 lunar months 460204 17 difference 11 if the one number 1260 stood alone the fact that it was so close a lunar cycle might easily be ascribed to a mere coincidence seven is a sacred number and the days in the year may be conventionally represented as 360 half the product of the two might perhaps seem to be a natural number to adopt for symbolic purposes but the number 2300 stands in quite a different category it is not suggested by any combination of sacred numbers and is not veiled under any mystic expression the number is given as it stands2300 but 2300 solar years is an exact number not only of lunations but also of anomalistic months the anomalistic month is the time occupied by the moon in travelling from its perigee that is its point of nearest approach to the earth round to its perigee again for the moons orbit round the earth is not circular but decidedly elliptical the moon being 31000 miles nearer to us at perigee than it is at apogee its point of greatest distance but it moves more rapidly when near perigee than when near apogee so that its motion differs considerably from perfect uniformity but the period in which the moon travels from her perigee round to perigee again is 27 days 13 hours 18 minutes 37 seconds and there are in 2300 solar years almost exactly 30487 such periods or anomalistic months which amount to 840057 days 2 hours if we take the mean of these three periods that is to say 840057 days as being the cycle it brings into harmony the day the anomalistic month the ordinary month and the solar year it is from this point of view the most perfect cycle known dr h grattan guinness3431 has shown what a beautifully simple and accurate calendar could have been constructed on the basis of this period of 2300 years thus 2300 solar years contain 28447 synodic months of which 847 are intercalary or epact months 2300 years are 840057 days days 27600 13800 nonintercalary mths of 29 d each 400200 13800 30 414000 847 423 intercalary months of 30 days each 12690 424 31 13144 23 days additional for the 23 centuries 23 840057 the jewish calendar on this system would have consisted of ordinary months alternately 29 and 30 days in length the intercalary months would have contained alternately 30 or 31 days and once in every century one of the ordinary months would have had an additional day or what would come to very much the same thing this extra day might have been added at every alternate jubilee by combining these two numbers of daniel some cycles of extreme astronomical interest have been derived by de cheseaux a swiss astronomer of the eighteenth century and by dr h grattan guinness and dr w bell dawson in our own times thus the difference between 2300 and 1260 is 1040 and 1040 years give an extremely exact correspondence between the solar year and the month whilst the mean of the two numbers gives us 1780 and 1780 lunar years is 1727 solar years with extreme precision but since these are not given directly in the book of daniel and are only inferential from his numbers there seems no need to comment upon them here it is fair however to conclude that daniel was aware of the metonic cycle the 2300year cycle gives evidence of a more accurate knowledge of the respective lengths of month and year than is involved in the cycle of 19 years and the latter is a cycle which a jew would be naturally led to detect as the number of intercalary months contained in it is seven the hebrew sacred number the book of daniel therefore itself proves to us that king nebuchadnezzar was perfectly justified in the high estimate which he formed of the attainments of the four hebrew children certainly one of them daniel was a better instructed mathematician and astronomer than any chaldean who had ever been brought into his presence we have the right to make this assertion for now we have an immense number of babylonian records at our command and can form a fairly accurate estimate as to the state there of astronomical and mathematical science at different epochs a kind of quasipatriotism has induced some assyriologists to confuse in their accounts of babylonian attainments the work of times close to the christian era with that of many centuries if not of several millenniums earlier and the times of sargon of agad whose reputed date is 3800 bc have seemed to be credited with the astronomical work done in babylon in the first and second centuries before our era this is much as if we should credit our predecessors who lived in this island at the time of abraham with the scientific attainments of the present day the earlier astronomical achievements at babylon were not in any real sense astronomical at all they were simply the compilation of lists of crude astrological omens of the most foolish and unreasoning kind late in babylonian history there were observations of a high scientific order real observations of the positions of moon and planets made with great system and regularity but these were made after greek astronomy had attained a high level and babylon had come under greek rule whether this development of genuine astronomical observation was of native origin or was derived from their greek masters is not clear if it was native then certainly the babylonians were not able to use and interpret the observations which they made nearly so well as were greek astronomers such as eudoxus thales pythagoras hipparchus and many others but it must not be supposed that though their astronomical achievements have been grossly even ludicrously exaggerated by some popular writers the babylonians contributed nothing of value to the progress of the science we may infer from such a tablet as that already quoted on page 320 when the equinox was observed on the 6th day of nisan since there were 6 kasbu of day and 6 kasbu of night that some mechanical timemeasurer was in use indeed the record on one tablet has been interpreted as noting that the astronomers clock or clepsydra had stopped if this be so then we owe to babylon the invention of clocks of some description and from an astronomical point of view this is of the greatest importance tradition also points to the chaldeans as the discoverers of the saros the cycle of 18 years 10 or 11 days after which eclipses of the sun or moon recur the fact that very careful watch was kept every month at the times of the new and of the full moon at many different stations to note whether an eclipse would take place would naturally bring about the discovery of the period sooner or later the achievements of a nation will be in accordance with its temperament and opportunities and it is evident from the records which they have left us that the babylonians though very superstitious were a methodical practical prosaic people and a people of that order if they are numerous and under strong rule will go far and do much the discovery of the saros was such as was within their power and was certainly no small achievement but it is to the greeks not to the babylonians that we trace the beginnings of mathematics and planetary theory we look in vain amongst such babylonian poetry as we possess for the traces of a homer a pindar a sophocles or even of a poet fit to enter into competition with those of the second rank in the literature of greece while it must remain one of the literary mysteries of our time that any one should deem the poetry of the books of isaiah and job dependent on babylonian inspiration there were two great hindrances under which the babylonian man of science laboured he was an idolater and he was an astrologer it is not possible for us in our freedom to fully realize how oppressive was the slavery of mind as well as spirit which was consequent upon this twofold superstition the greek was freer insomuch that he did not worship the planets and did not become a planetary astrologer until after he had learnt that superstition from chaldea in learning it he put an end to his scientific progress but the hebrew if he was faithful to the law that had been given to him was free in mind as well as in spirit he could fearlessly inquire into any and all the objects of nature for these were but thingsthe work of gods hands whereas he made in the image of god having the right of intercourse with god was the superior the ruler of everything he could see his religious attitude therefore gave him a great superiority for scientific advancement yet there was one phase of that attitude which whilst it preserved him from erroneous conceptions tended to check that spirit of curiosity which has led to so much of the scientific progress of modern times what how and why are the three questions which man is always asking of nature and to the hebrew the answer to the second and third was obviousit is the power of god it is the will of god he did not need to invent for himself the crass absurdities of the cosmogonies of the heathen but neither was he induced to go behind the appearances of things the sufficient cause and explanation of all was god but of the appearances he was very observant as i trust has become clear in the course of this imperfect review of the traces of one particular science as noticed in holy scripture if he was faithful to the law which had been given him the hebrew was free in character as well as in mind his spirit was not that of a bondman and nebuchadnezzar certainly never met anything more noble anything more free than the spirit of the men who answered him in the very view of the burning fiery furnace o nebuchadnezzar we are not careful to answer thee in this matter if it be so our god whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace and he will deliver us out of thine hand o king but if not be it known unto thee o king that we will not serve thy gods nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up footnotes 3431 creation centred in christ p 344 illustration sun stand thou still upon gibeon and thou moon in the valley of ajalon book iv three astronomical marvels chapter i joshuas long day3511 1method of studying the record there are three incidents recorded in holy scripture which may fairly if with no great exactness be termed astronomical miraclesthe long day on the occasion of joshuas victory at bethhoron the turning back of the shadow on the dial of ahaz as a sign of king hezekiahs recovery from sickness and the star which guided the wise men from the east to the birthplace of the holy child at bethlehem as astronomy has some bearing on each of these three remarkable events it will be of some interest to examine each of them from the point of view of our present astronomical knowledge it does not follow that this will throw any new light upon the narratives for we must always bear in mind that the scriptures were not intended to teach us the physical sciences consequently we may find that the very details have been omitted which an astronomer if he were writing an account of an astronomical observation would be careful to preserve and we must further remember that we have not the slightest reason to suppose that the sacred historians received any supernatural instruction in scientific matters their knowledge of astronomy therefore was that which they had themselves acquired from education and research and nothing more in other words the astronomy of the narrative must be read strictly in the terms of the scientific advancement of the writers but there is another thing that has also to be remembered the narrative which we have before us being the only one that we have must be accepted exactly as it stands that is the foundation of our inquiry we have no right to first cut it about at our will to omit this to alter that to find traces of two three or more original documents and so to split up the narrative as it stands into a number of imperfect fragments which by their very imperfection may seem to be more or less in conflict the scientific attitude with regard to the record of an observation cannot be too clearly defined if that record be the only one then we may accept it we may reject it we may be obliged to say we do not understand it or it is imperfect and we can make no use of it but we must not alter it a moments reflection will show that a man who would permit himself to tamper with the sole evidence upon which he purports to work no matter how profoundly convinced he may be that his proposed corrections are sound is one who does not understand the spirit of science and is not going the way to arrive at scientific truth there is no need then to inquire as to whether the tenth chapter of the book of joshua comes from two or more sources we take the narrative as it stands and it is one which has for the astronomer an interest quite irrespective of any interpretation which he may place upon the account of the miracle which forms its central incident for joshuas exclamation sun stand thou still upon gibeon and thou moon in the valley of ajalon implies that at the moment of his speaking the two heavenly bodies appeared to him to be the one upon or over gibeon the other over the valley of ajalon we have therefore in effect a definite astronomical observation interesting in itself as being one of the oldest that has been preserved to us doubly interesting in the conclusions that we are able to deduce from it the idea which has been most generally formed of the meaning of joshuas command is that he saw gibeon in the distance on the horizon in one direction with the sun low down in the sky immediately above it and the valley of ajalon in the distance on the horizon in another direction with the moon low down in the sky above it it would be quite natural to associate the sun and moon with distant objects if they were only some five or six degrees high it would be rather straining the point to do so if they were more than ten degrees high and if they were fifteen or more degrees high it would be quite impossible they could not be both in the same quarter of the sky both rising or both setting for this would mean that the moon was not only very near the sun in the sky but was very near to conjunctionin other words to new moon she could therefore have only shown a slender thread of light and it is perfectly certain that joshua facing the sun in such a country as southern palestine could not possibly have perceived the thin pale arch of light which would have been all that the moon could then have presented to him therefore the one must have been rising and the other setting and joshua must have been standing between gibeon and the valley of ajalon so that the two places were nearly in opposite directions from him the moon must have been in the west and the sun in the east for the valley of ajalon is west of gibeon that is to say it cannot have been more than an hour after sunrise and it cannot have been more than an hour before moonset adopting therefore the usual explanation of joshuas words we see at once that the common idea of the reason for joshuas command to the sun namely that the day was nearly over and that he desired the daylight to be prolonged is quite mistaken if the sun was low down in the sky he would have had practically the whole of the day still before him 2before the battle before attempting to examine further into the nature of the miracle it will be well to summarize once again the familiar history of the early days of the hebrew invasion of canaan we are told that the passage of the jordan took place on the tenth day of the first month and that the feast of the passover was held on the fourteenth day of that month these are the only two positive dates given us the week of the pascal celebrations would have occupied the time until the moons last quarter then preparations were made for the siege of jericho and another week passed in the daily processions round the city before the moment came for its destruction which must have been very nearly at the beginning of the second month of the year jericho having been destroyed joshua next ordered a reconnaissance of a a small fortified town some twenty miles distant and some 3400 feet above the israelite camp at gilgal and commanding the upper end of the valley of achor the chief ravine leading up from the valley of the jordan the reconnaissance was followed by an attack on the town which resulted in defeat from the dejection into which this reverse had thrown him joshua was roused by the information that the command to devote the spoil of jericho to utter destruction had been disobeyed a searching investigation was held it was found that achan one of the israelite soldiers had seized for himself a royal robe and an ingot of gold he was tried condemned and executed and the army of israel was absolved from his guilt a second attack was made upon a the town was taken and the road was made clear for israel to march into the heart of the country in order to hold the great religious ceremony of the reading of the law upon the mountains of ebal and gerizim which had been commanded them long before no note is given of the date when this ceremony took place but bearing in mind that the second month of the year must have begun at the time of the first reconnaissance of a and that the original giving of the law upon mount sinai had taken place upon the third day of the third month it seems most likely that that anniversary would be chosen for a solemnity which was intended to recall the original promulgation in the most effective manner if this were so it would account for the circumstance which would otherwise have seemed so strange that joshua should have attacked two cities only jericho and a and then for a time have held his hand it was the necessity of keeping the great national anniversary on the proper day which compelled him to desist from his military operations after a was taken we are not told how long the religious celebrations at shechem lasted but in any case the israelites can hardly have been back in their camp at gilgal before the third moon of the year was at the full but after their return events must have succeeded each other with great rapidity the amorites must have regarded the pilgrimage of israel to shechem as an unhopedfor respite and they took advantage of it to organize a great confederacy whilst this confederacy was being formed the rulers of a small state of hivitesby which we must understand a community differing either in race or habits from the generality of their amorite neighbourshad been much exercised by the course of events they had indeed reason to be a the last conquest of israel was less than four miles as the crow flies from bireh which is usually identified with beeroth one of the four cities of the hivite state and the beerothites had without doubt watched the cloud of smoke go up from the burning town when it was sacked and the mound which now covered what had been so recently their neighbour city was visible almost from their gates that was an objectlesson which required no enforcement the hivites sure that otherwise their turn would come next resolved to make peace with israel before they were attacked illustration map of southern palestine amorite cities thus hebron hivite cities beeroth places taken by the israelites jericho conjectural line of march of joshua to do this they had to deceive the israelites into believing that they were inhabitants of some land far from canaan and this they must do not only before joshua actually attacked them but before he sent out another scouting party for beeroth would inevitably have been the very first town which it would have approached and once joshuas spies had surveyed it all chance of the hivites successfully imposing upon him would have vanished but they were exposed to another danger if possible more urgent still the headquarters of the newly formed amorite league was at jerusalem on the same plateau as gibeon the hivite capital and distant from it less than six miles a single spy a single traitor during the anxious time that their defection was being planned and adonizedec the king of jerusalem would have heard of it in less than a couple of hours and the gibeonites would have been overwhelmed before joshua had any inkling that they were anxious to treat with him whoever was dilatory whoever was slow the gibeonites dared not be it can therefore have been at most only a matter of hours after joshuas return to gilgal before their wily embassy set forth but their defection had an instant result adonizedec recognized in a moment the urgency of the situation with joshua in possession of gibeon and its dependencies the israelites would be firmly established on the plateau at his very gates and the states of southern palestine would be cut off from their brethren in the north adonizedec lost no time he sought and obtained the aid of four neighbouring kings and marched upon gibeon the gibeonites sent at once the most urgent message to acquaint joshua with their danger and joshua as promptly replied he made a forced march with picked troops all that night up from gilgal and next day he was at their gates counterblow had followed blow swift as the clash of rapiers in a duel of fencers all three of the parties concernedhivite amorite and israelitehad moved with the utmost rapidity and no wonder the stake for which they were playing was very existence and the forfeit which would be exacted on failure was extinction 3day hour and place of the miracle the foregoing considerations enable us somewhat to narrow down the time of the year at which joshuas miracle can have taken place and from an astronomical point of view this is very important the israelites had entered the land of canaan on the 10th day of the first month that is to say very shortly after the spring equinoxmarch 21 of our present calendar seven weeks after that equinoxmay 11the sun attains a declination of 18 north from this time its declination increases day by day until the summer solstice when in joshuas time it was nearly 24 north after that it slowly diminishes and on august 4 it is 18 again for twelve weeks thereforevery nearly a quarter of the entire yearthe suns northern declination is never less than 18 the date of the battle must have fallen somewhere within this period it cannot have fallen earlier the events recorded could not possibly have all been included in the seven weeks following the equinox nor in view of the promptitude with which all the contending parties acted and were bound to act can we postpone the battle to a later date than the end of this midsummer period we thus know roughly speaking what was the declination of the sunthat is to say its distance from the equator of the heavensat the time of the battle it was not less than 18 north of the equator it could not have been more than 24 but if we adopt the idea most generally formed of the meaning of joshuas command namely that he saw the sun low down over gibeon in one direction and the moon low down over the valley of ajalon in another we can judge of the apparent bearing of those two heavenly bodies from an examination of the map and since if we may judge from the map of the palestine exploration fund the valley of ajalon lies about 17 north of west from gibeon and runs nearly in that direction from it the moon must to joshua have seemed about 17 north of west and the sun 17 south of east but for any date within the three summer months the sun in the latitude of gibeon when it bears 17 south of east must be at least 56 high at this height it would seem overhead and would not give the slightest idea of association with any distant terrestrial object not until some weeks after the autumnal equinox could the sun be seen low down on the horizon in the direction 17 south of east and at the same time the moon be as much as 17 north of the west point and as this would mean that the different combatants had remained so close to each other some four or five months without moving it is clearly inadmissible we are forced therefore to the unexpected conclusion that it is practically impossible that joshua could have been in any place from whence he could have seen at one and the name moment the sun low down in the sky over gibeon and the moon over the valley of ajalon is the narrative in error then or have we been reading into it our own erroneous impression is there any other sense in which a man would naturally speak of a celestial body as being over some locality on the earth except when both were together on his horizon most certainly there is another position which the sun can hold in which it may naturally be said to be over or upon a given place far more naturally and accurately than when it chances to lie in the same direction as some object on the horizon we have no experience of that position in these northern latitudes and hence perhaps our commentators have as a rule not taken it into account but those who in tropical or subtropical countries have been in the open at high noon when a mans foot can almost cover his shadow will recognize how definite how significant such a position is in southern palestine during the three summer months the sun is always so near the zenith at noon that it could never occur to any one to speak of it as anything but overhead and the prose narrative expressly tells us that this was the case it is intimated that when joshua spoke it was noon by the expression that the sun hasted not to go down about a whole day implying that the change in the rate in its apparent motion occurred only in the afternoon and that it had reached its culmination further as not a few commentators have pointed out the expressionthe sun stood still in the midst of heavenis literally in the bisection of heaven a phrase applicable indeed to any position on the meridian but especially appropriate to the meridian close to the zenith this then is what joshua meant by his command to the sun its glowing orb blazed almost in the centre of the whole celestial vaultin the midst of heavenand poured down its vertical rays straight on his head it stood over himit stood over the place where he wasgibeon we have therefore been able to find that the narrative gives us by implication two very important particulars the place where joshua was and the time of the day he was at gibeon and it was high noon the expression thou moon in the valley of ajalon has now a very definite signification as we have already seen the valley of ajalon bears 17 north of west from gibeon according to the map of the palestine exploration fund so that this is the azimuth which the moon had at the given moment in other words it was almost exactly midway between the two points of the compass wbn and wnw it was also in its last quarter or nearly so that is it was halffull and waning with the sun on the meridian it could not have been much more than halffull for in that case it would have already set nor much less than halffull or it would have been too faint to be seen in full daylight it was therefore almost exactly halffull and the day was probably the 21st day of the month in the jewish reckoning illustration bearings of the rising and setting points of the sun from gibeon but the moon cannot be as far as 17 north of west in latitude 31 51 n on the 21st day of the month earlier than the fourth month of the jewish year or later than the eighth month now the 21st day of the fourth month is about seven weeks after the 3rd day of the third month the 21st day of the fifth month is eleven weeks remembering how close gilgal gibeon and jerusalem were to each other and how important was the need for promptitude to israelite and amorite alike it can scarcely be disputed that eleven weeks is an inadmissible length of time to interpose between the reading of the law and the battle and that seven weeks is the utmost that can be allowed the battle took place then on or about the 21st day of the fourth month but it could only have done so if that particular year began late if the year had begun earlier than april 1st of our present calendar the moon could not have been so far north on the day named for the jewish calendar is a natural one and regulated both by the sun and the moon it begins with the new moon and it also begins as nearly as possible with the spring equinox but as twelve natural months fall short of a solar year by eleven days a thirteenth month has to be intercalated from time to time in every nineteen years seven are years having an extra month now the 21st day of the fourth month must have fallen on or about july 22 according to our present reckoning in order that the moon might have sufficient northing and that involves a year beginning after april 1 so that the year of the battle of bethhoron must have been an ordinary year one of twelve months but must have followed a year of thirteen months summarizing all the conclusions at which we have now arrived joshuas observation was made at gibeon itself almost precisely at the moment of noon on or about the 21st day of the fourth month which day fell late in july according to our present reckoning probably on or about the 22nd the suns declination must have been about 20 north probably if anything a little more the sun rose therefore almost exactly at five in the morning and set almost exactly at seven in the evening the day being just fourteen hours long the moon had not yet passed her third quarter but was very near it that is to say she was about half full her declination did not differ greatly from 16 north she was probably about 5 above the horizon and was due to set in about half an hour she had risen soon after eleven oclock the previous evening and had lighted the israelites during more than half of their night march up from gilgal 4joshuas strategy these conclusions as to the place and time of day entirely sweep away the impression so often formed that joshuas victory was practically in the nature of a night surprise had it been so and had the amorites been put to flight at daybreak there would have seemed no conceivable reason why with fourteen hours of daylight before him joshua should have been filled with anxiety for the day to have been prolonged nor is it possible to conceive that he would still have been at gibeon at noon seven hours after he had made his victorious attack upon his enemy the fact is that in all probability joshua had no wish to make a night surprise his attitude was like that of nelson before the battle of trafalgar he had not the slightest doubt but that he would gain the victory but he was most anxious that it should be a complete one the great difficulty in the campaign which lay before him was the number of fortified places in the hands of the enemy and the costliness both in time and lives of all siege operations at that epoch his enemies having taken the field gave him the prospect of overcoming this difficulty if now that they were in the open he could succeed in annihilating them there to have simply scattered them would have brought him but little advantage that this was the point to which he gave chief attention is apparent from one most significant circumstance in the history the amorites fled by the road to bethhoron there have been several battles of bethhoron since the days of joshua and the defeated army has on more than one occasion fled by the route now taken by the amorites two of these are recorded by josephus the one in which judas maccabus defeated and slew nicanor and the other when cestius gallus retreated from jerusalem it is probable that bethhoron was also the scene of one if not two battles with the philistines at the commencement of davids reign in all these cases the defeated foe fled by this road because it had been their line of advance and was their shortest way back to safety but the conditions were entirely reversed in the case of joshuas battle the amorites fled away from their cities jerusalem the capital of adonizedec and the chief city of the confederation lay in precisely the opposite direction the other cities of their league lay beyond jerusalem further still to the south a reference to the map shows that gilgal the headquarters of the army of israel was on the plain of jericho close to the banks of the jordan at the bottom of that extraordinary ravine through which the river runs due west at a distance of about sixteen or seventeen miles as the crow flies but three thousand four hundred feet above the level of the jordan rises the ridge of the watershed the backbone of the structure of palestine on this ridge are the cities of jerusalem and gibeon and on it leading down to the maritime plain runs in a northwesterly direction the road through the two bethhorons the two bethhorons are one and a half miles apart with a descent of 700 feet from the upper to the lower the flight of the amorites towards bethhoron proves beyond a doubt that joshua had possessed himself of the road from gibeon to jerusalem it is equally clear that this could not have been done by accident but that it must have been the deliberate purpose of his generalship jerusalem was a city so strong that it was not until the reign of david that the israelites obtained possession of the whole of it and to take it was evidently a matter beyond joshuas ability but to have defeated the amorites at gibeon and to have left open to them the way to jerusalemless than six miles distantwould have been a perfectly futile proceeding we may be sure therefore that from the moment when he learned that adonizedek was besieging gibeon joshuas first aim was to cut off the amorite king from his capital the fact that the amorites fled not towards their cities but away from them shows clearly that joshua had specially manoeuvred so as to cut them off from jerusalem how he did it we are not told and any explanation offered must necessarily be merely of the nature of surmise yet a considerable amount of probability may attach to it the geographical conditions are perfectly well known and we can to some degree infer the course which the battle must have taken from these just as we could infer the main lines of the strategy employed by the germans in their war with the french in 1870 simply by noting the places where the successive battles occurred the positions of the battlefields of marslatour gravelotte and sedan would show clearly that the object of the germans had been first to shut bazaine up in metz and then to hinder macmahon from coming to his relief so in the present case the fact that the amorites fled by the way of the two bethhorons shows first that joshua had completely cut them off from the road to jerusalem and next that somehow or other when they took flight they were a long way to the north of him had they not been so they could not have had any long start in their flight and the hailstorm which occasioned them such heavy loss would have injured the israelites almost as much how can these two circumstances be accounted for i think we can make a very plausible guess at the details of joshuas strategy from noting what he is recorded to have done in the case of a on that occasion as on this he had felt his inability to deal with an enemy behind fortifications his tactics therefore had consisted in making a feigned attack followed by a feigned retreat by which he drew his enemies completely away from their base which he then seized by means of a detachment which he had previously placed in ambush near then when the men of a were hopelessly cut off from their city he brought all his forces together surrounded his enemies in the open and destroyed them it was a far more difficult task which lay before him at gibeon but we may suppose that he still acted on the same general principles there were two points on the ridge of the watershed which for very different reasons it was important that he should seize the one was beeroth one of the cities of the hivites his allies close to his latest victory of a and commanding the highest point on the ridge of the watershed it is distant from jerusalem some ten milesa days journey tradition therefore gives it as the place where the virgin mary and st joseph turned back sorrowing seeking jesus for they supposing him to have been in the company went a days journey and beeroth still forms the first haltingplace for pilgrims from the north on their return journey beeroth also was the city of the two sons of rimmon who murdered ishbosheth the son of saul when it is remembered how saul had attempted to extirpate the gibeonites and how bitter a blood feud the latter entertained against his house in consequence it becomes very significant that the murderers of his son were men of this gibeonite town beeroth also commanded the exit from the principal ravine by which joshua could march upwards to the ridgethe valley of achor the israelites marching by this route would have the great advantage that beeroth in the possession of their allies the gibeonites would act as a cover to them whilst in the ravines and give them security whilst taking up a position on the plateau but beeroth had one fatal disadvantage as a sole line of advance from beeroth joshua would come down to gibeon from the north and the amorites if defeated would have a line of retreat clear and easy to jerusalem it was absolutely essential that somewhere or other he should cut the jerusalem road this would be a matter of great difficulty and danger as if his advance were detected whilst he was still in the ravines he would have been taken at almost hopeless disadvantage the fearful losses which the israelites sustained in the intertribal war with benjamin near this very place show what joshua might reasonably have expected had he tried to make his sole advance on the ridge near jerusalem is it not probable that he would have endeavoured under these circumstances to entice the amorites as far away to the north as possible before he ventured to bring his main force out on the ridge if so we may imagine that he first sent a strong force by the valley of achor to beeroth that they were instructed there to take up a strong position and when firmly established to challenge the amorites to attack them then when the israelite general in command at beeroth perceived that he had before him practically the whole amorite forcefor it would seem clear that the five kings themselves together with the greater part of their army were thus drawn awayhe would signal to joshua that the time had come for his advance just as joshua himself had signalled with his spear at the taking of a so the firing of a beacon placed on the summit of the ridge would suffice for the purpose joshua would then lead up the main body seize the jerusalem road and press on to gibeon at the utmost speed if this were so the small detachment of amorites left to continue the blockade was speedily crushed but perhaps was aware of joshuas approach soon enough to send swift runners urging the five kings to return the news would brook no delay the kings would turn south immediately but for all their haste they never reached gibeon they probably had but advanced as far as the ridge leading to bethhoron when they perceived that not only had joshua relieved gibeon and destroyed the force which they had left before it but that his line stretched out far to the right and left already cut them off not merely from the road to jerusalem and hebron but also from the valley of ajalon a shorter road to the maritime plain than the one they actually took east there was no escape north was the israelite army from beeroth south and west was the army of joshua outmanoeuvred and outgeneralled they were in the most imminent danger of being caught between the two israelite armies and of being ground like wheat between the upper and nether millstones they had no heart for further fight the promise made to joshuathere shall not a man of them stand before theewas fulfilled they broke and fled by the one way open to them the way of the two bethhorons whilst this conjectural strategy attributes to joshua a ready grasp of the essential features of the military position and skill in dealing with them it certainly does not attribute to him any greater skill than it is reasonable to suppose he possessed the hebrews have repeatedly proved not merely their valour in battle but their mastery of the art of war and as marcel dieulafoy has recently shown3721 the earliest general of whom we have record as introducing turning tactics in the field is david in the battle of the valley of rephaim recorded in 2 sam v 2225 and 1 chron xiv 1317 the several evolutions of a complicated and hazardous nature which decided the fate of the battle would betoken even at the present day when successfully conducted a consummate general experienced lieutenants troops well accustomed to manoeuvres mobile and above all disciplined almost into unconsciousness so contrary is it to our instincts not to meet peril face to face in point of fact the israelites had just effected in the face of the philistines a turning and enveloping movementthat is to say an operation of war considered to be one of the boldest most skilful and difficult attempted by forces similar in number to those of the hebrews but at the same time very efficacious and brilliant when successful it was the favourite manoeuvre of frederick ii and the one on which his military reputation rests but though the amorites had been discomfited by joshua they had not been completely surrounded one way of escape was left open more than this it appears that they obtained a very ample start in the race along the northwestern road we infer this from the incident of the hailstorm which fell upon them whilst rushing down the precipitous road between the bethhorons a storm so sudden and so violent that more of the amorites died by the hailstones than had fallen in the contest at gibeon it does not appear that the israelites suffered from the storm they must consequently have at the time been much in the rear of their foes probably they were still in the way that goeth up to bethhoron that is to say in the ascent some two miles long from gibeon till the summit of the road is reached there would be a special appropriateness in this case in the phrasing of the record that the lord discomfited the amorites before israel and slew them with a great slaughter at gibeon and chased them along the way that goeth up to bethhoron and smote them to azekah and unto makkedah there was no slaughter on the road between gibeon and bethhoron it was a simple chase a pursuit with the enemy far in advance the israelites general and soldiers alike had done their best the forced march all night up the steep ravines the plan of the battle and the way in which it had been carried out were alike admirable yet when the israelites had done their best and the heat and their long exertions had nearly overpowered them joshua was compelled to recognize that he had been but partly successful he had relieved gibeon the amorites were in headlong flight he had cut them off from the direct road to safety but he had failed in one most important point he had not succeeded in surrounding them and the greater portion of their force was escaping 5the miracle it was at this moment when his scouts announced to him the frustration of his hopes that joshua in the anxiety lest the full fruits of his victory should be denied him and in the supremest faith that the lord god in whose hand are all the powers of the universe was with him exclaimed sun stand thou still upon gibeon and thou moon in the valley of ajalon so his exclamation stands in our authorized version but as the marginal reading shows the word translated stand still is more literally be silent there can be no doubt that this expression so unusual in this connection must have been employed with intention what was it that joshua is likely to have had in his mind when he thus spoke the common idea is that he simply wished for more time for the day to be prolonged but as we have seen it was midday when he spoke and he had full seven hours of daylight before him there was a need which he must have felt more pressing his men had now been seventeen hours on the march for they had started at sunset7 pmon the previous evening and it was now noon the noon of a subtropical midsummer they had marched at least twenty miles in the time possibly considerably more according to the route which they had followed and the march had been along the roughest of roads and had included an ascent of 3400 feetabout the height of the summit of snowdon above the sealevel they must have been weary and have felt sorely the heat of the sun now blazing right overhead surely it requires no words to labour this point joshuas one pressing need at that moment was something to temper the fierce oppression of the sun and to refresh his men this was what he prayed for this was what was granted him for the moment the sun seemed fighting on the side of his enemies and he bade it be silent instantly in answer to his command a mighty rush of dark stormclouds came sweeping up from the sea refreshed by the sudden coolness the israelites set out at once in the pursuit of their enemies it is probable that for the first six miles they saw no trace of them but when they reached bethhoron the upper and stood at the top of its steep descent they saw the amorites again as it had been with their fathers at the red sea when the pillar of cloud had been a defence to them but the means of discomfiture to the egyptians so now the stormclouds which had so revived them and restored their their strength had brought death and destruction to their enemies all down the rocky descent lay the wounded the dying the dead for the lord cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto azekah and they died they were more which died with hailstones than they whom the children of israel slew with the sword the might of the gentile unsmote by the sword had melted like snow in the glance of the lord far below them the panicstricken remnants of the amorite host were fleeing for safety to the cities of the maritime plain the battle proper was over the one duty left to the army of israel was to overtake and destroy those remnants before they could gain shelter but the narrative continues the sun stayed in the midst of heaven and hasted not to go down about a whole day this statement evidently implies much more than the mere darkening of the sun by stormclouds for its interpretation we must return to the remaining incidents of the day these are soon told joshua pursued the amorites to makkedah twentyseven miles from gibeon by the route taken there the five kings had hidden themselves in a cave a guard was placed to watch the cave the israelites continued the pursuit for an undefined distance farther returned to makkedah and took it by assault brought the kings out of their cave and hanged them and it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun that joshua commanded and they took them down off the trees and cast them into the cave wherein they had hidden themselves and laid great stones on the mouth of the cave unto this very day all these eventsthe pursuit for twentyseven miles and more the taking of makkedah and the hanging of the kingstook place between noon and the going down of the sun an interval whose normal length for that latitude and at that time of the year was about seven hours this is an abnormal feat it is true that a single trained pedestrian might traverse the twentyseven and odd miles and still have time to take part in an assault on a town and to watch an execution but it is an altogether different thing when we come to a large army it is well known that the speed with which a body of men can move diminishes with the number a company can march faster than a regiment a regiment than a brigade a brigade than an army corps but for a large force thirty miles in the entire day is heavy work thus sir archibald hunters division in its march through bechuanaland to the relief of mafeking starting at four in the morning went on till seven or eight at night covering as many as thirty miles a day at times joshuas achievement was a march fully as long as any of general hunters but it was accomplished in less than seven hours instead of from fifteen to sixteen and it followed straight on from a march seventeen hours in length which had ended in a battle in all between one sunset and the next he had marched between fifty and sixty miles besides fighting a battle and taking a town if we turn to the records of other battles fought in this neighbourhood we find that they agree as closely as we could expect not with joshuas achievement but with general hunters in the case of the great victory secured by jonathan the gallant son of saul the israelites smote the philistines from michmash to ajalonnot quite twenty miles in the defeat of cestius gallus the jews followed him from bethhoron to antipatris a little over twenty miles the pursuit beginning at daybreak and being evidently continued nearly till sundown the pursuit of the syrians under nicanor by judas maccabus seems also to have covered about the same distance for nicanor was killed at the first onslaught and his troops took to flight it is not at all unusual to read in comments on the book of joshua that the miracle is simply the result of the dulness of the prose chronicler in accepting as literal fact an expression that originated in the poetic exuberance of an old bard the latter so it is urged simply meaning to add a figure of dignity and importance to his song commemorating a great national victory had written and the sun stood still and the moon stayed until the nation had avenged themselves of their enemies but with no more expectation that the stay of the moon would be accepted literally than the singers who welcomed david after the slaying of goliath imagined that any one would seriously suppose that saul had actually with his own hand killed two thousand philistines and david twenty thousand but say they the later prose chronicler quoting from the ballad and accepting a piece of poetic hyperbole as actual fact reproduced the statement in his own words and added the sun stayed in the midst of heaven and hasted not to go down about a whole day not so the poem and the prose chronicle make one coherent whole working from the poem alone treating the expressions in the first two lines merely as astronomical indications of time and place and without the slightest reference to any miraculous interpretation they lead to the inevitable conclusion that the time was noonday this result certainly does not lie on the surface of the poem and it was wholly beyond the power of the prose chronicler to have computed it yet it is just in the supposed stupid gloss of the prose chronicler and nowhere else that we find this fact definitely stated whilst the miracle recorded both by poem and prose narrative completely accords with the extraordinary distance traversed between noon and sunset any man however ignorant of science if he be but careful and conscientious can truthfully record an observation without any difficulty but to successfully invent even the simplest astronomical observation requires very full knowledge and is difficult even then every astronomer knows that there is hardly a single novelist no matter how learned or painstaking who can at this present day introduce a simple astronomical relation into his story without falling into egregious error we are therefore quite sure that joshua did use the words attributed to him that the moon and the valley of ajalon were not merely inserted in order to complete the parallelism by a bard putting a legend into poetic form nor was the prose narrative the result of an editor combining two or three narratives all written much after the date the original records must have been made at the time all astronomers know well how absolutely essential it is to commit an observation to writing on the spot illustrations of this necessity could be made to any extent one may suffice in vol ii of the life of sir richard burton by his wife p 244 lady burton says on the 6th december 1882 we were walking on the karso opona alone the sky was clear and all of a sudden my niece said to me oh look up there is a star walking into the moon glorious i answered we are looking at the transit of venus which crowds of scientists have gone to the end of the world to see the transit of venus did take place on december 6 1882 and though venus could have been seen without telescopic aid as a black spot on the suns disc nothing can be more unlike venus in transit than a star walking into the moon the moon was not visible on that evening and venus was only visible when on the suns disc and appeared then not as a star but as a black dot no doubt lady burtons niece did make the exclamation attributed to her but it must have been not on december 6 1882 but on some other occasion lady burton may indeed have told her niece that this was the transit of venus but that was simply because she did not know what a transit was nor that it occurred in the daytime not at night lady burtons narrative was therefore not written at the time so if the facts of the tenth chapter of joshua as we have it had not been written at the time of the battle some gross astronomical discordance would inevitably have crept in let us suppose that the sun and moon did actually stand still in the sky for so long a time that between noon and sunset was equal to the full length of an ordinary day what effect would have resulted that the israelites could have perceived this and this only that they would have marched twice as far between noon and sunset as they could have done in any ordinary afternoon and this as we have seen is exactly what they are recorded to have done the only measure of time available to the israelites independent of the apparent motion of the sun was the number of miles marched indeed with the babylonians the same word kasbu was used to indicate three distinct but related measures it was a measure of timethe double hour of celestial arcthe twelfth part of a great circle thirty degrees that is to say the space traversed by the sun in two hours and it was a measure of distance on the surface of the earthsix or seven miles or a two hours march if for the sake of illustration we may suppose that the sun were to stand still for us we should recognize it neither by sundial nor by shadow but we should see that whereas our clocks had indicated that the sun had risen we will say at six in the morning and had southed at twelve of noon it had not set until twelve of the night the register of work done shown by all our clocks and watches would be double for the afternoon what it had been for the morning and if all our clocks and watches did thus register upon some occasion twice the interval between noon and sunset that they had registered between sunrise and noon we should be justified in recording as the writer of the book of joshua has recorded the sun stood still in the midst of heaven and hasted not to go down about a whole day the real difficulty to the understanding of this narrative has lain in the failure of commentators to put themselves back into the conditions of the israelites the israelites had no timemeasurers could have had no timemeasurers a sundial if any such were in existence would only indicate the position of the sun and therefore could give no evidence in the matter beside a sundial is not a portable instrument and joshua and his men had something more pressing to do than to loiter round it clepsydr or clocks are of later date and no more than a sundial are they portable many comments one might almost say most comments on the narrative read as if the writers supposed that joshua and his men carried stopwatches and that their chief interest in the whole campaign was to see how fast the sun was moving since they had no such methods of measuring time since it is not possible to suppose that over and above any material miracle that was wrought the mental miracle was added of acquainting the israelites for this occasion only with the copernican system of astronomy all that the words of the narrative can possibly mean is that the sun stood still in the midst of heaven and hasted not to go down about a whole day according to the only means which the israelites had for testing the matter in short it simply states in other words what it is clear from other parts of the narrative was actually the case that the length of the march made between noon and sunset was equal to an ordinary march taking the whole of a day if we supposeas has been generally done and as it is quite legitimate to do for all things are possible to godthat the miracle consisted in the slackening of the rotation of the earth what effect would have been perceived by the hebrews this and only this that they would have accomplished a full days march in the course of the afternoon and what would have been the effects produced on all the neighbouring nations simply that they had managed to do more work than usual in the course of that afternoon and that they felt more than usually tired and hungry in the evening but would it have helped the israelites for the day to have been thus actually lengthened scarcely so unless they had been at the same time endowed with supernatural or at all events with unusual strength the israelites had already been 31 hours without sleep or rest they had made a remarkable march their enemies had several miles start of them would not a longer day have simply given the latter a better chance to make good their flight unless the israelites were enabled to pursue them with unusual speed and if the israelites were so enabled then no further miracle is required for them the sun would have hasted not to go down about a whole day leaving the question as to whether the sun appeared to stand still through the temporary arrest of the earths rotation or through some exaltation of the physical powers of the israelites it seems clear from the foregoing analysis of the narrative that both the prose account and the poem were written by eyewitnesses who recorded what they had themselves seen and heard whilst every detail was fresh in their memory simple as the astronomical references are they are very stringent and can only have been supplied by those who were actually present nothing can be more unlike poetic hyperbole than the sum of actual miles marched to the men who trod them and these very concrete miles were the gauge of the lapse of time for just as nail and span and foot and cubit and pace were the early measures of small distance so the average days march was the early measure of long distance the human frame in its proportions and in its abilities is sufficiently uniform to have furnished the primitive standards of length but the relation established between time and distance as in the case of a days march works either way and is employed in either direction even at the present day when the israelites at the end of their campaign returned from makkedah to gibeon and found the march though wholly unobstructed was still a heavy performance for the whole of a long day what could they think how could they express themselves concerning that same march made between noon and sundown whatever construction we put upon the incident whatever explanation we may offer for it to all the men of israel judging the events of the afternoon by the only standard within their reach the eminently practical standard of the miles they had marched the only conclusion at which they could arrive was the one they so justly drew the sun stayed in the midst of heaven and hasted not to go down about a whole day and there was no day like that before it or after it that the lord hearkened unto the voice of a man for the lord fought for israel footnotes 3511 revised and reprinted from the sunday at home for february and march 1904 3721 marcel dieulafoy david the king an historical enquiry pp 155175 chapter ii the dial of ahaz the second astronomical marvel recorded in the scripture narrative is the going back of the shadow on the dial of ahaz at the time of hezekiahs recovery from his dangerous illness it was shortly after the deliverance of the kingdom of judah from the danger threatened it by sennacherib king of assyria that hezekiah fell sick unto death but in answer to his prayer isaiah was sent to tell him thus saith the lord the god of david thy father i have heard thy prayer i have seen thy tears behold i will heal thee on the third day thou shalt go up unto the house of the lord and i will add unto thy days fifteen years and i will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of assyria and i will defend this city for mine own sake and for my servant davids sake and isaiah said take a lump of figs and they took and laid it on the boil and he recovered and hezekiah said unto isaiah what shall be the sign that the lord will heal me and that i shall go up into the house of the lord the third day and isaiah said this sign shalt thou have of the lord that the lord will do the thing that he hath spoken shall the shadow go forward ten degrees or go back ten degrees and hezekiah answered it is a light thing for the shadow to go down ten degrees nay but let the shadow return backward ten degrees and isaiah the prophet cried unto the lord and he brought the shadow ten degrees backward by which it had gone down in the dial of ahaz the narrative in the book of isaiah gives the concluding words in the form so the sun returned ten degrees by which degrees it was gone down the narrative is complete as a record of the healing of king hezekiah and of the sign given to him to assure him that he should recover complete for all the ordinary purposes of a narrative and for readers in general but for any purpose of astronomical analysis the narrative is deficient and it must be frankly confessed that it does not lie within the power of astronomy to make any use of it it has been generally assumed that it was an actual sundial upon which this sign was seen we do not know how far back the art of dialling goes the simplest form of dial is an obelisk on a flat pavement but it has the very important drawback that the graduation is different for different times of the year in a properly constructed dial the edge of the style casting the shadow should be made parallel to the axis of the earth consequently a dial for one latitude is not available without alteration when transferred to another latitude some fine types of dials on a large scale exist in the observatories built by jai singh the first of thesethat at delhiwas probably completed about 1710 ad they are therefore quite modern but afford good illustrations of the type of structure which we can readily conceive of as having been built in what has been termed the stone age of astronomy the principal of these buildings the samrat yantra is a long staircase in the meridian leading up to nothing the shadow falling on to a great semicircular arc which it crosses the slope of the staircase is of course parallel to the earths axis it has been suggested that if such a dial were erected at jerusalem and the style were that for a tropical latitude at certain times of the year the shadow would appear to go backward for a short time others again have suggested that if a small portable dial were tilted the same phenomenon would show itself it is of course evident that no such suggestion at all accords with the narrative hezekiah was now in the fourteenth year of his reign the dialif dial it waswas made by his father and the miracle would have been reproduced day by day for a considerable part of each year and after the event it would have been apparent to every one that the miracle continued to be reproduced if this had been the case it would say very little for the astronomical science of the wise men of merodachbaladan that he should have sent all the way from babylon to jerusalem to inquire of the wonder that was done in the land if the wonder was nothing more than a wrongly mounted dial others have hazarded the extreme hypothesis that there might have been an earthquake at the time which dipped the dial in the proper direction and then restored it to its proper place presumably of course without doing harm to jerusalem or any of its buildings and passing unnoticed by both king and people a much more ingenious theory than any of those was communicated by the late j w bosanquet to the royal asiatic society in 1854 an eclipse of the sun took place on january 11 689 bc it was an annular eclipse in asia minor and a very large partial eclipse at jerusalem the greatest phase taking place nearly at local noon mr bosanquet considers that the effect of the partial eclipse would be to practically shift the centre of the bright body casting the shadow at the beginning of the annular phase the part of the sun uncovered would be a crescent in a nearly vertical position at mid eclipse the crescent would be in a horizontal position at the end of the annular phase the crescent would again be in a vertical position so that the exposed part of the sun would appear to move down and up in the sky over a very small distance it is extremely doubtful whether any perceptible effect could be so produced on the shadow and one wholly fails to understand why the eclipse itself should not have been given as the sign and why neither the king nor the people seem to have noticed that it was in progress it is however sufficient to say that modern chronology shows that hezekiah died ten years before the eclipse in question so that it fell a quarter of a century too late for the purpose and no other eclipse is available to take its place during the lifetime of hezekiah but there is no reason to think that the word rendered in our authorized version as dial was a sundial at all the word translated dial is the same which is also rendered degrees in the av and steps in the rv as is shown in the margin of the latter it occurs in the prophecy of amos where it is rendered stories or ascensions it means an ascent a going up a step thus king solomons throne had six steps and there are fifteen psalms cxxcxxxivthat are called songs of degrees that is songs of steps we do not know how the staircase of ahaz faced but we can form some rough idea from the known positions of the temple and of the city of david and one or two little hints given us in the narrative itself it will be noted that hezekiah uses the movement of the shadow downward as equivalent to its going forward the going forward of course meant its ordinary direction of motion at that time of day so the return of the shadow backward meant that the shadow went up ten steps for in the book of isaiah it speaks of the sun returning ten degrees by which degrees it was gone down it was therefore in the afternoon and the sun was declining when the sign took place it is clear therefore that the staircase was so placed that the shadow went down the stairs as the sun declined in the sky the staircase therefore probably faced east or northeast as it would naturally do if it led from the palace towards the temple no doubt there was a causeway at the foot of this staircase and a corresponding ascent up the temple hill on the opposite side of the valley we can now conjecturally reproduce the circumstances it was afternoon and the palace had already cast the upper steps of the staircase into shadow the sick king looking longingly towards the temple could see the lower steps still gleaming in the bright judean sunshine it was natural therefore for him to say when the prophet isaiah offered him his choice of a sign shall the shadow go forward ten steps or back ten steps that it was a light thing for the shadow to go down ten steps nay but let the shadow return backward ten steps it would be quite obvious to him that a small cloud suitably placed might throw ten additional steps into shadow it will be seen that we are left with several details undetermined for the staircase wherever constructed was probably not meant to act as a sundial and was only so used because it chanced to have some rough suitability for the purpose in this case the shadow will probably have been thrown not by a properly constructed gnomon but by some building in the neighbourhood and as we have no record of the direction of the staircase its angle of inclination its height and the position of the buildings which might have cast a shadow upon it we are without any indication to guide us when the queen of sheba came to visit king solomon and saw all his magnificence one of the things which specially impressed her was his ascent by which he went up unto the house of the lord this was the causeway of the going up as it is called in the first book of chronicles we are told of a number of alterations made in the temple furniture and buildings by king ahaz and it is said that the covered way for the sabbath that they had built in the house and the kings entry without turned he unto margin round the house of the lord because of the king of assyria that is to say ahaz considered that solomons staircase was too much exposed in the case of a siege being without the temple enclosure this probably necessitated the construction of a new staircase which would naturally be called the staircase of ahaz that there was in later times such a staircase at about this place we know from the route taken by the triumphal procession at the time of the dedication of the wall of jerusalem under nehemiah at the fountain gate which was over against them they went up by the stairs of the city of david at the going up of the wall above the house of david even unto the water gate eastward in this case there would be a special appropriateness in the sign that was offered to hezekiah the sign that he would be so restored as once again to go up to the house of the lord was to be given him on the very staircase by which he would go he was now thirtyeight years old and had doubtless watched the shadow of the palace descend the staircase in the afternoon hundreds of times quite possibly he had actually seen a cloud make the shadow race forward but the reverse he had never seen once a step had passed into the shadow of the palace it did not again emerge until the next morning dawned the sign then was this it was afternoon probably approaching the time of the evening prayer and the court officials and palace attendants were moving down the staircase in the shadow when as the sick king watched them from above the shadow of the palace was rolled back up the staircase and a flood of light poured down on ten of the broad steps upon which the sun had already set how this lighting of the ten steps was brought about we are not told nor is any clue given us on which we can base a conjecture but this return of light was a figure of what was actually happening in the life of the king himself he had already as it were passed into the shadow that only deepens into night as he sang himself after his recovery i said in the noontide of my days i shall go into the gates of the grave i am deprived of the residue of my years i said i shall not see the lord even the lord in the land of the living i shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world but now the light had been brought back to him and he could say the living the living he shall praise thee as i do this day the father to the children shall make known thy truth the lord is ready to save me therefore we will sing my songs to the stringed instruments all the days of our life in the house of the lord chapter iii the star of bethlehem no narrative of holy scripture is more familiar to us than that of the visit of the wise men from the east to see him that was born king of the jews it was towards the end of the reign of herod the great that they arrived at jerusalem and threw herod the king and all the city into great excitement by their question where is he that is born king of the jews for we have seen his star in the east and are come to worship him herod at once gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together and demanded of them where the messiah should be born their reply was distinct and unhesitating in bethlehem of juda for thus it is written by the prophet and thou bethlehem in the land of juda art not the least among the princes of juda for out of thee shall come a governor that shall rule my people israel then herod when he had privily called the wise men inquired of them diligently what time the star appeared and he sent them to bethlehem and said go and search diligently for the young child and when ye have found him bring me word again that i may come and worship him also when they had heard the king they departed and lo the star which they saw in the east went before them till it came and stood over where the young child was when they saw the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy so much and no more are we told of the star of bethlehem and the story is as significant in its omissions as in that which it tells us what sort of a star it was that led the wise men how they learnt from it that the king of the jews was born how it went before them how it stood over where the young child was we do not know nor is it of the least importance that we should know one verse more and that a short one would have answered these inquiries it would have told us whether it was some conjunction of the planets whether perchance it was a comet or a new or temporary star or whether it was a supernatural light like the pillar of fire that guided the children of israel in the wilderness but that verse has not been given the twelve or twenty additional words which could have cleared up the matter have been withheld and there can be no doubt as to the reason the star whatever its physical nature was of no importance except as a guide to the birthplace of the infant jesus information about it would have drawn attention from the object of the narrative it would have given to a mere signpost the importance which belonged only to the word made flesh we are often told that the bible should be studied precisely as any other book is studied yet before we can criticize any book we must first ascertain what was the purpose that the author had in writing it the history of england for instance has been written by many persons and from many points of view one man has traced the succession of the dynasties the relationships of the successive royal families and the effect of the administrations of the various kings another has chiefly considered the development of representative government and of parliamentary institutions a third has concerned himself more with the different races that by their fusion have formed the nation as it is today a fourth has dealt with the social condition of the people the increase of comfort and luxury to a fifth the true history of england is the story of its expansion the foundation and growth of its colonial empire while to a sixth its religious history is the one that claims most attention and the struggles with rome the rise and decay of puritanism and the development of modern thought will fill his pages each of these six will select just those facts and those facts only that are relevant to his subject the introduction of irrelevant facts would be felt to mark the ignorant or unskilful workman the master of his craft will keep in the background the details that have no bearing on his main purpose and to those which have but a slight bearing he will give only such notice as their importance in this connection warrants the purpose of the bible is to reveal god to us and to teach us of our relationship to him it was not intended to gratify that natural and laudable curiosity which has been the foundation of the physical sciences our own efforts our own intelligence can help us here and the scriptures have not been given us in order to save us the trouble of exerting them there is no reason for surprise then that the information given us concerning the star is astronomically so imperfect we are indeed told but two facts concerning it first that its appearance in some way or other informed the wise men not of the birth of a king of the jews but of the king of the jews for whose coming not israel only but more or less consciously the whole civilized world was waiting next having come to juda in consequence of this information the star pointed out to them the actual spot where the newborn king was to be found it went before them till it came and stood over where the young child was it may also be inferred from matt ii 10 that in some way or other the wise men had for a time lost sight of the star so that the two facts mentioned of it relate to two separate appearances the first appearance induced them to leave the east and set out for juda the second pointed out to them the place at bethlehem where the object of their search was to be found nothing is told us respecting the star except its work as a guide some three centuries ago the ingenious and devout kepler supposed that he could identify the star with a conjunction of the planets jupiter and saturn in the constellation pisces this conjunction took place in the month of may bc 7 not very long before the birth of our lord is supposed to have taken place but the late prof c pritchard has shown first that a similar and closer conjunction occurred 59 years earlier and should therefore have brought a magian deputation to juda then next that the two planets never approached each other nearer than twice the apparent diameter of the moon so that they would have appeared not as one star but as two and thirdly if the planets had seemed to stand over bethlehem as the wise men left jerusalem they most assuredly would not have appeared to do so when they arrived at the little city ingenious as the suggestion was it may be dismissed as unworthy of serious consideration another suggestion shows upon what slight foundations a wellrounded legend may be built in the year 1572 a wonderful new star appeared in the constellation cassiopeia at its brightest it outshone venus and though it gradually declined in splendour it remained visible for some sixteen months there have been other instances of outbursts of bright shortlived stars and brief notices in the annals of the years 1265 and 952 may have referred to such objects but more probably these were comets the guess was hazarded that these objects might be one and the same that the star in cassiopeia might be a variable star bursting into brilliancy about every 315 or 316 years that it was the star that announced the birth of our lord and that it would reappear towards the end of the nineteenth century to announce his second coming one thing more was lacking to make the legend complete and this was supplied by the planet venus which shines with extraordinary brilliance when in particular parts of her orbit on one of these occasions when she was seen as a morning star in the east some hazy recollection of the legend just noticed caused a number of people to hail her as none other than the star of bethlehem at its predicted return there is no reason to suppose that the star of 1572 had ever appeared before that date or will ever appear again but in any case we are perfectly sure that it could not have been the star of bethlehem for cassiopeia is a northern constellation and the wise men when they set out from jerusalem to bethlehem must have had cassiopeia and all her stars behind them the fact that the star went before them and stood over where the young child lay gives the impression that it was some light like the shekinah glory resting on the ark in the tabernacle or the pillar of fire which led the children of israel through the wilderness but this view raises the questions as to the form in which it first appeared to the wise men when they were still in the east and how they came to call it a star when they must have recognized how very unstarlike it was whilst if what they saw when in the east was really a star it seems most difficult to understand how it can have appeared to go before them and to stand over the place where the young child lay i have somewhere come across a legend which may possibly afford the clue but i have not been able to find that the legend rests upon any authority it is that the star had been lost in the daylight by the time that the wise men reached jerusalem it was therefore an evening star during their journey thither but it is said that when they reached bethlehem apparently nearly at midday one of them went to the well of the inn in order to draw water looking down into the well he saw the star reflected from the surface of the water this would of course be an intimation to them that the star was directly overhead and its reobservation under such unusual circumstances would be a sufficient assurance that they had reached the right spot inquiry in the inn would lead to a knowledge of the visit of the shepherds and of the angelic message which had told them where to find the babe born in the city of david a saviour which is christ the lord if this story be true the star of bethlehem was probably a new star like that of 1572 its first appearance would then have caused the magi to set out on their journey though it does not appear how they knew what it signified unless we suppose that they were informed of it in a dream just as they were afterwards warned of god not to return to herod whilst they were travelling the course of the year would bring the star which shone straight before them in the west after sunset every evening nearer and nearer to the sun we may suppose that like other new stars it gradually faded so that by the time the wise men had reached jerusalem they had lost sight of it altogether having thus lost it they would probably not think of looking for it by daylight for it is no easy thing to detect by daylight even venus at her greatest brilliancy unless one knows exactly where to look the difficulty does not lie in any want of brightness but in picking up and holding steadily so minute a point of light in the broad expanse of the gleaming sky this difficulty would be overcome for them according to this story by the well which acted like a tube to direct them exactly to the star and like a telescope to lessen the sky glare it would be also necessary to suppose that the star was flashing out again with renewed brilliancy such a brief recovery of light has not been unknown in the case of some of our new or temporary stars i give the above story for what it is worth but i attach no importance to it myself some however may feel that it removes what they had felt as a difficulty in the narrativenamely to understand how the star could stand over where the young child lay it would also explain what seems to be implied in the narrative how it happened that the magi alone and not the jews in general perceived the star at its second appearance for myself the narrative appears to me astronomically too incomplete for any astronomical conclusions to be drawn from it the reticence of the narrative on all points except those directly relating to our lord himself is an illustration of the truth that the scriptures were not written to instruct us in astronomy or in any of the physical sciences but that we might have eternal life and this is life eternal that they might know thee the only true god and jesus christ whom thou hast sent a table of scriptural references page book chap and verse 9 i kings v 2934 10 wisdom vii 1722 rv 11 psalm viii 3 4 15 eccl i 9 17
