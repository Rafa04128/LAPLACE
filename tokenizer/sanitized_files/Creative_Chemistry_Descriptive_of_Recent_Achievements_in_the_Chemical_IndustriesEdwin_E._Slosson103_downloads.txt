professor of chemistry in the university of chicago the recent war as never before in the history of the world brought to the nations of the earth a realization of the vital place which the science of chemistry holds in the development of the resources of a nation some of the most picturesque features of this awakening reached the great public through the press thus the adventurous trips of the deutschland with its cargoes of concentrated aniline dyes valued at millions of dollars emphasized as no other incident our former dependence upon germany for these products of her chemical industries the public read too that her chemists saved germany from an early disastrous defeat both in the field of military operations and in the matter of economic supplies unquestionably without the tremendous expansion of her plants for the production of nitrates and ammonia from the air by the processes of haber ostwald and others of her great chemists the war would have ended in 1915 or early in 1916 from exhaustion of germanys supplies of nitrate explosives if not indeed from exhaustion of her food supplies as a consequence of the lack of nitrate and ammonia fertilizer for her fields inventions of substitutes for cotton copper rubber wool and many other basic needs have been reported these feats of chemistry performed under the stress of dire necessity have no doubt excited the wonder and interest of our public it is far more important at this time however when both for war and for peace needs the resources of our country are strained to the utmost that the public should awaken to a clear realization of what this science of chemistry really means for mankind to the realization that its wizardry permeates the whole life of the nation as a vitalizing protective and constructive agent very much in the same way as our blood coursing through our veins and arteries carries the constructive defensive and lifebringing materials to every organ in the body if the layman will but understand that chemistry is the fundamental science of the transformation of matter he will readily accept the validity of this sweeping assertion he will realize for instance why exactly the same fundamental laws of the science apply to and make possible scientific control of such widely divergent national industries as agriculture and steel manufacturing it governs the transformation of the salts minerals and humus of our fields and the components of the air into corn wheat cotton and the innumerable other products of the soil it governs no less the transformation of crude ores into steel and alloys which with the cunning born of chemical knowledge may be given practically any conceivable quality of hardness elasticity toughness or strength and exactly the same thing may be said of the hundreds of national activities that lie between the two extremes of agriculture and steel manufacture moreover the domain of the science of the transformation of matter includes even life itself as its loftiest phase from our birth to our return to dust the laws of chemistry are the controlling laws of life health disease and death and the ever clearer recognition of this relation is the strongest force that is raising medicine from the uncertain realm of an art to the safer sphere of an exact science to many scientific minds it has even become evident that those most wonderful facts of life heredity and character must find their final explanation in the chemical composition of the components of life producing germinal protoplasm mere form and shape are no longer supreme but are relegated to their proper place as the housing only of the living matter which functions chemically it must be quite obvious now why thoughtful men are insisting that the public should be awakened to a broad realization of the significance of the science of chemistry for its national life it is a difficult science in its details because it has found that it can best interpret the visible phenomena of the material world on the basis of the conception of invisible minute material atoms and molecules each a world in itself whose properties may be nevertheless accurately deduced by a rigorous logic controlling the highest type of scientific imagination but a layman is interested in the wonders of great bridges and of monumental buildings without feeling the need of inquiring into the painfully minute and extended calculations of the engineer and architect of the strains and stresses to which every pin and every bar of the great bridge and every bit of stone every foot of arch in a monumental edifice will be exposed so the public may understand and appreciate with the keenest interest the results of chemical effort without the need of instruction in the intricacies of our logic of our dealings with our minute invisible particles the whole nations welfare demands indeed that our public be enlightened in the matter of the relation of chemistry to our national life thus if our commerce and our industries are to survive the terrific competition that must follow the restablishment of peace our public must insist that its representatives in congress preserve that independence in chemical manufacturing which the war has forced upon us in the matter of dyes of numberless invaluable remedies to cure and relieve suffering in the matter too of hundreds of chemicals which our industries need for their successful existence unless we are independent in these fields how easily might an unscrupulous competing nation do us untold harm by the mere device for instance of delaying supplies or by sending inferior materials to this country or by underselling our chemical manufacturers and after the destruction of our chemical independence handicapping our industries as they were in the first year or two of the great war this is not a mere possibility created by the imagination for our economic history contains instance after instance of the purposeful undermining and destruction of our industries in finer chemicals dyes and drugs by foreign interests bent on preserving their monopoly if one recalls that through control for instance of dyes by a competing nation control is in fact also established over products valued in the hundreds of millions of dollars in which dyes enter as an essential factor one may realize indeed the tremendous industrial and commercial power which is controlled by the single leverchemical dyes of even more vital moment is chemistry in the domain of health the pitiful calls of our hospitals for local anesthetics to alleviate suffering on the operating table the frantic appeals for the hypnotic that soothes the epileptic and staves off his seizure the almost furious demands for remedy after remedy that came in the early years of the war are still ringing in the hearts of many of us no wonder that our small army of chemists is grimly determined not to give up the independence in chemistry which war has achieved for us only a widely enlightened public however can insure the permanence of what farseeing men have started to accomplish in developing the power of chemistry through research in every domain which chemistry touches the general public should realize that in the support of great chemical research laboratories of universities and technical schools it will be sustaining important centers from which the science which improves products abolishes waste establishes new industries and preserves life may reach out helpfully into all the activities of our great nation that are dependent on the transformation of matter the public is to be congratulated upon the fact that the writer of the present volume is better qualified than any other man in the country to bring home to his readers some of the great results of modern chemical activity as well as some of the big problems which must continue to engage the attention of our chemists dr slosson has indeed the unique quality of combining an exact and intimate knowledge of chemistry with the exquisite clarity and pointedness of expression of a born writer we have here an exposition by a master mind an exposition shorn of the terrifying and obscuring technicalities of the lecture room that will be as absorbing reading as any thrilling romance for the story of scientific achievement is the greatest epic the world has ever known and like the great national epics of bygone ages should quicken the life of the nation by a realization of its powers and a picture of its possibilities creative chemistry la chimie possde cette facult cratrice un degr plus minent que les autres sciences parce quelle pntre plus profondment et atteint jusquaux lments naturels des tres berthelot i three periods of progress the story of robinson crusoe is an allegory of human history man is a castaway upon a desert planet isolated from other inhabited worldsif there be any suchby millions of miles of untraversable space he is absolutely dependent upon his own exertions for this world of his as wells says has no imports except meteorites and no exports of any kind man has no wrecked ship from a former civilization to draw upon for tools and weapons but must utilize as best he may such raw materials as he can find in this conquest of nature by man there are three stages distinguishable 1 the appropriative period 2 the adaptive period 3 the creative period these eras overlap and the human race or rather its vanguard civilized man may be passing into the third stage in one field of human endeavor while still lingering in the second or first in some other respect but in any particular line this sequence is followed the primitive man picks up whatever he can find available for his use his successor in the next stage of culture shapes and develops this crude instrument until it becomes more suitable for his purpose but in the course of time man often finds that he can make something new which is better than anything in nature or naturally produced the savage discovers the barbarian improves the civilized man invents the first finds the second fashions the third fabricates the primitive man was a troglodyte he sought shelter in any cave or crevice that he could find later he dug it out to make it more roomy and piled up stones at the entrance to keep out the wild beasts this artificial barricade this false faade was gradually extended and solidified until finally man could build a cave for himself anywhere in the open field from stones he quarried out of the hill but man was not content with such materials and now puts up a building which may be composed of steel brick terra cotta glass concrete and plaster none of which materials are to be found in nature the untutored savage might cross a stream astride a floating tree trunk by and by it occurred to him to sit inside the log instead of on it so he hollowed it out with fire or flint later much later he constructed an ocean liner cain or whoever it was first slew his brother man made use of a stone or stick afterward it was found a better weapon could be made by tying the stone to the end of the stick and as murder developed into a fine art the stick was converted into the bow and this into the catapult and finally into the cannon while the stone was developed into the high explosive projectile the first music to soothe the savage breast was the soughing of the wind through the trees then strings were stretched across a crevice for the wind to play upon and there was the olian harp the second stage was entered when hermes strung the tortoise shell and plucked it with his fingers and when athena raising the wind from her own lungs forced it through a hollow reed from these beginnings we have the organ and the orchestra producing such sounds as nothing in nature can equal the first idol was doubtless a meteorite fallen from heaven or a fulgurite or concretion picked up from the sand bearing some slight resemblance to a human being later man made gods in his own image and so sculpture and painting grew until now the creations of futuristic art could be worshipedif one wanted towithout violation of the second commandment for they are not the likeness of anything that is in heaven above or that is in the earth beneath or that is in the water under the earth in the textile industry the same development is observable the primitive man used the skins of animals he had slain to protect his own skin in the course of time heor more probably his wife for it is to the women rather than to the men that we owe the early steps in the arts and sciencesfastened leaves together or pounded out bark to make garments later fibers were plucked from the sheepskin the cocoon and the cottonball twisted together and woven into cloth nowadays it is possible to make a complete suit of clothes from hat to shoes of any desirable texture form and color and not include any substance to be found in nature the first metals available were those found free in nature such as gold and copper in a later age it was found possible to extract iron from its ores and today we have artificial alloys made of multifarious combinations of rare metals the medicine man dosed his patients with decoctions of such roots and herbs as had a bad taste or queer look the pharmacist discovered how to extract from these their medicinal principle such as morphine quinine and cocaine and the creative chemist has discovered how to make innumerable drugs adapted to specific diseases and individual idiosyncrasies in the later or creative stages we enter the domain of chemistry for it is the chemist alone who possesses the power of reducing a substance to its constituent atoms and from them producing substances entirely new but the chemist has been slow to realize his unique power and the world has been still slower to utilize his invaluable services until recently indeed the leaders of chemical science expressly disclaimed what should have been their proudest boast the french chemist lavoisier in 1793 defined chemistry as the science of analysis the german chemist gerhardt in 1844 said i have demonstrated that the chemist works in opposition to living nature that he burns destroys analyzes that the vital force alone operates by synthesis that it reconstructs the edifice torn down by the chemical forces it is quite true that chemists up to the middle of the last century were so absorbed in the destructive side of their science that they were blind to the constructive side of it in this respect they were less prescient than their contemned predecessors the alchemists who foolish and pretentious as they were aspired at least to the formation of something new it was i think the french chemist berthelot who first clearly perceived the double aspect of chemistry for he defined it as the science of analysis and synthesis of taking apart and of putting together the motto of chemistry as of all the empirical sciences is savoir cest pouvoir to know in order to do this is the pragmatic test of all useful knowledge berthelot goes on to say chemistry creates its object this creative faculty comparable to that of art itself distinguishes it essentially from the natural and historical sciences these sciences do not control their object thus they are too often condemned to an eternal impotence in the search for truth of which they must content themselves with possessing some few and often uncertain fragments on the contrary the experimental sciences have the power to realize their conjectures what they dream of that they can manifest in actuality chemistry possesses this creative faculty to a more eminent degree than the other sciences because it penetrates more profoundly and attains even to the natural elements of existences since berthelots time that is within the last fifty years chemistry has won its chief triumphs in the field of synthesis organic chemistry that is the chemistry of the carbon compounds so called because it was formerly assumed as gerhardt says that they could only be formed by vital force of organized plants and animals has taken a development far overshadowing inorganic chemistry or the chemistry of mineral substances chemists have prepared or know how to prepare hundreds of thousands of such organic compounds few of which occur in the natural world but this conception of chemistry is yet far from having been accepted by the world at large this was brought forcibly to my attention during the publication of these chapters in the independent by various letters raising such objections as the following when you say in your article on what comes from coal tar that art can go ahead of nature in the dyestuff business you have doubtless for the moment allowed your enthusiasm to sweep you away from the moorings of reason shakespeare anticipating you and your creative chemistry has shown the utter untenableness of your position nature is made better by no mean but nature makes that mean so oer that art which you say adds to nature is an art that nature makes how can you say that art surpasses nature when you know very well that nothing man is able to make can in any way equal the perfection of all natures products it is blasphemous of you to claim that man can improve the works of god as they appear in nature only the creator can create man only imitates destroys or defiles gods handiwork no it was not in momentary absence of mind that i claimed that man could improve upon nature in the making of dyes i not only said it but i proved it i not only proved it but i can back it up i will give a million dollars to anybody finding in nature dyestuffs as numerous varied brilliant pure and cheap as those that are manufactured in the laboratory i havent that amount of money with me at the moment but the dyers would be glad to put it up for the discovery of a satisfactory natural source for their tinctorial materials this is not an opinion of mine but a matter of fact not to be decided by shakespeare who was not acquainted with the aniline products shakespeare in the passage quoted is indulging in his favorite amusement of a play upon words there is a possible and a proper sense of the word nature that makes it include everything except the supernatural therefore man and all his works belong to the realm of nature a tenement house in this sense is as natural as a birds nest a peapod or a crystal but such a wide extension of the term destroys its distinctive value it is more convenient and quite as correct to use nature as i have used it in contradistinction to art meaning by the former the products of the mineral vegetable and animal kingdoms excluding the designs inventions and constructions of man which we call art we cannot in a general and abstract fashion say which is superior art or nature because it all depends on the point of view the worm loves a rotten log into which he can bore man prefers a steel cabinet into which the worm cannot bore if man cannot improve upon nature he has no motive for making anything artificial products are therefore superior to natural products as measured by mans convenience otherwise they would have no reason for existence science and christianity are at one in abhorring the natural man and calling upon the civilized man to fight and subdue him the conquest of nature not the imitation of nature is the whole duty of man metchnikoff and st paul unite in criticizing the body we were born with st augustine and huxley are in agreement as to the eternal conflict between man and nature in his romanes lecture on evolution and ethics huxley said the ethical progress of society depends not on imitating the cosmic process still less on running away from it but on combating it and again the history of civilization details the steps by which man has succeeded in building up an artificial world within the cosmos there speaks the true evolutionist whose one desire is to get away from nature as fast and far as possible imitate nature yes when we cannot improve upon her admire nature possibly but be not blinded to her defects learn from nature we should sit humbly at her feet until we can stand erect and go our own way love nature never she is our treacherous and unsleeping foe ever to be feared and watched and circumvented for at any moment and in spite of all our vigilance she may wipe out the human race by famine pestilence or earthquake and within a few centuries obliterate every trace of its achievement the wild beasts that man has kept at bay for a few centuries will in the end invade his palaces the moss will envelop his walls and the lichen disrupt them the clam may survive man by as many millennia as it preceded him in the ultimate devolution of the world animal life will disappear before vegetable the higher plants will be killed off before the lower and finally the three kingdoms of nature will be reduced to one the mineral civilized man enthroned in his citadel and defended by all the forces of nature that he has brought under his control is after all in the same situation as a savage shivering in the darkness beside his fire listening to the pad of predatory feet the rustle of serpents and the cry of birds of prey knowing that only the fire keeps his enemies off but knowing too that every stick he lays on the fire lessens his fuel supply and hastens the inevitable time when the beasts of the jungle will make their fatal rush chaos is the natural state of the universe cosmos is the rare and temporary exception of all the million spheres this is apparently the only one habitable and of this only a small partthe reader may draw the boundaries to suit himselfcan be called civilized anarchy is the natural state of the human race it prevailed exclusively all over the world up to some five thousand years ago since which a few peoples have for a time succeeded in establishing a certain degree of peace and order this however can be maintained only by strenuous and persistent efforts for society tends naturally to sink into the chaos out of which it has arisen it is only by overcoming nature that man can rise the sole salvation for the human race lies in the removal of the primal curse the sentence of hard labor for life that was imposed on man as he left paradise some folks are trying to elevate the laboring classes some are trying to keep them down the scientist has a more radical remedy he wants to annihilate the laboring classes by abolishing labor there is no longer any need for human labor in the sense of personal toil for the physical energy necessary to accomplish all kinds of work may be obtained from external sources and it can be directed and controlled without extreme exertion mans first effort in this direction was to throw part of his burden upon the horse and ox or upon other men but within the last century it has been discovered that neither human nor animal servitude is necessary to give man leisure for the higher life for by means of the machine he can do the work of giants without exhaustion but the introduction of machines like every other step of human progress met with the most violent opposition from those it was to benefit smash em cried the workingman smash em cried the poet smash em cried the artist smash em cried the theologian smash em cried the magistrate this opposition yet lingers and every new invention especially in chemistry is greeted with general distrust and often with legislative prohibition man is the toolusing animal and the machine that is the powerdriven tool is his peculiar achievement it is purely a creation of the human mind the wheel its essential feature does not exist in nature the lever with its toandfro motion we find in the limbs of all animals but the continuous and revolving lever the wheel cannot be formed of bone and flesh man as a motive power is a poor thing he can only convert three or four thousand calories of energy a day and he does that very inefficiently but he can make an engine that will handle a hundred thousand times that twice as efficiently and three times as long in this way only can he get rid of pain and toil and gain the wealth he wants gradually then he will substitute for the natural world an artificial world molded nearer to his hearts desire man the artifex will ultimately master nature and reign supreme over his own creation until chaos shall come again in the ancient drama it was deus ex machina that came in at the end to solve the problems of the play it is to the same supernatural agency the divinity in machinery that we must look for the salvation of society it is by means of applied science that the earth can be made habitable and a decent human life made possible creative evolution is at last becoming conscious ii nitrogen preserver and destroyer of life in the eyes of the chemist the great war was essentially a series of explosive reactions resulting in the liberation of nitrogen nothing like it has been seen in any previous wars the first battles were fought with cellulose mostly in the form of clubs the next were fought with silica mostly in the form of flint arrowheads and spearpoints then came the metals bronze to begin with and later iron the nitrogenous era in warfare began when friar roger bacon or friar schwartzwhichever it wasground together in his mortar saltpeter charcoal and sulfur the chinese to be sure had invented gunpowder long before but theypoor innocentsdid not know of anything worse to do with it than to make it into firecrackers with the introduction of villainous saltpeter war ceased to be the vocation of the nobleman and since the nobleman had no other vocation he began to become extinct a bullet fired from a mile away is no respecter of persons it is just as likely to kill a knight as a peasant and a brave man as a coward you cannot fence with a cannon ball nor overawe it with a plumed hat the only thing you can do is to hide and shoot back now you cannot hide if you send up a column of smoke by day and a pillar of fire by nightthe most conspicuous of signalsevery time you shoot so the next step was the invention of a smokeless powder in this the oxygen necessary for the combustion is already in such close combination with its fuel the carbon and hydrogen that no black particles of carbon can get away unburnt in the oldfashioned gunpowder the oxygen necessary for the combustion of the carbon and sulfur was in a separate package in the molecule of potassium nitrate and however finely the mixture was ground some of the atoms in the excitement of the explosion failed to find their proper partners at the moment of dispersal the new gunpowder besides being smokeless is ashless there is no black sticky mass of potassium salts left to foul the gun barrel the gunpowder period of warfare was actively initiated at the battle of cressy in which as a contemporary historian says the english guns made noise like thunder and caused much loss in men and horses smokeless powder as invented by paul vieille was adopted by the french government in 1887 this then might be called the beginning of the guncotton or nitrocellulose periodor perhaps in deference to the cavemans club the second cellulose period of human warfare better doubtless to call it the high explosive period for various other nitrocompounds besides guncotton are being used the important thing to note is that all the explosives from gunpowder down contain nitrogen as the essential element it is customary to call nitrogen an inert element because it was hard to get it into combination with other elements it might on the other hand be looked upon as an active element because it acts so energetically in getting out of its compounds we can dodge the question by saying that nitrogen is a most unreliable and unsociable element like kiplings cat it walks by its wild lone it is not so bad as argon the lazy and the other celibate gases of that family where each individual atom goes off by itself and absolutely refuses to unite even temporarily with any other atom the nitrogen atoms will pair off with each other and stick together but they are reluctant to associate with other elements and when they do the combination is likely to break up any moment you all know people like that good enough when by themselves but sure to break up any club church or society they get into now the value of nitrogen in warfare is due to the fact that all the atoms desert in a body on the field of battle millions of them may be lying packed in a gun cartridge as quiet as you please but let a little disturbance start in the neighborhoodsay a grain of mercury fulminate flares upand all the nitrogen atoms get to trembling so violently that they cannot be restrained the shock spreads rapidly through the whole mass the hydrogen and carbon atoms catch up the oxygen and in an instant they are off on a stampede crowding in every direction to find an exit and getting more heated up all the time the only movable side is the cannon ball in front so they all pound against that and give it such a shove that it goes ten miles before it stops the external bombardment by the cannon ball is therefore preceded by an internal bombardment on the cannon ball by the molecules of the hot gases whose speed is about as great as the speed of the projectile that they propel illustration underwood underwood the hand grenades which these women are boring will contain potential chemical energy capable of causing a vast amount of destruction when released during the war the american government placed orders for 68000000 such grenades as are here shown illustration international film service inc women in a munition plant engaged in the manufacture of trinitrotoluol the most important of modern high explosives the active agent in all these explosives is the nitrogen atom in combination with two oxygen atoms which the chemist calls the nitro group and which he represents by no2 this group was as i have said originally used in the form of saltpeter or potassium nitrate but since the chemist did not want the potassium part of itfor it fouled his gunshe took the nitro group out of the nitrate by means of sulfuric acid and by the same means hooked it on to some compound of carbon and hydrogen that would burn without leaving any residue and give nothing but gases one of the simplest of these hydrocarbon derivatives is glycerin the same as you use for sunburn this mixed with nitric and sulfuric acids gives nitroglycerin an easy thing to make though i should not advise anybody to try making it unless he has his life insured but nitroglycerin is uncertain stuff to keep and being a liquid is awkward to handle so it was mixed with sawdust or porous earth or something else that would soak it up this molded into sticks is our ordinary dynamite if instead of glycerin we take cellulose in the form of wood pulp or cotton and treat this with nitric acid in the presence of sulfuric we get nitrocellulose or guncotton which is the chief ingredient of smokeless powder now guncotton looks like common cotton it is too light and loose to pack well into a gun so it is dissolved with ether and alcohol or acetone to make a plastic mass that can be molded into rods and cut into grains of suitable shape and size to burn at the proper speed here then we have a liquid explosive nitroglycerin that has to be soaked up in some porous solid and a porous solid guncotton that has to soak up some liquid why not solve both difficulties together by dissolving the guncotton in the nitroglycerin and so get a double explosive this is a simple idea any of us can see the sense of itonce it is suggested to us but alfred nobel the swedish chemist who thought it out first in 1878 made millions out of it then apparently alarmed at the possible consequences of his invention he bequeathed the fortune he had made by it to found international prizes for medical chemical and physical discoveries idealistic literature and the promotion of peace but his posthumous efforts for the advancement of civilization and the abolition of war did not amount to much and his high explosives were later employed to blow into pieces the doctors chemists authors and pacifists he wished to reward nobels invention cordite is composed of nitroglycerin and nitrocellulose with a little mineral jelly or vaseline besides cordite and similar mixtures of nitroglycerin and nitrocellulose there are two other classes of high explosives in common use one is made from carbolic acid which is familiar to us all by its use as a disinfectant if this is treated with nitric and sulfuric acids we get from it picric acid a yellow crystalline solid every government has its own secret formula for this type of explosive the british call theirs lyddite the french melinite and the japanese shimose the third kind of high explosives uses as its base toluol this is not so familiar to us as glycerin cotton or carbolic acid it is one of the coal tar products an inflammable liquid resembling benzene when treated with nitric acid in the usual way it takes up like the others three nitro groups and so becomes trinitrotoluol realizing that people could not be expected to use such a mouthful of a word the chemists have suggested various pretty nicknames trotyl tritol trinol tolite and trilit but the public with the wilfulness it always shows in the matter of names persists in calling it tnt as though it were an author like gbs or gkc or fpa tnt is the latest of these high explosives and in some ways the best of them picric acid has the bad habit of attacking the metals with which it rests in contact forming sensitive picrates that are easily set off but tnt is inert toward metals and keeps well tnt melts far below the boiling point of water so can be readily liquefied and poured into shells it is insensitive to ordinary shocks a rifle bullet can be fired through a case of it without setting it off and if lighted with a match it burns quietly the amazing thing about these modern explosives the organic nitrates is the way they will stand banging about and burning yet the terrific violence with which they blow up when shaken by an explosive wave of a particular velocity like that of a fulminating cap like picric acid tnt stains the skin yellow and causes soreness and sometimes serious cases of poisoning among the employees mostly girls in the munition factories on the other hand the girls working with cordite get to using it as chewing gum a harmful habit not because of any danger of being blown up by it but because nitroglycerin is a heart stimulant and they do not need that illustration the genealogical tree of nitric acid from wq whitmans the story of nitrates in the war general science quarterly tnt is by no means smokeless the german shells that exploded with a cloud of black smoke and which british soldiers called black marias coalboxes or jack johnsons were loaded with it but it is an advantage to have a shell show where it strikes although a disadvantage to have it show where it starts it is these high explosives that have revolutionized warfare as soon as the first german shell packed with these new nitrates burst inside the gruson cupola at lige and tore out its steel and concrete by the roots the world knew that the day of the fixed fortress was gone the armies deserted their expensively prepared fortifications and took to the trenches the british troops in france found their weapons futile and sent across the channel the cry of send us high explosives or we perish the home government was slow to heed the appeal but no progress was made against the germans until the allies had the means to blast them out of their entrenchments by shells loaded with five hundred pounds of tnt all these explosives are made from nitric acid and this used to be made from nitrates such as potassium nitrate or saltpeter but nitrates are rarely found in large quantities napoleon and lee had a hard time to scrape up enough saltpeter from the compost heaps cellars and caves for their gunpowder and they did not use as much nitrogen in a whole campaign as was freed in a few days cannonading on the somme now there is one place in the worldand so far as we know one onlywhere nitrates are to be found abundantly this is in a desert on the western slope of the andes where ancient guano deposits have decomposed and there was not enough rain to wash away their salts here is a bed two miles wide two hundred miles long and five feet deep yielding some twenty to fifty per cent of sodium nitrate the deposit originally belonged to peru but chile fought her for it and got it in 1881 here all countries came to get their nitrates for agriculture and powder making germany was the largest customer and imported 750000 tons of chilean nitrate in 1913 besides using 100000 tons of other nitrogen salts by this means her old wornout fields were made to yield greater harvests than our fresh land germany and england were like two duelists buying powder at the same shop the chilean government pocketing an export duty that aggregated half a billion dollars permitted the saltpeter to be shoveled impartially into british and german ships and so two nitrogen atoms torn from their pacific home and parted like evangeline and gabriel by transportation oversea may have found themselves flung into each others arms from the mouths of opposing howitzers in the air of flanders goethe could write a romance on such a theme now the moment war broke out this source of supply was shut off to both parties for they blockaded each other the british fleet closed up the german ports while the german cruisers in the pacific took up a position off the coast of chile in order to intercept the ships carrying nitrates to england and france the panama canal designed to afford relief in such an emergency caved in most inopportunely the british sent a fleet to the pacific to clear the nitrate route but it was outranged and defeated on november 1 1914 then a stronger british fleet was sent out and smashed the germans off the falkland islands on december 8 but for seven weeks the nitrate route had been closed while the chemical reactions on the marne and yser were decomposing nitrogencompounds at an unheard of rate england was now free to get nitrates for her munition factories but germany was still bottled up she had stored up chilean nitrates in anticipation of the war and as soon as it was seen to be coming she bought all she could get in europe but this supply was altogether inadequate and the war would have come to an end in the first winter if german chemists had not provided for such a contingency in advance by working out methods of getting nitrogen from the air long ago it was said that the british ruled the sea and the french the land so that left nothing to the german but the air the germans seem to have taken this jibe seriously and to have set themselves to make the most of the aerial realm in order to challenge the british and french in the fields they had appropriated they had succeeded so far that the kaiser when he declared war might well have considered himself the prince of the power of the air he had a fleet of zeppelins and he had means for the fixation of nitrogen such as no other nation possessed the zeppelins burst like wind bags but the nitrogen plants worked and made germany independent of chile not only during the war but in the time of peace germany during the war used 200000 tons of nitric acid a year in explosives yet her supply of nitrogen is exhaustless illustration world production and consumption of fixed inorganic nitrogen expressed in tons nitrogen from the journal of industrial and engineering chemistry march 1919 nitrogen is free as air that is the trouble it is too free it is fixed nitrogen that we want and that we are willing to pay for nitrogen in combination with some other elements in the form of food or fertilizer so we can make use of it as we set it free fixed nitrogen in its cheapest form chile saltpeter rose to 250 during the war free nitrogen costs nothing and is good for nothing if a landowner has a right to an expanding pyramid of air above him to the limits of the atmosphereas i believe the courts have decided in the eavesdropping casesthen for every square foot of his ground he owns as much nitrogen as he could buy for 2500 the air is fourfifths free nitrogen and if we could absorb it in our lungs as we do the oxygen of the other fifth a few minutes breathing would give us a full meal but we let this free nitrogen all out again through our noses and then go and pay 35 cents a pound for steak or 60 cents a dozen for eggs in order to get enough combined nitrogen to live on though man is immersed in an ocean of nitrogen yet he cannot make use of it he is like coleridges ancient mariner with water water everywhere nor any drop to drink nitrogen is as hood said not so truly about gold hard to get and hard to hold the bacteria that form the nodules on the roots of peas and beans have the power that man has not of utilizing free nitrogen instead of this quiet inconspicuous process man has to call upon the lightning when he wants to fix nitrogen the air contains the oxygen and nitrogen which it is desired to combine to form nitrates but the atoms are paired like to like passing an electric spark through the air breaks up some of these pairs and in the confusion of the shock the lonely atoms seize on their nearest neighbor and so may get partners of the other sort i have seen this same thing happen in a square dance where somebody made a blunder it is easy to understand the reaction if we represent the atoms of oxygen and nitrogen by the initials of their names in this fashion nn oo no no nitrogen oxygen nitric oxide the represents joves thunderbolt a stroke of artificial lightning we see on the left the molecules of oxygen and nitrogen before taking the electric treatment as separate elemental pairs and then to the right of the arrow we find them as compound molecules of nitric oxide this takes up another atom of oxygen from the air and becomes noo or using a subscript figure to indicate the number of atoms and so avoid repeating the letter no2 which is the familiar nitro group of nitric acid hono2 and of its salts the nitrates and of its organic compounds the high explosives the no2 is a brown and evilsmelling gas which when dissolved in water hoh and further oxidized is completely converted into nitric acid the apparatus which effects this transformation is essentially a gigantic arc light in a chimney through which a current of hot air is blown the more thoroughly the air comes under the action of the electric arc the more molecules of nitrogen and oxygen will be broken up and rearranged but on the other hand if the mixture of gases remains in the path of the discharge the no molecules are also broken up and go back into their original form of nn and oo so the object is to spread out the electric arc as widely as possible and then run the air through it rapidly in the schnherr process the electric arc is a spiral flame twentythree feet long through which the air streams with a vortex motion in the birkelandeyde furnace there is a series of semicircular arcs spread out by the repellent force of a powerful electric magnet in a flaming disc seven feet in diameter with a temperature of 6300 f in the pauling furnace the electrodes between which the current strikes are two cast iron tubes curving upward and outward like the horns of a texas steer and cooled by a stream of water passing through them these electric furnaces produce two or three ounces of nitric acid for each kilowatthour of current consumed whether they can compete with the natural nitrates and the products of other processes depends upon how cheaply they can get their electricity before the war there were several large installations in norway and elsewhere where abundant water power was available and now the norwegians are using half a million horse power continuously in the fixation of nitrogen and the rest of the world as much again the germans had invested largely in these foreign oxidation plants but shortly before the war they had sold out and turned their attention to other processes not requiring so much electrical energy for their country is poorly provided with water power the haber process that they made most of is based upon as simple a reaction as that we have been considering for it consists in uniting two elemental gases to make a compound but the elements in this case are not nitrogen and oxygen but nitrogen and hydrogen this gives ammonia instead of nitric acid but ammonia is useful for its own purposes and it can be converted into nitric acid if this is desired the reaction is nn hh hh hh nhhh nhhh nitrogen hydrogen ammonia the animals go in two by two but they come out four by four four molecules of the mixed elements are turned into two molecules and so the gas shrinks to half its volume at the same time it acquires an odorfamiliar to us when we are curing a coldthat neither of the original gases had the agent that effects the transformation in this case is not the electric sparkfor this would tend to work the reaction backwardsbut uranium a rare metal which has the peculiar property of helping along a reaction while seeming to take no part in it such a substance is called a catalyst the action of a catalyst is rather mysterious and whenever we have a mystery we need an analogy we may then compare the catalyst to what is known as a good mixer in society you know the sort of man i mean he may not be brilliant or especially talkative but somehow there is always something doing at a picnic or houseparty when he is along the tactful hostess the salon leader is a social catalyst the trouble with catalysts either human or metallic is that they are rare and that sometimes they get sulky and wont work if the ingredients they are supposed to mix are unsuitable but the uranium osmium platinum or whatever metal is used as a catalyzing agent is expensive and although it is not used up it is easily poisoned as the chemists say by impurities in the gases the nitrogen and the hydrogen for the haber process must then be prepared and purified before trying to combine them into ammonia the nitrogen is obtained by liquefying air by cold and pressure and then boiling off the nitrogen at 194 c the oxygen left is useful for other purposes the hydrogen needed is extracted by a similar process of fractional distillation from watergas the blueflame burning gas used for heating then the nitrogen and hydrogen mixed in the proportion of one to three as shown in the reaction given above are compressed to two hundred atmospheres heated to 1300 f and passed over the finely divided uranium the stream of gas that comes out contains about four per cent of ammonia which is condensed to a liquid by cooling and the uncombined hydrogen and nitrogen passed again through the apparatus the ammonia can be employed in refrigeration and other ways but if it is desired to get the nitrogen into the form of nitric acid it has to be oxidized by the socalled ostwald process this is the reaction nh3 4o hno3 h2o ammonia oxygen nitric acid water the catalyst used to effect this combination is the metal platinum in the form of fine wire gauze since the action takes place only on the surface the ammonia gas is mixed with air which supplies the oxygen and the heated mixture run through the platinum gauze at the rate of several yards a second although the gases come in contact with the platinum only a fivehundredth part of a second yet eightyfive per cent is converted into nitric acid the haber process for the making of ammonia by direct synthesis from its constituent elements and the supplemental ostwald process for the conversion of the ammonia into nitric acid were the salvation of germany as soon as the germans saw that their dash toward paris had been stopped at the marne they knew that they were in for a long war and at once made plans for a supply of fixed nitrogen the chief german dye factories the badische anilin and sodafabrik promptly put 100000000 into enlarging its plant and raised its production of ammonium sulfate from 30000 to 300000 tons one german electrical firm with aid from the city of berlin contracted to provide 66000000 pounds of fixed nitrogen a year at a cost of three cents a pound for the next twentyfive years the 750000 tons of chilean nitrate imported annually by germany contained about 116000 tons of the essential element nitrogen the fourteen large plants erected during the war can fix in the form of nitrates 500000 tons of nitrogen a year which is more than twice the amount needed for internal consumption so germany is now not only independent of the outside world but will have a surplus of nitrogen products which could be sold even in america at about half what the farmer has been paying for south american saltpeter besides the haber or direct process there are other methods of making ammonia which are at least outside of germany of more importance most prominent of these is the cyanamid process this requires electrical power since it starts with a product of the electrical furnace calcium carbide familiar to us all as a source of acetylene gas if a stream of nitrogen is passed over hot calcium carbide it is taken up by the carbide according to the following equation cac2 n2 cacn2 c calcium carbide nitrogen calcium cyanamid carbon calcium cyanamid was discovered in 1895 by caro and franke when they were trying to work out a new process for making cyanide to use in extracting gold it looks like stone and under the name of limenitrogen or kalkstickstoff or nitrolim is sold as a fertilizer if it is desired to get ammonia it is treated with superheated steam the reaction produces heat and pressure so it is necessary to carry it on in stout autoclaves or enclosed kettles the cyanamid is completely and quickly converted into pure ammonia and calcium carbonate which is the same as the limestone from which carbide was made the reaction is cacn2 3h2o caco3 2nh3 calcium cyanamid water calcium carbonate ammonia another electrical furnace method the serpek process uses aluminum instead of calcium for the fixation of nitrogen bauxite or impure aluminum oxide the ordinary mineral used in the manufacture of metallic aluminum is mixed with coal and heated in a revolving electrical furnace through which nitrogen is passing the equation is al2o3 3c n2 2aln 3co aluminum carbon nitrogen aluminum carbon oxide nitride monoxide then the aluminum nitride is treated with steam under pressure which produces ammonia and gives back the original aluminum oxide but in a purer form than the mineral from which was made 2aln 3h2o 2nh3 al2o3 aluminum water ammonia aluminum oxide nitride the serpek process is employed to some extent in france in connection with the aluminum industry these are the principal processes for the fixation of nitrogen now in use but they by no means exhaust the possibilities for instance professor john c bucher of brown university created a sensation in 1917 by announcing a new process which he had worked out with admirable completeness and which has some very attractive features it needs no electric power or high pressure retorts or liquid air apparatus he simply fills a twentyfoot tube with briquets made out of soda ash iron and coke and passes producer gas through the heated tube producer gas contains nitrogen since it is made by passing air over hot coal the reaction is 2na2co3 4c n2 2nacn 3co sodium carbon nitrogen sodium carbon carbonate cyanide monoxide the iron here acts as the catalyst and converts two harmless substances sodium carbonate which is common washing soda and carbon into two of the most deadly compounds known to man cyanide and carbon monoxide which is what kills you when you blow out the gas sodium cyanide is a salt of hydrocyanic acid which for some curious reason is called prussic acid it is so violent a poison that as the freshman said in a chemistry recitation a single drop of it placed on the tongue of a dog will kill a man but sodium cyanide is not only useful in itself for the extraction of gold and cleaning of silver but can be converted into ammonia and a variety of other compounds such as urea and oxamid which are good fertilizers sodium ferrocyanide that makes prussian blue and oxalic acid used in dyeing professor bucher claimed that his furnace could be set up in a day at a cost of less than 100 and could turn out 150 pounds of sodium cyanide in twentyfour hours this process was placed freely at the disposal of the united states government for the war and a 10ton plant was built at saltville va by the ordnance department but the armistice put a stop to its operations and left the future of the process undetermined illustration a chemical reaction on a large scale from the chemists standpoint modern warfare consists in the rapid liberation of nitrogen from its compounds illustration courtesy of ei du pont de nemours co burning air in a birkelandeyde furnace at the du pont plant an electric arc consuming about 4000 horsepower of energy is

nitrogen and oxygen of the air combine to form oxides of nitrogen which when dissolved in water form the nitric acid used in explosives illustration courtesy of ei du pont de nemours co a battery of birkelandeyde furnaces for the fixation of nitrogen at the du pont plant we might have expected that the fixation of nitrogen by passing an electrical spark through hot air would have been an american invention since it was franklin who snatched the lightning from the heavens as well as the scepter from the tyrant and since our output of hot air is unequaled by any other nation but little attention was paid to the nitrogen problem until 1916 when it became evident that we should soon be drawn into a war with a first class power on june 3 1916 congress placed 20000000 at the disposal of the president for investigation of the best cheapest and most available means for the production of nitrate and other products for munitions of war and useful in the manufacture of fertilizers and other useful products by water power or any other power but by the time war was declared on april 6 1917 no definite program had been approved and by the time the armistice was signed on november 11 1918 no plants were in active operation but five plants had been started and two of them were nearly ready to begin work when they were closed by the ending of the war united states nitrate plant no 1 was located at sheffield alabama and was designed for the production of ammonia by direct action from nitrogen and hydrogen according to the plans of the american chemical company its capacity was calculated at 60000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia a day half of which was to be oxidized to nitric acid plant no 2 was erected at muscle shoals alabama to use the process of the american cyanamid company this was contracted to produce 110000 tons of ammonium nitrate a year and later two other cyanamid plants of half that capacity were started at toledo and ancor ohio at muscle shoals a mushroom city of 20000 sprang up on an alabama cotton field in six months the raw material air was as abundant there as anywhere and the power water could be obtained from the government hydroelectric plant on the tennessee river but this was not available during the war so steam was employed instead the heat of the coal was used to cool the air down to the liquefying point the principle of this process is simple everybody knows that heat expands and cold contracts but not everybody has realized the converse of this rule that expansion cools and compression heats if air is forced into smaller space as in a tire pump it heats up and if allowed to expand to ordinary pressure it cools off again but if the air while compressed is cooled and then allowed to expand it must get still colder and the process can go on till it becomes cold enough to congeal that is by expanding a great deal of air a little of it can be reduced to the liquefying point at muscle shoals the plant for liquefying air in order to get the nitrogen out of it consisted of two dozen towers each capable of producing 1765 cubic feet of pure nitrogen per hour the air was drawn in through two pipes a yard across and passed through scrubbing towers to remove impurities the air was then compressed to 600 pounds per square inch nine tenths of the air was permitted to expand to 50 pounds and this expansion cooled down the other tenth still under high pressure to the liquefying point rectifying towers 24 feet high were stacked with trays of liquid air from which the nitrogen was continually bubbling off since its boiling point is twelve degrees centigrade lower than that of oxygen pure nitrogen gas collected at the top of the tower and the residual liquid air now about half oxygen was allowed to escape at the bottom the nitrogen was then run through pipes into the limenitrogen ovens there were 1536 of these about four feet square and each holding 1600 pounds of pulverized calcium carbide this is at first heated by an electrical current to start the reaction which afterwards produces enough heat to keep it going as the stream of nitrogen gas passes over the finely divided carbide it is absorbed to form calcium cyanamid as described on a previous page this product is cooled powdered and wet to destroy any quicklime or carbide left unchanged then it is charged into autoclaves and steam at high temperature and pressure is admitted the steam acting on the cyanamid sets free ammonia gas which is carried to towers down which cold water is sprayed giving the ammonia water familiar to the kitchen and the bathroom but since nitric acid rather than ammonia was needed for munitions the oxygen of the air had to be called into play this process as already explained is carried on by aid of a catalyzer in this case platinum wire at muscle shoals there were 696 of these catalyzer boxes the ammonia gas mixed with air to provide the necessary oxygen was admitted at the top and passed down through a sheet of platinum gauze of 80 mesh to the inch heated to incandescence by electricity in contact with this the ammonia is converted into gaseous oxides of nitrogen the familiar red fumes of the laboratory which carried off in pipes cooled and dissolved in water form nitric acid but since none of the national plants could be got into action during the war the united states was compelled to draw upon south america for its supply the imports of chilean saltpeter rose from half a million tons in 1914 to a million and a half in 1917 after peace was made the department of war turned over to the department of agriculture its surplus of saltpeter 150000 tons and it was sold to american farmers at cost 81 a ton for nitrogen plays a double rle in human economy it appears like brahma in two aspects vishnu the preserver and siva the destroyer here i have been considering nitrogen in its maleficent aspect its use in war we now turn to its beneficent aspect its use in peace iii feeding the soil the great war not only starved people it starved the land enough nitrogen was thrown away in some indecisive battle on the aisne to save india from a famine the population of europe as a whole has not been lessened by the war but the soil has been robbed of its power to support the population a plant requires certain chemical elements for its growth and all of these must be within reach of its rootlets for it will accept no substitutes a wheat stalk in france before the war had placed at its feet nitrates from chile phosphates from florida and potash from germany all these were shut off by the firing line and the shortage of shipping out of the eighty elements only thirteen are necessary for crops four of these are gases hydrogen oxygen nitrogen and chlorine five are metals potassium magnesium calcium iron and sodium four are nonmetallic solids carbon sulfur phosphorus and silicon three of these hydrogen oxygen and carbon making up the bulk of the plant are obtainable ad libitum from the air and water the other ten in the form of salts are dissolved in the water that is sucked up from the soil the quantity needed by the plant is so small and the quantity contained in the soil is so great that ordinarily we need not bother about the supply except in case of three of them they are nitrogen potassium and phosphorus these would be useless or fatal to plant life in the elemental form but fixed in neutral salt they are essential plant foods a ton of wheat takes away from the soil about 47 pounds of nitrogen 18 pounds of phosphoric acid and 12 pounds of potash if then the farmer does not restore this much to his field every year he is drawing upon his capital and this must lead to bankruptcy in the long run so much is easy to see but actually the question is extremely complicated when the german chemist justus von liebig pointed out in 1840 the possibility of maintaining soil fertility by the application of chemicals it seemed at first as though the question were practically solved chemists assumed that all they had to do was to analyze the soil and analyze the crop and from this figure out as easily as balancing a bank book just how much of each ingredient would have to be restored to the soil every year but somehow it did not work out that way and the practical agriculturist finding that the formulas did not fit his farm sneered at the professors and whenever they cited liebig to him he irreverently transposed the syllables of the name the chemist when he went deeper into the subject saw that he had to deal with the colloids damp unpleasant gummy bodies that he had hitherto fought shy of because they would not crystallize or filter so the chemist called to his aid the physicist on the one hand and the biologist on the other and then they both had their hands full the physicist found that he had to deal with a polyvariant system of solids liquids and gases mutually miscible in phases too numerous to be handled by gibbss rule the biologist found that he had to deal with the invisible flora and fauna of a new world plants obey the injunction of tennyson and rise on the stepping stones of their dead selves to higher things each successive generation lives on what is left of the last in the soil plus what it adds from the air and sunshine as soon as a leaf or tree trunk falls to the ground it is taken in charge by a wrecking crew composed of a myriad of microscopic organisms who proceed to break it up into its component parts so these can be used for building a new edifice the process is called rotting and the product the black gummy stuff of a fertile soil is called humus the plants that is the higher plants are not able to live on their own proteids as the animals are but there are lower plants certain kinds of bacteria that can break up the big complicated proteid molecules into their component parts and reduce the nitrogen in them to ammonia or ammonialike compounds having done this they stop and turn over the job to another set of bacteria to be carried through the next step for you must know that soil society is as complex and specialized as that above ground and the tiniest bacterium would die rather than violate the union rules the second set of bacteria change the ammonia over to nitrites and then a third set the amalgamated union of nitrate workers steps in and completes the process of oxidation with an efficiency that ostwald might envy for ninetysix per cent of the ammonia of the soil is converted into nitrates but if the conditions are not just right if the food is insufficient or unwholesome or if the air that circulates through the soil is contaminated with poison gases the bacteria go on a strike the farmer not seeing the thing from the standpoint of the bacteria says the soil is sick and he proceeds to doctor it according to his own notion of what ails it first perhaps he tries running in strike breakers he goes to one of the firms that makes a business of supplying nitrogenfixing bacteria from the scabs or nodules of the clover roots and scatters these colonies over the field but if the living conditions remain bad the newcomers will soon quit work too and the farmer loses his money if he is wise then he will remedy the conditions putting a better ventilation system in his soil perhaps or neutralizing the sourness by means of lime or killing off the ameboid banditti that prey upon the peaceful bacteria engaged in the nitrogen industry it is not an easy job that the farmer has in keeping billions of billions of subterranean servants contented and working together but if he does not succeed at this he wastes his seed and labor the layman regards the soil as a platform or anchoring place on which to set plants he measures its value by its superficial area without considering its contents which is as absurd as to estimate a mans wealth by the size of his safe the difference in point of view is well illustrated by the old story of the city chap who was showing his farmer uncle the sights of new york when he took him to central park he tried to astonish him by saying this land is worth 500000 an acre the old farmer dug his toe into the ground kicked out a clod broke it open looked at it spit on it and squeezed it in his hand and then said dont you believe it taint worth ten dollars an acre mighty poor soil i call it both were right illustration courtesy of american cyanamid co fixing nitrogen by calcium carbide a view of the oven room in the plant of the american cyanamid company the steel cylinders standing in the background are packed with the carbide and then put into the ovens sunk in the floor when these are heated internally by electricity to 2000 degrees fahrenheit pure nitrogen is let in

green kelp by the government chemists illustration natures silent method of nitrogen fixation the nodules on the vetch roots contain colonies of bacteria which have the power of taking the free nitrogen out of the air and putting it in compounds suitable for plant food the modern agriculturist realizes that the soil is a laboratory for the production of plant food and he ordinarily takes more pains to provide a balanced ration for it than he does for his family of course the necessity of feeding the soil has been known ever since man began to settle down and the ancient methods of maintaining its fertility though discovered accidentally and followed blindly were sound and efficacious virgil who like liberty hyde bailey was fond of publishing agricultural bulletins in poetry wrote two thousand years ago but sweet vicissitudes of rest and toil make easy labor and renew the soil yet sprinkle sordid ashes all around and load with fattning dung thy fallow soil the ashes supplied the potash and the dung the nitrate and phosphate long before the discovery of the nitrogenfixing bacteria the custom prevailed of sowing pealike plants every third year and then plowing them under to enrich the soil but such local supplies were always inadequate and as soon as deposits of fertilizers were discovered anywhere in the world they were drawn upon the richest of these was the chincha islands off the coast of peru where millions of penguins and pelicans had lived in a most untidy manner for untold centuries the guano composed of the excrement of the birds mixed with the remains of dead birds and the fishes they fed upon was piled up to a depth of 120 feet from this isle of penguinswhich is not that described by anatole francea billion dollars worth of guano was taken and the deposit was soon exhausted then the attention of the world was directed to the mainland of peru and chile where similar guano deposits had been accumulated and not being washed away on account of the lack of rain had been deposited as sodium nitrate or saltpeter these beds were discovered by a german taddeo haenke in 1809 but it was not until the last quarter of the century that the nitrates came into common use as a fertilizer since then more than 53000000 tons have been taken out of these beds and the exportation has risen to a rate of 2500000 to 3000000 tons a year how much longer they will last is a matter of opinion and opinion is largely influenced by whether you have your money invested in chilean nitrate stock or in one of the new synthetic processes for making nitrates the united states department of agriculture says the nitrate beds will be exhausted in a few years on the other hand the chilean inspector general of nitrate deposits in his latest official report says that they will last for two hundred years at the present rate and that then there are incalculable areas of low grade deposits containing less than eleven per cent to be drawn upon anyhow the south american beds cannot long supply the worlds need of nitrates and we shall some time be starving unless creative chemistry comes to the rescue in 1898 sir william crookesthe discoverer of the crookes tubes the radiometer and radiant matterstartled the british association for the advancement of science by declaring that the world was nearing the limit of wheat production and that by 1931 the breadeaters the caucasians would have to turn to other grains or restrict their population while the rice and millet eaters of asia would continue to increase sir william was laughed at then as a sensationalist he was but his sensations were apt to prove true and it is already evident that he was too near right for comfort before we were half way to the date he set we had two wheatless days a week though that was because we persisted in shooting nitrates into the air the area producing wheat was by decades1 the wheat fields of the world acres 188190 192000000 18901900 211000000 190010 242000000 probable limit 300000000 if 300000000 acres can be brought under cultivation for wheat and the average yield raised to twenty bushels to the acre that will give enough to feed a billion people if they eat six bushels a year as do the english whether this maximum is correct or not there is evidently some limit to the area which has suitable soil and climate for growing wheat so we are ultimately thrown back upon crookess solution of the problem that is we must increase the yield per acre and this can only be done by the use of fertilizers and especially by the fixation of atmospheric nitrogen crookes estimated the average yield of wheat at 127 bushels to the acre which is more than it is in the new lands of the united states australia and russia but less than in europe where the soil is well fed what can be done to increase the yield may be seen from these figures gain in the yield of wheat in bushels per acre 188990 1913 germany 19 35 belgium 30 35 france 17 20 united kingdom 28 32 united states 12 15 the greatest gain was made in germany and we see a reason for it in the fact that the german importation of chilean saltpeter was 55000 tons in 1880 and 747000 tons in 1913 in potatoes too germany gets twice as big a crop from the same ground as we do 223 bushels per acre instead of our 113 bushels but the united states uses on the average only 28 pounds of fertilizer per acre while europe uses 200 it is clear that we cannot rely upon chile but make nitrates for ourselves as germany had to in war time in the first chapter we considered the new methods of fixing the free nitrogen from the air but the fixation of nitrogen is a new business in this country and our chief reliance so far has been the coke ovens when coal is heated in retorts or ovens for making coke or gas a lot of ammonia comes off with the other products of decomposition and is caught in the sulfuric acid used to wash the gas as ammonium sulfate our american cokemakers have been in the habit of letting this escape into the air and consequently we have been losing some 700000 tons of ammonium salts every year enough to keep our land rich and give us all the explosives we should need but now they are reforming and putting in ovens that save the byproducts such as ammonia and coal tar so in 1916 we got from this source 325000 tons a year illustration courtesy of scientific american consumption of potash for agricultural purposes in different countries germany had a natural monopoly of potash as chile had a natural monopoly of nitrates the agriculture of europe and america has been virtually dependent upon these two sources of plant foods now when the world was cleft in twain by the shock of august 1914 the allied powers had the nitrates and the central powers had the potash if germany had not had up her sleeve a new process for making nitrates she could not long have carried on a war and doubtless would not have ventured upon it but the outside world had no such substitute for the german potash salts and has not yet discovered one consequently the price of potash in the united states jumped from 40 to 400 and the cost of food went up with it even under the stimulus of prices ten times the normal and with chemists searching furnace crannies and bad lands the united states was able to scrape up less than 10000 tons of potash in 1916 and this was barely enough to satisfy our needs for two weeks illustration what happened to potash when the war broke out this diagram from the journal of industrial and engineering chemistry of july 1917 shows how the supply of potassium muriate from germany was shut off in 1914 and how its price rose yet potash compounds are as cheap as dirt pick up a handful of gravel and you will be able to find much of it feldspar or other mineral containing some ten per cent of potash unfortunately it is in combination with silica which is harder to break up than a trust but constant washing wears away stones and the potash that the metallurgist finds too hard to extract in his hottest furnace is washed out in the course of time through the dropping of the gentle rain from heaven all rivers run to the sea and so the sea gets salt all sorts of salts principally sodium chloride our table salt and next magnesium calcium and potassium chlorides or sulfates in this order of abundance but if we evaporate seawater down to dryness all these are left in a mix together and it is hard to sort them out only patient nature has time for it and she only did on a large scale in one place that is at stassfurt germany it seems that in the days when northwestern prussia was undetermined whether it should be sea or land it was flooded annually by seawater as this slowly evaporated the dissolved salts crystallized out at the critical points leaving beds of various combinations each year there would be deposited three to five inches of salts with a thin layer of calcium sulfate or gypsum on top counting these annual layers like the rings on a stump we find that the stassfurt beds were ten thousand years in the making they were first worked for their salt common salt alone but in 1837 the prussian government began prospecting for new and deeper deposits and found not the clean rock salt that they wanted but bittern largely magnesium sulfate or epsom salt which is not at all nice for table use this stuff was first thrown away until it was realized that it was much more valuable for the potash it contains than was the rock salt they were after then the germans began to purify the stassfurt salts and market them throughout the world they contain from fifteen to twentyfive per cent of magnesium chloride mixed with magnesium chloride in carnallite with magnesium sulfate in kainite and sodium chloride in sylvinite more than thirty thousand miners and workmen are employed in the stassfurt works there are some seventy distinct establishments engaged in the business but they are in combination in fact they are compelled to be for the german government is as anxious to promote trusts as the american government is to prevent them once the stassfurt firms had a falling out and began a cutthroat competition but the german government objects to its people cutting each others throats american dealers were getting unheard of bargains when the german government stepped in and compelled the competing corporations to recombine under threat of putting on an export duty that would eat up their profits the advantages of such business coperation are specially shown in opening up a new market for an unknown product as in the case of the introduction of the stassfurt salts into american agriculture the farmer in any country is apt to be set in his ways and when it comes to inducing him to spend his hardearned money for chemicals that he never heard of and could not pronounce hequite rightlyhas to be shown well he was shown it was if i remember right early in the nineties that the german kali syndikat began operations in america and the united states government became its chief advertising agent in every state there was an agricultural experiment station and these were provided liberally with illustrated literature on stassfurt salts with colored wall charts and sets of samples and free sacks of salts for field experiments the station men finding that they could rely upon the scientific accuracy of the information supplied by kali and that the experiments worked out well became enthusiastic advocates of potash fertilizers the station bulletinswhich uncle sam was kind enough to carry free to all the farmers of the statesometimes were worded so like the kali company advertising that the company might have raised a complaint of plagiarizing but they never did the chilean nitrates which are under british control were later introduced by similar methods through the agency of the state agricultural experiment stations as a result of all this missionary work which cost the kali company 50000 a year the attention of a large proportion of american farmers was turned toward intensive farming and they began to realize the necessity of feeding the soil that was feeding them they grew dependent upon these two foreign and widely separated sources of supply in the year before the war the united states imported a million tons of stassfurt salts for which the farmers paid more than 20000000 then a declaration of american independencethe german embargo of 1915cut us off from stassfurt and for five years we had to rely upon our own resources we have seen how germanyshut off from chilesolved the nitrogen problem for her fields and munition plants it was not so easy for usshut off from germanyto solve the potash problem there is no more lack of potash in the rocks than there is of nitrogen in the air but the nitrogen is free and has only to be caught and combined while the potash is shut up in a granite prison from which it is hard to get it free it is not the percentage in the soil but the percentage in the soil water that counts a farmer with his potash locked up in silicates is like the merchant who has left the key of his safe at home in his other trousers he may be solvent but he cannot meet a sight draft it is only solvent potash that passes current in the days of our grandfathers we had not only national independence but household independence every homestead had its own potash plant and soap factory the frugal housewife dumped the maple wood ashes of the fireplace into a hollow log set up on end in the backyard water poured over the ashes leached out the lye which drained into a bucket beneath this gave her a solution of pearl ash or potassium carbonate whose concentration she tested with an egg as a hydrometer in the meantime she had been saving up all the waste grease from the frying pan and pork rinds from the plate and by trying out these she got her soap fat then on a day set apart for this disagreeable process in chemical technology she boiled the fat and the lye together and got soft soap or as the chemist would call it potassium stearate if she wanted hard soap she salted it out with brine the sodium stearate being less soluble was precipitated to the top and cooled into a solid cake that could be cut into bars by pack thread but the frugal housewife threw away in the waste water what we now consider the most valuable ingredients the potash and the glycerin but the old lyeleach is only to be found in ruins on an abandoned farm and we no longer burn wood at the rate of a log a night in 1916 even under the stimulus of tenfold prices the amount of potash produced as pearl ash was only 412 tonsand we need 300000 tons in some form it would of course be very desirable as a conservation measure if all the sawdust and waste wood were utilized by charring it in retorts the gas makes a handy fuel the tar washed from the gas contains a lot of valuable products and potash can be leached out of the charcoal or from its ashes whenever it is burned but this at best would not go far toward solving the problem of our national supply there are other potashbearing wastes that might be utilized the cement mills which use feldspar in combination with limestone give off a potash dust very much to the annoyance of their neighbors this can be collected by running the furnace clouds into large settling chambers or long flues where the dust may be caught in bags or washed out by water sprays or thrown down by electricity the blast furnaces for iron also throw off potashbearing fumes our sixmillionton crop of sugar beets contains some 12000 tons of nitrogen 4000 tons of phosphoric acid and 18000 tons of potash all of which is lost except where the waste liquors from the sugar factory are used in irrigating the beet land the beet molasses after extracting all the sugar possible by means of lime leaves a waste liquor from which the potash can be recovered by evaporation and charring and leaching the residue the germans get 5000 tons of potassium cyanide and as much ammonium sulfate annually from the waste liquor of their beet sugar factories and if it pays them to save this it ought to pay us where potash is dearer various other industries can put in a bit when uncle sam passes around the contribution basket marked potash for the poor wool wastes and fish refuse make valuable fertilizers although they will not go far toward solving the problem if we saved all our potash byproducts they would not supply more than fifteen per cent of our needs though no potash beds comparable to those of stassfurt have yet been discovered in the united states yet in nebraska utah california and other western states there are a number of alkali lakes wet or dry containing a considerable amount of potash mixed with soda salts of these deposits the largest is searles lake california here there are some twelve square miles of salt crust some seventy feet deep and the brine as pumped out contains about four per cent of potassium chloride the quantity is sufficient to supply the country for over twenty years but it is not an easy or cheap job to separate the potassium from the sodium salts which are five times more abundant these being less soluble than the potassium salts crystallize out first when the brine is evaporated the final crystallization is done in vacuum pans as in getting sugar from the cane juice in this way the american trona corporation is producing some 4500 tons of potash salts a month besides a thousand tons of borax the borax which is contained in the brine to the extent of 112 per cent is removed from the fertilizer for a double reason it is salable by itself and it is detrimental to plant life another mineral source of potash is alunite which is a sort of natural alum or double sulfate of potassium and aluminum with about ten per cent of potash it contains a lot of extra alumina but after roasting in a kiln the potassium sulfate can be leached out the alunite beds near marysville utah were worked for all they were worth during the war but the process does not give potash cheap enough for our needs in ordinary times illustration photo by international film service in order to secure a new supply of potash salts the united states government set up an experimental plant at sutherland california for the utilization of kelp the harvester cuts 40 tons of kelp at a load illustration the kelp harvester gathering the seaweed from the pacific ocean illustration courtesy of hercules powder co overhead suction at the san diego wharf pumping kelp from the barge to the digestion tanks the tourist going through wyoming on the union pacific will have to the north of him what is marked on the map as the leucite hills if he looks up the word in the unabridged that he carries in his satchel he will find that leucite is a kind of lava and that it contains potash but he will also observe that the potash is combined with alumina and silica which are hard to get out and useless when you get them out one of the lavas of the leucite hills that named from its native state wyomingite gives fiftyseven per cent of its potash in a soluble form on roasting with alunitebut this costs too much the same may be said of all the potash feldspars and mica they are abundant enough but until we find a way of utilizing the byproducts say the silica in cement and the aluminum as a metal they cannot solve our problem since it is so hard to get potash from the land it has been suggested that we harvest the sea the experts of the united states department of agriculture have placed high hopes in the kelp or giant seaweed which floats in great masses in the pacific ocean not far off from the california coast this is harvested with ocean reapers run by gasoline engines and brought in barges to the shore where it may be dried and used locally as a fertilizer or burned and the potassium chloride leached out of the charcoal ashes but it is hard to handle the bulky slimy seaweed cheaply enough to get out of it the small amount of potash it contains so efforts are now being made to get more out of the kelp than the potash instead of burning the seaweed it is fermented in vats producing acetic acid vinegar from the resulting liquid can be obtained lime acetate potassium chloride potassium iodide acetone ethyl

of mines report 1918 this table shows how inadequate was the reaction of the united states to the war demand for potassium salts the minimum yearly requirements of the united states are estimated to be 250000 tons of potash this completes our survey of the visible sources of potash in america in 1917 under the pressure of the embargo and unprecedented prices the output of potash k2o in various forms was raised to 32573 tons but this is only about a tenth as much as we needed in 1918 potash production was further raised to 52135 tons chiefly through the increase of the output from natural brines to 39255 tons nearly twice what it was the year before the rust in cotton and the resulting decrease in yield during the war are laid to lack of potash truck crops grown in soils deficient in potash do not stand transportation well the bureau of animal industry has shown in experiments in aroostook county maine that the addition of moderate amounts of potash doubled the yield of potatoes professor ostwald the great leipzig chemist boasted in the war america went into the war like a man with a rope round his neck which is in his enemys hands and is pretty tightly drawn with its tremendous deposits germany has a world monopoly in potash a point of immense value which cannot be reckoned too highly when once this war is going to be settled it is in germanys power to dictate which of the nations shall have plenty of food and which shall starve if indeed some mineralogist or metallurgist will cut that rope by showing us a supply of cheap potash we will erect him a monument as big as washingtons but ostwald is wrong in supposing that america is as dependent as germany upon potash the bulk of our food crops are at present raised without the use of any fertilizers whatever as the cession of lorraine in 1871 gave germany the phosphates she needed for fertilizers so the retrocession of alsace in 1919 gives france the potash she needed for fertilizers ten years before the war a bed of potash was discovered in the forest of monnebruck near hartmannsweilerkopf the peak for which french and germans contested so fiercely and so long the layer of potassium salts is 1612 feet thick and the total deposit is estimated to be 275000000 tons of potash at any rate it is a formidable rival of stassfurt and its acquisition by france breaks the german monopoly when we turn to the consideration of the third plant food we feel better while the united states has no such monopoly of phosphates as germany had of potash and chile had of nitrates we have an abundance and to spare whereas we formerly imported about 17000000 worth of potash from germany and 20000000 worth of nitrates from chile a year we exported 7000000 worth of phosphates whoever it was who first noticed that the grass grew thicker around a buried bone he lived so long ago that we cannot do honor to his powers of observation but ever since thenwhenever it wasold bones have been used as a fertilizer but we long ago used up all the buffalo bones we could find on the prairies and our packing houses could not give us enough bonemeal to go around so we have had to draw upon the old boneyards of prehistoric animals deposits of lime phosphate of such origin were found in south carolina in 1870 and in florida in 1888 since then the industry has developed with amazing rapidity until in 1913 the united states produced over three million tons of phosphates nearly half of which was sent abroad the chief source at present is the florida pebbles which are dredged up from the bottoms of lakes and rivers or washed out from the banks of streams by a hydraulic jet the gravel is washed free from the sand and clay screened and dried and then is ready for shipment the rock deposits of florida and south carolina are more limited than the pebble beds and may be exhausted in twentyfive or thirty years but tennessee and kentucky have a lot in reserve and behind them are idaho wyoming and other western states with millions of acres of phosphate land so in this respect we are independent but even here the war hit us hard for the calcium phosphate as it comes from the ground is not altogether available because it is not very soluble and the plants can only use what they can get in the water that they suck up from the soil but if the phosphate is treated with sulfuric acid it becomes more soluble and this product is sold as superphosphate the sulfuric acid is made mostly from iron pyrite and this we have been content to import over 800000 tons of it a year largely from spain although we have an abundance at home since the shortage of shipping shut off the foreign supply we are using more of our own pyrite and also our deposits of native sulfur along the gulf coast but as a consequence of this sulfuric acid during the war went up from 5 to 25 a ton and acidulated phosphates rose correspondingly germany is short on natural phosphates as she is long on natural potash but she has made up for it by utilizing a byproduct of her steelworks when phosphorus occurs in iron ore even in minute amounts it makes the steel brittle much of the iron ores of alsacelorraine were formerly considered unworkable because of this impurity but shortly after germany took these provinces from france in 1871 a method was discovered by two british metallurgists thomas and gilchrist by which the phosphorus is removed from the iron in the process of converting it into steel this consists in lining the crucible or converter with lime and magnesia which takes up the phosphorus from the melted iron this slag lining now rich in phosphates can be taken out and ground up for fertilizer so the phosphorus which used to be a detriment is now an additional source of profit and this british invention has enabled germany to make use of the territory she stole from france to outstrip england in the steel business in 1910 germany produced 2000000 tons of thomas slag while only 160000 tons were produced in the united kingdom the open hearth process now chiefly used in the united states gives an acid instead of a basic phosphate slag not suitable as a fertilizer the iron ore of america with the exception of some of the southern ores carries so small a percentage of phosphorus as to make a basic process inadvisable recently the germans have been experimenting with a combined fertilizer schrders potassium phosphate which is said to be as good as thomas slag for phosphates and as good as stassfurt salts for potash the american cyanamid company is just putting out a similar product ammophos in which the ammonia can be varied from thirteen to twenty per cent and the phosphoric acid from twenty to fortyseven per cent so as to give the proportions desired for any crop we have then the possibility of getting the three essential plant foods altogether in one compound with the elimination of most of the extraneous elements such as lime and magnesia chlorids and sulfates for the last three hundred years the american people have been living on the unearned increment of the unoccupied land but now that all our land has been staked out in homesteads and we cannot turn to new soil when we have used up the old we must learn as the older races have learned how to keep up the supply of plant food only in this way can our population increase and prosper as we have seen the phosphate question need not bother us and we can see our way clear toward solving the nitrate question we gave the government 20000000 to experiment on the production of nitrates from the air and the results will serve for fields as well as firearms but the question of an independent supply of cheap potash is still unsolved iv coaltar colors if you put a bit of soft coal into a test tube or if you havent a test tube into a clay tobacco pipe and lute it over with clay and heat it you will find a gas coming out of the end of the tube that will burn with a yellow smoky flame after all the gas comes off you will find in the bottom of the test tube a chunk of dry porous coke these then are the two main products of the destructive distillation of coal but if you are an unusually observant person that is if you are a born chemist with an eye to byproducts you will notice along in the middle of the tube where it is neither too hot nor too cold some dirty drops of water and some black sticky stuff if you are just an ordinary person you wont pay any attention to this because there is only a little of it and because what you are after is the coke and gas you regard the nasty smelly mess that comes in between as merely a nuisance because it clogs up and spoils your nice clean tube now that is the way the gasmakers and cokemakersbeing for the most part ordinary persons and not born chemistsused to regard the water and tar that got into their pipes they washed it out so as to have the gas clean and then ran it into the creek but the neighborsespecially those who fished in the stream below the gasworksmade a fuss about spoiling the water so the gasmen gave away the tar to the boys for use in celebrating the fourth of july and election night or sold it for roofing illustration the production of coal tar a battery of koppers byproduct cokeovens at the plant of the bethlehem steel company sparrows point maryland the coke is being pushed out of one of the ovens into the waiting car the vapors given off from the coal contain ammonia and the benzene compound used to make dyes and explosives illustration in these mixing vats at the buffalo works aniline dyes are prepared but this same tar which for a hundred years was thrown away and nearly half of which is thrown away yet in the united states turns out to be one of the most useful things in the world it is one of the strategic points in war and commerce it wounds and heals it supplies munitions and medicines it is like the magic purse of fortunatus from which anything wished for could be drawn the chemist puts his hand into the black mass and draws out all the colors of the rainbow this evilsmelling substance beats the rose in the production of perfume and surpasses the honeycomb in sweetness bishop berkeley after having proved that all matter was in your mind wrote a book to prove that wood tar would cure all diseases nobody reads it now the name is enough to frighten them off siris a chain of philosophical reflections and inquiries concerning the virtues of tar water he had a sort of mystical idea that tar contained the quintessence of the forest the purified spirit of the trees which could somehow revive the spirit of man people said he was crazy on the subject and doubtless he was but the interesting thing about it is that not even his active and ingenious imagination could begin to suggest all of the strange things that can be got out of tar whether wood or coal the reason why tar supplies all sorts of useful material is because it is indeed the quintessence of the forest of the forests of untold millenniums if it is coal tar if you are acquainted with a village tinker one of those allround mechanics who still survive in this age of specialization and can mend anything from a babycarriage to an automobile you will know that he has on the floor of his back shop a heap of broken machinery from which he can get almost anything he wants a copper wire a zinc plate a brass screw or a steel rod now coal tar is the scrapheap of the vegetable kingdom it contains a little of almost everything that makes up trees but you must not imagine that all that comes out of coal tar is contained in it there are only about a dozen primary products extracted from coal tar but from these the chemist is able to build up hundreds of thousands of new substances this is true creative chemistry for most of these compounds are not to be found in plants and never existed before they were made in the laboratory it used to be thought that organic compounds the products of vegetable and animal life could only be produced by organized beings that they were created out of inorganic matter by the magic touch of some vital principle but since the chemist has learned how he finds it easier to make organic than inorganic substances and he is confident that he can reproduce any compound that he can analyze he cannot only imitate the manufacturing processes of the plants and animals but he can often beat them at their own game when coal is heated in the open air it is burned up and nothing but the ashes is left but heat the coal in an enclosed vessel say a big fireclay retort and it cannot burn up because the oxygen of the air cannot get to it so it breaks up all parts of it that can be volatized at a high heat pass off through the outlet pipe and nothing is left in the retort but coke that is carbon with the ash it contains when the escaping vapors reach a cool part of the outlet pipe the oily and tarry matter condenses out then the gas is passed up through a tower down which water spray is falling and thus is washed free from ammonia and everything else that is soluble in water this process is called destructive distillation what products come off depends not only upon the composition of the particular variety of coal used but upon the heat pressure and rapidity of distillation the way you run it depends upon what you are most anxious to have if you want illuminating gas you will leave in it the benzene if you are after the greatest yield of tar products you impoverish the gas by taking out the benzene and get a blue instead of a bright yellow flame if all you are after is cheap coke you do not bother about the byproducts but let them escape and burn as they please the tourist passing across the coal region at night could see through his car window the flames of hundreds of oldfashioned beehive cokeovens and if he were of economical mind he might reflect that this display of fireworks was costing the country 75000000 a year besides consuming the irreplaceable fuel supply of the future but since the gas was not needed outside of the cities and since the coal tar if it could be sold at all brought only a cent or two a gallon how could the cokemakers be expected to throw out their old beehive ovens and put in the expensive retorts and towers necessary to the recovery of the byproducts but within the last ten years the byproduct ovens have come into use and now nearly half our coke is made in them although the products of destructive distillation vary within wide limits yet the following table may serve to give an approximate idea of what may be got from a ton of soft coal 1 ton of coal may give gas 12000 cubic feet liquor washings ammonium sulfate 725 pounds tar 120 pounds benzene 1020 pounds toluene 3 pounds xylene 112 pounds phenol 12 pound naphthalene 38 pound anthracene 14 pound pitch 80 pounds coke 12001500 pounds when the tar is redistilled we get among other things the ten crudes which are fundamental material for making dyes their names are benzene toluene xylene phenol cresol naphthalene anthracene methyl anthracene phenanthrene and carbazol there i had to introduce you to the whole receiving line but now that that ceremony is over we are at liberty to do as we do at a reception meet our old friends get acquainted with one or two more and turn our backs on the rest two of them i am sure youve met before phenol which is common carbolic acid and naphthalene which we use for mothballs but notice one thing in passing that not one of them is a dye they are all colorless liquids or white solids also they all have an indescribable odorall odors that you dont know are indescribablewhich gives them and their progeny even when odorless the name of aromatic compounds illustration fig 8 diagram of the products obtained from coal and some of their uses the most important of the ten because he is the father of the family is benzene otherwise called benzol but must not be confused with benzine spelled with an i which we used to burn and clean our clothes with benzine is a kind of gasoline but benzene alias benzol has quite another constitution although it looks and burns the same now the search for the constitution of benzene is one of the most exciting chapters in chemistry also one of the most intricate chapters but in spite of that i believe i can make the main point of it clear even to those who have never studied chemistryprovided they retain their childish liking for puzzles it is really much like putting together the old sixblock chinese puzzle the chemist can work better if he has a picture of what he is working with now his unit is the molecule which is too small even to analyze with the microscope no matter how high powered so he makes up a sort of diagram of the molecule and since he knows the number of atoms and that they are somehow attached to one another he represents each atom by the first letter of its name and the points of attachment or bonds by straight lines connecting the atoms of the different elements now it is one of the rules of the game that all the bonds must be connected or hooked up with atoms at both ends that there shall be no free hands reaching out into empty space carbon for instance has four bonds and hydrogen only one they unite therefore in the proportion of one atom of carbon to four of hydrogen or ch4 which is methane or marsh gas and obviously the simplest of the hydrocarbons but we have more complex hydrocarbons such as c6h14 known as hexane now if you try to draw the diagrams or structural formulas of these two compounds you will easily get h h h h h h h hch hcccccch h h h h h h h methane hexane each carbon atom you see has its four hands outstretched and duly grasped by onehanded hydrogen atoms or by neighboring carbon atoms in the chain we can have such chains as long as you please thirty or more in a chain they are all contained in kerosene and paraffin so far the chemist found it east to construct diagrams that would satisfy his sense of the fitness of things but when he found that benzene had the compostion c6h6 he was puzzled if you try to draw the picture of c6h6 you will get something like this cccccc h h h h h h which is an absurdity because more than half of the carbon hands are waving wildly around asking to be held by something benzene c6h6 evidently is like hexane c6h14 in having a chain of six carbon atoms but it has dropped its hs like an englishman eight of the hs are missing now one of the men who was worried over this benzene puzzle was the german chemist kekul one evening after working over the problem all day he was sitting by the fire trying to rest but he could not throw it off his mind the carbon and the hydrogen atoms danced like imps on the carpet and as he watched them through his halfclosed eyes he suddenly saw that the chain of six carbon atoms had joined at the ends and formed a ring while the six hydrogen atoms were holding on to the outside hands in this fashion h c hc ch hc ch c h professor kekul saw at once that the demons of his subconscious self had furnished him with a clue to the labyrinth and so it proved we need not suppose that the benzene molecule if we could see it would look anything like this diagram of it but the theory works and that is all the scientist asks of any theory by its use thousands of new compounds have been constructed which have proved of inestimable value to man the modern chemist is not a discoverer he is an inventor he sits down at his desk and draws a kekul ring or rather hexagon then he rubs out an h and hooks a nitro group no2 on to the carbon in place of it next he rubs out the o2 of the nitro group and puts in h2 then he hitches on such other elements or carbon chains and rings as he likes he works like an architect designing a house and when he gets a picture of the proposed compounds to suit him he goes into the laboratory to make it first he takes down the bottle of benzene and boils up some of this with nitric acid and sulfuric acid this he puts in the nitro group and makes nitrobenzene c6h5no2 he treats this with hydrogen which displaces the oxygen and gives c6h5nh2 or aniline which is the basis of so many of these compounds that they are all commonly called the aniline dyes but aniline itself is not a dye it is a colorless or brownish oil it is not necessary to follow our chemist any farther now that we have seen how he works but before we pass on we will just look at one of his products not one of the most complicated but still complicated enough illustration a molecule of a coaltar dye the name of this is sodium ditolyldisazobetanaphthylamine 6sulfonicbetanaphthylamine36disulfonate these chemical names of organic compounds are discouraging to the beginner and amusing to the layman but that is because neither of them realizes that they are not really words but formulas they are hyphenated because they come from germany the name given above is no more of a mouthful than asquareplustwoabplusbsquare or third assistant secretary of war to the president of the united states of america the trade name of this dye is brilliant congo but while that is handier to say it does not mean anything nobody but an expert in dyes would know what it was while from the formula name any chemist familiar with such compounds could draw its picture tell how it would behave and what it was made from or even make it the old alchemist was a secretive and pretentious person and used to invent queer names for the purpose of mystifying and awing the ignorant but the chemist in dropping the al has dropped the idea of secrecy and his names though equally appalling to the layman are designed to reveal and not to conceal from this brief explanation the reader who has not studied chemistry will i think be able to get some idea of how these very intricate compounds are built up step by step a completed house is hard to understand but when we see the mason laying one brick on top of another it does not seem so difficult although if we tried to do it we should not find it so easy as we think anyhow let me give you a hint if you want to make a good impression on a chemist dont tell him that he seems to you a sort of magician master of a black art and all that nonsense the chemist has been trying for three hundred years to live down the reputation of being inspired of the devil and it makes him mad to have his past thrown up at him in this fashion if his tactless admirers would stop saying it is all a mystery and a miracle to me and i cannot understand it and pay attention to what he is telling them they would understand it and would find that it is no more of a mystery or a miracle than anything else you can make an electrician mad in the same way by interrupting his explanation of a dynamo by asking but you cannot tell me what electricity really is the electrician does not care a rap what electricity really isif there really is any meaning to that phrase all he wants to know is what he can do with it illustration comparison of coal and its distillation products from hesses the industry of the coal tar dyes journal of industrial and engineering chemistry december 1914 the tar obtained from the gas plant or the coke plant has now to be redistilled giving off the ten crudes already mentioned and leaving in the still sixtyfive per cent of pitch which may be used for roofing paving and the like the ten primary products or crudes are then converted into secondary products or intermediates by processes like that for the conversion of benzene into aniline there are some three hundred of these intermediates in use and from them are built up more than three times as many dyes the year before the war the american custom house listed 5674 distinct brands of synthetic dyes imported chiefly from germany but some of these were trade names for the same product made by different firms or represented by different degrees of purity or form of preparation although the number of possible products is unlimited and over five thousand dyes are known yet only about nine hundred are in use we can summarize the situation so coaltar 10 crudes 300 intermediates 900 dyes 5000 brands or to borrow the neat simile used by dr bernhard c hesse it is like clothmaking where ten fibers make 300 yarns which are woven into 900 patterns the advantage of the artificial dyestuffs over those found in nature lies in their variety and adaptability practically any desired tint or shade can be made for any particular fabric if my lady wants a new kind of green for her stockings or her hair she can have it candies and jellies and drinks can be made more attractive and therefore more appetizing by varied colors easter eggs and easter bonnets take on new and brighter hues more and more the chemist is becoming the architect of his own fortunes he does not make discoveries by picking up a beaker and pouring into it a little from each bottle on the shelf to see what happens he generally knows what he is after and he generally gets it although he is still often baffled and occasionally happens on something quite unexpected and perhaps more valuable than what he was looking for columbus was looking for india when he ran into an obstacle that proved to be america william henry perkin was looking for quinine when he blundered into that rich and undiscovered country the aniline dyes william henry was a queer boy he had rather listen to a chemistry lecture than eat when he was attending the city of london school at the age of thirteen there was an extra course of lectures on chemistry given at the noon recess so he skipped his lunch to take them in hearing that a german chemist named hofmann had opened a laboratory in the royal college of london he headed for that hofmann obviously had no fear of forcing the young intellect prematurely he perhaps had never heard that the tender petals of the adolescent mind must be allowed to open slowly he admitted young perkin at the age of fifteen and started him on research at the end of his second year an american student nowadays thinks he is lucky if he gets started on his research five years older than perkin now if hofmann had studied pedagogical psychology he would have been informed that nothing chills the ardor of the adolescent mind like being set at tasks too great for its powers if he had heard this and believed it he would not have allowed perkin to spend two years in fruitless endeavors to isolate phenanthrene from coal tar and to prepare artificial quinineand in that case perkin would never have discovered the aniline dyes but perkin so far from being discouraged set up a private laboratory so he could work overtime while working here during the easter vacation of 1856the date is as well worth remembering as 1066he was oxidizing some aniline oil when he got what chemists most detest a black tarry mass instead of nice clean crystals when he went to wash this out with alcohol he was surprised to find that it gave a beautiful purple solution this was mauve the first of the aniline dyes the funny thing about it was that when perkin tried to repeat the experiment with purer aniline he could not get his color it was because he was working with impure chemicals with aniline containing a little toluidine that he discovered mauve it was as i said a lucky accident but it was not accidental that the accident happened to the young fellow who spent his noonings and vacations at the study of chemistry a man may not find what he is looking for but he never finds anything unless he is looking for something mauve was a product of creative chemistry for it was a substance that had never existed before perkins next great triumph ten years later was in rivaling nature in the manufacture of one of her own choice products this is alizarin the coloring matter contained in the madder root it was an ancient and oriental dyestuff known as turkey red or by its arabic name of alizari when madder was introduced into france it became a profitable crop and at one time half a million tons a year were raised a couple of french chemists robiquet and colin extracted from madder its active principle alizarin in 1828 but it was not until forty years later that it was discovered that alizarin had for its base one of the coaltar products anthracene then came a neckandneck race between perkin and his german rivals to see which could discover a cheap process for making alizarin from anthracene the german chemists beat him to the patent office by one day graebe and liebermann filed their application for a patent on the sulfuric acid process as no 1936 on june 25 1869 perkin filed his for the same process as no 1948 on june 26 it had required twenty years to determine the constitution of alizarin but within six months from its first synthesis the commercial process was developed and within a few years the sale of artificial alizarin reached 8000000 annually the madder fields of france were put to other uses and even the french soldiers became dependent on madeingermany dyes for their red trousers the british soldiers were placed in a similar situation as regards their red coats when after 1878 the azo scarlets put the cochineal bug out of business the modern chemist has robbed royalty of its most distinctive insignia tyrian purple in ancient times to be porphyrogene that is born to the purple was like admission to the almanach de gotha at the present time for only princes or their wealthy rivals could afford to pay 600 a pound for crimsoned linen the precious dye is secreted by a snaillike shellfish of the eastern coast of the mediterranean from a tiny sac behind the head a drop of thick whitish liquid smelling like garlic can be extracted if this is spread upon cloth of any kind and exposed to air and sunlight it turns first green next blue and then purple if the cloth is washed with soapthat is set by alkaliit becomes a fast crimson such as catholic cardinals still wear as princes of the church the phoenician merchants made fortunes out of their monopoly but after the fall of tyre it became one of the lost artsand accordingly considered by those whose faces are set toward the past as much more wonderful than any of the new arts but in 1909 friedlander put an end to the superstition by analyzing tyrian purple and finding that it was already known it was the same as a dye that had been prepared five years before by sachs but had not come into commercial use because of its inferiority to others in the market it required 12000 of the mollusks to supply the little material needed for analysis but once the chemist had identified it he did not need to bother the murex further for he could make it by the ton if he had wanted to the coloring principle turned out to be a dibrom indigo that is the same as the substance extracted from the indian plant but with the addition of two atoms of bromine why a particular kind of a shellfish should have got the habit of extracting this rare element from sea water and stowing it away in this peculiar form is one of those things no fellow can find out but according to the chemist the murex mollusk made a mistake in hitching the bromine to the wrong carbon atoms he finds as he would word it that the 66 dibrom indigo secreted by the shellfish is not so good as the 55 dibrom indigo now manufactured at a cheap rate and in unlimited quantity but we must not expect too much of a mollusks mind in their cheapness lies the offense of the aniline dyes in the minds of some people our modern aristocrats would delight to be entitled porphyrogeniti and to wear exclusive gowns of purple and scarlet from the isles of elishah as was done in ezekiels time but when any shopgirl or sailor can wear the royal color it spoils its beauty in their eyes applied science accomplishes a real democracy such as legislation has ever failed to establish any kind of dye found in nature can be made in the laboratory whenever its composition is understood and usually it can be made cheaper and purer than it can be extracted from the plant but to work out a profitable process for making it synthetically is sometimes a task requiring high skill persistent labor and heavy expenditure one of the latest and most striking of these achievements of synthetic chemistry is the manufacture of indigo indigo is one of the oldest and fastest of the dyestuffs to see that it is both ancient and lasting look at the unfaded blue cloths that enwrap an egyptian mummy when caesar conquered our british ancestors he found them tattooed with woad the native indigo but the chief source of indigo was as its name implies india in 1897 nearly a million acres in india were growing the indigo plant and the annual value of the crop was 20000000 then the fall began and by 1914 india was producing only 300000 worth what had happened to destroy this profitable industry some blight or insect no it was simply that the badische anilinundsoda fabrik had worked out a practical process for making artificial indigo that indigo on breaking up gave off aniline was discovered as early as 1840 in fact that was how aniline got its name for when fritzsche distilled indigo with caustic soda he called the colorless distillate aniline from the arabic name for indigo anil or alnil that is the bluestuff but how to reverse the process and get indigo from aniline puzzled chemists for more than forty years until finally it was solved by adolf von baeyer of munich who died in 1917 at the age of eightyfour he worked on the problem of the constitution of indigo for fifteen years and discovered several ways of making it it is possible to start from benzene toluene or naphthalene the first process was the easiest but if you will refer to the products of the distillation of tar you will find that the amount of toluene produced is less than the naphthalene which is hard to dispose of that is if a dye factory had worked out a process for making indigo from toluene it would not be practicable because there was not enough toluene produced to supply the demand for indigo so the more complicated napthalene process was chosen in preference to the others in order to utilize this byproduct the badische anilinundsoda fabrik spent 5000000 and seventeen years in chemical research before they could make indigo but they gained a monopoly or to be exact ninetysix per cent of the worlds production a hundred years ago indigo cost as much as 4 a pound in 1914 we were paying fifteen cents a pound for it even the pauper labor of india could not compete with the german chemists at that price at the beginning of the present century germany was paying more than 3000000 a year for indigo fourteen years later germany was selling indigo to the amount of 12600000 besides its cheapness artificial indigo is preferable because it is of uniform quality and greater purity vegetable indigo contains from forty to eighty per cent of impurities among them various other tinctorial substances artificial indigo is made pure and of any desired strength so the dyers can depend on it the value of the aniline colors lies in their infinite variety some are fast some will fade some will stand wear and weather as long as the fabric some will wash out on the spot dyes can be made that will attach themselves to wool to silk or to cotton and give it any shade of any color the period of discovery by accident has long gone by the chemist nowadays decides first just what kind of a dye he wants and then goes to work systematically to make it he begins by drawing a diagram of the molecule doublelinking nitrogen or carbon and oxygen atoms to give the required intensity putting in acid or basic radicals to fasten it to the fiber shifting the color back and forth along the spectrum at will by introducing methyl groups until he gets it just to his liking art can go ahead of nature in the dyestuff business before man found that he could make all the dyes he wanted from the tar he had been burning up at home he searched the wide world over to find colors by which he could make himselfor his wifegarments as beautiful as those that arrayed the flower the bird and the butterfly he sent divers down into the mediterranean to rob the murex of his purple he sent ships to the new world to get brazil wood and to the oldest world for indigo he robbed the lady cochineal of her scarlet coat why these peculiar substances were formed only by these particular plants mussels and insects it is hard to understand i dont know that mrs cacti coccus derived any benefit from her scarlet uniform when khaki would be safer and i cant imagine that to a shellfish it was of advantage to turn red as it rots or to an indigo plant that its leaves in decomposing should turn blue but anyhow it was man that took advantage of them until he learned how to make his own dyestuffs our independent ancestors got along so far as possible with what grew in the neighborhood sweetapple bark gave a fine saffron yellow ribbons were given the hue of the rose by poke berry juice the confederates in their butternutcolored uniform were almost as invisible as if in khaki or feldgrau madder was cultivated in the kitchen garden only logwood from jamaica and indigo from india had to be imported that we are not so independent today is our own fault for we waste enough coal tar to supply ourselves and other countries with all the new dyes needed it is essentially a question of economy and organization we have forgotten how to economize but we have learned how to organize the british government gave the discoverer of mauve a title but it did not give him any support in his endeavors to develop the industry although england led the world in textiles and needed more dyes than any other country so in 1874 sir william perkin relinquished the attempt to manufacture the dyes he had discovered because as he said oxford and cambridge refused to educate chemists or to carry on research their students trained in the classics for the profession of being a gentleman showed a decided repugnance to the laboratory on account of its bad smells so when hofmann went home he virtually took the infant industry along with him to germany where phds were cheap and plentiful and not afraid of bad smells there the business throve amazingly and by 1914 the germans were manufacturing more than threefourths of all the coaltar products of the world and supplying material for most of the rest the british cursed the universities for thus imperiling the nation through their narrowness and neglect but this accusation though natural was not altogether fair for at least half the blame should go to the british dyer who did not care where his colors came from so long as they were cheap when finally the universities did turn over a new leaf and began to educate chemists the manufacturers would not employ them before the war six english factories producing dyestuffs employed only 35 chemists altogether while one german color works the hchster farbwerke employed 307 expert chemists and 74 technologists this firm united with the six other leading dye companies of germany on january 1 1916 to form a trust to last for fifty years during this time they will maintain uniform prices and uniform wage scales and hours of labor and exchange patents and secrets they will divide the foreign business pro rata and share the profits the german chemical works made big profits during the war mostly from munitions and medicines and will be through this new combination in a stronger position than ever to push the export trade as a consequence of letting the dye business get away from her england found herself in a fix when war broke out she did not have dyes for her uniforms and flags and she did not have drugs for her wounded she could not take advantage of the blockade to capture the german trade in asia and south america because she could not color her textiles a blue cotton dyestuff that sold before the war at sixty cents a pound brought 34 a pound a bright pink rhodamine formerly quoted at a dollar a pound jumped to 48 when one keg of dye ordinarily worth 15 was put up at forced auction sale in 1915 it was knocked down at 1500 the highlanders could not get the colors for their kilts until some german dyes were smuggled into england the textile industries of great britain that brought in a billion dollars a year and employed one and a half million workers were crippled for lack of dyes the demand for high explosives from the front could not be met because these also are largely coaltar products picric acid is both a dye and an explosive it is made from carbolic acid and the famous trinitrotoluene is made from toluene both of which you will find in the list of the ten fundamental crudes both great britain and the united states realized the danger of allowing germany to recover her former monopoly and both have shown a readiness to cast overboard their traditional policies to meet this emergency the british government has discovered that a country without a tariff is a land without walls the american government has discovered that an industry is not benefited by being cut up into small pieces both governments are now doing all they can to build up big concerns and to provide them with protection the british government assisted in the formation of a national company for the manufacture of synthetic dyes by taking onesixth of the stock and providing 500000 for a research laboratory but this effort is now reported to be a great failure because the government put it in charge of the politicians instead of the chemists the united states like england had become dependent upon germany for its dyestuffs we imported ninetenths of what we used and most of those that were produced here were made from imported intermediates when the war broke out there were only seven firms and 528 persons employed in the manufacture of dyes in the united states one of these the schoelkopf aniline and chemical works of buffalo deserves mention for it had stuck it out ever since 1879 and in 1914 was making 106 dyes in june 1917 this firm with the encouragement of the government bureau of foreign and domestic commerce joined with some of the other american producers to form a trade combination the national aniline and chemical company the du pont company also entered the field on an extensive scale and soon there were 118 concerns engaged in it with great profit during the war 200000000 was invested in the domestic dyestuff industry to protect this industry congress put on a specific duty of five cents a pound and an ad valorem duty of 30 per cent on imported dyestuffs but if after five years american manufacturers are not producing 60 per cent in value of the domestic consumption the protection is to be removed for some reason not clearly understood and therefore hotly discussed congress at the last moment struck off the specific duty from two of the most important of the dyestuffs indigo and alizarin as well as from all medicinals and flavors the manufacture of dyes is not a big business but it is a strategic business heligoland is not a big island but england would have been glad to buy it back during the war at a high price per square yard american industries employing over two million men and women and producing over three billion dollars worth of products a year are dependent upon dyes chief of these is of course textiles using more than half the dyes next come leather paper paint and ink we have been importing more than 12000000 worth of coaltar products a year but the cottonseed oil we exported in 1912 would alone suffice to pay that bill twice over but although the manufacture of dyes cannot be called a big business in comparison with some others it is a paying business when well managed the german concerns paid on an average 22 per cent dividends on their capital and sometimes as high as 50 per cent most of the standard dyes have been so long in use that the patents are off and the processes are well enough known we have the coal tar and we have the chemists so there seems no good reason why we should not make our own dyes at least enough of them so we will not be caught napping as we were in 1914 it was decidedly humiliating for our government to have to beg germany to sell us enough colors to print our stamps and greenbacks and then have to beg great britain for permission to bring them over by dutch ships the raw material for the production of coaltar products we have in abundance if we will only take the trouble to save it in 1914 the crude light oil collected from the cokeovens would have produced only about 4500000 gallons of benzol and 1500000 gallons of toluol but in 1917 this output was raised to 40200000 gallons of benzol and 10200000 of toluol the toluol was used mostly in the manufacture of trinitrotoluol for use in europe when the war broke out in 1914 it shut off our supply of phenol carbolic acid for which we were dependent upon foreign sources this threatened not only to afflict us with headaches by depriving us of aspirin but also to removed the consolation of music for phenol is used in making phonographic records mr edison with his accustomed energy put up a factory within a few weeks for the manufacture of synthetic phenol when we entered the war the need for phenol became yet more imperative for it was needed to make picric acid for filling bombs this demand was met and in 1917 there were fifteen new plants turning out 64146499 pounds of phenol valued at 23719805 some of the coaltar products as we see serve many purposes for instance picric acid appears in three places in this book it is a high explosive it is a powerful and permanent yellow dye as any one who has touched it knows thirdly it is used as an antiseptic to cover burned skin other coaltar dyes are used for the same purpose malachite green brilliant green crystal violet ethyl violet and victoria blue so a patient in a military hospital is decorated like an easter egg during the last five years surgeons have unfortunately had unprecedented opportunities for the study of wounds and fortunately they have been unprecedentedly successful in finding improved methods of treating them in former wars a serious wound meant usually death or amputation now nearly ninety per cent of the wounded are able to continue in the service the reason for this improvement is that medicines are now being made to order instead of being gathered from china to peru the old herb doctor picked up any strange plant that he could find and tried it on any sick man that would let him this empirical method though hard on the patients resulted in the course of five thousand years in the discovery of a number of useful remedies but the modern medicine man when he knows the cause of the disease is usually able to devise ways of counteracting it directly for instance he knows thanks to pasteur and metchnikoff that the cause of wound infection is the bacterial enemies of man which swarm by the million into any breach in his protective armor the skin now when a breach is made in a line of intrenchments the defenders rush troops to the threatened spot for two purposes constructive and destructive engineers and warriors the former to build up the rampart with sandbags the latter to kill the enemy so when the human body is invaded the blood brings to the breach two kinds of defenders one is the serum which neutralizes the bacterial poison and by coagulating forms a new skin or scab over the exposed flesh the other is the phagocytes or white corpuscles the free lances of our corporeal militia which attack and kill the invading bacteria the aim of the physician then is to aid these defenders as much as possible without interfering with them therefore the antiseptic he is seeking is one that will assist the serum in protecting and repairing the broken tissues and will kill the hostile bacteria without killing the friendly phagocytes carbolic acid the most familiar of the coaltar antiseptics will destroy the bacteria when it is diluted with 250 parts of water but unfortunately it puts a stop to the fighting activities of the phagocytes when it is only half that strength or one to 500 so it cannot destroy the infection without hindering the healing in this search for substances that would attack a specific disease germ one of the leading investigators was prof paul ehrlich a german physician of the hebrew race he found that the aniline dyes were useful for staining slides under the microscope for they would pick out particular cells and leave others uncolored and from this starting point he worked out organic and metallic compounds which would destroy the bacteria and parasites that cause some of the most dreadful of diseases a year after the war broke out professor ehrlich died while working in his laboratory on how to heal with coaltar compounds the wounds inflicted by explosives from the same source one of the most valuable of the aniline antiseptics employed by ehrlich is flavine or if the reader prefers to call it by its full name diaminomethylacridinium chloride flavine as its name implies is a yellow dye and will kill the germs causing ordinary abscesses when in solution as dilute as one part of the dye to 200000 parts of water but it does not interfere with the bactericidal action of the white blood corpuscles unless the solution is 400 times as strong as this that is one part in 500 unlike carbolic acid and other antiseptics it is said to stimulate the serum instead of impairing its activity another antiseptic of the coaltar family which has recently been brought into use by dr dakin of the rockefeller institute is that called by european physicians chloraminet and by american physicians chlorazene and by chemists paratoluenesodiumsulfochloramide this may serve to illustrate how a chemist is able to make such remedies as the doctor needs instead of depending upon the accidental byproducts of plants on an earlier page i explained how by starting with the simplest of ringcompounds the benzene of coal tar we could get aniline suppose we go a step further and boil the aniline oil with acetic acid which is the acid of vinegar minus its water this easy process gives us acetanilid which when introduced into the market some years ago under the name of antifebrin made a fortune for its makers the making of medicines from coal tar began in 1874 when kolbe made salicylic acid from carbolic acid salicylic acid is a rheumatism remedy and had previously been extracted from willow bark if now we treat salicylic acid with concentrated acetic acid we get aspirin from aniline again are made phenacetin antipyrin and a lot of other drugs that have become altogether too popular as headache remediessay rather headache relievers another class of synthetics equally useful and likewise abused are the soporifics such as sulphonal veronal and medinal when it is not desired to put the patient to sleep but merely to render insensible a particular place as when a tooth is to be pulled cocain may be used this like alcohol and morphine has proved a curse as well as a blessing and its sale has had to be restricted because of the many victims to the habit of using this drug cocain is obtained from the leaves of the south american coca tree but can be made artificially from coaltar products the laboratory is superior to the forest because other forms of local anesthetics such as eucain and novocain can be made that are better than the natural alkaloid because more effective and less poisonous i must not forget to mention another lot of coaltar derivatives in which some of my readers will take a personal interest that is the photographic developers i am old enough to remember when we used to develop our plates in ferrous sulfate solution and you never saw nicer negatives than we got with it but when pyrogallic acid came in we switched over to that even though it did stain our fingers and sometimes our plates later came a swarm of new organic reducing agents under various fancy names such as metol hydro short for hydroquinone and eikongen the imagemaker every fellow fixed up his own formula and called his fellowmembers of the camera club fools for not adopting it though he secretly hoped they would not under the double stimulus of patriotism and high prices the american drug and dyestuff industry developed rapidly in 1917 about as many pounds of dyes were manufactured in america as were imported in 1913 and our exports of americanmade dyes exceeded in value our imports before the war in 1914 the output of american dyes was valued at 2500000 in 1917 it amounted to over 57000000 this does not mean that the problem was solved for the home products were not equal in variety and sometimes not in quality to those made in germany many valuable dyes were lacking and the cost was of course much higher whether the american industry can compete with the foreign in an open market and on equal terms is impossible to say because such conditions did not prevail before the war and they are not going to prevail in the future formerly the large german cartels through their agents and branches in this country kept the business in their own hands and now the american manufacturers are determined to maintain the independence they have acquired they will not depend hereafter upon the tariff to cut off competition but have adopted more effective measures the 4500 german chemical patents that had been seized by the alien property custodian were sold by him for 250000 to the chemical foundation an association of american manufacturers organized for the americanization of such institutions as may be affected thereby for the exclusion or elimination of alien interests hostile or detrimental to said industries and for the advancement of chemical and allied science and industry in the united states the foundation has a large fighting fund so that it may be able to commence immediately and prosecute with the utmost vigor infringement proceedings whenever the first german attempt shall hereafter be made to import into this country so much mystery has been made of the achievements of german chemistsas though the teutonic brain had a special lobe for that faculty lacking in other craniumsthat i want to quote what dr hesse says about his first impressions of a german laboratory of industrial research directly after graduating from the university of chicago in 1896 i entered the employ of the largest coaltar dye works in the world at its plant in germany and indeed in one of its research laboratories this was my first trip outside the united states and it was of course an event of the first magnitude for me to be in europe and as a chemist to be in germany in a german coaltar dye plant and to cap it all in its research laboratorya real sanctum sanctorum for chemists in a short time the daily routine wore the novelty off my experience and i then settled down to calm analysis and dispassionate appraisal of my surroundings and to compare what was actually before and around me with my expectations i found that the general laboratory equipment was no better than what i had been accustomed to that my colleagues had no better fundamental training than i had enjoyed nor any better factor manipulativeequipment than i that those in charge of the work had no better general intellectual equipment nor any more native ability than had my instructors in short there was nothing new about it all nothing that we did not have back home nothingexcept the specific problems that were engaging their attention and the special opportunities of attacking them those problems were of no higher order of complexity than those i had been accustomed to for years in fact most of them were not very complex from a purely intellectual viewpoint there was nothing inherently uncanny magical or wizardly about their occupation whatever it was nothing but plain hard work and keeping everlastingly at it now what was the actual thing behind that chemical laboratory that we did not have at home it was money willing to back such activity convinced that in the final outcome a profit would be made money willing to take university graduates expecting from them no special knowledge other than a good and thorough grounding in scientific research and provide them with opportunity to become specialists suited to the factorys needs it is evidently not impossible to make the united states selfsufficient in the matter of coaltar products weve got the tar weve got the men weve got the money too whether such a policy would pay us in the long run or whether it is necessary as a measure of military or commercial selfdefense is another question that cannot here be decided but whatever share we may have in it the coaltar industry has increased the economy of civilization and added to the wealth of the world by showing how a waste byproduct could be utilized for making new dyes and valuable medicines a better use for tar than as fuel for political bonfires and as clothing for the nakedness of social outcasts v synthetic perfumes and flavors the primitive man got his living out of such wild plants and animals as he could find next he or more likely his wife began to cultivate the plants and tame the animals so as to insure a constant supply this was the first step toward civilization for when men had to settle down in a community civitas they had to ameliorate their manners and make laws protecting land and property in this settled and orderly life the plants and animals improved as well as man and returned a hundredfold for the pains that their master had taken in their training but still man was dependent upon the chance bounties of nature he could select but he could not invent he could cultivate but he could not create if he wanted sugar he had to send to the west indies if he wanted spices he had to send to the east indies if he wanted indigo he had to send to india if he wanted a febrifuge he had to send to peru if he wanted a fertilizer he had to send to chile if he wanted rubber he had to send to the congo if he wanted rubies he had to send to mandalay if he wanted otto of roses he had to send to turkey man was not yet master of his environment this period of cultivation the second stage of civilization began before the dawn of history and lasted until recent times we might almost say up to the twentieth century for it was not until the fundamental laws of heredity were discovered that man could originate new species of plants and animals according to a predetermined plan by combining such characteristics as he desired to perpetuate and it was not until the fundamental laws of chemistry were discovered that man could originate new compounds more suitable to his purpose than any to be found in nature since the progress of mankind is continuous it is impossible to draw a date line unless a very jagged one along the frontier of human culture but it is evident that we are just entering upon the third era of evolution in which man will make what he needs instead of trying to find it somewhere the new epoch has hardly dawned yet already a man may stay at home in new york or london and make his own rubber and rubies his own indigo and otto of roses more than this he can make gems and colors and perfumes that never existed since time began the man of science has signed a declaration of independence of the lower world and we are now in the midst of the revolution our eyes are dazzled by the dawn of the new era we know what the hunter and the horticulturist have already done for man but we cannot imagine what the chemist can do if we look ahead through the eyes of one of the greatest of french chemists berthelot this is what we shall see the problem of food is a chemical problem whenever energy can be obtained economically we can begin to make all kinds of aliment with carbon borrowed from carbonic acid hydrogen taken from the water and oxygen and nitrogen drawn from the air the day will come when each person will carry for his nourishment his little nitrogenous tablet his pat of fatty matter his package of starch or sugar his vial of aromatic spices suited to his personal taste all manufactured economically and in unlimited quantities all independent of irregular seasons drought and rain of the heat that withers the plant and of the frost that blights the fruit all free from pathogenic microbes the origin of epidemics and the enemies of human life on that day chemistry will have accomplished a worldwide revolution that cannot be estimated there will no longer be hills covered with vineyards and fields filled with cattle man will gain in gentleness and morality because he will cease to live by the carnage and destruction of living creatures the earth will be covered with grass flowers and woods and in it the human race will dwell in the abundance and joy of the legendary age of goldprovided that a spiritual chemistry has been discovered that changes the nature of man as profoundly as our chemistry transforms material nature but this is looking so far into the future that we can trust no mans eyesight not even berthelots there is apparently no impossibility about the manufacture of synthetic food but at present there is no apparent probability of it there is no likelihood that the laboratory will ever rival the wheat field the cornstalk will always be able to work cheaper than the chemist in the manufacture of starch but in rarer and choicer products of nature the chemist has proved his ability to compete and even to excel what have been from the dawn of history to the rise of synthetic chemistry the most costly products of nature what could tempt a merchant to brave the perils of a caravan journey over the deserts of asia beset with arab robbers what induced the portuguese and spanish mariners to risk their frail barks on perilous waters of the cape of good hope or the horn the chief prizes were perfumes spices drugs and gems and why these rather than what now constitutes the bulk of oversea and overland commerce because they were precious portable and imperishable if the merchant got back safe after a year or two with a little flask of otto of roses a package of camphor and a few pearls concealed in his garments his fortune was made if a single ship of the argosy sent out from lisbon came back with a load of sandalwood indigo or nutmeg it was regarded as a successful venture you know from reading the bible or if not that from your reading of arabian nights that a few grains of frankincense or a few drops of perfumed oil were regarded as gifts worthy the acceptance of a king or a god these products of the orient were equally in demand by the toilet and the temple the unctorium was an adjunct of the roman bathroom kings had to be greased and fumigated before they were thought fit to sit upon a throne there was a theory not yet altogether extinct that medicines brought from a distance were most efficacious especially if besides being expensive they tasted bad like myrrh or smelled bad like asafetida and if these failed to save the princely patient he was embalmed in aromatics or as we now call them antiseptics of the benzene series today as always men are willing to pay high for the titillation of the senses of smell and taste the african savage will trade off an ivory tusk for a piece of soap reeking with synthetic musk the clubman will pay 10 for a bottle of wine which consists mostly of water with about ten per cent of alcohol worth a cent or two but contains an unweighable amount of the bouquet that can only be produced on the sunny slopes of champagne or in the valley of the rhine but very likely the reader is quite as extravagant for when one buys the natural violet perfumery he is paying at the rate of more than 10000 a pound for the odoriferous oil it contains the rest is mere water and alcohol but you would not want the pure undiluted oil if you could get it for it is unendurable a single whiff of it paralyzes your sense of smell for a time just as a loud noise deafens you of the five senses three are physical and two chemical by touch we discern pressures and surface textures by hearing we receive impressions of certain air waves and by sight of certain ether waves but smell and taste lead us to the heart of the molecule and enable us to tell how the atoms are put together these twin senses stand like sentries at the portals of the body where they closely scrutinize everything that enters sounds and sights may be disagreeable but they are never fatal a man can live in a boiler factory or in a cubist art gallery but he cannot live in a room containing hydrogen sulfide since it is more important to be warned of danger than guided to delights our senses are made more sensitive to pain than pleasure we can detect by the smell one twomillionth of a milligram of oil of roses or musk but we can detect one twobillionth of a milligram of mercaptan which is the vilest smelling compound that man has so far invented if you do not know how much a milligram is consider a drop picked up by the point of a needle and imagine that divided into two billion parts also try to estimate the weight of the odorous particles that guide a dog to the fox or warn a deer of the presence of man the unaided nostril can rival the spectroscope in the detection and analysis of unweighable amounts of matter what we call flavor or savor is a joint effect of taste and odor in which the latter predominates there are only four tastes of importance acid alkaline bitter and sweet the acid or sour taste is the perception of hydrogen atoms charged with positive electricity the alkaline or soapy taste is the perception of hydroxyl radicles charged with negative electricity the bitter and sweet tastes and all the odors depend upon the chemical constitution of the compound but the laws of the relation have not yet been worked out since these sense organs the taste and smell buds are sunk in the moist mucous membrane they can only be touched by substances soluble in water and to reach the sense of smell they must also be volatile so as to be diffused in the air inhaled by the nose the taste of food is mostly due to the volatile odors of it that creep up the backstairs into the olfactory chamber a chemist given an unknown substance would have to make an elementary analysis and some tedious tests to determine whether it contained methyl or ethyl groups whether it was an aldehyde or an ester whether the carbon atoms were singly or doubly linked and whether it was an open chain or closed but let him get a whiff of it and he can give instantly a pretty shrewd guess as to these points his nose knows although the chemist does not yet know enough to tell for certain from looking at the structural formula what sort of odor the compound would have or whether it would have any yet we can divide odoriferous substances into classes according to their constitution what are commonly known as fruity odors belong mostly to what the chemist calls the fatty or aliphatic series for instance we may have in a ripe fruit an alcohol say ethyl or common alcohol and an acid say acetic or vinegar and a combination of these the ester or organic salt in this case ethyl acetate which is more odorous than either of its components these esters of the fatty acids give the characteristic savor to many of our favorite fruits candies and beverages the pear flavor amyl acetate is made from acetic acid and amyl alcoholthough amyl alcohol fusel oil has a detestable smell pineapple is ethyl butyratebut the acid part of it butyric acid is what gives limburger cheese its aroma these essential oils are easily made in the laboratory but cannot be extracted from the fruit for separate use if the carbon chain contains one or more double linkages we get the flowery perfumes for instance here is the symbol of geraniol the chief ingredient of otto of roses ch32c chch2ch2cch32 chch2oh the rose would smell as sweet under another name but it may be questioned whether it would stand being called by the name of dimethyl26octadiene26ol8 geraniol by oxidation goes into the aldehyde citral which occurs in lemons oranges and verbena flowers another compound of this group linalool is found in lavender bergamot and many flowers geraniol as you would see if you drew up its structural formula in the way i described in the last chapter contains a chain of six carbon atoms that is the same number as make a benzene ring now if we shake up geraniol and other compounds of this group the diolefines with diluted sulfuric acid the carbon chain hooks up to form a benzene ring but with the other carbon atoms stretched across it rather too complicated to depict here these bridged rings of the formula c5h8 or some multiple of that constitute the important group of the terpenes which occur in turpentine and such wild and woodsy things as sage lavender caraway pine needles and eucalyptus going further in this direction we are led into the realm of the heavy oriental odors patchouli sandalwood cedar cubebs ginger and camphor camphor can now be made directly from turpentine so we may be independent of formosa and borneo when we have a six carbon ring without double linkings cycloaliphatic or with one or two such we get soft and delicate perfumes like the violet ionone and irone but when these pass into the benzene ring with its three double linkages the odor becomes more powerful and so characteristic that the name aromatic compound has been extended to the entire class of benzene derivatives although many of them are odorless the essential oils of jasmine orange blossoms musk heliotrope tuberose ylang ylang etc consist mostly of this class and can be made from the common source of aromatic compounds coal tar the synthetic flavors and perfumes are made in the same way as the dyes by starting with some coaltar product or other crude material and building up the molecule to the desired complexity for instance let us start with phenol the illsmelling and poisonous carbolic acid of disagreeable associations and evil fame treat this to sodawater and it is transformed into salicylic acid a white odorless powder used as a preservative and as a rheumatism remedy add to this methyl alcohol which is obtained by the destructive distillation of wood and is much more poisonous than ordinary ethyl alcohol the alcohol and the acid heated together will unite with the aid of a little sulfuric acid and we get what the chemist calls methyl salicylate and other people call oil of wintergreen the same as is found in wintergreen berries and birch bark we have inherited a taste for this from our pioneer ancestors and we use it extensively to flavor our soft drinks gum tooth paste and candy but the europeans have not yet found out how nice it is but starting with phenol again let us heat it with caustic alkali and chloroform this gives us two new compounds of the same composition but differing a little in the order of the atoms if you refer back to the diagram of the benzene ring which i gave in the last chapter you will see that there are six hydrogen atoms attached to it now any or all these hydrogen atoms may be replaced by other elements or groups and what the product is depends not only on what the new elements are but where they are put it is like spelling words the three letters t r and a mean very different things according to whether they are put together as art tar or rat or to take a more apposite illustration every hostess knows that the success of her dinner depends upon how she seats her guests around the table so in the case of aromatic compounds a little difference in the seating arrangement around the benzene ring changes the character the two derivatives of phenol which we are now considering have two substituting groups one isoh called the hydroxyl group the other ischo called the aldehyde group if these are opposite called the para position we have an odorless white solid if they are side by side called the ortho position we have an oil with the odor of meadowsweet treating the odorless solid with methyl alcohol we get audepine or anisic aldehyde which is the perfume of hawthorn blossoms but treating the other of the twin products the fragrant oil with dry acetic acid perkins reaction we get cumarin which is the perfume part of the tonka or tonquin beans that our forefathers used to carry in their snuff boxes one ounce of cumarin is equal to four pounds of tonka beans it smells sufficiently like vanilla to be used as a substitute for it in cheap extracts in perfumery it is known as new mown hay you may remember what i said on a former page about the career of william henry perkin the boy who loved chemistry better than eating and how he discovered the coaltar dyes well it is also to his ingenious mind that we owe the starting of the coaltar perfume business which has had almost as important a development perkin made cumarin in 1868 but this like the dye industry escaped from english hands and flew over the north sea before the war germany was exporting 1500000 worth of synthetic perfumes a year part of these went to france where they were mixed and put up in fancy bottles with french names and sold to americans at fancy prices the real vanilla flavor vanillin was made by tiemann in 1874 at first it sold for nearly 800 a pound but now it may be had for 10 how extensively it is now used in chocolate ice cream soda water cakes and the like we all know it should be noted that cumarin and vanillin however they may be made are not imitations but identical with the chief constituent of the tonka and vanilla beans and of course are equally wholesome or harmless but the nice palate can distinguish a richer flavor in the natural extracts for they contain small quantities of other savory ingredients a true perfume consists of a large number of odoriferous chemical compounds mixed in such proportions as to produce a single harmonious effect upon the sense of smell in a fine brand of perfume may be compounded a dozen or twenty different ingredients and these if they are natural essences are complex mixtures of a dozen or so distinct substances perfumery is one of the fine arts the perfumer like the orchestra leader must know how to combine and cordinate his instruments to produce a desired sensation a wagnerian opera requires 103 musicians a strauss opera requires 112 now if the concert manager wants to economize he will insist upon cutting down on the most expensive musicians and dropping out some of the others say the supernumerary violinists and the man who blows a single blast or tinkles a triangle once in the course of the evening only the trained ear will detect the difference and the manager can make more money suppose our mercenary impresario were unable to get into the concert hall of his famous rival he would then listen outside the window and analyze the sound in this fashion fifty per cent of the sound is made by the tuba 20 per cent by the bass drum 15 per cent by the cello and 10 per cent by the clarinet there are some other instruments but they are not loud and i guess if we can leave them out nobody will know the difference so he makes up his orchestra out of these four alone and many people do not know the difference the cheap perfumer goes about it in the same way he analyzes for instance the otto or oil of roses which cost during the war 400 a poundif you could get it at any priceand he finds that the chief ingredient is geraniol costing only 5 and next is citronelol costing 20 then comes nerol and others so he makes up a cheap brand of perfumery out of three or four such compounds but the genuine oil of roses like other natural essences contains a dozen or more constituents and to leave many of them out is like reducing an orchestra to a few loudsounding instruments or a painting to a threecolor print a few years ago an attempt was made to make music electrically by producing separately each kind of sound vibration contained in the instruments imitated theoretically that seems easy but practically the tone was not satisfactory because the tones and overtones of a full orchestra or even of a single violin are too numerous and complex to be reproduced individually so the synthetic perfumes have not driven out the natural perfumes but on the contrary have aided and stimulated the growth of flowers for essences the otto or attar of roses favorite of the persian monarchs and romances has in recent years come chiefly from bulgaria but wars are not made with rosewater and the bulgars for the last five years have been engaged in other business than cultivating their own gardens the alembic or still was invented by the arabian alchemists for the purpose of obtaining the essential oil or attar of roses but distillation even with the aid of steam is not altogether satisfactory for instance the distilled rose oil contains anywhere from 10 to 74 per cent of a paraffin wax stearopten that is odorless and on the other hand phenylethyl alcohol which is an important constituent of the scent of roses is broken up in the process of distillation so the perfumer can improve on the natural or rather the distilled oil by leaving out part of the paraffin and adding the missing alcohol even the imported article taken direct from the still is not always genuine for the wily bulgar sometimes increases the yield by sprinkling his roses in the vat with synthetic geraniol just as the wily italian pours a barrel of american cottonseed oil over his olives in the press another method of extracting the scent of flowers is by enfleurage which takes advantage of the tendency of fats to absorb odors you know how butter set beside fish in the ice box will get a fishy flavor in enfleurage moist air is carried up a tower passing alternately over trays of fresh flowers say violets and over glass plates covered with a thin layer of lard the perfumed lard may then be used as a pomade or the perfume may be extracted by alcohol but many sweet flowers do not readily yield an essential oil so in such oases we have to rely altogether upon more or less successful substitutes for instance the perfumes sold under the names of heliotrope lily of the valley lilac cyclamen honeysuckle sweet pea arbutus mayflower and magnolia are not produced from these flowers but are simply imitations made from other essences synthetic or natural among the thousand flowers that contribute to the eau de mille fleurs are the civet cat the musk deer and the sperm whale some of the published formulas for jockey club call for civet or ambergris and those of lavender water for musk and civet the less said about the origin of these three animal perfumes the better fortunately they are becoming too expensive to use and are being displaced by synthetic products more agreeable to a refined imagination the musk deer may now be saved from extinction since we can make trinitrobutylxylene from coal tar this synthetic musk passes muster to human nostrils but a cat will turn up her nose at it the synthetic musk is not only much cheaper than the natural but a dozen times as strong or let us say goes a dozen times as far for nobody wants it any stronger such powerful scents as these are only pleasant when highly diluted yet they are as we have seen essential ingredients of the finest perfumes for instance the natural oil of jasmine and other flowers contain traces of indols and skatols which have most disgusting odors though our olfactory organs cannot detect their presence yet we perceive their absence so they have to be put into the artificial perfume just so a brief but violent discord in a piece of music or a glaring color contrast in a painting may be necessary to the harmony of the whole it is absurd to object to artificial perfumes for practically all perfumes now sold are artificial in the sense of being compounded by the art of the perfumer and whether the materials he uses are derived from the flowers of yesteryear or of carboniferous era is nobodys business but his and he does not tell the materials can be purchased in the open market various recipes can be found in the books but every famous perfumer guards well the secret of his formulas and hands it as a legacy to his posterity the ancient roman family of frangipani has been made immortal by one such hereditary recipe the farina family still claims to have the exclusive knowledge of how to make eau de cologne this famous perfume was first compounded by an italian giovanni maria farina who came to cologne in 1709 it soon became fashionable and was for a time the only scent allowed at some of the german courts the various published recipes contain from six to a dozen ingredients chiefly the oils of neroli rosemary bergamot lemon and lavender dissolved in very pure alcohol and allowed to age like wine the invention in 1895 of artificial neroli orange flowers has improved the product french perfumery like the german had its origin in italy when catherine de medici came to paris as the bride of henri ii she brought with her among other artists her perfumer sieur toubarelli who established himself in the flowery land of grasse here for four hundred years the industry has remained rooted and the family formulas have been handed down from generation to generation in the city of grasse there were at the outbreak of the war fifty establishments making perfumes the french perfumer does not confine himself to a single sense he appeals as well to sight and sound and association he adds to the attractiveness of his creation by a quaintly shaped bottle an artistic box and an enticing name such as dans les nues le coeur de jeannette nuit de chine un air embaum le vertige bon vieux temps lheure bleue nuit damour quelques fleurs djerkiss the requirements of a successful scent are very strict a perfume must be lasting but not strong all its ingredients must continue to evaporate in the same proportion otherwise it will change odor and deteriorate scents kill one another as colors do the minutest trace of some impurity or foreign odor may spoil the whole effect to mix the ingredients in a vessel of any metal but aluminum or even to filter through a tin funnel is likely to impair the perfume the odoriferous compounds are very sensitive and unstable bodies otherwise they would have no effect upon the olfactory organ the combination that would be suitable for a toilet water would not be good for a talcum powder and might spoil in a soap perfumery is used even in the scentless powders and soaps in fact it is now used more extensively if less intensively than ever before in the history of the world during the unwashed ages commonly called the dark ages between the destruction of the roman baths and the construction of the modern bathroom the art of the perfumer like all the fine arts suffered an eclipse the odor of sanctity was in highest esteem and what that odor was may be imagined from reading the lives of the saints but in the course of centuries the refinements of life began to seep back into europe from the east by means of the arabs and crusaders and chemistry then chiefly the art of cosmetics began to revive when science the greatest democratizing agent on earth got into action it elevated the poor to the ranks of kings and priests in the delights of the palate and the nose we should not despise these delights for the pleasure they confer is greater in amount at least than that of the socalled higher senses we eat three times a day some of us drink oftener few of us visit the concert hall or the art gallery as often as we do the dining room then too these primitive senses have a stronger influence upon our emotional nature than those acquired later in the course of evolution as kipling puts it smells are surer than sounds or sights to make your heartstrings crack vi cellulose organic compounds on which our life and living depend consist chiefly of four elements carbon hydrogen oxygen and nitrogen these compounds are sometimes hard to analyze but when once the chemist has ascertained their constitution he can usually make them out of their elementsif he wants to he will not want to do it as a business unless it pays and it will not pay unless the manufacturing process is cheaper than the natural process this depends primarily upon the cost of the crude materials what then is the market price of these four elements oxygen and nitrogen are free as air and as we have seen in the second chapter their direct combination by the electric spark is possible hydrogen is free in the form of water but expensive to extricate by means of the electric current but we need more carbon than anything else and where shall we get that bits of crystallized carbon can be picked up in south africa and elsewhere but those who can afford to buy them prefer to wear them rather than use them in making synthetic food graphite is rare and hard to melt we must then have recourse to the compounds of carbon the simplest of these carbon dioxide exists in the air but only four parts in ten thousand by volume to extract the carbon and get it into combination with the other elements would be a difficult and expensive process here then we must call in cheap labor the cheapest of all laborers the plants pine trees on the highlands and cotton plants on the lowlands keep their green traps set all the day long and with the captured carbon dioxide build up cellulose if then man wants free carbon he can best get it by charring wood in a kiln or digging up that which has been charred in natures kiln during the carboniferous era but there is no reason why he should want to go back to elemental carbon when he can have it already combined with hydrogen in the remains of modern or fossil vegetation the synthetic products on which modern chemistry prides itself such as vanillin camphor and rubber are not built up out of their elements c h and o although they might be as a laboratory stunt instead of that the raw material of the organic chemist is chiefly cellulose or the products of its recent or remote destructive distillation tar and oil it is unnecessary to tell the reader what cellulose is since he now holds a specimen of it in his hand pretty pure cellulose except for the sizing and the specks of carbon that mar the whiteness of its surface this utilization of cellulose is the chief cause of the difference between the modern world and the ancient for what is called the invention of printing is essentially the inventing of paper the romans made type to stamp their coins and lead pipes with and if they had had paper to print upon the world might have escaped the dark ages but the clay tablets of the babylonians were cumbersome the wax tablets of the greeks were perishable the papyrus of the egyptians was fragile parchment was expensive and penning was slow so it was not until literature was put on a paper basis that democratic education became possible at the present time sheepskin is only used for diplomas treaties and other antiquated documents and even if your diploma is written in latin it is likely to be made of sulfated cellulose the textile industry has followed the same law of development that i have indicated in the other industries here again we find the three stages of progress 1 utilization of natural products 2 cultivation of natural products 3 manufacture of artificial products the ancients were dependent upon plants animals and insects for their fibers china used silk greece and rome used wool egypt used flax and india used cotton in the course of cultivation for three thousand years the animal and vegetable fibers were lengthened and strengthened and cheapened but at last man has risen to the level of the worm and can spin threads to suit himself he can now rival the wasp in the making of paper he is no longer dependent upon the flax and the cotton plant but grinds up trees to get his cellulose a new york newspaper uses up nearly 2000 acres of forest a year the united states grinds up about five million cords of wood a year in the manufacture of pulp for paper and other purposes in making mechanical pulp the blocks of wood mostly spruce and hemlock are simply pressed sidewise of the grain against wet grindstones but in wood fiber the cellulose is in part combined with lignin which is worse than useless to break up the lignocellulose combine chemicals are used the logs for this are not ground fine but cut up by disk chippers the chips are digested for several hours under heat and pressure with acid or alkali there are three processes in vogue in the most common process the reagent is calcium sulfite made by passing sulfur fumes so2 into lime water in another process a solution of caustic of soda is used to disintegrate the wood the third known as the sulfate process should rather be called the sulfide process since the active agent is an alkaline solution of sodium sulfide made by roasting sodium sulfate with the carbonaceous matter extracted from the wood this sulfate process though the most recent of the three is being increasingly employed in this country for by means of it the resinous pine wood of the south can be worked up and the final product known as kraft paper because it is strong is used for wrapping but whatever the process we get nearly pure cellulose which as you can see by examining this page under a microscope consists of a tangled web of thin white fibers the remains of the original cell walls owing to the severe treatment it has undergone wood pulp paper does not last so long as the linen rag paper used by our ancestors the pages of the newspapers magazines and books printed nowadays are likely to become brown and brittle in a few years no great loss for the most part since they have served their purpose though it is a pity that a few copies of the worst of them could not be printed on permanent paper for preservation in libraries so that future generations could congratulate themselves on their progress in civilization but in our absorption in the printed page we must not forget the other uses of paper the paper clothing so often prophesied has not yet arrived even paper collars have gone out of fashionif they ever were in in germany during the war paper was used for socks shirts and shoes as well as handkerchiefs and napkins but it could not stand wear and washing our sanitary engineers have set us to drinking out of sharpedged paper cups and we blot our faces instead of wiping them twine is spun of paper and furniture made of the twine a rival of rattan cloth and matting woven of paper yarn are being used for burlap and grass in the making of bags and suitcases here however we are not so much interested in manufactures of cellulose itself that is wood paper and cotton as we are in its chemical derivatives cellulose as we can see from the symbol c6h10o5 is composed of the three elements of carbon hydrogen and oxygen these are present in the same proportion as in starch c6h10o5 while glucose or grape sugar c6h12o6 has one molecule of water more but glucose is soluble in cold water and starch is soluble in hot while cellulose is soluble in neither consequently cellulose cannot serve us for food although some of the vegetarian animals notably the goat have a digestive apparatus that can handle it in finland and germany birch wood pulp and straw were used not only as an ingredient of cattle food but also put into war bread it is not likely however that the human stomach even under the pressure of famine is able to get much nutriment out of sawdust but by digesting with dilute acid sawdust can be transformed into sugars and these by fermentation into alcohol so it would be possible for a man after he has read his morning paper to get drunk on it if the cellulose instead of being digested a long time in dilute acid is dipped into a solution of sulfuric acid 50 to 80 per cent and then washed and dried it acquires a hard tough and translucent coating that makes it waterproof and greaseproof this is the parchment paper that has largely replaced sheepskin strong alkali has a similar effect to strong acid in 1844 john mercer a lancashire calico printer discovered that by passing cotton cloth or yarn through a cold 30 per cent solution of caustic soda the fiber is shortened and strengthened for over forty years little attention was paid to this discovery but when it was found that if the material was stretched so that it could not shrink on drying the twisted ribbons of the cotton fiber were changed into smoothwalled cylinders like silk the process came into general use and nowadays much that passes for silk is mercerized cotton another step was taken when cross of london discovered that when the mercerized cotton was treated with carbon disulfide it was dissolved to a yellow liquid this liquid contains the cellulose in solution as a cellulose xanthate and on acidifying or heating the cellulose is recovered in a hydrated form if this yellow solution of cellulose is squirted out of tubes through extremely minute holes into acidulated water each tiny stream becomes instantly solidified into a silky thread which may be spun and woven like that ejected from the spinneret of the silkworm the origin of natural silk if we think about it rather detracts from the pleasure of wearing it and if he who needlessly sets foot upon a worm is to be avoided as a friend we must hope that the advance of the artificial silk industry will be rapid enough to relieve us of the necessity of boiling thousands of baby worms in their cradles whenever we want silk stockings on a plain rush hurdle a silkworm lay when a proud young princess came that way the haughty daughter of a lordly king threw a sidelong glance at the humble thing little thinking she walked in pride in the winding sheet where the silkworm died but so far we have not reached a stage where we can altogether dispense with the services of the silkworm the viscose threads made by the process look as well as silk but they are not so strong especially when wet besides the viscose method there are several other methods of getting cellulose into solution so that artificial fibers may be made from it a strong solution of zinc chloride will serve and this process used to be employed for making the threads to be charred into carbon filaments for incandescent bulbs cellulose is also soluble in an ammoniacal solution of copper hydroxide the liquid thus formed is squirted through a fine nozzle into a precipitating solution of caustic soda and glucose which brings back the cellulose to its original form in the chapter on explosives i explained how cellulose treated with nitric acid in the presence of sulfuric acid was nitrated the cellulose molecule having three hydroxyl oh groups can take up one two or three nitrate groups ono2 the higher nitrates are known as guncotton and form the basis of modern dynamite and smokeless powder the lower nitrates known as pyroxylin are less explosive although still very inflammable all these nitrates are like the original cellulose insoluble in water but unlike the original cellulose soluble in a mixture of ether and alcohol the solution is called collodion and is now in common use to spread a new skin over a wound the great war might be traced back to nobels cut finger alfred nobel was a swedish chemistand a pacifist one day while working in the laboratory he cut his finger as chemists are apt to do and again as chemists are apt to do he dissolved some guncotton in etheralcohol and swabbed it on the wound at this point however his conduct diverges from the ordinary for instead of standing idle impatiently waving his hand in the air to dry the film as most people including chemists are apt to do he put his mind on it and it occurred to him that this sticky stuff slowly hardening to an elastic mass might be just the thing he was hunting as an absorbent and solidifier of nitroglycerin so instead of throwing away the extra collodion that he had made he mixed it with nitroglycerin and found that it set to a jelly the blasting gelatin thus discovered proved to be so insensitive to shock that it could be safely transported or fired from a cannon this was the first of the high explosives that have been the chief factor in modern warfare but on the whole collodion has healed more wounds than it has caused besides being of infinite service to mankind otherwise it has made modern photography possible for the film we use in the camera and moving picture projector consists of a gelatin coating on a pyroxylin backing if collodion is forced through fine glass tubes instead of through a slit it comes out a thread instead of a film if the collodion jet is run into a vat of cold water the ether and alcohol dissolve if it is run into a chamber of warm air they evaporate the thread of nitrated cellulose may be rendered less inflammable by taking out the nitrate groups by treatment with ammonium or calcium sulfide this restores the original cellulose but now it is an endless thread of any desired thickness whereas the native fiber was in size and length adapted to the needs of the cottonseed instead of the needs of man the old motto if you want a thing done the way you want it you must do it yourself explains why the chemist has been called in to supplement the work of nature in catering to human wants instead of nitric acid we may use strong acetic acid to dissolve the cotton the resulting cellulose acetates are less inflammable than the nitrates but they are more brittle and more expensive motion picture films made from them can be used in any hall without the necessity of imprisoning the operator in a fireproof box where if anything happens he can burn up all by himself without disturbing the audience the cellulose acetates are being used for auto goggles and gas masks as well as for windows in leather curtains and transparent coverings for index cards a new use that has lately become important is the varnishing of aeroplane wings as it does not readily absorb water or catch fire and makes the cloth taut and airtight aeroplane wings can be made of cellulose acetate sheets as transparent as those of a dragonfly and not easy to see against the sky the nitrates sulfates and acetates are the salts or esters of the respective acids but recently true ethers or oxides of cellulose have been prepared that may prove still better since they contain no acid radicle and are neutral and stable these are in brief the chief processes for making what is commonly but quite improperly called artificial silk they are not the same substance as silkworm silk and ought not to bethough they sometimes aresold as such they are none of them as strong as the silk fiber when wet although if i should venture to say which of the various makes weakens the most on wetting i should get myself into trouble i will only say that if you have a grudge against some fisherman give him a fly line of artificial silk most any kind the nitrate process was discovered by count hilaire de chardonnet while he was at the polytechnic school of paris and he devoted his life and his fortune trying to perfect it samples of the artificial silk were exhibited at the paris exposition in 1889 and two years later he started a factory at basanon in 1892 cross and bevan english chemists discovered the viscose or xanthate process and later the acetate process but although all four of these processes were invented in france and england germany reaped most benefit from the new industry which was bringing into that country 6000000 a year before the war the largest producer in the world was the vereinigte glanzstofffabriken of elberfeld which was paying annual dividends of 34 per cent in 1914 the raw materials as may be seen are cheap and abundant merely cellulose salt sulfur carbon air and water any kind of cellulose can be used cotton waste rags paper or even wood pulp the processes are various the names of the products are numerous and the uses are innumerable even the most inattentive must have noticed the widespread employment of these new forms of cellulose we can buy from a street barrow for fifteen cents nearsilk neckties that look as well as those sold for

one operation give us fabrics instead of threads a machine has been invented for manufacturing net and lace the liquid material being poured on one side of a roller and the fabric being reeled off on the other side the process seems capable of indefinite extension and application to various sorts of woven knit and reticulated goods the raw material is cotton waste and the finished fabric is a good substitute for silk as in the process of making artificial silk the cellulose is dissolved in a cuproammoniacal solution but instead of being forced out through minute openings to form threads as in that process the paste is allowed to flow upon a revolving cylinder which is engraved with the pattern of the desired textile a scraper removes the excess and the turning of the cylinder brings the paste in the engraved lines down into a bath which solidifies it tulle or net is now what is chiefly being turned out but the engraved design may be as elaborate and artistic as desired and various materials can be used since the threads wherever they cross are united the fabric is naturally stronger than the ordinary it is all of a piece and not composed of parts in short we seem to be on the eve of a revolution in textiles that is the same as that taking place in building materials our concrete structures however great are all one stone they are not built up out of blocks but cast as a whole lace has always been the aristocrat among textiles it has maintained its exclusiveness hitherto by being based upon hand labor in no other way could one get so much painful patient toil put into such a light and portable form a filmy thing twined about a neck or dropping from a wrist represented years of work by poor peasant girls or pallid unpaid nuns a visit to a lace factory even to the public rooms where the wornout women were not to be seen is enough to make one resolve never to purchase any such thing made by hand again but our good resolutions do not last long and in time we forget the strained eyes and bowed backs or what is worse value our bit of lace all the more because it means that some poor woman has put her life and health into it netting and weaving purling and knotting twining and twisting throwing and drawing thread by thread day after day until her eyes can no longer see and her fingers have become stiffened but man is not naturally cruel he does not really enjoy being a slave driver either of human or animal slaves although he can be hardened to it with shocking ease if there seems no other way of getting what he wants so he usually welcomes that great liberator the machine he prefers to drive the tireless engine than to whip the straining horses he had rather see the farmer riding at ease in a mowing machine than bending his back over a scythe the machine is not only the great liberator it is the great leveler also it is the most powerful of the forces for democracy an aristocracy can hardly be maintained except by distinction in dress and distinction in dress can only be maintained by sumptuary laws or costliness sumptuary laws are unconstitutional in this country hence the stress laid upon costliness but machinery tends to bring styles and fabrics within the reach of all the shopgirl is almost as well dressed on the street as her rich customer the man who buys readymade clothing is only a few weeks behind the vanguard of the fashion there is often no difference perceptible to the ordinary eye between cheap and highpriced clothing once the price tag is off jewels as a portable form of concentrated costliness have been in favor from the earliest ages but now they are losing their factitious value through the advance of invention rubies of unprecedented size not imitation but genuine rubies can now be manufactured at reasonable rates and now we may hope that lace may soon be within the reach of all not merely lace of the established forms but new and more varied and intricate and beautiful designs such as the imagination has been able to conceive but the hand cannot execute dissolving nitrocellulose in ether and alcohol we get the collodion varnish that we are all familiar with since we have used it on our cut fingers spread it on cloth instead of your skin and it makes a very good leather substitute as we all know to our cost the number of animals to be skinned has not increased so rapidly in recent years as the number of feet to be shod after having gone barefoot for a million years or so the majority of mankind have decided to wear shoes and this change in fashion comes at a time roughly speaking when pasture land is getting scarce also there are books to be bound and other new things to be done for which leather is needed the war has intensified the stringency so has feminine fashion the conventions require that the shoetops extend nearly to skirtbottom and this means that an inch or so must be added to the shoetop every year consequent to this rise in leather we have to pay as much for one shoe as we used to pay for a pair here then is a chance for necessity to exercise her maternal function and she has responded nobly a progeny of new substances have been brought forth and what is most encouraging to see they are no longer trying to worm their way into favor as surreptitious surrogates under the names of leatheret leatherine leatheroid and leatherthisorthat but come out boldly under names of their own coinage and declare themselves not an imitation not even a substitute but better than leather this policy has had the curious result of compelling the cowhide men to take full pages in the magazines to call attention to the forgotten virtues of good oldfashioned soleleather there are now upon the market synthetic shoes that a vegetarian could wear with a clear conscience the soles are made of some rubber composition the uppers of cellulose fabric canvas coated with a cellulose solution such as i have described each firm keeps its own process for such substance a dead secret but without prying into these we can learn enough to satisfy our legitimate curiosity the first of the artificial fabrics was the oldfashioned and still indispensable oilcloth that is canvas painted or printed with linseed oil carrying the desired pigments linseed oil belongs to the class of compounds that the chemist calls unsaturated and the psychologist would call unsatisfied they take up oxygen from the air and become solid hence are called the drying oils although this does not mean that they lose water for they have not any to lose later ground cork was mixed with the linseed oil and then it went by its latin name linoleum the next step was to cut loose altogether from the natural oils and use for the varnish a solution of some of the cellulose esters usually the nitrate pyroxylin or guncotton more rarely the acetate as a solvent the etheralcohol mixture forming collodion was as we have seen the first to be employed but now various other solvents are in use among them castor oil methyl alcohol acetone and the acetates of amyl or ethyl some of these will be recognized as belonging to the fruit essences that we considered in chapter v and doubtless most of us have perceived an odor as of overripe pears bananas or apples mysteriously emanating from a newly lacquered radiator with powdered bronze imitation gold aluminum or something of the kind a metallic finish can be put on any surface canvas coated or impregnated with such soluble cellulose gives us new flexible and durable fabrics that have other advantages over leather besides being cheaper and more abundant without such material for curtains and cushions the automobile business would have been sorely hampered it promises to provide us with a book binding that will not crumble to powder in the course of twenty years linen collars may be waterproofed and possibly dame fashionbeing a fickle ladymay some day relent and let us wear such sanitary and economical neckwear for shoes purses belts and the like the cellulose varnish or veneer is usually colored and stamped to resemble the grain of any kind of leather desired even snake or alligator if instead of dissolving the cellulose nitrate and spreading it on fabric we combine it with camphor we get celluloid a plastic solid capable of innumerable applications but that is another story and must be reserved for the next chapter but before leaving the subject of cellulose proper i must refer back again to its chief source wood we inherited from the indians a wellwooded continent but the pioneer carried an ax on his shoulder and began using it immediately for three hundred years the trees have been cut down faster than they could grow first to clear the land next for fuel then for lumber and lastly for paper consequently we are within sight of a shortage of wood as we are of coal and oil but the coal and oil are irrecoverable while the wood may be regrown though it would require another three hundred years and more to grow some of the trees we have cut down for fuel a pound of coal is about equal to two pounds of wood and a pound of gasoline to three pounds of wood in heating value so there would be a great loss in efficiency and economy if the world had to go back to a wood basis but when that time shall come as of course it must come some time the wood will doubtless not be burned in its natural state but will be converted into hydrogen and carbon monoxide in a gas producer or will be distilled in closed ovens giving charcoal and gas and saving the byproducts the tar and acid liquors as it is now the lumberman wastes twothirds of every tree he cuts down the rest is left in the forest as stump and tops or thrown out at the mill as sawdust and slabs the slabs and other scraps may be used as fuel or worked up into small wood articles like laths and clothespins the sawdust is burned or left to rot but it is possible although it may not be profitable to save all this waste in a former chapter i showed the advantages of the introduction of byproduct cokeovens the same principle applies to wood as to coal if a cord of wood 128 cubic feet is subjected to a process of destructive distillation it yields about 50 bushels of charcoal 11500 cubic feet of gas 25 gallons of tar 10 gallons of crude wood alcohol and 200 pounds of crude acetate of lime resinous woods such as pine and fir distilled with steam give turpentine and rosin the acetate of lime gives acetic acid and acetone the wood methyl alcohol is almost as useful as grain ethyl alcohol in arts and industry and has the advantage of killing off those who drink it promptly instead of slowly the chemist is an economical soul he is never content until he has converted every kind of waste product into some kind of profitable byproduct he now has his glittering eye fixed upon the mountains of sawdust that pile up about the lumber mills he also has a notion that he can beat lumber for some purposes vii synthetic plastics in the last chapter i told how alfred nobel cut his finger and daubing it over with collodion was led to the discovery of high explosive dynamite i remarked that the first part of this processthe hurting and the healing of the fingermight happen to anybody but not everybody would be led to discovery thereby that is true enough but we must not think that the swedish chemist was the only observant man in the world about this same time a young man in albany named john wesley hyatt got a sore finger and resorted to the same remedy and was led to as great a discovery his father was a blacksmith and his education was confined to what he could get at the seminary of eddytown new york before he was sixteen at that age he set out for the west to make his fortune he made it but after a long hard struggle his trade of typesetter gave him a living in illinois new york or wherever he wanted to go but he was not content with his wages or his hours however he did not strike to reduce his hours or increase his wages on the contrary he increased his working time and used it to increase his income he spent his nights and sundays in making billiard balls not at all the sort of thing you would expect of a young man of his christian name but working with billiard balls is more profitable than playing with themthough that is not the sort of thing you would expect a man of my surname to say hyatt had seen in the papers an offer of a prize of 10000 for the discovery of a satisfactory substitute for ivory in the making of billiard balls and he set out to get that prize i dont know whether he ever got it or not but i have in my hand a newly published circular announcing that mr hyatt has now perfected a process for making billiard balls better than ivory meantime he has turned out several hundred other inventions many of them much more useful and profitable but i imagine that he takes less satisfaction in any of them than he does in having solved the problem that he undertook fifty years ago the reason for the prize was that the game on the billiard table was getting more popular and the game in the african jungle was getting scarcer especially elephants having tusks more than 2716 inches in diameter the raising of elephants is not an industry that promises as quick returns as raising chickens or belgian hares to make a ball having exactly the weight color and resiliency to which billiard players have become accustomed seemed an impossibility hyatt tried compressed wood but while he did not succeed in making billiard balls he did build up a profitable business in stamped checkers and dominoes setting type in the way they did it in the sixties was hard on the hands and if the skin got worn thin or broken the dirty lead type were liable to infect the fingers one day in 1863 hyatt finding his fingers were getting raw went to the cupboard where was kept the liquid cuticle used by the printers but when he got there he found it was bare for the vial had tipped overyou know how easily they tip overand the collodion had run out and solidified on the shelf possibly hyatt was annoyed but if so he did not waste time raging around the office to find out who tipped over that bottle instead he pulled off from the wood a bit of the dried film as big as his thumb nail and examined it with that satiable curtiosity as kipling calls it which is characteristic of the born inventor he found it tough and elastic and it occurred to him that it might be worth 10000 it turned out to be worth many times that collodion as i have explained in previous chapters is a solution in ether and alcohol of guncotton otherwise known as pyroxylin or nitrocellulose which is made by the action of nitric acid on cotton hyatt tried mixing the collodion with ivory powder also using it to cover balls of the necessary weight and solidity but they did not work very well and besides were explosive a colorado saloon keeper wrote in to complain that one of the billiard players had touched a ball with a lighted cigar which set it off and every man in the room had drawn his gun the trouble with the dissolved guncotton was that it could not be molded it did not swell up and set it merely dried up and shrunk when the solvent evaporated it left a wrinkled shriveled horny film satisfactory to the surgeon but not to the man who wanted to make balls and hairpins and knife handles out of it in england alexander parkes began working on the problem in 1855 and stuck to it for ten years before he or rather his backers gave up he tried mixing in various things to stiffen up the pyroxylin of these camphor which he tried in 1865 worked the best but since he used castor oil to soften the mass articles made of parkesine did not hold up in all weathers another englishman daniel spill an associate of parkes took up the problem where he had dropped it and turned out a better product xylonite though still sticking to the idea that castor oil was necessary to get the two solids the guncotton and the camphor together but hyatt hearing that camphor could be used and not knowing enough about what others had done to follow their false trails simply mixed his camphor and guncotton together without any solvent and put the mixture in a hot press the two solids dissolved one another and when the press was opened there was a clear solid homogeneous block ofwhat he namedcelluloid the problem was solved and in the simplest imaginable way tissue paper that is cellulose is treated with nitric acid in the presence of sulfuric acid the nitration is not carried so far as to produce the guncotton used in explosives but only far enough to make a soluble nitrocellulose or pyroxylin this is pulped and mixed with half the quantity of camphor pressed into cakes and dried if this mixture is put into steamheated molds and subjected to hydraulic pressure it takes any desired form the process remains essentially the same as was worked out by the hyatt brothers in the factory they set up in newark in 1872 and some of their original machines are still in use but this protean plastic takes innumerable forms and almost as many names each factory has its own secrets and lays claim to peculiar merits the fundamental product itself is not patented so trade names are copyrighted to protect the product i have already mentioned three parkesine xylonite and celluloid and i may add without exhausting the list of species belonging to this genus viscoloid lithoxyl fiberloid coraline eburite pulveroid ivorine pergamoid duroid ivortus crystalloid transparene litnoid petroid pasbosene cellonite and pyralin celluloid can be given any color or colors by mixing in aniline dyes or metallic pigments the color may be confined to the surface or to the interior or pervade the whole if the nitrated tissue paper is bleached the celluloid is transparent or colorless in that case it is necessary to add an antacid such as urea to prevent its getting yellow or opaque to make it opaque and less inflammable oxides or chlorides of zinc aluminum magnesium etc are mixed in without going into the question of their variations and relative merits we may consider the advantages of the pyroxylin plastics in general here we have a new substance the product of the creative genius of man and therefore adaptable to his needs it is hard but light tough but elastic easily made and tolerably cheap heated to the boiling point of water it becomes soft and flexible it can be turned carved ground polished bent pressed stamped molded or blown to make a block of any desired size simply pile up the sheets and put them in a hot press to get sheets of any desired thickness simply shave them off the block to make a tube of any desired size shape or thickness squirt out the mixture through a ringshaped hole or roll the sheets around a hot bar cut the tube into sections and you have rings to be shaped and stamped into box bodies or napkin rings print words or pictures on a celluloid sheet put a thin transparent sheet over it and weld them together then you have something like the horn book of our ancestors but better nowadays such things as celluloid and pyralin can be sold under their own name but in the early days the artificial plastics like every new thing had to resort to camouflage a very humiliating expedient since in some cases they were better than the material they were forced to imitate tortoise shell for instance cracks splits and twists but a tortoise shell comb of celluloid looks as well and lasts better horn articles are limited to size of the ceratinous appendages that can be borne on the animals head but an imitation of horn can be made of any thickness by wrapping celluloid sheets about a cone ivory which also has a laminated structure may be imitated by rolling together alternate white opaque and colorless translucent sheets some of the sheets are wrinkled in order to produce the knots and irregularities of the grain of natural ivory mans chief difficulty in all such work is to imitate the imperfections of nature his whites are too white his surfaces are too smooth his shapes are too regular his products are too pure the precious red coral of the mediterranean can be perfectly imitated by taking a cast of a coral branch and filling in the mold with celluloid of the same color and hardness the clear luster of amber the dead black of ebony the cloudiness of onyx the opalescence of alabaster the glow of carnelianonce confined to the selfish enjoyment of the richare now within the reach of every one thanks to this chameleon material mosaics may be multiplied indefinitely by laying together sheets and sticks of celluloid suitably cut and colored to make up the picture fusing the mass and then shaving off thin layers from the end that chef doeuvre of the venetian glass makers the battle of isus from the house of the faun in pompeii can be reproduced as fast as the machine can shave them off the block and the tesserae do not fall out like those you bought on the rialto the process thus does for mosaics ivory and coral what printing does for pictures it is a mechanical multiplier and only by such means can we ever attain to a state of democratic luxury the product in cases where the imitation is accurate is equally valuable except to those who delight in thinking that coral insects italian craftsmen and elephants have been laboring for years to put a trinket into their hands the lord may be trusted to deal with such selfish souls according to their deserts but it is very low praise for a synthetic product that it can pass itself off more or less acceptably as a natural product if that is all we could do without it it must be an improvement in some respects on anything to be found in nature or it does not represent a real advance so celluloid and its congeners are not confined to the shapes of shell and coral and crystal or to the grain of ivory and wood and horn the colors of amber and amethyst and lapis lazuli but can be given forms and textures and tints that were never known before 1869 let me see now have i mentioned all the uses of celluloid oh no there are handles for canes umbrellas mirrors and brushes knives whistles toys blown animals card cases chains charms brooches badges bracelets rings book bindings hairpins campaign buttons cuff and collar buttons cuffs collars and dickies tags cups knobs paper cutters picture frames chessmen pool balls ping pong balls piano keys dental plates masks for disfigured faces penholders eyeglass frames goggles playing cardsand you can carry on the list as far as you like celluloid has its disadvantages you may mold you may color the stuff as you will the scent of the camphor will cling around it still this is not usually objectionable except where the celluloid is trying to pass itself off for something else in which case it deserves no sympathy it is attacked and dissolved by hot acids and alkalies it softens up when heated which is handy in shaping it though not so desirable afterward but the worst of its failings is its combustibility it is not explosive but it takes fire from a flame and burns furiously with clouds of black smoke but celluloid is only one of many plastic substances that have been introduced to the present generation a new and important group of them is now being opened up the socalled condensation products if you will take down any old volume of chemical research you will find occasionally words to this effect the reaction resulted in nothing but an insoluble resin which was not further investigated such a passage would be marked with a tear if chemists were given to crying over their failures for it is the epitaph of a buried hope it likely meant the loss of months of labor the reason the chemist did not do anything further with the gummy stuff that stuck up his test tube was because he did not know what to do with it it could not be dissolved it could not be crystallized it could not be distilled therefore it could not be purified analyzed and identified what had happened was in most cases this the molecule of the compound that the chemist was trying to make had combined with others of its kind to form a molecule too big to be managed by such means financiers call the process a merger chemists call it polymerization the resin was a molecular trust indissoluble uncontrollable and contaminating everything it touched but chemistslike governmentshave learned wisdom in recent years they have not yet discovered in all cases how to undo the process of polymerization or if you prefer the financial phrase how to unscramble the eggs but they have found that these molecular mergers are very useful things in their way for instance there is a liquid known as isoprene c5h8 this on heating or standing turns into a gum that is nothing less than rubber which is some multiple of c5h8 for another instance there is formaldehyde an acrid smelling gas used as a disinfectant this has the simplest possible formula for a carbohydrate ch2o but in the leaf of a plant this molecule multiplies itself by six and turns into a sweet solid glucose c6h12o6 or with the loss of water into starch c6h10o5 or cellulose c6h10o5 but formaldehyde is so insatiate that it not only combines with itself but seizes upon other substances particularly those having an acquisitive nature like its own such a substance is carbolic acid phenol which as we all know is used as a disinfectant like formaldehyde because it too has the power of attacking decomposable organic matter now prof adolf von baeyer discovered in 1872 that when phenol and formaldehyde were brought into contact they seized upon one another and formed a combine of unusual tenacity that is a resin but as i have said chemists in those days were shy of resins kleeberg in 1891 tried to make something out of it and wh story in 1895 went so far as to name the product resinite but nothing came of it until 1909 when lh baekeland undertook a serious and systematic study of this reaction in new york baekeland was a belgian chemist born at ghent in 1863 and professor at bruges while a student at ghent he took up photography as a hobby and began to work on the problem of doing away with the darkroom by producing a printing paper that could be developed under ordinary light when he came over to america in 1889 he brought his idea with him and four years later turned out velox with which doubtless the reader is familiar velox was never patented because as dr baekeland explained in his speech of acceptance of the perkin medal from the chemists of america lawsuits are too expensive manufacturers seem to be coming generally to the opinion that a synthetic name copyrighted as a trademark affords better protection than a patent later dr baekeland turned his attention to the phenol condensation products working gradually up from test tubes to ton vats according to his motto make your mistakes on a small scale and your profits on a large scale he found that when equal weights of phenol and formaldehyde were mixed and warmed in the presence of an alkaline catalytic agent the solution separated into two layers the upper aqueous and the lower a resinous precipitate this resin was soft viscous and soluble in alcohol or acetone but if it was heated under pressure it changed into another and a new kind of resin that was hard inelastic unplastic infusible and insoluble the chemical name of this product is polymerized oxybenzyl methylene glycol anhydride but nobody calls it that not even chemists it is called bakelite after its inventor the two stages in its preparation are convenient in many ways for instance porous wood may be soaked in the soft resin and then by heat and pressure it is changed to the bakelite form and the wood comes out with a hard finish that may be given the brilliant polish of japanese lacquer paper cardboard cloth wood pulp sawdust asbestos and the like may be impregnated with the resin producing tough and hard material suitable for various purposes brass work painted with it and then baked at 300 f acquires a lacquered surface that is unaffected by soap forced in powder or sheet form into molds under a pressure of 1200 to 2000 pounds to the square inch it takes the most delicate impressions billiard balls of bakelite are claimed to be better than ivory because having no grain they do not swell unequally with heat and humidity and so lose their sphericity pipestems and beads of bakelite have the clear brilliancy of amber and greater strength fountain pens made of it are transparent so you can see how much ink you have left a new and enlarging field for bakelite and allied products is the making of noiseless gears for automobiles and other machinery also of airplane propellers celluloid is more plastic and elastic than bakelite it is therefore more easily worked in sheets and small objects celluloid can be made perfectly transparent and colorless while bakelite is confined to the range between a clear amber and an opaque brown or black on the other hand bakelite has the advantage in being tasteless odorless inert insoluble and noninflammable this last quality and its high electrical resistance give bakelite its chief field of usefulness electricity was discovered by the greeks who found that amber electron when rubbed would pick up straws this means simply that amber like all such resinous substances natural or artificial is a nonconductor or dielectric and does not carry off and scatter the electricity collected on the surface by the friction bakelite is used in its liquid form for impregnating coils to keep the wires from shortcircuiting and in its solid form for commutators magnetos switch blocks distributors and all sorts of electrical apparatus for automobiles telephones wireless telegraphy electric lighting etc bakelite however is only one of an indefinite number of such condensation products as baeyer said long ago it seems that all the aldehydes will under suitable circumstances unite with the aromatic hydrocarbons to form resins so instead of phenol other coal tar products such as cresol naphthol or benzene itself may be used the carbon links ch2 methylene necessary to hook these carbon rings together may be obtained from other substances than the aldehydes for instance from the amines or ammonia derivatives three chemists lv kedman aj weith and fp broek working in 1910 on the industrial fellowships of the late robert kennedy duncan at the university of kansas developed a process using formin instead of formaldehyde forminor if you insist upon its full name hexamethylenetetramineis a sugarlike substance with a fishlike smell this mixed with crystallized carbolic acid and slightly warmed melts to a golden liquid that sets on pouring into molds it is still plastic and can be bent into any desired shape but on further heating it becomes hard without the need of pressure ammonia is given off in this process instead of water which is the byproduct in the case of formaldehyde the product is similar to bakelite exactly how similar is a question that the courts will have to decide the inventors threatened to call it phenylendekasaligenosaligenin but rightly fearing that this would interfere with its salability they have named it redmanol a phenolic condensation product closely related to bakelite and redmanol is condensite the invention of jonas walter aylesworth aylesworth was trained in what he referred to as the greatest university of the world the edison laboratory he entered this university at the age of nineteen at a salary of 3 a week but edison soon found that he had in his new boy an assistant who could stand being shut up in the laboratory working day and night as long as he could after nine years of close association with edison he set up a little laboratory in his own back yard to work out new plastics he found that by acting on naphthalenethe mothball stuffwith chlorine he got a series of useful products called halowaxes the lower chlorinated products are oils which may be used for impregnating paper or soft wood making it noninflammable and impregnable to water if four atoms of chlorine enter the naphthalene molecule the product is a hard wax that rings like a metal condensite is anhydrous and infusible and like its rivals finds its chief employment in the insulation parts of electrical apparatus the records of the edison phonograph are made of it so are the buttons of our bluejackets the government at the outbreak of the war ordered 40000 goggles in condensite frames to protect the eyes of our gunners from the glare and acid fumes the various synthetics played an important part in the war according to an ancient military pun the endurance of soldiers depends upon the strength of their soles the new compound rubber soles were found useful in our army and the germans attribute their success in making a little leather go a long way during the late war to the use of a new synthetic tanning material known as neradol there are various forms of this some are phenolic condensation products of formaldehyde like those we have been considering but some use coaltar compounds having no phenol groups such as naphthalene sulfonic acid these are now being made in england under such names as paradol cresyntan and syntan they have the advantage of the natural tannins such as bark in that they are of known strength and can be varied to suit this very grasping compound formaldehyde will attack almost anything even molecules many times its size gelatinous and albuminous substances of all sorts are solidified by it glue skimmed milk blood eggs yeast brewers slops may by this magic agent be rescued from waste and reappear in our buttons hairpins roofing phonographs shoes or shoepolish the french have made great use of casein hardened by formaldehyde into what is known as galalith ie milkstone this is harder than celluloid and noninflammable but has the disadvantages of being more brittle and of absorbing moisture a mixture of casein and celluloid has something of the merits of both the japanese as we should expect are using the juice of the soy bean familiar as a condiment to all who patronize chopsueys or use worcestershire sauce the soy glucine coagulated by formalin gives a plastic said to be better and cheaper than celluloid its inventor s sato of sendai university has named it according to american precedent satolite and has organized a milliondollar satolite company at mukojima the algin extracted from the pacific kelp can be used as a rubber surrogate for waterproofing cloth when combined with heavier alkaline bases it forms a tough and elastic substance that can be rolled into transparent sheets like celluloid or turned into buttons and knife handles in australia when the war shut off the supply of tin the government commission appointed to devise means of preserving fruits recommended the use of cardboard containers varnished with magramite this is a name the australians coined for synthetic resin made from phenol and formaldehyde like bakelite magramite dissolved in alcohol is painted on the cardboard cans and when these are stoved the coating becomes insoluble tarasoff has made a series of condensation products from phenol and formaldehyde with the addition of sulfonated oils these are formed by the action of sulfuric acid on coconut castor cottonseed or mineral oils the products of this combination are white plastics opaque insoluble and infusible since i am here chiefly concerned with creative chemistry that is with the art of making substances not found in nature i have not spoken of shellac asphaltum rosin ozocerite and the innumerable gums resins and waxes animal mineral and vegetable that are used either by themselves or in combination with the synthetics what particular dope or mud is used to coat a canvas or form a telephone receiver is often hard to find out the manufacturer finds secrecy safer than the patent office and the chemist of a rival establishment is apt to be baffled in his attempt to analyze and imitate but we of the outside world are not concerned with this though we are interested in the manifold applications of these new materials there seems to be no limit to these compounds and every week the journals report new processes and patents but we must not allow the new ones to crowd out the remembrance of the oldest and most famous of the synthetic plasters hard rubber to which a separate chapter must be devoted viii the race for rubber there is one law that regulates all animate and inanimate things it is formulated in various ways for instance running down a hill is easy in latin it reads facilis descensus averni herbert spencer calls it the dissolution of definite coherent heterogeneity into indefinite incoherent homogeneity mother goose expresses it in the fable of humpty dumpty and the business man extracts the moral as you cant unscramble an egg the theologian calls it the dogma of natural depravity the physicist calls it the second law of thermodynamics clausius formulates it as the entropy of the world tends toward a maximum it is easier to smash up than to build up children find that this is true of their toys the bolsheviki have found that it is true of a civilization so too the chemist knows analysis is easier than synthesis and that creative chemistry is the highest branch of his art this explains why chemists discovered how to take rubber apart over sixty years before they could find out how to put it together the first is easy just put some raw rubber into a retort and heat it if you can stand the odor you will observe the caoutchouc decomposing and a benzinelike liquid distilling over this is called isoprene any freshman chemist could write the reaction for this operation it is simply c10h16 2c5h8 caoutchouc isoprene that is one molecule of the gum splits up into two molecules of the liquid it is just as easy to write the reaction in the reverse directions as 2 isoprene 1 caoutchouc but nobody could make it go in that direction yet it could be done it had been done but the man who did it did not know how he did it and could not do it again professor tilden in may 1892 read a paper before the birmingham philosophical society in which he said i was surprised a few weeks ago at finding the contents of the bottles containing isoprene from turpentine entirely changed in appearance in place of a limpid colorless liquid the bottles contained a dense syrup in which were floating several large masses of a yellowish color upon examination this turned out to be india rubber but neither professor tilden nor any one else could repeat this accidental metamorphosis it was tantalizing for the world was willing to pay 2000000000 a year for rubber and the forests of the amazon and congo were failing to meet the demand a large share of these millions would have gone to any chemist who could find out how to make synthetic rubber and make it cheaply enough with such a reward of fame and fortune the competition among chemists was intense it took the form of an international contest in which england and germany were neck and neck illustration courtesy of the india rubber world what goes into rubber and what is made out of it the english who had been beaten by the germans in the dye business where they had the start were determined not to lose in this prof wh perkin of manchester university was one of the most eager for he was inspired by a personal grudge against the germans as well as by patriotism and scientific zeal it was his father who had fifty years before discovered mauve the first of the anilin dyes but england could not hold the business and its rich rewards went over to germany so in 1909 a corps of chemists set to work under professor perkin in the manchester laboratories to solve the problem of synthetic rubber what reagent could be found that would reverse the reaction and convert the liquid isoprene into the solid rubber it was discovered by accident we may say but it should be understood that such advantageous accidents happen only to those who are working for them and know how to utilize them in july 1910 dr matthews who had charge of the research set some isoprene to drying over metallic sodium a common laboratory method of freeing a liquid from the last traces of water in september he found that the flask was filled with a solid mass of real rubber instead of the volatile colorless liquid he had put into it twenty years before the discovery would have been useless for sodium was then a rare and costly metal a little of it in a sealed glass tube being passed around the chemistry class once a year as a curiosity or a tiny bit cut off and dropped in water to see what a fuss it made but nowadays metallic sodium is cheaply produced by the aid of electricity the difficulty lay rather in the cost of the raw material isoprene in industrial chemistry it is not sufficient that a thing can be made it must be made to pay isoprene could be obtained from turpentine but this was too expensive and limited in supply it would merely mean the destruction of pine forests instead of rubber forests starch was finally decided upon as the best material since this can be obtained for about a cent a pound from potatoes corn and many other sources here however the chemist came to the end of his rope and had to call the bacteriologist to his aid the splitting of the starch molecule is too big a job for man only the lower organisms the yeast plant for example know enough to do that owing perhaps to the entente cordiale a french biologist was called into the combination professor fernbach of the pasteur institute and after eighteen months hard work he discovered a process of fermentation by which a large amount of fusel oil can be obtained from any starchy stuff hitherto the aim in fermentation and distillation had been to obtain as small a proportion of fusel as possible for fusel oil is a mixture of the heavier alcohols all of them more poisonous and malodorous than common alcohol but here as has often happened in the history of industrial chemistry the byproduct turned out to be more valuable than the product from fusel oil by the use of chlorine isoprene can be prepared so the chain was complete but meanwhile the germans had been making equal progress in 1905 prof karl harries of berlin found out the name of the caoutchouc molecule this discovery was to the chemists what the architects plan of a house is to the builder they knew then what they were trying to construct and could go about their task intelligently mark twain said that he could understand something about how astronomers could measure the distance of the planets calculate their weights and so forth but he never could see how they could find out their names even with the largest telescopes this is a joke in astronomy but it is not in chemistry for when the chemist finds out the structure of a compound he gives it a name which means that the stuff came to be called caoutchouc because that was the way the spaniards of columbuss time caught the indian word cahuchu when dr priestley called it india rubber he told merely where it came from and what it was good for but when harries named it 15dimethylcyclooctadien15 any chemist could draw a picture of it and give a guess as to how it could be made even a person without any knowledge of chemistry can get the main point of it by merely looking at this diagram c c cc cc c cc c c cc c cc c c cc illustration isoprene turns into caoutchouc i have dropped the 16 hs or hydrogen atoms of the formula for simplicitys sake they simply hook on wherever they can you will see that the isoprene consists of a chain of four carbon atoms represented by the cs with an extra carbon on the side in the transformation of this colorless liquid into soft rubber two of the double linkages break and so permit the two chains of 4 cs to unite to form one ring of eight if you have ever played ringaroundarosy you will get the idea in chapter iv i explained that the anilin dyes are built up upon the benzene ring of six carbon atoms the rubber ring consists of eight at least and probably more any substance containing that peculiar carbon chain with two double links cccc can double uppolymerize the chemist calls itinto a rubberlike substance so we may have many kinds of rubber some of which may prove to be more useful than that which happens to be found in nature with the structural formula of harries as a clue chemists all over the world plunged into the problem with renewed hope the famous bayer dye works at elberfeld took it up and there in august 1909 dr fritz hofmann worked out a process for the converting of pure isoprene into rubber by heat then in 1910 harries happened upon the same sodium reaction as matthews but when he came to get it patented he found that the englishman had beaten him to the patent office by a few weeks this anglogerman rivalry came to a dramatic climax in 1912 at the great hall of the college of the city of new york when dr carl duisberg of the elberfeld factory delivered an address on the latest achievements of the chemical industry before the eighthand the last for a long timeinternational congress of applied chemistry duisberg insisted upon talking in german although more of his auditors would have understood him in english he laid full emphasis upon german achievements and cast doubt upon the claim of the englishman tilden to have prepared artificial rubber in the eighties perkin of manchester confronted him with his new process for making rubber from potatoes but duisberg countered by proudly displaying two automobile tires made of synthetic rubber with which he had made a thousandmile run the intense antagonism between the british and german chemists at this congress was felt by all present but we did not foresee that in two years from that date they would be engaged in manufacturing poison gas to fire at one another it was however realized that more was at stake than personal reputation and national prestige under pressure of the new demand for automobiles the price of rubber jumped from 125 to 3 a pound in 1910 and millions had been invested in plantations if professor perkin was right when he told the congress that by his process rubber could be made for less than 25 cents a pound it meant that these plantations would go the way of the indigo plantations when the germans succeeded in making artificial indigo if dr duisberg was right when he told the congress that synthetic rubber would certainly appear on the market in a very short time it meant that germany in war or peace would become independent of brazil in the matter of rubber as she had become independent of chile in the matter of nitrates as it turned out both scientists were too sanguine synthetic rubber has not proved capable of displacing natural rubber by underbidding it nor even of replacing natural rubber when this is shut out when germany was blockaded and the success of her armies depended on rubber price was no object three danish sailors who were caught by united states officials trying to smuggle dental rubber into germany confessed that they had been selling it there for gas masks at 73 a pound the german gas masks in the latter part of the war were made without rubber and were frail and leaky they could not have withstood the new gases which american chemists were preparing on an unprecedented scale every scrap of old rubber in germany was saved and worked over and over and diluted with fillers and surrogates to the limit of elasticity spring tires were substituted for pneumatics so it is evident that the supply of synthetic rubber could not have been adequate or satisfactory neither on the other hand have the british made a success of the perkin process although they spent 200000 on it in the first two years but of course there was not the same necessity for it as in the case of germany for england had practically a monopoly of the worlds supply of natural rubber either through owning plantations or controlling shipping if rubber could not be manufactured profitably in germany when the demand was imperative and price no consideration it can hardly be expected to compete with the natural under peace conditions the problem of synthetic rubber has then been solved scientifically but not industrially it can be made but cannot be made to pay the difficulty is to find a cheap enough material to start with we can make rubber out of potatoesbut potatoes have other uses it would require more land and more valuable land to raise the potatoes than to raise the rubber we can get isoprene by the distillation of turpentinebut why not bleed a rubber tree as well as a pine tree turpentine is neither cheap nor abundant enough any kind of wood sawdust for instance can be utilized by converting the cellulose over into sugar and fermenting this to alcohol but the process is not likely to prove profitable petroleum when cracked up to make gasoline gives isoprene or other doublebond compounds that go over into some form of rubber but the most interesting and most promising of all is the complete inorganic synthesis that dispenses with the aid of vegetation and starts with coal and lime these heated together in the electric furnace form calcium carbide and this as every automobilist knows gives acetylene by contact with water from this gas isoprene can be made and the isoprene converted into rubber by sodium or acid or alkali or simple heating acetone which is also made from acetylene can be converted directly into rubber by fuming sulfuric acid this seems to have been the process chiefly used by the germans during the war several carbide factories were devoted to it but the intermediate and byproducts of the process such as alcohol acetic acid and acetone were in as much demand for war purposes as rubber the germans made some rubber from pitch imported from sweden they also found a useful substitute in aluminum naphthenate made from baku petroleum for it is elastic and plastic and can be vulcanized so although rubber can be made in many different ways it is not profitable to make it in any of them we have to rely still upon the natural product but we can greatly improve upon the way nature produces it when the call came for more rubber for the electrical and automobile industries the first attempt to increase the supply was to put pressure upon the natives to bring in more of the latex as a consequence the trees were bled to death and sometimes also the natives the belgian atrocities in the congo shocked the civilized world and at putumayo on the upper amazon the same cause produced the same horrible effects but no matter what cruelty was practiced the tropical forests could not be made to yield a sufficient increase so the cultivation of the rubber was begun by farsighted men in dutch java sumatra and borneo and in british malaya and ceylon brazil feeling secure in the possession of a natural monopoly made no effort to compete with these parvenus it cost about as much to gather rubber from the amazon forests as it did to raise it on a malay plantation that is 25 cents a pound the brazilian government clapped on another 25 cents export duty and spent the money lavishly in 1911 the treasury of para took in 2000000 from the rubber tax and a good share of the money was spent on a magnificent new theater at manaosnot on setting out rubber trees the result of this rivalry between the collector and the cultivator is shown by the fact that in the decade 19071917 the worlds output of plantation rubber increased from 1000 to 204000 tons while the output of wild rubber decreased from 68000 to 53000 besides this the plantation rubber is a cleaner and more even product carefully coagulated by acetic acid instead of being smoked over a forest fire it comes in pale yellow sheets instead of big black balls loaded with the dirt or sticks and stones that the honest indian sometimes adds to make a bigger lump whats better the man who milks the rubber trees on a plantation may live at home where he can be decently looked after the agriculturist and the chemist may do what the philanthropist and statesman could not accomplish put an end to the cruelties involved in the international struggle for black gold the united states uses threefourths of the worlds rubber output and grows none of it what is the use of tropical possessions if we do not make use of them the philippines could grow all our rubber and keep a 300000000 business under our flag santo domingo where rubber was first discovered is now under our supervision and could be enriched by the industry the guianas where the rubber tree was first studied might be purchased it is chiefly for lack of a definite colonial policy that our rubber industry by far the largest in the world has to be dependent upon foreign sources for all its raw materials because the philippines are likely to be cast off at any moment american manufacturers are placing their plantations in the dutch or british possessions the goodyear company has secured a concession of 20000 acres near medan in dutch sumatra while the united states is planning to relinquish its pacific possessions the british have more than doubled their holdings in new guinea by the acquisition of kaiser wilhelms land good rubber country the british malay states in 1917 exported over 118000000 worth of plantationgrown rubber and could have sold more if shipping had not been short and production restricted fully 90 per cent of the cultivated rubber is now grown in british colonies or on british plantations in the dutch east indies to protect this monopoly an act has been passed preventing foreigners from buying more land in the malay peninsula the japanese have acquired there 50000 acres on which they are growing more than a million dollars worth of rubber a year the british tropical life says of the american invasion as america is so extremely wealthy uncle sam can well afford to continue to buy our rubber as he has been doing instead of coming in to produce rubber to reduce his competition as a buyer in the worlds market the malaya estates calculate to pay a dividend of 20 per cent on the investment with rubber selling at 30 cents a pound and every two cents additional on the price brings a further 312 per cent dividend the output is restricted by the rubber growers association so as to keep the price up to 5070 cents when the plantations first came into bearing in 1910 rubber was bringing nearly 3 a pound and since it can be produced at less than 30 cents a pound we can imagine the profits of the early birds the fact that the worlds rubber trade was in the control of great britain caused america great anxiety and financial loss in the early part of the war when the british government suspectingnot without reasonthat some american rubber goods were getting into germany through neutral nations suddenly shut off our supply this threatened to kill the fourth largest of our industries and it was only by the submission of american rubber dealers to the closest supervision and restriction by the british authorities that they were allowed to continue their business sir francis hopwood in laying down these regulations gave emphatic warning that in case any manufacturer importer or dealer came under suspicion his permits should be immediately revoked reinstatement will be slow and difficult the british government will cancel first and investigate afterward of course the british had a right to say under what conditions they should sell their rubber and we cannot blame them for taking such precautions to prevent its getting to their enemies but it placed the united states in a humiliating position and if we had not been in sympathy with their side it would have aroused more resentment than it did but it made evident the desirability of having at least part of our supply under our own control and if possible within our own country rubber is not rare in nature for it is contained in almost every milky juice every country boy knows that he can get a selffeeding mucilage brush by cutting off a milkweed stalk the only native source so far utilized is the guayule which grows wild on the deserts of the mexican and the american border the plant was discovered in 1852 by dr jm bigelow near escondido creek texas professor asa gray described it and named it parthenium argentatum or the silver pallas when chopped up and macerated guayule gives a satisfactory quality of caoutchouc in profitable amounts in 1911 seven thousand tons of guayule were imported from mexico in 1917 only seventeen hundred tons why this falling off because the eager exploiters had killed the goose that laid the golden egg or in plain language pulled up the plant by the roots now guayule is being cultivated and is reaped instead of being uprooted experiments at the tucson laboratory have recently removed the difficulty of getting the seed to germinate under cultivation this seems the most promising of the homegrown plants and until artificial rubber can be made profitable gives us the only chance of being in part independent of oversea supply there are various other gums found in nature that can for some purposes be substituted for caoutchouc gutta percha for instance is pliable and tough though not very elastic it becomes plastic by heat so it can be molded but unlike rubber it cannot be hardened by heating with sulfur a lump of gutta percha was brought from java in 1766 and placed in a british museum where it lay for nearly a hundred years before it occurred to anybody to do anything with it except to look at it but a german electrician siemens discovered in 1847 that gutta percha was valuable for insulating telegraph lines and it found extensive employment in submarine cables as well as for golf balls and the like balata which is found in the forests of the guianas is between gutta percha and rubber not so good for insulation but useful for shoe soles and machine belts the bark of the tree is so thick that the latex does not run off like caoutchouc when the bark is cut so the bark has to be cut off and squeezed in hand presses formerly this meant cutting down the tree but now alternate strips of the bark are cut off and squeezed so the tree continues to live when columbus discovered santo domingo he found the natives playing with balls made from the gum of the caoutchouc tree the soldiers of pizarro when they conquered incaland adopted the peruvian custom of smearing caoutchouc over their coats to keep out the rain a french scientist m de la condamine who went to south america to measure the earth came back in 1745 with some specimens of caoutchouc from para as well as quinine from peru the vessel on which he returned the brig minerva had a narrow escape from capture by an english cruiser for great britain was jealous of any trespassing on her american sphere of influence the old world need not have waited for the discovery of the new for the rubber tree grows wild in annam as well as brazil but none of the asiatics seems to have discovered any of the many uses of the juice that exudes from breaks in the bark the first practical use that was made of it gave it the name that has stuck to it in english ever since magellan announced in 1772 that it was good to remove pencil marks a lump of it was sent over from france to priestley the clergyman chemist who discovered oxygen and was mobbed out of manchester for being a republican and took refuge in pennsylvania he cut the lump into little cubes and gave them to his friends to eradicate their mistakes in writing or figuring then they asked him what the queer things were and he said that they were india rubbers illustration forest rubber compare this tropical tangle and gnarled trunk with the straight tree and cleared ground of the plantation at the foot of the trunk are cups collecting rubber juice illustration plantation rubber this spiral cut draws off the milk as completely and quickly as possible without harming the tree the man is pulling off a strip of coagulated rubber that clogs it illustration in making garden hose the rubber is formed into a tube by the machine on the right and coiled on the table to the left the peruvian natives had used caoutchouc for waterproof clothing shoes bottles and syringes but europe was slow to take it up for the stuff was too sticky and smelled too bad in hot weather to become fashionable in fastidious circles in 1825 mackintosh made his name immortal by putting a layer of rubber between two cloths a german chemist ludersdorf discovered in 1832 that the gum could be hardened by treating it with sulfur dissolved in turpentine but it was left to a yankee inventor charles goodyear of connecticut to work out a practical solution of the problem a friend of his hayward told him that it had been revealed to him in a dream that sulfur would harden rubber but unfortunately the angel or defunct chemist who inspired the vision failed to reveal the details of the process so hayward sold out his dream to goodyear who spent all his own money and all he could borrow from his friends trying to convert it into a reality he worked for ten years on the problem before the lucky accident came to him one day in 1839 he happened to drop on the hot stove of the kitchen that he used as a laboratory a mixture of caoutchouc and sulfur to his surprise he saw the two substances fuse together into something new instead of the soft tacky gum and the yellow brittle brimstone he had the tough stable elastic solid that has done so much since to make our footing and wheeling safe swift and noiseless the gumshoes or galoshes that he was then enabled to make still go by the name of rubbers in this country although we do not use them for pencil erasers goodyear found that he could vary this vulcanized rubber at will by adding a little more sulfur he got a hard substance which however could be softened by heat so as to be molded into any form wanted out of this hard rubber vulcanite or ebonite were made combs hairpins penholders and the like and it has not yet been superseded for some purposes by any of its recent rivals the synthetic resins the new form of rubber made by the germans methyl rubber is said to be a superior substitute for the hard variety but not satisfactory for the soft the electrical resistance of the synthetic product is 20 per cent higher than the natural so it is excellent for insulation but it is inferior in elasticity in the latter part of the war the methyl rubber was manufactured at the rate of 165 tons a month the first pneumatic tires known then as patent aerial wheels were invented by robert william thomson of london in 1846 on the following year a carriage equipped with them was seen in the streets of new york city but the pneumatic tire did not come into use until after 1888 when an irish horsedoctor john boyd dunlop of belfast tied a rubber tube around the wheels of his little sons velocipede within seven years after that a 25000000 corporation was manufacturing dunlop tires later america took the lead in this business in 1913 the united states exported 3000000 worth of tires and tubes in 1917 the american exports rose to 13000000 not counting what went to the allies the number of pneumatic tires sold in 1917 is estimated at 18000000 which at an average cost of 25 would amount to 450000000 no matter how much synthetic rubber may be manufactured or how many rubber trees are set out there is no danger of glutting the market for as the price falls the uses of rubber become more numerous one can think of a thousand ways in which rubber could be used if it were only cheap enough in the form of pads and springs and tires it would do much to render traffic noiseless even the elevated railroad and the subway might be opened to conversation and the city made habitable for mild voiced and gentle folk it would make ones step sure noiseless and springy whether it was used individualistically as rubber heels or collectivistically as carpeting and paving in roofing and siding and paint it would make our buildings warmer and more durable it would reduce the cost and permit the extension of electrical appliances of almost all kinds in short there is hardly any other material whose abundance would contribute more to our comfort and convenience noise is an automatic alarm indicating lost motion and wasted energy silence is economy and resiliency is superior to resistance a gumshoe outlasts a hobnailed sole and a rubber tube full of air is better than a steel tire ix the rival sugars the ancient greeks being an inquisitive and acquisitive people were fond of collecting tales of strange lands they did not care much whether the stories were true or not so long as they were interesting among the marvels that the greeks heard from the far east two of the strangest were that in india there were plants that bore wool without sheep and reeds that bore honey without bees these incredible tales turned out to be true and in the course of time europe began to get a little calico from calicut and a kind of edible gravel that the arabs who brought it called sukkar but of course only kings and queens could afford to dress in calico and have sugar prescribed for them when they were sick fortunately however in the course of time the arabs invaded spain and forced upon the unwilling inhabitants of europe such instrumentalities of higher civilization as arithmetic and algebra soap and sugar later the spaniards by an act of equally unwarranted and beneficent aggression carried the sugar cane to the caribbean where it thrived amazingly the west indies then became a rival of the east indies as a treasurehouse of tropical wealth and for several centuries the spanish portuguese dutch english danes and french fought like wildcats to gain possession of this little nest of islands and the routes leading thereunto the english finally overcame all these enemies whether they fought her singly or combined great britain became mistress of the seas and took such caribbean lands as she wanted but in the end her continental foes came out ahead for they rendered her victory valueless they were defeated in geography but they won in chemistry canning boasted that the new world had been called into existence to redress the balance of the old napoleon might have boasted that he had called in the sugar beet to balance the sugar cane france was then as germany was a century later threatening to dominate the world england then as in the great war shut off from the seas the shipping of the aggressive power france then like germany later felt most keenly the lack of tropical products chief among which then but not in the recent crisis was sugar the cause of this vital change is that in 1747 marggraf a berlin chemist discovered that it was possible to extract sugar from beets there was only a little sugar in the beet root then some six per cent and what he got out was dirty and bitter one of his pupils in 1801 set up a beet sugar factory near breslau under the patronage of the king of prussia but the industry was not a success until napoleon took it up and in 1810 offered a prize of a million francs for a practical process how the french did make fun of him for this crazy notion in a comic paper of that day you will find a cartoon of napoleon in the nursery beside the cradle of his son and heir the king of romeknown to the readers of rostand as laiglon the emperor is squeezing the juice of a beet into his coffee and the nurse has put a beet into the mouth of the infant king saying suck dear suck your father says its sugar in like manner did the wits ridicule franklin for fooling with electricity rumford for trying to improve chimneys parmentier for thinking potatoes were fit to eat and jefferson for believing that something might be made of the country west of the mississippi in all ages ridicule has been the chief weapon of conservatism if you want to know what line human progress will take in the future read the funny papers of today and see what they are fighting the satire of every century from aristophanes to the latest vaudeville has been directed against those who are trying to make the world wiser or better against the teacher and the preacher the scientist and the reformer in spite of the ridicule showered upon it the despised beet year by year gained in sweetness of heart the percentage of sugar rose from six to eighteen and by improved methods of extraction became finally as pure and palatable as the sugar of the cane an acre of german beets produces more sugar than an acre of louisiana cane continental europe waxed wealthy while the british west indies sank into decay as the beets of europe became sweeter the population of the islands became blacker before the war england was paying out 125000000 for sugar and more than twothirds of this money was going to germany and austriahungary fostered by scientific study protected by tariff duties and stimulated by export bounties the beet sugar industry became one of the financial forces of the world the english at home especially the marmalademakers at first rejoiced at the idea of getting sugar for less than cost at the expense of her continental rivals but the suffering colonies took another view of the situation in 1888 a conference of the powers called at london agreed to stop competing by the pernicious practice of export bounties but france and the united states refused to enter so the agreement fell through another conference ten years later likewise failed but when the parvenu beet sugar ventured to invade the historic home of the cane the limit of toleration had been reached the council of india put on countervailing duties to protect their homegrown cane from the bountyfed beet this forced the calling of a convention at brussels in 1903 to equalize the conditions of competition between beet sugar and cane sugar of the various countries at which the powers agreed to a mutual suppression of bounties beet sugar then divided the worlds market equally with cane sugar and the two rivals stayed substantially neck and neck until the great war came this shut out from england the product of germany austriahungary belgium northern france and russia and took the farmers from their fields the battle lines of the central powers enclosed the land which used to grow a third of the worlds supply of sugar in 1913 the beet and the cane each supplied about nine million tons of sugar in 1917 the output of cane sugar was 11200000 and of beet sugar 5300000 tons consequently the old world had to draw upon the new cuba on which the united states used to depend for half its sugar supply sent over 700000 tons of raw sugar to england in 1916 the united states sent as much more refined sugar the lack of shipping interfered with our getting sugar from our tropical dependencies hawaii porto rico and the philippines the homegrown beets give us only a fifth and the cane of louisiana and texas only a fifteenth of the sugar we need as a result we were obliged to file a claim in advance to get a pound of sugar from the corner grocery and then we were apt to be put off with rock candy muscovado or honey lemon drops proved useful for russian tea and the long sweetening of our forefathers came again into vogue in the form of various syrups the united states was accustomed to consume almost a fifth of all the sugar produced in the worldand then we could not get it illustration map showing location of european beet sugar factoriesalso battle lines at close of 1918 estimated that onethird of worlds production before the war was produced within battle lines courtesy american sugar refining co the shortage made us realize how dependent we have become upon sugar yet it was as we have seen practically unknown to the ancients and only within the present generation has it become an essential factor in our diet as soon as the chemist made it possible to produce sugar at a reasonable price all nations began to buy it in proportion to their means americans as the wealthiest people in the world ate the most ninety pounds a year on the average for every man woman and child in other words we ate our weight of sugar every year the english consumed nearly as much as the americans the french and germans about half as much the balkan peoples less than ten pounds per annum and the african savages none illustration how the sugar beet has gained enormously in sugar content under chemical control pure white sugar is the first and greatest contribution of chemistry to the worlds dietary it is unique in being a single definite chemical compound sucrose c12h22o11 all natural nutriments are more or less complex mixtures many of them like wheat or milk or fruit contain in various proportions all of the three factors of foods the fats the proteids and the carbohydrates as well as water and the minerals and other ingredients necessary to life but sugar is a simple substance like water or salt and like them is incapable of sustaining life alone although unlike them it is nutritious in fact except the fats there is no more nutritious food than sugar pound for pound for it contains no water and no waste it is therefore the quickest and usually the cheapest means of supplying bodily energy but as may be seen from its formula as given above it contains only three elements carbon hydrogen and oxygen and omits nitrogen and other elements necessary to the body an engine requires not only coal but also lubricating oil water and bits of steel and brass to keep it in repair but as a source of the energy needed in our strenuous life sugar has no equal and only one rival alcohol alcohol is the offspring of sugar a degenerate descendant that retains but few of the good qualities of its sire and has acquired some evil traits of its own alcohol like sugar may serve to furnish the energy of a steam engine or a human body used as a fuel alcohol has certain advantages but used as a food it has the disqualification of deranging the bodily mechanism even a little alcohol will impair the accuracy and speed of thought and action while a large quantity as we all know from observation if not experience will produce temporary incapacitation when man feeds on sugar he splits it up by the aid of air into water and carbon dioxide in this fashion c12h22o11 12o2 11h2o 12co2 cane sugar oxygen water carbon dioxide when sugar is burned the reaction is just the same but when the yeast plant feeds on sugar it carries the process only part way and instead of water the product is alcohol a very different thing so they say who have tried both as beverages the yeast or fermentation reaction is this c12h22o11 h2o 4c2h6o 4co2 cane sugar water alcohol carbon dioxide alcohol then is the first product of the decomposition of sugar a dangerous halfway house the twin product carbon dioxide or carbonic acid is a gas of slightly sour taste which gives an attractive tang and effervescence to the beer wine cider or champagne that is to say one of these twins is a pestilential fellow and the other is decidedly agreeable yet for several thousand years mankind took to the first and let the second for the most part escape into the air but when the chemist appeared on the scene he discovered a way of separating the two and bottling the harmless one for those who prefer it an increasing number of people were found to prefer it so the american sodawater fountain is gradually driving demon rum out of the civilized world the brewer nowadays caters to two classes of customers he bottles up the beer with the alcohol and a little carbonic acid in it for the saloon and he catches the rest of the carbonic acid that he used to waste and sells it to the drug stores for sodawater or uses it to charge some nonalcoholic beer of his own this catering to rival trades is not an uncommon thing with the chemist as we have seen the synthetic perfumes are used to improve the natural perfumes cottonseed is separated into oil and meal the oil going to make margarin and the meal going to feed the cows that produce butter some people have been drinking coffee although they do not like the taste of it because they want the stimulating effect of its alkaloid caffein other people liked the warmth and flavor of coffee but find that caffein does not agree with them formerly one had to take the coffee whole or let it alone now one can have his choice for the caffein is extracted for use in certain popular cold drinks and the rest of the bean sold as caffeinfree coffee most of the soft drinks that are now gradually displacing the hard ones consist of sugar water and carbonic acid with various flavors chiefly the esters of the fatty and aromatic acids such as i described in a previous chapter these are still usually made from fruits and spices and in some cases the law or public opinion requires this but eventually i presume the synthetic flavors will displace the natural and then we shall get rid of such extraneous and indigestible matter as seeds skins and bark suppose the world had always been used to synthetic and hence seedless figs strawberries and blackberries suppose then some manufacturer of fig paste or strawberry jam should put in ten per cent of little round hard wooden nodules just the sort to get stuck between the teeth or caught in the vermiform appendix how long would it be before he was sent to jail for adulterating food but neither jail nor boycott has any reformatory effect on nature nature is quite human in that respect but you can reform nature as you can human beings by looking out for heredity and culture in this way mother nature has been quite cured of her bad habit of putting seeds in bananas and oranges figs she still persists in adulterating with particles of cellulose as nutritious as sawdust but we can circumvent the old lady at this i got on christmas a package of figs from california without a seed in them somebody had taken out all the seedsit must have been a big joband then put the figs together again as natural looking as life and very much better tasting sugar and alcohol are both found in nature sugar in the ripe fruit alcohol when it begins to decay but it was the chemist who discovered how to extract them he first worked with alcohol and unfortunately succeeded previous to the invention of the still by the arabian chemists man could not get drunk as quickly as he wanted to because his liquors were limited to what the yeast plant could stand without intoxication when the alcoholic content of wine or beer rose to seventeen per cent at the most the process of fermentation stopped because the yeast plants got drunk and quit working that meant that a man confined to ordinary wine or beer had to drink ten or twenty quarts of water to get one quart of the stuff he was after and he had no liking for water so the chemist helped him out of this difficulty and got him into worse trouble by distilling the wine the more volatile part that came over first contained the flavor and most of the alcohol in this way he could get liquors like brandy and whisky rum and gin containing from thirty to eighty per cent of alcohol this was the origin of the modern liquor problem the wine of the ancients was strong enough to knock out noah and put the companions of socrates under the table but it was not until distilled liquors came in that alcoholism became chronic epidemic and ruinous to whole populations but the chemist later tried to undo the ruin he had quite inadvertently wrought by introducing alcohol into the world one of his most successful measures was the production of cheap and pure sugar which as we have seen has become a large factor in the dietary of civilized countries as a country sobers up it takes to sugar as a selfstarter to provide the energy needed for the strenuous life a five oclock candy is a better restorative than a five oclock highball or even a five oclock tea for it is a true nutrient instead of a mere stimulant it is a matter of common observation that those who like sweets usually do not like alcohol women for instance are apt to eat candy but do not commonly take to alcoholic beverages look around you at a banquet table and you will generally find that those who turn down their wine glasses generally take two lumps in their demitasses we often hear it said that whenever a candy store opens up a saloon in the same block closes up our grandmothers used to warn their daughters dont marry a man who does not want sugar in his tea he is likely to take to drink so young man when next you give a box of candy to your best girl and she offers you some dont decline it eat it and pretend to like it at least for it is quite possible that she looked into a physiology and is trying you out you never can tell what girls are up to in the army and navy ration the same change has taken place as in the popular dietary the ration of rum has been mostly replaced by an equivalent amount of candy or marmalade instead of the tippling trooper of former days we have the chocolate soldier no previous war in history has been fought so largely on sugar and so little on alcohol as the last one when the war reduced the supply and increased the demand we all felt the sugar famine and it became a mark of patriotism to refuse candy and to drink coffee unsweetened this however is not as some think the mere curtailment of a superfluous or harmful luxury the sacrifice of a pleasant sensation it is a real deprivation and a serious loss to national nutrition for there is no reason to think the constantly rising curve of sugar consumption has yet reached its maximum or optimum individuals overeat but not the population as a whole according to experiments of the department of agriculture men doing heavy labor may add threequarters of a pound of sugar to their daily diet without any deleterious effects this is at the rate of 275 pounds a year which is three times the average consumption of england and america but the department does not state how much a girl doing nothing ought to eat between meals of the 2500 to 3500 calories of energy required to keep a man going for a day the best source of supply is the carbohydrates that is the sugars and starches the fats are more concentrated but are more expensive and less easily assimilable the proteins are also more expensive and their decomposition products are more apt to clog up the system common sugar is almost an ideal food cheap clean white portable imperishable unadulterated pleasanttasting germfree highly nutritious completely soluble altogether digestible easily assimilable requires no cooking and leaves no residue its only fault is its perfection it is so pure that a man cannot live on it four square lumps give one hundred calories of energy but twentyfive or thirtyfive times that amount would not constitute a days ration in fact one would ultimately starve on such fare it would be like supplying an army with an abundance of powder but neglecting to provide any bullets clothing or food to make sugar the sole food is impossible to make it the main food is unwise it is quite proper for man to separate out the distinct ingredients of natural productsto extract the butter from the milk the casein from the cheese the sugar from the canebut he must not forget to combine them again at each meal with the other essential foodstuffs in their proper proportion illustration the rival sugars the sugar beet of the north has become a close rival of the sugar cane of the south illustration interior of a sugar mill showing the machinery for crushing cane to extract the juice illustration courtesy of american sugar refinery co vacuum pans of the american sugar refinery company in these airtight vats the water is boiled off from the cane juice under diminished atmospheric pressure until the sugar crystallizes out sugar is not a synthetic product and the business of the chemist has been merely to extract and purify it but this is not so simple as it seems and every sugar factory has had to have its chemist he has analyzed every mother beet for a hundred years he has watched every step of the process from the cane to the crystal lest the sucrose should invert to the less sweet and noncrystallizable glucose he has tested with polarized light every shipment of sugar that has passed through the custom house much to the mystification of congressmen who have often wondered at the money and argumentation expended in a tariff discussion over the question of the precise angle of rotation of the plane of vibration of infinitesimal waves in a hypothetical ether the reason for this painstaking is that there are dozens of different sugars so much alike that they are difficult to separate they are all composed of the same three elements c h and o and often in the same proportion sometimes two sugars differ only in that one has a righthanded and the other a lefthanded twist to its molecule they bear the same resemblance to one another as the two gloves of a pair cane sugar and beet sugar are when completely purified the same substance that is sucrose c12h22o11 the brown and strawcolored sugars which our forefathers used and which we took to using during the war are essentially the same but have not been so completely freed from moisture and the coloring and flavoring matter of the cane juice maple sugar is mostly sucrose so partly is honey candies are made chiefly of sucrose with the addition of glucose gums or starch to give them the necessary consistency and of such colors and flavors natural or synthetic as may be desired practically all candy even the cheapest is nowadays free from deleterious ingredients in the manufacture though it is liable to become contaminated in the handling in fact sugar is about the only food that is never adulterated it would be hard to find anything cheaper to add to it that would not be easily detected sanding the sugar the crime of which grocers are generally accused is the one they are least likely to be guilty of besides the big family of sugars which are all more or less sweet similar in structure and about equally nutritious there are very curiously other chemical compounds of altogether different composition which taste like sugar but are not nutritious at all one of these is a coaltar derivative discovered accidentally by an american student of chemistry ira remsen afterward president of johns hopkins university and named by him saccharin this has the composition c6h4coso2nh and as you may observe from the symbol it contains sulfur s and nitrogen n and the benzene ring c6h4 that are not found in any of the sugars it is several hundred times sweeter than sugar though it has also a slightly bitter aftertaste a minute quantity of it can therefore take the place of a large amount of sugar in syrups candies and preserves so because it lends itself readily to deception its use in food has been prohibited in the united states and other countries but during the war on account of the shortage of sugar it came again into use the european governments encouraged what they formerly tried to prevent and it became customary in germany or italy to carry about a package of saccharin tablets in the pocket and drop one or two into the tea or coffee such reversals of administrative attitude are not uncommon when the use of hops in beer was new it was prohibited by british law but hops became customary nevertheless and now the law requires hops to be used in beer when workingmen first wanted to form unions laws were passed to prevent them but now in australia for instance the laws require workingmen to form unions governments naturally tend to a conservative reaction against anything new it is amusing to turn back to the pure food agitation of ten years ago and read the sensational articles in the newspapers about the poisonous nature of this dangerous drug saccharin in view of the fact that it is being used by millions of people in europe in amounts greater than once seemed to upset the tender stomachs of the washington poison squads but saccharin does not appear to be responsible for any fatalities yet though people are said to be heartily sick of it and well they may be for it is not a substitute for sugar except to the sense of taste glucose may correctly be called a substitute for sucrose as margarin for butter since they not only taste much the same but have about the same food value but to serve saccharin in the place of sugar is like giving a rubber bone to a dog it is reported from europe that the constant use of saccharin gives one eventually a distaste for all sweets this is quite likely although it means the reversal within a few years of prehistoric food habits mankind has always associated sweetness with food value for there are few sweet things found in nature except the sugars we think we eat sugar because it is sweet but we do not we eat it because it is good for us the reason it tastes sweet to us is because it is good for us so man makes a virtue out of necessity a pleasure out of duty which is the essence of ethics in the ancient days of ind the great raja trishanku possessed an earthly paradise that had been constructed for his delectation by a magician therein grew all manner of beautiful flowers savory herbs and delicious fruits such as had never been known before outside heaven of them all the raja and his harems liked none better than the reed from which they could suck honey but indra being a jealous god was wroth when he looked down and beheld mere mortals enjoying such delights so he willed the destruction of the enchanted garden with drought and tempest it was devastated with fire and hail until not a leaf was left of its luxuriant vegetation and the ground was bare as a threshing floor but the roots of the sugar cane are not destroyed though the stalk be cut down so when men ventured to enter the desert where once had been this garden of eden they found the cane had grown up again and they carried away cuttings of it and cultivated it in their gardens thus it happened that the nectar of the gods descended first to monarchs and their favorites then was spread among the people and carried abroad to other lands until now any child with a penny in his hand may buy of the best of it so it has been with many things so may it be with all things x what comes from corn the discovery of america dowered mankind with a world of new flora the early explorers in their haste to gather up gold paid little attention to the more valuable products of field and forest but in the course of centuries their usefulness has become universally recognized the potato and tomato which europe at first considered as unfit for food or even as poisonous have now become indispensable among all classes new world drugs like quinine and cocaine have been adopted into every pharmacopeia cocoa is proving a rival of tea and coffee and even the banana has made its appearance in european markets tobacco and chicle occupy the nostrils and jaws of a large part of the human race maize and rubber are become the common property of mankind but still may be called american the united states alone raises fourfifths of the corn and uses threefourths of the caoutchouc of the world all flesh is grass this may be taken in a dietary as well as a metaphorical sense the graminaceae provide the greater part of the sustenance of man and beast hay and cereals wheat oats rye barley rice sugar cane sorghum and corn from an american viewpoint the greatest of these physically and financially is corn the corn crop of the united states for 1917 amounting to 3159000000 bushels brought in more money than the wheat cotton potato and rye crops all together when columbus reached the west indies he found the savages playing with rubber balls smoking incense sticks of tobacco and eating cakes made of a new grain that they called mahiz when pizarro invaded peru he found this same cereal used by the natives not only for food but also for making alcoholic liquor in spite of the efforts of the incas to enforce prohibition when the pilgrim fathers penetrated into the woods back of plymouth harbor they discovered a cache of indian corn so throughout the three americas from canada to peru corn was king and it has proved worthy to rank with the rival cereals of other continents the wheat of europe and the rice of asia but food habits are hard to change and for the most part the people of the old world are still ignorant of the delights of hasty pudding and indian pudding of hoecake and hominy of sweet corn and popcorn i remember thirty years ago seeing on a london stand a heap of dejected popcorn balls labeled novel american confection please try one but nobody complied with this pitiful appeal but me and i was sorry that i did americans used to respond with a shipload of corn whenever an appeal came from famine sufferers in armenia russia ireland india or austria but their generosity was chilled when they found that their gift was resented as an insult or as an attempt to poison the impoverished population who declared that they would rather die than eat itand some of them did our department of agriculture sent maize missionaries to europe with farmers and millers as educators and expert cooks to serve free flapjacks and pones but the propaganda made little impression and today americans are urged to eat more of their own corn because the famished families of the warstricken region will not touch it just so the beggars of munich revolted at potato soup when the pioneer of american food chemists bumford attempted to introduce this transatlantic dish but here we are not so much concerned with corn foods as we are with its manufactured products if you split a kernel in two you will find that it consists of three parts a hard and horny hull on the outside a small oily and nitrogenous germ at the point and a white body consisting mostly of starch each of these is worked up into various products as may be seen from the accompanying table the hull forms bran and may be mixed with the gluten as a cattle food the corn steeped for several days with sulfurous acid is disintegrated and on being ground the germs are floated off the gluten or nitrogenous portion washed out the starch grains settled down and the residue pressed together as oil cake fodder the refined oil from the germ is marketed as a table or cooking oil under the name of mazola and comes into competition with olive peanut and cottonseed oil in the making of vegetable substitutes for lard and butter inferior grades may be used for soaps or for glycerin and perhaps nitroglycerin a bushel of corn yields a pound or more of oil from the corn germ also is extracted a gum called paragol that forms an acceptable substitute for rubber in certain uses the red rubber sponges and the eraser tips to pencils may be made of it and it can contribute some twenty per cent to the synthetic soles of shoes illustration corn products starch which constitutes fiftyfive per cent of the corn kernel can be converted into a variety of products for dietary and industrial uses as found in corn potatoes or any other vegetables starch consists of small round white hard grains tasteless and insoluble in cold water but hot water converts it into a soluble sticky form which may serve for starching clothes or making cornstarch pudding carrying the process further with the aid of a little acid or other catalyst it takes up water and goes over into a sugar dextrose commonly called glucose expressed in chemical shorthand this reaction is c6h10o5 h2o c6h12o6 starch water dextrose this reaction is carried out on forty million bushels of corn a year in the united states the starch milk that is the starch grains washed out from the disintegrated corn kernel by water is digested in large pressure tanks under fifty pounds of steam with a few tenths of one per cent of hydrochloric acid until the required degree of conversion is reached then the remaining acid is neutralized by caustic soda and thereby converted into common salt which in this small amount does not interfere but rather enhances the taste the product is the commercial glucose or corn syrup which may if desired be evaporated to a white powder it is a mixture of three derivatives of starch in about this proportion maltose 45 per cent dextrose 20 per cent dextrin 35 per cent there are also present three or fourtenths of one per cent salt and as much of the corn protein and a variable amount of water it will be noticed that the glucose dextrose which gives name to the whole is the least of the three ingredients maltose or malt sugar has the same composition as cane sugar c12h22o11 but is not nearly so sweet dextrin or starch paste is not sweet at all dextrose or glucose is otherwise known as grape sugar for it is commonly found in grapes and other ripe fruits it forms half of honey and it is one of the two products into which cane sugar splits up when we take it into the mouth it is not so sweet as cane sugar and cannot be so readily crystallized which however is not altogether a disadvantage the process of changing starch into dextrose that takes place in the great steam kettles of the glucose factory is essentially the same as that which takes place in the ripening of fruit and in the digestion of starch a large part of our nutriment therefore consists of glucose either eaten as such in ripe fruits or produced in the mouth or stomach by the decomposition of the starch of unripe fruit vegetables and cereals glucose may be regarded as a predigested food in spite of this wellknown fact we still sometimes read poor food articles in which glucose is denounced as a dangerous adulterant and even classed as a poison the other ingredients of commercial glucose the maltose and dextrin have of course the same food value as the dextrose since they are made over into dextrose in the process of digestion whether the glucose syrup is fit to eat depends like anything else on how it is made if as was formerly sometimes the case sulfuric acid was used to effect the conversion of the starch or sulfurous acid to bleach the glucose and these acids were not altogether eliminated the product might be unwholesome or worse some years ago in england there was a mysterious epidemic of arsenical poisoning among beer drinkers on tracing it back it was found that the beer had been made from glucose which had been made from sulfuric acid which had been made from sulfur which had been made from a batch of iron pyrites which contained a little arsenic the replacement of sulfuric acid by hydrochloric has done away with that danger and the glucose now produced is pure the old recipe for homemade candy called for the addition of a little vinegar to the sugar syrup to prevent graining the purpose of the acid was of course to invert part of the cane sugar to glucose so as to keep it from crystallizing out again the professional candymaker now uses the corn glucose for that purpose so if we accuse him of adulteration on that ground we must levy the same accusation against our grandmothers the introduction of glucose into candy manufacture has not injured but greatly increased the sale of sugar for the same purpose this is not an uncommon effect of scientific progress for as we have observed the introduction of synthetic perfumes has stimulated the production of odoriferous flowers and the price of butter has gone up with the introduction of margarin so too there are more weavers employed and they get higher wages than in the days when they smashed up the first weaving machines and the same is true of printers and typesetting machines the popular animosity displayed toward any new achievement of applied science is never justified for it benefits not only the world as a whole but usually even those interests with which it seems at first to conflict the chemist is an economizer it is his special business to hunt up waste products and make them useful he was for instance worried over the waste of the cores and skins and scraps that were being thrown away when apples were put up apple pulp contains pectin which is what makes jelly jell and berries and fruits that are short of it will refuse to jell but using these for their flavor he adds apple pulp for pectin and glucose for smoothness and sugar for sweetness and if necessary synthetic dyes for color he is able to put on the market a variety of jellies jams and marmalades at very low price the same principle applies here as in the case of all compounded food products if they are made in cleanly fashion contain no harmful ingredients and are truthfully labeled there is no reason for objecting to them but if the manufacturer goes so far as to put strawberry seedsor hayseedinto his artificial strawberry jam i think that might properly be called adulteration for it is imitating the imperfections of nature and man ought to be too proud to do that the oldfashioned open kettle molasses consisted mostly of glucose and other invert sugars together with such cane sugar as could not be crystallized out but when the vacuum pan was introduced the molasses was impoverished of its sweetness and beet sugar does not yield any molasses so we now have in its place the corn syrups consisting of about 85 per cent of glucose and 15 per cent of sugar flavored with maple or vanillin or whatever we like it is encouraging to see the bill boards proclaiming the virtues of karo syrup and mazola oil when only a few years ago the products of our national cereal were without honor in their own country many other products besides foods are made from corn starch dextrin serves in place of the old gum arabic for the mucilage of our envelopes and stamps another form of dextrin sold as kordex is used to hold together the sand of the cores of castings after the casting has been made the scorched core can be shaken out glucose is used in place of sugar as a filler for cheap soaps and for leather altogether more than a hundred different commercial products are now made from corn not counting cob pipes every year the factories of the united states work up over 50000000 bushels of corn into 800000000 pounds of corn syrup 600000000 pounds of starch 230000000 pounds of corn sugar 625000000 pounds of gluten feed 90000000 pounds of oil and 90000000 pounds of oil cake two million bushels of cobs are wasted every year in the united states cant something be made out of them this is the question that is agitating the chemists of the carbohydrate laboratory of the department of agriculture at washington they have found it possible to work up the corn cobs into glucose and xylose by heating with acid but glucose can be more cheaply obtained from other starchy or woody materials and they cannot find a market for the xylose this is a sort of a sugar but only about half as sweet as that from cane who can invent a use for it more promising is the discovery by this laboratory that by digesting the cobs with hot water there can be extracted about 30 per cent of a gum suitable for bill posting and labeling since the starches and sugars belong to the same class of compounds as the celluloses they also can be acted upon by nitric acid with the production of explosives like guncotton nitrosugar has not come into common use but nitrostarch is found to be one of safest of the high explosives on account of the danger of decomposition and spontaneous explosion from the presence of foreign substances the materials in explosives must be of the purest possible it was formerly thought that tapioca must be imported from java for making nitrostarch but during the war when shipping was short the war department found that it could be made better and cheaper from our homegrown corn starch when the war closed the united states was making 1720000 pounds of nitrostarch a month for loading hand grenades so too the post office department discovered that it could use mucilage made of corn dextrin as well as that which used to be made from tapioca this is progress in the right direction it would be well to divert some of the energetic efforts now devoted to the increase of commerce to the discovery of ways of reducing the need for commerce by the development of home products there is no merit in simply hauling things around the world in the last chapter we saw how dextrose or glucose could be converted by fermentation into alcohol since corn starch as we have seen can be converted into dextrose it can serve as a source of alcohol this was in fact one of the earliest misuses to which corn was put and before the war put a stop to it 34000000 bushels went into the making of whiskey in the united states every year not counting the moonshiners output but even though we left off drinking whiskey the distillers could still thrive mars is more thirsty than bacchus the output of whiskey denatured for industrial purposes is more than three times what is was before the war and the price has risen from 30 cents a gallon to 67 cents this may make it profitable to utilize sugars starches and cellulose that formerly were out of the question according to the calculations of the forest products laboratory of madison it costs from 37 to 44 cents a gallon to make alcohol from corn but it may be made from sawdust at a cost of from 14 to 20 cents this is not wood alcohol that is methyl alcohol ch4o such as is made by the destructive distillation of wood but genuine grain alcohol ethyl alcohol c2h6o such as is made by the fermentation of glucose or other sugar the first step in the process is to digest the sawdust or chips with dilute sulfuric acid under heat and pressure this converts the cellulose wood fiber in large part into glucose corn sugar which may be extracted by hot water in a diffusion battery as in extracting the sugar from beet chips this glucose solution may then be fermented by yeast and the resulting alcohol distilled off the process is perfectly practicable but has yet to be proved profitable but the sulfite liquors of the paper mills are being worked up successfully into industrial alcohol the rapidly approaching exhaustion of our oil fields which the war has accelerated leads us to look around to see what we can get to take the place of gasoline one of the most promising of the suggested substitutes is alcohol the united states is exceptionally rich in mineral oil but some countries for instance england germany france and australia have little or none the australian advisory council of science called to consider the problem recommends alcohol for stationary engines and motor cars alcohol has the disadvantage of being less volatile than gasoline so it is hard to start up the engine from the cold but the lower volatility and ignition point of alcohol are an advantage in that it can be put under a pressure of 150 pounds to the square inch a pound of gasoline contains fifty per cent more potential energy than a pound of alcohol but since the alcohol vapor can be put under twice the compression of the gasoline and requires only onethird the amount of air the thermal efficiency of an alcohol engine may be fifty per cent higher than that of a gasoline engine alcohol also has several other conveniences that can count in its favor in the case of incomplete combustion the cylinders are less likely to be clogged with carbon and the escaping gases do not have the offensive odor of the gasoline smoke alcohol does not ignite so easily as gasoline and the fire is more readily put out for water thrown upon blazing alcohol dilutes it and puts out the flame while gasoline floats on water and the fire is spread by it it is possible to increase the inflammability of alcohol by mixing with it some hydrocarbon such as gasoline benzene or acetylene in the taylorwhite process the vapor from lowgrade alcohol containing 17 per cent water is passed over calcium carbide this takes out the water and adds acetylene gas making a suitable mixture for an internal combustion engine alcohol can be made from anything of a starchy sugary or woody nature that is from the main substance of all vegetation if we start with wood cellulose we convert it first into sugar glucose and of course we could stop here and use it for food instead of carrying it on into alcohol this provides one factor of our food the carbohydrate but by growing the yeast plants on glucose and feeding them with nitrates made from the air we can get the protein and fat so it is quite possible to live on sawdust although it would be too expensive a diet for anybody but a millionaire and he would not enjoy it glucose has been made from formaldehyde and this in turn made from carbon hydrogen and oxygen so the synthetic production of food from the elements is not such an absurdity as it was thought when berthelot suggested it half a century ago the first step in the making of alcohol is to change the starch over into sugar this transformation is effected in the natural course of sprouting by which the insoluble starch stored up in the seed is converted into the soluble glucose for the sap of the growing plant this malting process is that mainly made use of in the production of alcohol from grain but there are other ways of effecting the change it may be done by heating with acid as we have seen or according to a method now being developed the final conversion may be accomplished by mold instead of malt in applying this method known as the amylo process to corn the meal is mixed with twice its weight of water acidified with hydrochloric acid and steamed the mash is then cooled down somewhat diluted with sterilized water and innoculated with the mucor filaments as the mash molds the starch is gradually changed over to glucose and if this is the product desired the process may be stopped at this point but if alcohol is wanted yeast is added to ferment the sugar by keeping it alkaline and treating with the proper bacteria a high yield of glycerin can be obtained in the fermentation process for making alcoholic liquors a little glycerin is produced as a byproduct glycerin otherwise called glycerol is intermediate between sugar and alcohol its molecule contains three carbon atoms while glucose has six and alcohol two it is possible to increase the yield of glycerin if desired by varying the form of fermentation this was desired most earnestly in germany during the war for the british blockade shut off the importation of the fats and oils from which the germans extracted the glycerin for their nitroglycerin under pressure of this necessity they worked out a process of getting glycerin in quantity from sugar and news of this being brought to this country by dr alonzo taylor the united states treasury department set up a special laboratory to work out this problem john r eoff and other chemists working in this laboratory succeeded in getting a yield of twenty per cent of glycerin by fermenting black strap molasses or other syrup with california wine yeast during the fermentation it is necessary to neutralize the acetic acid formed with sodium or calcium carbonate it was estimated that glycerin could be made from waste sugars at about a quarter of its wartime cost but it is doubtful whether the process would be profitable at normal prices we can if we like dispense with either yeast or bacteria in the production of glycerin glucose syrup suspended in oil under steam pressure with finely divided nickel as a catalyst and treated with nascent hydrogen will take up the hydrogen and be converted into glycerin but the yield is poor and the process expensive food serves substantially the same purpose in the body as fuel in the engine it provides the energy for work the carbohydrates that is the sugars starches and celluloses can all be used as fuels and can alleven as we have seen the cellulosebe used as foods the final products water and carbon dioxide are in both cases the same and necessarily therefore the amount of energy produced is the same in the body as in the engine corn is a good example of the equivalence of the two sources of energy there are few better foods and no better fuels i can remember the good old days in kansas when we had corn to burn it was both an economy and a luxury forat ten cents a bushelit was cheaper than coal or wood and preferable to either at any price the long yellow ears each wrapped in its own kindling could be handled without crocking the fingers each kernel as it crackled sent out a blazing jet of oil and the cobs left a fine bed of coals for the corn popper to be shaken over driftwood and the pyrotechnic fuel they make now by soaking sticks in strontium and copper salts cannot compare with the oldfashioned cornfed fire in beauty and the power of evoking visions doubtless such luxury would be condemned as wicked nowadays but those who have known the calorific value of corn would find it hard to abandon it altogether and i fancy that the western farmers wife when she has an extra batch of baking to do will still steal a few ears from the crib xi solidified sunshine all life and all that life accomplishes depend upon the supply of solar energy stored in the form of food the chief sources of this vital energy are the fats and the sugars the former contain two and a quarter times the potential energy of the latter both when completely purified consist of nothing but carbon hydrogen and oxygen elements that are to be found freely everywhere in air and water so when the sunny southland exports fats and oils starches and sugar it is then sending away nothing material but what comes back to it in the next wind what it is sending to the regions of more slanting sunshine is merely some of the surplus of the radiant energy it has received so abundantly compacted for convenience into a portable and edible form in previous chapters i have dealt with some of the uses of cotton its employment for cloth for paper for artificial fibers for explosives and for plastics but i have ignored the thing that cotton is attached to and for which in the economy of nature the fibers are formed that is the seed it is as though i had described the aeroplane and ignored the aviator whom it was designed to carry but in this neglect i am but following the example of the human race which for three thousand years used the fiber but made no use of the seed except to plant the next crop just as mankind is now divided into the two great classes the wheateaters and the riceeaters so the ancient world was divided into the woolwearers and the cottonwearers the people of india wore cotton the europeans wore wool when the greeks under alexander fought their way to the far east they were surprised to find wool growing on trees later travelers returning from cathay told of the same marvel and travelers who stayed at home and wrote about what they had not seen like sir john maundeville misunderstood these reports and elaborated a legend of a tree that bore live lambs as fruit here for instance is how a french poetical botanist delacroix described it in 1791 as translated from his latin verse upon a stalk is fixed a living brute a rooted plant bears quadruped for fruit it has a fleece nor does it want for eyes and from its brows two wooly horns arise the rude and simple country people say it is an animal that sleeps by day and wakes at night though rooted to the ground to feed on grass within its reach around but modern commerce broke down the barrier between east and west a new cotton country the best in the world was discovered in america cotton invaded england and after a hard fight with fists as well as finance wool was beaten in its chief stronghold cotton became king and the woolsack in the house of lords lost its symbolic significance still twothirds of the cotton crop the seed was wasted and it is only within the last fifty years that methods of using it have been developed to any extent the cotton crop of the united states for 1917 amounted to about 11000000 bales of 500 pounds each when the great war broke out and no cotton could be exported to germany and little to england the south was in despair for cotton went down to five or six cents a pound the national government regardless of states rights was called upon for aid and everybody was besought to buy a bale those who responded to this patriotic appeal were well rewarded for cotton rose as the war went on and sold at twentynine cents a pound illustration products and uses of cottonseed but the chemist has added some 150000000 a year to the value of the crop by discovering ways of utilizing the cottonseed that used to be thrown away or burned as fuel the genealogical table of the progeny of the cottonseed herewith printed will give some idea of their variety if you will examine a cottonseed you will see first that there is a fine fuzz of cotton fiber sticking to it these linters can be removed by machinery and used for any purpose where length of fiber is not essential for instance they may be nitrated as described in previous articles and used for making smokeless powder or celluloid on cutting open the seed you will observe that it consists of an oily mealy kernel encased in a thin brown hull the hulls amounting to 700 or 900 pounds in a ton of seed were formerly burned now however they bring from 4 to 10 a ton because they can be ground up into cattlefeed or paper stock or used as fertilizer the kernel of the cottonseed on being pressed yields a yellow oil and leaves a mealy cake this last mixed with the hulls makes a good fodder for fattening cattle also adding twentyfive per cent of the refined cottonseed meal to our war bread made it more nutritious and no less palatable cottonseed meal contains about forty per cent of protein and is therefore a highly concentrated and very valuable feeding stuff before the war we were exporting nearly half a million tons of cottonseed meal to europe chiefly to germany and denmark where it is used for dairy cows the british yeoman his countrys pride has not yet been won over to the use of any such newfangled fodder and consequently the british manufacturer could not compete with his continental rivals in the seedcrushing business for he could not dispose of his mealcake byproduct as did they illustration photo by press illustrating service cottonseed oil as it is squeezed from the seed by the presses illustration photo by press illustrating service cottonseed oil as it comes from the compressors flowing out of the faucets when cold it is firm and white like lard let us now turn to the most valuable of the cottonseed products the oil the seed contains about twenty per cent of oil most of which can be squeezed out of the hot seeds by hydraulic pressure it comes out as a red liquid of a disagreeable odor this is decolorized deodorized and otherwise purified in various ways by treatment with alkalies or acids by blowing air and steam through it by shaking up with fullers earth by settling and filtering the refined product is a yellow oil suitable for table use formerly on account of the popular prejudice against any novel food products it used to masquerade as olive oil now however it boldly competes with its ancient rival in the lands of the olive tree and america ships some 700000 barrels of cottonseed oil a year to the mediterranean the turkish government tried to check the spread of cottonseed oil by calling it an adulterant and prohibiting its mixture with olive oil the result was that the sale of turkish olive oil fell off because people found its flavor too strong when undiluted italy imports cottonseed oil and exports her olive oil denmark imports cottonseed meal and margarine and exports her butter northern nations are accustomed to hard fats and do not take to oils for cooking or table use as do the southerners butter and lard are preferred to olive oil and ghee but this does not rule out cottonseed it can be combined with the hard fats of animal or vegetable origin in margarine or it may itself be hardened by hydrogen to understand this interesting reaction which is profoundly affecting international relations it will be necessary to dip into the chemistry of the subject here are the symbols of the chief ingredients of the fats and oils please look at them linoleic acid c18h32o2 oleic acid c18h34o2 stearic acid c18h36o2 dont skip these because you have not studied chemistry thats why i am giving them to you if you had studied chemistry you would know them without my telling just examine them and you will discover the secret you will see that all three are composed of the same elements carbon hydrogen and oxygen notice next the number of atoms in each element as indicated by the little low figures on the right of each letter you observe that all three contain the same number of atoms of carbon and oxygen but differ in the amount of hydrogen this trifling difference in composition makes a great difference in behavior the less the hydrogen the lower the melting point or to say the same thing in other words fatty substances low in hydrogen are apt to be liquids and those with a full complement of hydrogen atoms are apt to be solids at the ordinary temperature of the air it is common to call the former oils and the latter fats but that implies too great a dissimilarity for the distinction depends on whether we are living in the tropics or the arctic it is better therefore to lump them all together and call them soft fats and hard fats respectively fats of the third order the stearic group are called saturated because they have taken up all the hydrogen they can hold fats of the other two groups are called unsaturated the first which have the least hydrogen are the most eager for more if hydrogen is not handy they will take up other things for instance oxygen linseed oil which consists largely as the name implies of linoleic acid will absorb oxygen on exposure to the air and become hard that is why it is used in painting such oils are called drying oils although the hardening process is not really drying since they contain no water but is oxidation the semidrying oils those that will harden somewhat on exposure to the air include the oils of cottonseed corn sesame soy bean and castor bean olive oil and peanut oil are nondrying and contain oleic compounds olein the hard fats such as stearin palmitin and margarin are mostly of animal origin tallow and lard though coconut and palm oil contain a large proportion of such saturated compounds though the chemist talks of the fatty acids nobody else would call them so because they are not sour but they do behave like the acids in forming salts with bases the alkali salts of the fatty acids are known to us as soaps in the natural fats they exist not as free acids but as salts of an organic base glycerin as i explained in a previous chapter the natural fats and oils consist of complex mixtures of the glycerin compounds of these acids known as olein stearin etc as well as various others of a similar sort if you will set a bottle of salad oil in the icebox you will see it separate into two parts the white crystalline solid that separates out is largely stearin the part that remains liquid is largely olein you might separate them by filtering it cold and if then you tried to sell the two products you would find that the hard fat would bring a higher price than the oil either for food or soap if you tried to keep them you would find that the hard fat kept neutral and sweet longer than the other you may remember that the perfumes as well as their odorous opposites were mostly unsaturated compounds so we find that it is the free and unsaturated fatty acids that cause butter and oil to become rank and rancid obviously then we could make money if we could turn soft unsaturated fats like olein into hard saturated fats like stearin referring to the symbols we see that all that is needed to effect the change is to get the former to unite with hydrogen this requires a little coaxing the coaxer is called a catalyst a catalyst as i have previously explained is a substance that by its mere presence causes the union of two other substances that might otherwise remain separate for that reason the catalyst is referred to as a chemical parson finely divided metals have a strong catalytic action platinum sponge is excellent but too expensive so in this case nickel is used a nickel salt mixed with charcoal or pumice is reduced to the metallic state by heating in a current of hydrogen then it is dropped into the tank of oil and hydrogen gas is blown through the hydrogen may be obtained by splitting water into its two components hydrogen and oxygen by means of the electrical current or by passing steam over spongy iron which takes out the oxygen the stream of hydrogen blown through the hot oil converts the linoleic acid to oleic and then the oleic into stearic if you figured up the weights from the symbols given above you would find that it takes about one pound of hydrogen to convert a hundred pounds of olein to stearin and the cost is only about one cent a pound the nickel is unchanged and is easily separated a trace of nickel may remain in the product but as it is very much less than the amount dissolved when food is cooked in nickelplated vessels it cannot be regarded as harmful even more unsaturated fats may be hydrogenated fish oil has hitherto been almost unusable because of its powerful and persistent odor this is chiefly due to a fatty acid which properly bears the uneuphonious name of clupanodonic acid and has the composition of c18h28o2 by comparing this with the symbol of the odorless stearic acid c18h36o2 you will see that all the rank fish oil lacks to make it respectable is eight hydrogen atoms a japanese chemist tsujimoto has discovered how to add them and now the reformed fish oil under the names of talgol and candelite serves for lubricant and even enters higher circles as a soap or food this process of hardening fats by hydrogenation resulted from the experiments of a french chemist professor sabatier of toulouse in the last years of the last century but as in many other cases the germans were the first to take it up and profit by it before the war the copra or coconut oil from the british asiatic colonies of india ceylon and malaya went to germany at the rate of 15000000 a year the palm kernels grown in british west africa were shipped not to liverpool but to hamburg 19000000 worth annually here the oil was pressed out and used for margarin and the residual cake used for feeding cows produced butter or for feeding hogs produced lard half of the copra raised in the british possessions was sent to germany and half of the oil from it was resold to the british margarin candle and soap makers at a handsome profit the british chemists were not blind to this but they could do nothing first because the english politician was wedded to free trade second because the english farmer would not use oil cake for his stock france was in a similar situation marseilles produced 15500000 gallons of oil from peanuts grown largely in the french african coloniesbut shipped the oilcake on to hamburg meanwhile the germans in pursuit of their policy of attaining economic independence were striving to develop their own tropical territory the subjects of king george who because they had the misfortune to live in india were excluded from the british south african dominions or mistreated when they did come were invited to come to german east africa and set to raising peanuts in rivalry to french senegal and british coromandel before the war germany got half of the egyptian cottonseed and half of the philippine copra that is one of the reasons why german warships tried to check dewey at manila in 1898 and german troops tried to conquer egypt in 1915 but the tide of war set the other way and the german plantations of palmnuts and peanuts in africa have come into british possession and now the british government is starting an educational campaign to teach their farmers to feed oil cake like the germans and their people to eat peanuts like the americans the germans shut off from the tropical fats supply were hard up for food and for soap for lubricants and for munitions every person was given a fat card that reduced his weekly allowance to the minimum millers were required to remove the germs from their cereals and deliver them to the war department children were set to gathering horsechestnuts elderberries lindenballs grape seeds cherry stones and sunflower heads for these contain from six to twenty per cent of oil even the bluebottle flyhitherto an idle creature for whom beelzebub found mischiefwas conscripted into the national service and set to laying eggs by the billion on fish refuse within a few days there is a crop of larvae which to quote the chemische zentralblatt yields fortyfive grams per kilogram of a yellow oil this product we should hope is used for axlegrease and nitroglycerin although properly purified it would be as nutritious as any otherto one who has no imagination driven to such straits germany would have given a good deal for one of those tropical islands that we are so careless about it might have been supposed that since the united states possessed the best land in the world for the production of cottonseed coconuts peanuts and corn that it would have led all other countries in the utilization of vegetable oils for food that this country has not so used its advantage is due to the fact that the new products have not merely had to overcome popular conservatism ignorance and prejudicehard things to fight in any casebut have been deliberately checked and hampered by the state and national governments in defense of vested interests the farmer vote is a power that no politician likes to defy and the dairy business in every state was thoroughly organized in new york the oleomargarin industry that in 1879 was turning out products valued at more than 5000000 a year was completely crushed out by state legislation2 the output of the united states which in 1902 had risen to 126000000 pounds was cut down to 43000000 pounds in 1909 by federal legislation according to the disingenuous custom of american lawmakers the act of 1902 was passed through congress as a revenue measure although it meant a loss to the government of more than three million dollars a year over what might be produced by a straight two cents a pound tax a wholesale dealer in oleomargarin was made to pay a higher license than a wholesale liquor dealer the federal law put a tax of ten cents a pound on yellow oleomargarin and a quarter of a cent a pound on the uncolored but peopledoubtless from pure prejudiceprefer a yellow spread for their bread so the economical housewife has to work over her oleomargarin with the annatto which is given to her when she buys a package or if the law prohibits this which she is permitted to steal from an open box on the grocers counter a plausible pretext for such legislation is afforded by the fact that the butter substitutes are so much like butter that they cannot be easily distinguished from it unless the use of annatto is permitted to butter and prohibited to its competitors fradulent sales of substitutes of any kind ought to be prevented but the recent pure food legislation in america has shown that it is possible to secure truthful labeling without resorting to such drastic measures in europe the laws against substitution were very strict but not devised to restrict the industry consequently the margarin output of germany doubled in the five years preceding the war and the output of england tripled in denmark the consumption of margarin rose from 88 pounds per capita in 1890 to 326 pounds in 1912 yet the butter business denmarks pride was not injured and germany and england imported more butter than ever before now that the price of butter in america has gone over the seventyfive cent mark congress may conclude that it no longer needs to be protected against competition the compound lards or lard compounds consisting usually of cottonseed oil and oleostearin although the latter may now be replaced by hardened oil met with the same popular prejudice and attempted legislative interference but succeeded more easily in coming into common use under such names as cottosuet kream krisp kuxit korno cottolene and crisco oleomargarin now generally abbreviated to margarin originated like many other inventions in military necessity the french government in 1869 offered a prize for a butter substitute for the army that should be cheaper and better than butter in that it did not spoil so easily the prize was won by a french chemist mgemouries who found that by chilling beef fat the solid stearin could be separated from an oil oleo which was the substantially same as that in milk and hence in butter neutral lard acts the same this discovery of how to separate the hard and soft fats was followed by improved methods for purifying them and later by the process for converting the soft into the hard fats by hydrogenation the net result was to put into the hands of the chemist the ability to draw his materials at will from any land and from the vegetable and animal kingdoms and to combine them as he will to make new fat foods for every use hard for summer soft for winter solid for the northerners and liquid for the southerners white yellow or any other color and flavored to suit the taste the hindu can eat no fat from the sacred cow the mohammedan and the jew can eat no fat from the abhorred pig the vegetarian will touch neither other people will take both no matter all can be accommodated all the fats and oils though they consist of scores of different compounds have practically the same food value when freed from the extraneous matter that gives them their characteristic flavors they are all practically tasteless and colorless the various vegetable and animal oils and fats have about the same digestibility 98 per cent3 and are all ordinarily completely utilized in the body supplying it with two and a quarter times as much energy as any other food it does not follow however that there is no difference in the products the margarin men accuse butter of harboring tuberculosis germs from which their product because it has been heated or is made from vegetable fats is free the butter men retort that margarin is lacking in vitamines those mysterious substances which in minute amounts are necessary for life and especially for growth both the claim and the objection lose a large part of their force where the margarin as is customarily the case is mixed with butter or churned up with milk to give it the familiar flavor but the difficulty can be easily overcome the milk used for either butter or margarin should be free or freed from disease germs if margarin is altogether substituted for butter the necessary vitamines may be sufficiently provided by milk eggs and greens owing to these new processes all the fatty substances of all lands have been brought into competition with each other in such a contest the vegetable is likely to beat the animal and the southern to win over the northern zones in europe before the war the proportion of the various ingredients used to make butter substitutes was as follows average composition of european margarin per cent animal hard fats 25 vegetable hard fats 35 copra 29 palmkernel 6 vegetable soft fats 26 cottonseed 13 peanut 6 sesame 6 soyabean 1 water milk salt 14 100 this is not the composition of any particular brand but the average of them all the use of a certain amount of the oil of the sesame seed is required by the laws of germany and denmark because it can be easily detected by a chemical color test and so serves to prevent the margarin containing it from being sold as butter open sesame is the password to these markets remembering that margarin originally was made up entirely of animal fats soft and hard we can see from the above figures how rapidly they are being displaced by the vegetable fats the cottonseed and peanut oils have replaced the original oleo oil and the tropical oils from the coconut copra and african palm are crowding out the animal hard fats since now we can harden at will any of the vegetable oils it is possible to get along altogether without animal fats such vegetable margarins were originally prepared for sale in india but proved unexpectedly popular in europe and are now being introduced into america they are sold under various trade names suggesting their origin such as palmira palmona milkonut cocose coconut oleomargarin and nucoa nut margarin the last named is stated to be made of coconut oil for the hard fat and peanut oil for the soft fat churned up with a culture of pasteurized milk to impart the butter flavor the law requires such a product to be branded oleomargarine although it is not such cases of compulsory mislabeling are not rare you remember the pigs is pigs story peanut butter has won its way into the american menu without any camouflage whatever and as a salad oil it is almost equally frank about its lowly origin this nut which grows on a vine instead of a tree and is dug from the ground like potatoes instead of being picked with a pole goes by various names according to locality peanuts groundnuts monkeynuts arachides and goobers as it takes the place of cotton oil in some of its products so it takes its place in the fields and oilmills of texas left vacant by the bollweevil the once despised peanut added some 56000000 to the wealth of the south in 1916 the peanut is rich in the richest of foods some 50 per cent of oil and 30 per cent of protein the latter can be worked up into meat substitutes that will make the vegetarian cease to envy his omnivorous neighbor thanks largely to the chemist who has opened these new fields of usefulness the peanutraiser got 125 a bushel in 1917 instead of the 30 cents that he got four years before it would be impossible to enumerate all the available sources of vegetable oils for all seeds and nuts contain more or less fatty matter and as we become more economical we shall utilize of what we now throw away the germ of the corn kernel once discarded in the manufacture of starch now yields a popular table oil from tomato seeds one of the waste products of the canning factory can be extracted 22 per cent of an edible oil oats contain 7 per cent of oil from rape seed the japanese get 20000 tons of oil a year to the sources previously mentioned may be added pumpkin seeds poppy seeds raspberry seeds tobacco seeds cockleburs hazelnuts walnuts beechnuts and acorns the oilbearing seeds of the tropics are innumerable and will become increasingly essential to the inhabitants of northern lands it was the realization of this that brought on the struggle of the great powers for the possession of tropical territory which for years before they did not think worth while raising a flag over no country in the future can consider itself safe unless it has secure access to such sources we had a sharp lesson in this during the war palm oil it seems is necessary for the manufacture of tinplate an industry that was built up in the united states by the mckinley tariff the british possessions in west africa were the chief source of palm oil and the germans had the handling of it during the war the british government assumed control of the palm oil products of the british and german colonies and prohibited their export to other countries than england americans protested and beseeched but in vain the british held quite correctly that they needed all the oil they could get for food and lubrication and nitroglycerin but the british also needed canned meat from america for their soldiers and when it was at length brought to their attention that the packers could not ship meat unless they had cans and that cans could not be made without tin and that tin could not be made without palm oil the british government consented to let us buy a little of their palm oil the lesson is that of voltaires story candide let us cultivate our own gardenand plant a few palm trees in italso rubber trees but that is another story the international struggle for oil led to the partition of the pacific as the struggle for rubber led to the partition of africa theodor weber as stevenson says harried the samoans to get copra much as king leopold of belgium harried the congoese to get caoutchouc it was weber who first fully realized that the south sea islands formerly given over to cannibals pirates and missionaries might be made immensely valuable through the cultivation of the coconut palms when the ripe coconut is split open and exposed to the sun the meat dries up and shrivels and in this form called copra it can be cut out and shipped to the factory where the oil is extracted and refined weber while german consul in samoa was also manager of what was locally known as the longhandled concern deutsche handels und plantagen gesellschaft der sdsee inseln zu hamburg a pioneer commercial and semiofficial corporation that played a part in the pacific somewhat like the british hudson bay company in canada or east india company in hindustan through the agency of this corporation on the start germany acquired a virtual monopoly of the transportation and refining of coconut oil and would have become the dominant power in the pacific if she had not been checked by force of arms in apia bay in 1889 and again in manila bay in 1898 an american fleet faced a german fleet ready for action while a british warship lay between so we rescued the philippines and samoa from german rule and in 1914 german power was eliminated from the pacific during the ten years before the war the production of copra in the german islands more than doubled and this was only the beginning of the business now these islands have been divided up among australia new zealand and japan and these countries are planning to take care of the copra but although we get no extension of territory from the war we still have the philippines and some of the samoan islands and these are capable of great development from her share of the samoan islands germany got a million dollars worth of copra and we might get more from ours the philippines now lead the world in the production of copra but java is a close second and ceylon not far behind if we do not look out we will be beaten both by the dutch and the british for they are undertaking the cultivation of the coconut on a larger scale and in a more systematic way according to an official bulletin of the philippine government a coconut plantation should bring in dividends ranging from 10 to 75 per cent from the tenth to the hundredth year and this being printed in 1913 figured the price of copra at 312 cents whereas it brought 412 cents in 1918 so the prospect is still more encouraging the copra is half fat and can be cheaply shipped to america where it can be crushed in the southern oilmills when they are not busy on cottonseed or peanuts but even this cost of transportation can be reduced by extracting the oil in the islands and shipping it in bulk like petroleum in tank steamers in the year ending june 1918 the united states imported from the philippines 155000000 pounds of coconut oil worth 18000000 and 220000000 pounds of copra worth 10000000 but this was about half our total importations the rest of it we had to get from foreign countries panama palms may give us a little relief from this dependence on foreign sources in 1917 we imported 19000000 whole coconuts from panama valued at 700000 illustration splitting coconuts on the island of tahiti after drying in the sun the meat is picked and the oil extracted for making coconut butter illustration from americas munitions the electric current passing through salt water in these cells decomposes the salt into caustic soda and chlorine gas there were eight rooms like this in the edgewood plant capable of producing 200000 pounds of chlorine a day a new form of fat that has rapidly come into our market is the oil of the soya or soy bean in 1918 we imported over 300000000 pounds of soybean oil mostly from manchuria the oil is used in manufacture of substitutes for butter lard cheese milk and cream as well as for soap and paint the soybean can be raised in the united states wherever corn can be grown and provides provender for man and beast the soy meal left after the extraction of the oil makes a good cattle food and the fermented juice affords the shoya sauce made familiar to us through the popularity of the chopsuey restaurants as meat and dairy products become scarcer and dearer we shall become increasingly dependent upon the vegetable fats we should therefore devise means of saving what we now throw away raise as much as we can under our own flag keep open avenues for our foreign supply and encourage our cooks to make use of the new products invented by our chemists chapter xii fighting with fumes the germans opened the war using projectiles seventeen inches in diameter they closed it using projectiles one onehundred millionth of an inch in diameter and the latter were more effective than the former as the dimensions were reduced from molar to molecular the battle became more intense for when the big bertha had shot its bolt that was the end of it whomever it hit was hurt but after that the steel fragments of the shell lay on the ground harmless and inert the men in the dugouts could hear the shells whistle overhead without alarm but the poison gas could penetrate where the rifle ball could not the malignant molecules seemed to search out their victims they crept through the crevices of the subterranean shelters they hunted for the pinholes in the face masks they lay in wait for days in the trenches for the soldiers return as a cat watches at the hole of a mouse the cannon ball could be seen and heard the poison gas was invisible and inaudible and sometimes even the chemical sense which nature has given man for his protection the sense of smell failed to give warning of the approach of the foe the smaller the matter that man can deal with the more he can get out of it so long as man was dependent for power upon wind and water his working capacity was very limited but as soon as he passed over the border line from physics into chemistry and learned how to use the molecule his efficiency in work and warfare was multiplied manifold the molecular bombardment of the piston by steam or the gases of combustion runs his engines and propels his cars the first man who wanted to kill another from a safe distance threw the stone by his arms strength david added to his arm the centrifugal force of a sling when he slew goliath the romans improved on this by concentrating in a catapult the strength of a score of slaves and casting stone cannon balls to the top of the city wall but finally man got closer to natures secret and discovered that by loosing a swarm of gaseous molecules he could throw his projectile seventyfive miles and then by the same force burst it into flying fragments there is no smaller projectile than the atom unless our belligerent chemists can find a way of using the electron stream of the cathode ray but this so far has figured only in the pages of our scientific romancers and has not yet appeared on the battlefield if however man could tap the reservoir of subatomic energy he need do no more work and would make no more war for unlimited powers of construction and destruction would be at his command the forces of the infinitesimal are infinite the reason why a gas is so active is because it is so egoistic psychologically interpreted a gas consists of particles having the utmost aversion to one another each tries to get as far away from every other as it can there is no cohesive force no attractive impulse nothing to draw them together except the all too feeble power of gravitation the hotter they get the more they try to disperse and so the gas expands the gas represents the extreme of individualism as steel represents the extreme of collectivism the combination of the two works wonders a hot gas in a steel cylinder is the most powerful agency known to man and by means of it he accomplishes his greatest achievements in peace or war time the projectile is thrown from the gun by the expansive force of the gases released from the powder and when it reaches its destination it is blown to pieces by the same force this is the end of it if it is a shell of the oldfashioned sort for the gases of combustion mingle harmlessly with the air of which they are normal constituents but if it is a poison gas shell each molecule as it is released goes off straight into the air with a speed twice that of the cannon ball and carries death with it a man may be hit by a heavy piece of lead or iron and still survive but an unweighable amount of lethal gas may be fatal to him most of the novelties of the war were merely extensions of what was already known to increase the caliber of a cannon from 38 to 42 centimeters or its range from 30 to 75 miles does indeed make necessary a decided change in tactics but it is not comparable to the revolution effected by the introduction of new weapons of unprecedented power such as airplanes submarines tanks high explosives or poison gas if any army had been as well equipped with these in the beginning as all armies were at the end it might easily have won the war that is to say if the general staff of any of the powers had had the foresight and confidence to develop and practise these modes of warfare on a large scale in advance it would have been irresistible against an enemy unprepared to meet them but no military genius appeared on either side with sufficient courage and imagination to work out such schemes in secret before trying them out on a small scale in the open consequently the enemy had fair warning and ample time to learn how to meet them and methods of defense developed concurrently with methods of attack for instance consider the motor fortresses to which ludendorff ascribes his defeat the british first sent out a few clumsy tanks against the german lines then they set about making a lot of stronger and livelier ones but by the time these were ready the germans had field guns to smash them and chain fences with concrete posts to stop them on the other hand if the germans had followed up their advantage when they first set the cloud of chlorine floating over the battlefield of ypres they might have won the war in the spring of 1915 instead of losing it in the fall of 1918 for the british were unprepared and unprotected against the silent death that swept down upon them on the 22nd of april 1915 what happened then is best told by sir arthur conan doyle in his history of the great war from the base of the german trenches over a considerable length there appeared jets of whitish vapor which gathered and swirled until they settled into a definite low cloudbank greenishbrown below and yellow above where it reflected the rays of the sinking sun this ominous bank of vapor impelled by a northern breeze drifted swiftly across the space which separated the two lines the french troops staring over the top of their parapet at this curious screen which ensured them a temporary relief from fire were observed suddenly to throw up their hands to clutch at their throats and to fall to the ground in the agonies of asphyxiation many lay where they had fallen while their comrades absolutely helpless against this diabolical agency rushed madly out of the mephitic mist and made for the rear overrunning the lines of trenches behind them many of them never halted until they had reached ypres while others rushed westwards and put the canal between themselves and the enemy the germans meanwhile advanced and took possession of the successive lines of trenches tenanted only by the dead garrisons whose blackened faces contorted figures and lips fringed with the blood and foam from their bursting lungs showed the agonies in which they had died some thousands of stupefied prisoners eight batteries of french fieldguns and four british 47s which had been placed in a wood behind the french position were the trophies won by this disgraceful victory under the shattering blow which they had received a blow particularly demoralizing to african troops with their fears of magic and the unknown it was impossible to rally them effectually until the next day it is to be remembered in explanation of this disorganization that it was the first experience of these poison tactics and that the troops engaged received the gas in a very much more severe form than our own men on the right of langemarck for a time there was a gap five miles broad in the front of the position of the allies and there were many hours during which there was no substantial force between the germans and ypres they wasted their time however in consolidating their ground and the chance of a great coup passed forever they had sold their souls as soldiers but the devils price was a poor one had they had a corps of cavalry ready and pushed them through the gap it would have been the most dangerous moment of the war a deserter had come over from the german side a week before and told them that cylinders of poison gas had been laid in the front trenches but no one believed him or paid any attention to his tale war was then in the englishmans opinion a gentlemans game the royal sport and poison was prohibited by the hague rules but the germans were not playing the game according to the rules so the british soldiers were strangled in their own trenches and fell easy victims to the advancing foe within half an hour after the gas was turned on 80 per cent of the opposing troops were knocked out the canadians with wet handkerchiefs over their faces closed in to stop the gap but if the germans had been prepared for such success they could have cleared the way to the coast but after such trials the germans stopped the use of free chlorine and began the preparation of more poisonous gases in some way that may not be revealed till the secret history of the war is published the british intelligence department obtained a copy of the lecture notes of the instructions to the german staff giving details of the new system of gas warfare to be started in december among the compounds named was phosgene a gas so lethal that one part in ten thousand of air may be fatal the antidote for it is hexamethylene tetramine this is not something the soldieror anybody elseis accustomed to carry around with him but the british having had a chance to cram up in advance on the stolen lecture notes were ready with gas helmets soaked in the reagent with the long name the germans rejoiced when gas bombs took the place of bayonets because this was a field in which intelligence counted for more than brute force and in which therefore they expected to be supreme as usual they were right in their major premise but wrong in their conclusion owing to the egoism of their implicit minor premise it does indeed give the advantage to skill and science but the germans were beaten at their own game for by the end of the war the united states was able to turn out toxic gases at a rate of 200 tons a day while the output of germany or england was only about 30 tons a gas plant was started at edgewood maryland in november 1917 by march it was filling shell and before the war put a stop to its activities in the fall it was producing 1300000 pounds of chlorine 1000000 pounds of chlorpicrin 1300000 pounds of phosgene and 700000 pounds of mustard gas a month chlorine the first gas used is unpleasantly familiar to every one who has entered a chemical laboratory or who has smelled the breath of bleaching powder it is a greenishyellow gas made from common salt the germans employed it at ypres by laying cylinders of the liquefied gas in the trenches about a yard apart and running a lead discharge pipe over the parapet when the stop cocks are turned the gas streams out and since it is two and a half times as heavy as air it rolls over the ground like a noisome mist it works best when the ground slopes gently down toward the enemy and when the wind blows in that direction at a rate between four and twelve miles an hour but the wind being strictly neutral may change its direction without warning and then the gases turn back in their flight and attack their own side something that rifle bullets have never been known to do illustration international film service germans starting a gas attack on the russian lines behind the cylinders from which the gas streams are seen three lines of german troops waiting to attack the photograph was taken from above by a russian airman illustration press illustrating service filling the cannisters of gas masks with charcoal made from fruit pits in long island city because free chlorine would not stay put and was dependent on the favor of the wind for its effect it was later employed not as an elemental gas but in some volatile liquid that could be fired in a shell and so released at any particular point far back of the front trenches the most commonly used of these compounds was phosgene which as the reader can see by inspection of its formula cocl2 consists of chlorine cl combined with carbon monoxide co the cause of deaths from illuminating gas these two poisonous gases chlorine and carbon monoxide when mixed together will not readily unite but if a ray of sunlight falls upon the mixture they combine at once for this reason john davy who discovered the compound over a hundred years ago named it phosgene that is produced by light the same roots recur in hydrogen so named because it is produced from water and phosphorus because it is a lightbearer in its modern manufacture the catalyzer or instigator of the combination is not sunlight but porous carbon this is packed in iron boxes eight feet long through which the mixture of the two gases was forced carbon monoxide may be made by burning coke with a supply of air insufficient for complete combustion but in order to get the pure gas necessary for the phosgene common air was not used but instead pure oxygen extracted from it by a liquid air plant phosgene is a gas that may be condensed easily to a liquid by cooling it down to 46 degrees fahrenheit a mixture of threequarters chlorine with onequarter phosgene has been found most effective by itself phosgene has an inoffensive odor somewhat like green corn and so may fail to arouse apprehension until a toxic concentration is reached but even small doses have such an effect upon the heart action for days afterward that a slight exertion may prove fatal the compound manufactured in largest amount in america was chlorpicrin this like the others is not so unfamiliar as it seems as may be seen from its formula ccl3no2 it is formed by joining the nitric acid radical no2 found in all explosives with the main part of chloroform hccl3 this is not quite so poisonous as phosgene but it has the advantage that it causes nausea and vomiting the soldier so affected is forced to take off his gas mask and then may fall victim to more toxic gases sent over simultaneously chlorpicrin is a liquid and is commonly loaded in a shell or bomb with 20 per cent of tin chloride which produces dense white fumes that go through gas masks it is made from picric acid trinitrophenol one of the best known of the high explosives by treatment with chlorine the chlorine is obtained as it is in the household from common bleaching powder or chloride of lime this is mixed with water to form a cream in a steel still 18 feet high and 8 feet in diameter a solution of calcium picrate that is the lime salt of picric acid is pumped in and as the reaction begins the mixture heats up and the chlorpicrin distils over with the steam when the distillate is condensed the chlorpicrin being the heavier liquid settles out under the layer of water and may be drawn off to fill the shell much of what a student learns in the chemical laboratory he is apt to forget in later life if he does not follow it up but there are two gases that he always remembers chlorine and hydrogen sulfide he is lucky if he has escaped being choked by the former or sickened by the latter he can imagine what the effect would be if two offensive fumes could be combined without losing their offensive features now a combination something like this is the socalled mustard gas which is not a gas and is not made from mustard but it is easily gasified and oil of mustard is about as near as nature dare come to making such sinful stuff it was first made by guthrie an englishman in 1860 and rediscovered by a german chemist victor meyer in 1886 but he found it so dangerous to work with that he abandoned the investigation nobody else cared to take it up for nobody could see any use for it so it remained in innocuous desuetude a mere name in beilsteins dictionary together with the thousands of other organic compounds that have been invented and never utilized but on july 12 1917 the british holding the line at ypres were besprinkled with this villainous substance its success was so great that the germans henceforth made it their main reliance and soon the allies followed suit in one offensive of ten days the germans are said to have used a million shells containing 2500 tons of mustard gas the making of so dangerous a compound on a large scale was one of the most difficult tasks set before the chemists of this and other countries yet it was successfully solved the raw materials are chlorine alcohol and sulfur the alcohol is passed with steam through a vertical iron tube filled with kaolin and heated this converts the alcohol into a gas known as ethylene c2h4 passing a stream of chlorine gas into a tank of melted sulfur produces sulfur monochloride and this treated with the ethylene makes the mustard the final reaction was carried on at the edgewood arsenal in seven airtight tanks or reactors each having a capacity of 30000 pounds the ethylene gas being led into the tank and distributed through the liquid sulfur chloride by porous blocks or fine nozzles the two chemicals combined to form what is officially named dichlordiethylsulfide clc2h4sc2h4cl this however is too big a mouthful so even the chemists were glad to fall in with the commonalty and call it mustard gas the effectiveness of mustard depends upon its persistence it is a stable liquid evaporating slowly and not easily decomposed it lingers about trenches and dugouts and impregnates soil and cloth for days gas masks do not afford complete protection for even if they are impenetrable they must be taken off some time and the gas lies in wait for that time in some cases the masks were worn continuously for twelve hours after the attack but when they were removed the soldiers were overpowered by the poison a place may seem to be free from it but when the sun heats up the ground the liquid volatilizes and the vapor soaks through the clothing as the men become warmed up by work their skin is blistered especially under the armpits the mustard acts like steam producing burns that range from a mere reddening to serious ulcerations always painful and incapacitating but if treated promptly in the hospital rarely causing death or permanent scars the gas attacks the eyes throat nose and lungs and may lead to bronchitis or pneumonia it was found necessary at the front to put all the clothing of the soldiers into the sterilizing ovens every night to remove all traces of mustard general johnson and his staff in the 77th division were poisoned in their dugouts because they tried to alleviate the discomfort of their camp cots by bedding taken from a neighboring village that had been shelled the day before of the 925 cases requiring medical attention at the edgewood arsenal 674 were due to mustard during the month of august 312 per cent of the mustard plant force were sent to the hospital each day on the average but the record of the edgewood arsenal is a striking demonstration of what can be done in the prevention of industrial accidents by the exercise of scientific prudence in spite of the fact that from three to eleven thousand men were employed at the plant for the year 1918 and turned out some twenty thousand tons of the most poisonous gases known to man there were only three fatalities and not a single case of blindness besides the four toxic gases previously described chlorine phosgene chlorpicrin and mustard various other compounds have been and many others might be made a list of those employed in the present war enumerates thirty among them compounds of bromine arsenic and cyanogen that may prove more formidable than any so far used american chemists kept very mum during the war but occasionally one could not refrain from saying if the kaiser knew what i know he would surrender unconditionally by telegraph no doubt the science of chemical warfare is in its infancy and every foresighted power has concealed weapons of its own in reserve one deadly compound whose identity has not yet been disclosed is known as lewisite from professor lewis of northwestern who was manufacturing it at the rate of ten tons a day in the mouse trap stockade near cleveland throughout the history of warfare the art of defense has kept pace with the art of offense and the courage of man has never failed no matter to what new danger he was exposed as each new gas employed by the enemy was detected it became the business of our chemists to discover some method of absorbing or neutralizing it porous charcoal best made from such dense wood as coconut shells was packed in the respirator box together with layers of such chemicals as will catch the gases to be expected charcoal absorbs large quantities of any gas soda lime and potassium permanganate and nickel salts were among the neutralizers used the mask is fitted tightly about the face or over the head with rubber the nostrils are kept closed with a clip so breathing must be done through the mouth and no air can be inhaled except that passing through the absorbent cylinder men within five miles of the front were required to wear the masks slung on their chests so they could be put on within six seconds a wellmade mask with a fresh box afforded almost complete immunity for a time and the soldiers learned within a few days to handle their masks adroitly so the problem of defense against this new offensive was solved satisfactorily while no such adequate protection against the older weapons of bayonet and shrapnel has yet been devised then the problem of the offense was to catch the opponent with his mask off or to make him take it off here the lachrymators and the sternutators the tear gases and the sneeze gases came into play phenylcarbylamine chloride would make the bravest soldier weep on the battlefield with the abandonment of a greek hero diphenylchloroarsine would set him sneezing the germans alternated these with diabolical ingenuity so as to catch us unawares some shells gave off voluminous smoke or a vile stench without doing much harm but by the time our men got used to these and grew careless about their masks a few shells of some extremely poisonous gas were mixed with them the ideal gas for belligerent purposes would be odorless colorless and invisible toxic even when diluted by a million parts of air not set on fire or exploded by the detonator of the shell not decomposed by water not readily absorbed stable enough to stand storage for six months and capable of being manufactured by the thousands of tons no one gas will serve all aims for instance phosgene being very volatile and quickly dissipated is thrown into trenches that are soon to be taken while mustard gas being very tenacious could not be employed in such a case for the trenches could not be occupied if they were captured the extensive use of poison gas in warfare by all the belligerents is a vindication of the american protest at the hague conference against its prohibition at the first conference of 1899 captain mahan argued very sensibly that gas shells were no worse than other projectiles and might indeed prove more merciful and that it was illogical to prohibit a weapon merely because of its novelty the british delegates voted with the americans in opposition to the clause the contracting parties agree to abstain from the use of projectiles the sole object of which is the diffusion of asphyxiating or deleterious gases but both great britain and germany later agreed to the provision the use of poison gas by germany without warning was therefore an act of treachery and a violation of her pledge but the united states has consistently refused to bind herself to any such restriction the facts reported by general amos a fries in command of the overseas branch of the american chemical warfare service give ample support to the american contention at the hague out of 1000 gas casualties there are from 30 to 40 fatalities while out of 1000 high explosive casualties the number of fatalities run from 200 to 250 while exact figures are as yet not available concerning the men permanently crippled or blinded by high explosives one has only to witness the debarkation of a shipload of troops to be convinced that the number is very large on the other hand there is so far as known at present not a single case of permanent disability or blindness among our troops due to gas and this in face of the fact that the germans used relatively large quantities of this material in the light of these facts the prejudice against the use of gas must gradually give way for the statement made to the effect that its use is contrary to the principles of humanity will apply with far greater force to the use of high explosives as a matter of fact for certain purposes toxic gas is an ideal agent for example it is difficult to imagine any agent more effective or more humane that may be used to render an opposing battery ineffective or to protect retreating troops captain mahans argument at the hague against the proposed prohibition of poison gas is so cogent and well expressed that it has been quoted in treatises on international law ever since these reasons were briefly 1 that no shell emitting such gases is as yet in practical use or has undergone adequate experiment consequently a vote taken now would be taken in ignorance of the facts as to whether the results would be of a decisive character or whether injury in excess of that necessary to attain the end of warfarethe immediate disabling of the enemywould be inflicted 2 that the reproach of cruelty and perfidy addressed against these supposed shells was equally uttered formerly against firearms and torpedoes both of which are now employed without scruple until we know the effects of such asphyxiating shells there was no saying whether they would be more or less merciful than missiles now permitted that it was illogical and not demonstrably humane to be tender about asphyxiating men with gas when all are prepared to admit that it was allowable to blow the bottom out of an ironclad at midnight throwing four or five hundred into the sea to be choked by water with scarcely the remotest chance of escape as captain mahan says the same objection has been raised at the introduction of each new weapon of war even though it proved to be no more cruel than the old the modern rifle ball swift and small and sterilized by heat does not make so bad a wound as the ancient sword and spear but we all remember how gunpowder was regarded by the dandies of hotspurs time and it was great pity so it was this villainous saltpeter should be diggd out of the bowels of the harmless earth which many a good tall fellow had destroyd so cowardly and but for these vile guns he would himself have been a soldier the real reason for the instinctive aversion manifested against any new arm or mode of attack is that it reveals to us the intrinsic horror of war we naturally revolt against premeditated homicide but we have become so accustomed to the sword and latterly to the rifle that they do not shock us as they ought when we think of what they are made for the constitution of the united states prohibits the infliction of cruel and unusual punishments the two adjectives were apparently used almost synonymously as though any unusual punishment were necessarily cruel and so indeed it strikes us but our ingenious lawyers were able to persuade the courts that electrocution though unknown to the fathers and undeniably unusual was not unconstitutional dumdum bullets are rightfully ruled out because they inflict frightful and often incurable wounds and the aim of humane warfare is to disable the enemy not permanently to injure him illustration from americas munitions the chlorpicrin plant at the edgewood arsenal from these stills filled with a mixture of bleaching powder lime and picric acid the poisonous gas chlorpicrin distills off this plant produced 31 tons in one day illustration courtesy of the metal and thermit corporation ny repairing the broken stern post of the uss northern pacific the biggest marine weld in the world on the right the fractured stern post is shown on the left it is being mended by means of thermit two crucibles each containing 700 pounds of the thermit mixture are seen on the sides of the vessel from the bottom of these the melted steel flowed down to fill the fracture in spite of the opposition of the american and british delegates the first hague conference adopted the clause the contracting powers agree to abstain from the use of projectiles the sole object of which is the diffusion of asphyxiating or deleterious gases the word sole unique which appears in the original french text of the hague convention is left out of the official english translation this is a strange omission considering that the french and british defended their use of explosives which diffuse asphyxiating and deleterious gases on the ground that this was not the sole purpose of the bombs but merely an accidental effect of the nitric powder used the hague congress of 1907 placed in its rules for war it is expressly forbidden to employ poisons or poisonous weapons but such attempts to rule out new and more effective means of warfare are likely to prove futile in any serious conflict and the restriction gives the advantage to the most unscrupulous side we americans if ever we give our assent to such an agreement would of course keep it but our enemywhoever he may be in the futurewill be as he always has been utterly without principle and will not hesitate to employ any weapon against us besides as the germans held chemical warfare favors the army that is most intelligent resourceful and disciplined and the nation that stands highest in science and industry this advantage let us hope will be on our side chapter xiii products of the electric furnace the control of man over the materials of nature has been vastly enhanced by the recent extension of the range of temperature at his command when fahrenheit stuck the bulb of his thermometer into a mixture of snow and salt he thought he had reached the nadir of temperature so he scratched a mark on the tube where the mercury stood and called it zero but we know that absolute zero the total absence of heat is 459 of fahrenheits degrees lower than his zero point the modern scientist can get close to that lowest limit by making use of the cooling by the expansion principle he first liquefies air under pressure and then releasing the pressure allows it to boil off a tube of hydrogen immersed in the liquid air as it evaporates is cooled down until it can be liquefied then the boiling hydrogen is used to liquefy helium and as this boils off it lowers the temperature to within three or four degrees of absolute zero the early metallurgist had no hotter a fire than he could make by blowing charcoal with a bellows this was barely enough for the smelting of iron but by the bringing of two carbon rods together as in the electric arc light we can get enough heat to volatilize the carbon at the tips and this means over 7000 degrees fahrenheit by putting a pressure of twenty atmospheres onto the arc light we can raise it to perhaps 14000 degrees which is 3000 degrees hotter than the sun this gives the modern man a working range of about 14500 degrees so it is no wonder that he can perform miracles when a builder wants to make an old house over into a new one he takes it apart brick by brick and stone by stone then he puts them together in such new fashion as he likes the electric furnace enables the chemist to take his materials apart in the same way as the temperature rises the chemical and physical forces that hold a body together gradually weaken first the solid loosens up and becomes a liquid then this breaks bonds and becomes a gas compounds break up into their elements the elemental molecules break up into their component atoms and finally these begin to throw off corpuscles of negative electricity eighteen hundred times smaller than the smallest atom these electrons appear to be the building stones of the universe no indication of any smaller units has been discovered although we need not assume that in the electron science has delivered what has been called its ultimatom the greeks called the elemental particles of matter atoms because they esteemed them indivisible but now in the light of the xray we can witness the disintegration of the atom into electrons all the chemical and physical properties of matter except perhaps weight seem to depend upon the number and movement of the negative and positive electrons and by their rearrangement one element may be transformed into another so the electric furnace where the highest attainable temperature is combined with the divisive and directive force of the current is a magical machine for accomplishment of the metamorphoses desired by the creative chemist a hundred years ago davy by dipping the poles of his battery into melted soda lye saw forming on one of them a shining globule like quicksilver it was the metal sodium never before seen by man nowadays this process of electrolysis electric loosening is carried out daily by the ton at niagara the reverse process electrosynthesis electric combining is equally simple and even more important by passing a strong electric current through a mixture of lime and coke the metal calcium disengages itself from the oxygen of the lime and attaches itself to the carbon or to put it briefly cao 3c cac2 co lime coke calcium carbon carbide monoxide this reaction is of peculiar importance because it bridges the gulf between the organic and inorganic worlds it was formerly supposed that the substances found in plants and animals mostly complex compounds of carbon hydrogen and oxygen could only be produced by vital forces if this were true it meant that chemistry was limited to the mineral kingdom and to the extraction of such carbon compounds as happened to exist ready formed in the vegetable and animal kingdoms but fortunately this barrier to human achievement proved purely illusory the organic field once man had broken into it proved easier to work in than the inorganic but it must be confessed that man is dreadfully clumsy about it yet he takes a thousand horsepower engine and an electric furnace at several thousand degrees to get carbon into combination with hydrogen while the little green leaf in the sunshine does it quietly without getting hot about it evidently man is working as wastefully as when he used a thousand slaves to drag a stone to the pyramid or burned down a house to roast a pig not until his laboratory is as cool and calm and comfortable as the forest and the field can the chemist call himself completely successful but in spite of his clumsiness the chemist is actually making things that he wants and cannot get elsewhere the calcium carbide that he manufactures from inorganic material serves as the raw material for producing all sorts of organic compounds the electric furnace was first employed on a large scale by the cowles electric smelting and aluminum company at cleveland in 1885 on the dump were found certain lumps of porous gray stone which dropped into water gave off a gas that exploded at touch of a match with a splendid bang and flare this gas was acetylene and we can represent the reaction thus cac2 2 h2o c2h2 cao2h2 calcium carbide added to water gives acetylene and slaked lime we are all familiar with this reaction now for it is acetylene that gives the dazzling light of the automobiles and of the automatic signal buoys of the seacoast when burned with pure oxygen instead of air it gives the hottest of chemical flames hotter even than the oxyhydrogen blowpipe for although a given weight of hydrogen will give off more heat when it burns than carbon will yet acetylene will give off more heat than either of its elements or both of them when they are separate this is because acetylene has stored up heat in its formation instead of giving it off as in most reactions or to put it in chemical language acetylene is an endothermic compound it has required energy to bring the h and the c together therefore it does not require energy to separate them but on the contrary energy is released when they are separated that is to say acetylene is explosive not only when mixed with air as coal gas is but by itself under a suitable impulse acetylene will break up into its original carbon and hydrogen with great violence it explodes with twice as much force without air as ordinary coal gas with air it forms an explosive compound with copper so it has to be kept out of contact with brass tubes and stopcocks but compressed in steel cylinders and dissolved in acetone it is safe and commonly used for welding and melting it is a marvelous though not an unusual sight on city streets to see a man with blue glasses on cutting down through a steel rail with an oxyacetylene blowpipe as easily as a carpenter saws off a board with such a flame he can carve out a pattern in a steel plate in a way that reminds me of the days when i used to make brackets with a scroll saw out of cigar boxes the torch will travel through a steel plate an inch or two thick at a rate of six to ten inches a minute illustration courtesy of the carborundum company niagara falls making aloxite in the electric furnaces by fusing coke and bauxite in the background are the circular furnaces in the foreground are the fused masses of the product illustration courtesy of the carborundum co niagara falls a block of carborundum crystals illustration courtesy of the carborundum co niagara falls making carborundum in the electric furnace at the end may be seen the attachments for the wires carrying the electric current and on the side the flames from the burning carbon the temperatures attainable with various fuels in the compound blowpipe are said to be acetylene with oxygen 7878 f hydrogen with oxygen 6785 f coal gas with oxygen 6575 f gasoline with oxygen 5788 f if we compare the formula of acetylene c2h2 with that of ethylene c2h4 or with ethane c2h6 we see that acetylene could take on two or four more atoms it is evidently what the chemists call an unsaturated compound one that has not reached its limit of hydrogenation it is therefore a very active and energetic compound ready to pick up on the slightest instigation hydrogen or oxygen or chlorine or any other elements that happen to be handy this is why it is so useful as a starting point for synthetic chemistry to build up from this simple substance acetylene the higher compounds of carbon and oxygen it is necessary to call in the aid of that mysterious agency the catalyst acetylene is not always acted upon by water as we know for we see it bubbling up through the water when prepared from the carbide but if to the water be added a little acid and a mercury salt the acetylene gas will unite with the water forming a new compound acetaldehyde we can show the change most simply in this fashion c2h2 h2o c2h4o acetylene added to water forms acetaldehyde acetaldehyde is not of much importance in itself but is useful as a transition if its vapor mixed with hydrogen is passed over finely divided nickel serving as a catalyst the two unite and we have alcohol according to this reaction c2h4o h2 c2h6o acetaldehyde added to hydrogen forms alcohol alcohol we are all familiar withsome of us too familiar but the prohibition laws will correct that the point to be noted is that the alcohol we have made from such unpromising materials as limestone and coal is exactly the same alcohol as is obtained by the fermentation of fruits and grains by the yeast plant as in wine and beer it is not a substitute or imitation it is not the wood spirits methyl alcohol ch4o produced by the destructive distillation of wood equally serviceable as a solvent or fuel but undrinkable and poisonous now as we all know cider and wine when exposed to the air gradually turn into vinegar that is by the growth of bacteria the alcohol is oxidized to acetic acid we can if we like dispense with the bacteria and speed up the process by employing a catalyst acetaldehyde which is halfway between alcohol and acid may also be easily oxidized to acetic acid the relationship is readily seen by this c2h6o cc2h4o c2h4o3 alcohol acetaldehyde acetic acid acetic acid familiar to us in a diluted and flavored form as vinegar is when concentrated of great value in industry especially as a solvent i have already referred to its use in combination with cellulose as a dope for varnishing airplane canvas or making noninflammable film for motion pictures its combination with lime calcium acetate when heated gives acetone which as may be seen from its formula c3h6o is closely related to the other compounds we have been considering but it is neither an alcohol nor an acid it is extensively employed as a solvent acetone is not only useful for dissolving solids but it will under pressure dissolve many times its volume of gaseous acetylene this is a convenient way of transporting and handling acetylene for lighting or welding if instead of simply mixing the acetone and acetylene in a solution we combine them chemically we can get isoprene which is the mother substance of ordinary india rubber from acetone also is made the war rubber of the germans methyl rubber which i have mentioned in a previous chapter the germans had been getting about half their supply of acetone from american acetate of lime and this was of course shut off that which was produced in germany by the distillation of beech wood was not even enough for the high explosives needed at the front so the germans resorted to rotting potatoesor rather let us say since it sounds betterto the cultivation of bacillus macerans this particular bacillus converts the starch of the potato into twothirds alcohol and onethird acetone but soon potatoes got too scarce to be used up in this fashion so the germans turned to calcium carbide as a source of acetone and before the war ended they had a factory capable of manufacturing 2000 tons of methyl rubber a year this shows the advantage of having several strings to a bow the reason why acetylene is such an active and acquisitive thing the chemist explains or rather expresses by picturing its structure in this shape hctriple bondch now the carbon atoms are holding each others hands because they have nothing else to do there are no other elements around to hitch on to but the two carbons of acetylene readily loosen up and keeping the connection between them by a single bond reach out in this fashion with their two disengaged arms and grab whatever alien atoms happen to be in the vicinity hcch carbon atoms belong to the quadrumani like the monkeys so they are peculiarly fitted to forming chains and rings this accounts for the variety and complexity of the carbon compounds so when acetylene gas mixed with other gases is passed over a catalyst such as a heated mass of iron ore or clay hydrates or silicates of iron or aluminum it forms all sorts of curious combinations in the presence of steam we may get such simple compounds as acetic acid acetone and the like but when three acetylene molecules join to form a ring of six carbon atoms we get compounds of the benzene series such as were described in the chapter on the coaltar colors if ammonia is mixed with acetylene we may get rings with the nitrogen atom in place of one of the carbons like the pyridins and quinolins pungent bases such as are found in opium and tobacco or if hydrogen sulfide is mixed with the acetylene we may get thiophenes which have sulfur in the ring so starting with the simple combination of two atoms of carbon with two of hydrogen we can get directly by this single process some of the most complicated compounds of the organic world as well as many others not found in nature in the development of the electric furnace america played a pioneer part provost smith of the university of pennsylvania who is the best authority on the history of chemistry in america claims for robert hare a philadelphia chemist born in 1781 the honor of constructing the first electrical furnace with this crude apparatus and with no greater electromotive force than could be attained from a voltaic pile he converted charcoal into graphite volatilized phosphorus from its compounds isolated metallic calcium and synthesized calcium carbide it is to hare also that we owe the invention in 1801 of the oxyhydrogen blowpipe which nowadays is used with acetylene as well as hydrogen with this instrument he was able to fuse strontia and volatilize platinum but the electrical furnace could not be used on a commercial scale until the dynamo replaced the battery as a source of electricity the industrial development of the electrical furnace centered about the search for a cheap method of preparing aluminum this is the metallic base of clay and therefore is common enough but clay as we know from its use in making porcelain is very infusible and difficult to decompose sixty years ago aluminum was priced at 140 a pound but one would have had difficulty in buying such a large quantity as a pound at any price at international expositions a small bar of it might be seen in a case labeled silver from clay mechanics were anxious to get the new metal for it was light and untarnishable but the metallurgists could not furnish it to them at a low enough price in order to extract it from clay a more active metal sodium was essential but sodium also was rare and expensive in those days a professor of chemistry used to keep a little stick of it in a bottle under kerosene and once a year he whittled off a piece the size of a pea and threw it into water to show the class how it sizzled and gave off hydrogen the way to get cheaper aluminum was it seemed to get cheaper sodium and hamilton young castner set himself at this problem he was a brooklyn boy a student of chandlers at columbia you can see the bronze tablet in his honor at the entrance of havemeyer hall in 1886 he produced metallic sodium by mixing caustic soda with iron and charcoal in an iron pot and heating in a gas furnace before this experiment sodium sold at 2 a pound after it sodium sold at twenty cents a pound but although castner had succeeded in his experiment he was defeated in his object for while he was perfecting the sodium process for making aluminum the electrolytic process for getting aluminum directly was discovered in oberlin so the 250000 plant of the aluminium company ltd that castner had got erected at birmingham england did not make aluminum at all but produced sodium for other purposes instead castner then turned his attention to the electrolytic method of producing sodium by the use of the power of niagara falls electric power here in 1894 he succeeded in separating common salt into its component elements chlorine and sodium by passing the electric current through brine and collecting the sodium in the mercury floor of the cell the sodium by the action of water goes into caustic soda nowadays sodium and chlorine and their components are made in enormous quantities by the decomposition of salt the united states government in 1918 procured nearly 4000000 pounds of chlorine for gas warfare the discovery of the electrical process of making aluminum that displaced the sodium method was due to charles m hall he was the son of a congregational minister and as a boy took a fancy to chemistry through happening upon an old textbook of that science in his fathers library he never knew who the author was for the cover and title page had been torn off the obstacle in the way of the electrolytic production of aluminum was as i have said because its compounds were so hard to melt that the current could not pass through in 1886 when hall was twentytwo he solved the problem in the laboratory of oberlin college with no other apparatus than a small crucible a gasoline burner to heat it with and a galvanic battery to supply the electricity he found that a greenland mineral known as cryolite a double fluoride of sodium and aluminum was readily fused and would dissolve alumina aluminum oxide when an electric current was passed through the melted mass the metal aluminum would collect at one of the poles in working out the process and defending his claims hall used up all his own money his brothers and his uncles but he won out in the end and judge taft held that his patent had priority over the french claim of hrault on his death a few years ago hall left his large fortune to his alma mater oberlin two other young men from ohio alfred and eugene cowles with whom hall was for a time associated wore the first to develop the wide possibilities of the electric furnace on a commercial scale in 1885 they started the cowles electric smelting and aluminum company at lockport new york using niagara power the various aluminum bronzes made by absorbing the electrolyzed aluminum in copper attracted immediate attention by their beauty and usefulness in electrical work and later the company turned out other products besides aluminum such as calcium carbide phosphorus and carborundum they got carborundum as early as 1885 but miscalled it crystallized silicon so its introduction was left to ea acheson who was a graduate of edisons laboratory in 1891 he packed clay and charcoal into an iron bowl connected it to a dynamo and stuck into the mixture an electric light carbon connected to the other pole of the dynamo when he pulled out the rod he found its end encrusted with glittering crystals of an unknown substance they were blue and black and iridescent exceedingly hard and very beautiful he sold them at first by the carat at a rate that would amount to 560 a pound they were as well worth buying as diamond dust but those who purchased them must have regretted it for much finer crystals were soon on sale at ten cents a pound the mysterious substance turned out to be a compound of carbon and silicon the simplest possible compound one atom of each csi acheson set up a factory at niagara where he made it in tenton batches the furnace consisted simply of a brick box fifteen feet long and seven feet wide and deep with big carbon electrodes at the ends between them was packed a mixture of coke to supply the carbon sand to supply the silicon sawdust to make the mass porous and salt to make it fusible illustration the first american electric furnace constructed by robert hare of philadelphia from chemistry in america by edgar fahs smith the substance thus produced at niagara falls is known as carborundum south of the americancanadian boundary and as crystolon north of this line as carbolon by another firm and as silicon carbide by chemists the world over since it is next to the diamond in hardness it takes off metal faster than emery aluminum oxide using less power and wasting less heat in futile fireworks it is used for grindstones of all sizes including those the dentist uses on your teeth it has revolutionized shoppractice for articles can be ground into shape better and quicker than they can be cut what is more the artificial abrasives do not injure the lungs of the operatives like sandstone the output of artificial abrasives in the united states and canada for 1917 was tons value silicon carbide 8323 1074152 aluminum oxide 48463 6969387 a new use for carborundum was found during the war when uncle sam assumed the rle of jove as cloudcompeller acting on carborundum with chlorinealso you remember a product of electrical dissolutionthe chlorine displaces the carbon forming silicon tetrachloride sicl4 a colorless liquid resembling chloroform when this comes in contact with moist air it gives off thick white fumes for water decomposes it giving a white powder silicon hydroxide and hydrochloric acid if ammonia is present the acid will unite with it giving further white fumes of the salt ammonium chloride so a mixture of two parts of silicon chloride with one part of dry ammonia was used in the war to produce smokescreens for the concealment of the movements of troops batteries and vessels or put in shells so the outlook could see where they burst and so get the range titanium tetrachloride a similar substance proved 50 per cent better than silicon but phosphoruswhich also we get from the electric furnacewas the most effective mistifier of all before the introduction of the artificial abrasives fine grinding was mostly done by emery which is an impure form of aluminum oxide found in nature a purer form is made from the mineral bauxite by driving off its combined water bauxite is the ore from which is made the pure aluminum oxide used in the electric furnace for the production of metallic aluminum formerly we imported a large part of our bauxite from france but when the war shut off this source we developed our domestic fields in arkansas alabama and georgia and these are now producing half a million tons a year bauxite simply fused in the electric furnace makes a better abrasive than the natural emery or corundum and it is sold for this purpose under the name of aloxite alundum exolon lionite or coralox when the fused bauxite is worked up with a bonding material into crucibles or muffles and baked in a kiln it forms the alundum refractory ware since alundum is porous and not attacked by acids it is used for filtering hot and corrosive liquids that would eat up filterpaper carborundum or crystolon is also made up into refractory ware for high temperature work when the fused mass of the carborundum furnace is broken up there is found surrounding the carborundum core a similar substance though not quite so hard and infusible known as carborundum sand or siloxicon this is mixed with fireclay and used for furnace linings many new forms of refractories have come into use to meet the demands of the new high temperature work the essentials are that it should not melt or crumble at high heat and should not expand and contract greatly under changes of temperature low coefficient of thermal expansion whether it is desirable that it should heat through readily or slowly coefficient of thermal conductivity depends on whether it is wanted as a crucible or as a furnace lining lime calcium oxide fuses only at the highest heat of the electric furnace but it breaks down into dust magnesia magnesium oxide is better and is most extensively employed for every ton of steel produced five pounds of magnesite is needed formerly we imported 90 per cent of our supply from austria but now we get it from california and washington in 1913 the american production of magnesite was only 9600 tons in 1918 it was 225000 zirconia zirconium oxide is still more refractory and in spite of its greater cost zirkite is coming into use as a lining for electric furnaces silicon is next to oxygen the commonest element in the world it forms a quarter of the earths crust yet it is unfamiliar to most of us that is because it is always found combined with oxygen in the form of silica as quartz crystal or sand this used to be considered too refractory to be blown but is found to be easily manipulable at the high temperatures now at the command of the glassblower so the chemist rejoices in flasks that he can heat red hot in the bunsen burner and then plunge into ice water without breaking and the cook can bake and serve in a dish of pyrex which is 80 per cent silica at the beginning of the twentieth century minute specimens of silicon were sold as laboratory curiosities at the price of 100 an ounce two years later it was turned out by the barrelful at niagara as an accidental byproduct and could not find a market at ten cents a pound silicon from the electric furnace appears in the form of hard glittering metallic crystals an alloy of iron and silicon ferrosilicon made by heating a mixture of iron ore sand and coke in the electrical furnace is used as a deoxidizing agent in the manufacture of steel since silicon has been robbed with difficulty of its oxygen it takes it on again with great avidity this has been made use of in the making of hydrogen a mixture of silicon or of the ferrosilicon alloy containing 90 per cent of silicon with soda and slaked lime is inert compact and can be transported to any point where hydrogen is needed say at a battle front then the hydrogenite as the mixture is named is ignited by a hot iron ball and goes off like thermit with the production of great heat and the evolution of a vast volume of hydrogen gas or the ferrosilicon may be simply burned in an atmosphere of steam in a closed tank after ignition with a pinch of gunpowder the iron and the silicon revert to their oxides while the hydrogen of the water is set free the french silikol method consists in treating silicon with a 40 per cent solution of soda another source of hydrogen originating with the electric furnace is hydrolith which consists of calcium hydride metallic calcium is prepared from lime in the electric furnace then pieces of the calcium are spread out in an oven heated by electricity and a current of dry hydrogen passed through the gas is absorbed by the metal forming the hydride cah2 this is packed up in cans and when hydrogen is desired it is simply dropped into water when it gives off the gas just as calcium carbide gives off acetylene this last reaction was also used in germany for filling zeppelins for calcium carbide is convenient and portable and acetylene when it is once started as by an electric shock decomposes spontaneously by its own internal heat into hydrogen and carbon the latter is left as a fine pure lampblack suitable for printers ink napoleon who was always on the lookout for new inventions that could be utilized for military purposes seized immediately upon the balloon as an observation station within a few years after the first ascent had been made in paris napoleon took balloons and apparatus for generating hydrogen with him on his archeological expedition to egypt in which he hoped to conquer asia but the british fleet in the mediterranean put a stop to this experiment by intercepting the ship and military aviation waited until the great war for its full development this caused a sudden demand for immense quantities of hydrogen and all manner of means was taken to get it water is easily decomposed into hydrogen and oxygen by passing an electric current through it in various electrolytical processes hydrogen has been a wasted byproduct since the balloon demand was slight and it was more bother than it was worth to collect and purify the hydrogen another way of getting hydrogen in quantity is by passing steam over redhot coke this produces the blue watergas which contains about 50 per cent hydrogen 40 per cent carbon monoxide and the rest nitrogen and carbon dioxide the last is removed by running the mixed gases through lime then the nitrogen and carbon monoxide are frozen out in an airliquefying apparatus and the hydrogen escapes to the storage tank the liquefied carbon monoxide allowed to regain its gaseous form is used in an internal combustion engine to run the plant there are then many ways of producing hydrogen but it is so light and bulky that it is difficult to get it where it is wanted the american government in the war made use of steel cylinders each holding 161 cubic feet of the gas under a pressure of 2000 pounds per square inch even the hydrogen used by the troops in france was shipped from america in this form for field use the ferrosilicon and soda process was adopted a portable generator of this type was capable of producing 10000 cubic feet of the gas per hour the discovery by a kansas chemist of natural sources of helium may make it possible to free ballooning of its great danger for helium is noninflammable and almost as light as hydrogen other uses of hydrogen besides ballooning have already been referred to in other chapters it is combined with nitrogen to form synthetic ammonia it is combined with oxygen in the oxyhydrogen blowpipe to produce heat it is combined with vegetable and animal oils to convert them into solid fats there is also the possibility of using it as a fuel in the internal combustion engine in place of gasoline but for this purpose we must find some way of getting hydrogen portable or producible in a compact form aluminum like silicon sodium and calcium has been rescued by violence from its attachment to oxygen and like these metals it reverts with readiness to its former affinity dr goldschmidt made use of this reaction in his thermit process powdered aluminum is mixed with iron oxide rust if the mixture is heated at any point a furious struggle takes place throughout the whole mass between the iron and the aluminum as to which metal shall get the oxygen and the aluminum always comes out ahead the temperature runs up to some 6000 degrees fahrenheit within thirty seconds and the freed iron completely liquefied runs down into the bottom of the crucible where it may be drawn off by opening a trap door the newly formed aluminum oxide alumina floats as slag on top the applications of the thermit process are innumerable if for instance it is desired to mend a broken rail or crank shaft without moving it from its place the two ends are brought together or fixed at the proper distance apart a crucible filled with the thermit mixture is set up above the joint and the thermit ignited with a priming of aluminum and barium peroxide to start it off the barium peroxide having a superabundance of oxygen gives it up readily and the aluminum thus encouraged attacks the iron oxide and robs it of its oxygen as soon as the iron is melted it is run off through the bottom of the crucible and fills the space between the rail ends being kept from spreading by a mold of refractory material such as magnesite the two ends of the rail are therefore joined by a section of the same size shape substance and strength as themselves the same process can be used for mending a fracture or supplying a missing fragment of a steel casting of any size such as a ships propeller or a cogwheel illustration types of gas mask used by america the allies and germany during the war in the top row are the american masks chronologically from left to right us navy mask obsolete us navy

shells are being placed on small trucks to be run into the filling chamber the large truck in the foreground contains loaded shell for smaller work thermit has two rivals the oxyacetylene torch and electric welding the former has been described and the latter is rather out of the range of this volume although i may mention that in the latter part of 1918 there was launched from a british shipyard the first rivotless steel vessel in this the steel plates forming the shell bulkheads and floors are welded instead of being fastened together by rivets there are three methods of doing this depending upon the thickness of the plates and the sort of strain they are subject to the plates may be overlapped and tacked together at intervals by pressing the two electrodes on opposite sides of the same point until the spot is sufficiently heated to fuse together the plates here or roller electrodes may be drawn slowly along the line of the desired weld fusing the plates together continuously as they go or thirdly the plates may be buttwelded by being pushed together edge to edge without overlapping and the electric current being passed from one plate to the other heats up the joint where the conductivity is interrupted it will be observed that the thermit process is essentially like the ordinary blast furnace process of smelting iron and other metals except that aluminum is used instead of carbon to take the oxygen away from the metal in the ore this has an advantage in case carbonfree metals are desired and the process is used for producing manganese tungsten titanium molybdenum vanadium and their allows with iron and copper during the war thermit found a new and terrible employment as it was used by the airmen for setting buildings on fire and exploding ammunition dumps the german incendiary bombs consisted of a perforated steel nosepiece a tail to keep it falling straight and a cylindrical body which contained a tube of thermit packed around with mineral wax containing potassium perchlorate the fuse was ignited as the missile was released and the thermit as it heated up melted the wax and allowed it to flow out together with the liquid iron through the holes in the nosepiece the american incendiary bombs were of a still more malignant type they weighed about forty pounds apiece and were charged with oil emulsion thermit and metallic sodium sodium decomposes water so that if any attempt were made to put out with a hose a fire started by one of these bombs the stream of water would be instantaneously changed into a jet of blazing hydrogen besides its use in combining and separating different elements the electric furnace is able to change a single element into its various forms carbon for instance is found in three very distinct forms in hard transparent and colorless crystals as the diamond in black opaque metallic scales as graphite and in shapeless masses and powder as charcoal coke lampblack and the like in the intense heat of the electric arc these forms are convertible one into the other according to the conditions since the third form is the cheapest the object is to change it into one of the other two graphite plumbago or blacklead as it is still sometimes called is not found in many places and more rarely found pure the supply was not equal to the demand until acheson worked out the process of making it by packing powdered anthracite between the electrodes of his furnace in this way graphite can be cheaply produced in any desired quantity and quality since graphite is infusible and incombustible except at exceedingly high temperatures it is extensively used for crucibles and electrodes these electrodes are made in all sizes for the various forms of electric lamps and furnaces from rods onesixteenth of an inch in diameter to bars a foot thick and six feet long it is graphite mixed with fine clay to give it the desired degree of hardness that forms the filling of our lead pencils finely ground and flocculent graphite treated with tannin may be held in suspension in liquids and even pass through filterpaper the mixture with water is sold under the name of aquadag with oil as oildag and with grease as gredag for lubrication the smooth slippery scales of graphite in suspension slide over each other easily and keep the bearings from rubbing against each other the other and more difficult metamorphosis of carbon the transformation of charcoal into diamond was successfully accomplished by moissan in 1894 henri moissan was a toxicologist that is to say a professor of poisoning in the paris school of pharmacy who took to experimenting with the electric furnace in his leisure hours and did more to demonstrate its possibilities than any other man with it he isolated fluorine most active of the elements and he prepared for the first time in their purity many of the rare metals that have since found industrial employment he also made the carbides of the various metals including the now common calcium carbide among the problems that he undertook and solved was the manufacture of artificial diamonds he first made pure charcoal by burning sugar this was packed with iron in the hollow of a block of lime into which extended from opposite sides the carbon rods connected to the dynamo when the iron had melted and dissolved all the carbon it could moissan dumped it into water or better into melted lead or into a hole in a copper block for this cooled it most rapidly after a crust was formed it was left to solidify slowly the sudden cooling of the iron on the outside subjected the carbon which was held in solution to intense pressure and when the bit of iron was dissolved in acid some of the carbon was found to be crystallized as diamond although most of it was graphite to be sure the diamonds were hardly big enough to be seen with the naked eye but since moissans aim was to make diamonds not big diamonds he ceased his efforts at this point to produce large diamonds the carbon would have to be liquefied in considerable quantity and kept in that state while it slowly crystallized but that could only be accomplished at a temperature and pressure and duration unattainable as yet under ordinary atmospheric pressure carbon passes over from the solid to the gaseous phase without passing through the liquid just as snow on a cold clear day will evaporate without melting probably some one in the future will take up the problem where moissan dropped it and find out how to make diamonds of any size but it is not a question that greatly interests either the scientist or the industrialist because there is not much to be learned from it and not much to be made out of it if the inventor of a process for making cheap diamonds could keep his electric furnace secretly in his cellar and market his diamonds cautiously he might get rich out of it but he would not dare to turn out very large stones or too many of them for if a suspicion got around that he was making them the price would fall to almost nothing even if he did sell another one for the high price of the diamond is purely fictitious it is in the first place kept up by limiting the output of the natural stone by the combination of dealers and further the diamond is valued not for its usefulness or beauty but by its real or supposed rarity chesterton says all is gold that glitters for the glitter is the gold this is not so true of gold for if gold were as cheap as nickel it would be very valuable since we should goldplate our machinery our ships our bridges and our roofs but if diamonds were cheap they would be good for nothing except grindstones and drills an imitation diamond made of heavy glass paste cannot be distinguished from the genuine gem except by an expert it sparkles about as brilliantly for its refractive index is nearly as high the reason why it is not priced so highly is because the natural stone has presumably been obtained through the toil and sweat of hundreds of negroes searching in the blue ground of the transvaal for many months it is valued exclusively by its cost to wear a diamond necklace is the same as hanging a certified check for 100000 by a string around the neck real values are enhanced by reduction in the cost of the price of production fictitious values are destroyed by it aluminum at twentyfive cents a pound is immensely more valuable to the world than when it is a curiosity in the chemists cabinet and priced at 160 a pound so the scope of the electric furnace reaches from the costly but comparatively valueless diamond to the cheap but indispensable steel as fj tone says if the automobile manufacturers were deprived of niagara products the abrasives aluminum acetylene for welding and highspeed tool steel a factory now turning out five hundred cars a day would be reduced to one hundred i have here been chiefly concerned with electricity as effecting chemical changes in combining or separating elements but i must not omit to mention its rapidly extending use as a source of heat as in the production and casting of steel in 1908 there were only fiftyfive tons of steel produced by the electric furnace in the united states but by 1918 this had risen to 511364 tons and besides ordinary steel the electric furnace has given us alloys of iron with the once rare metals that have created a new science of metallurgy chapter xiv metals old and new the primitive metallurgist could only make use of such metals as he found free in nature that is such as had not been attacked and corroded by the ubiquitous oxygen these were primarily gold or copper though possibly some original genius may have happened upon a bit of meteoric iron and pounded it out into a sword but when man found that the red ocher he had hitherto used only as a cosmetic could be made to yield iron by melting it with charcoal he opened a new era in civilization though doubtless the ocher artists of that day denounced him as a utilitarian and deplored the decadence of the times iron is one of the most timid of metals it has a great disinclination to be alone it is also one of the most altruistic of the elements it likes almost every other element better than itself it has an especial affection for oxygen and since this is in both air and water and these are everywhere iron is not long without a mate the result of this union goes by various names in the mineralogical and chemical worlds but in common language which is quite good enough for our purpose it is called iron rust illustration by courtesy mineral footenotes from agricolas de re metallica 1550 primitive furnace for smelting iron ore not many of us have ever seen iron the pure metal soft ductile and white like silver as soon as it is exposed to the air it veils itself with a thin film of rust and becomes black and then red for that reason there is practically no iron in the world except what man has made it is rarer than gold than diamonds we find in the earth no nuggets or crystals of it the size of the fist as we find of these but occasionally there fall down upon us out of the clear sky great chunks of it weighing tons these meteorites are the mavericks of the universe we do not know where they come from or what sun or planet they belonged to they are our only visitors from space and if all the other spheres are like these fragments we know we are alone in the universe for they contain rustless iron and where iron does not rust man cannot live nor can any other animal or any plant iron rusts for the same reason that a stone rolls down hill because it gets rid of its energy that way all things in the universe are constantly trying to get rid of energy except man who is always trying to get more of it or on second thought we see that man is the greatest spendthrift of all for he wants to expend so much more energy than he has that he borrows from the winds the streams and the coal in the rocks he robs minerals and plants of the energy which they have stored up to spend for their own purposes just as he robs the bee of its honey and the silk worm of its cocoon mans chief business is in reversing the processes of nature that is the way he gets his living and one of his greatest triumphs was when he discovered how to undo iron rust and get the metal out of it in the four thousand years since he first did this he has accomplished more than in the millions of years before without knowing the value of iron rust man could attain only to the culture of the aztecs and incas the ancient egyptians and assyrians the prosperity of modern states is dependent on the amount of iron rust which they possess and utilize england united states germany all nations are competing to see which can dig the most iron rust out of the ground and make out of it railroads bridges buildings machinery battleships and such other tools and toys and then let them relapse into rust again civilization can be measured by the amount of iron rusted per capita or better by the amount rescued from rust but we are devoting so much space to the consideration of the material aspects of iron that we are like to neglect its esthetic and ethical uses the beauty of nature is very largely dependent upon the fact that iron rust and in fact all the common compounds of iron are colored few elements can assume so many tints look at the paint pot caons of the yellowstone cheap glass bottles turn out brown green blue yellow or black according to the amount and kind of iron they contain we build a house of creamcolored brick varied with speckled brick and adorned with terra cotta ornaments of red yellow and green all due to iron iron rusts therefore it must be painted but what is there better to paint it with than iron rust itself it is cheap and durable for it cannot rust any more than a dead man can die and what is also of importance it is a good strong clean looking endurable color whenever we take a trip on the railroad and see the miles of cars the acres of roofing and wall the towns full of brick buildings we rejoice that iron rust is red not white or some leas satisfying color we do not know why it is so zinc and aluminum are metals very much like iron in chemical properties but all their salts are colorless why is it that the most useful of the metals forms the most beautiful compounds some say providence some say chance some say nothing but if it had not been so we would have lost most of the beauty of rocks and trees and human beings for the leaves and the flowers would all be white and all the men and women would look like walking corpses without color in the flower what would the bees and painters do if all the grass and trees were white it would be like winter all the year round if we had white blood in our veins like some of the insects it would be hard lines for our poets and what would become of our morality if we could not blush as for me i thrill to see the bloom a velvet cheek discloses made of dust i well believe it so are lilies so are roses an etiolated earth would be hardly worth living in the chlorophyll of the leaves and the hemoglobin of the blood are similar in constitution chlorophyll contains magnesium in place of iron but iron is necessary to its formation we all know how pale a plant gets if its soil is short of iron it is the iron in the leaves that enables the plants to store up the energy of the sunshine for their own use and ours it is the iron in our blood that enables us to get the iron out of iron rust and make it into machines to supplement our feeble hands iron is for us internally the carrier of energy just as in the form of a trolley wire or of a third rail it conveys power to the electric car withdraw the iron from the blood as indicated by the pallor of the cheeks and we become weak faint and finally die if the amount of iron in the blood gets too small the disease germs that are always attacking us are no longer destroyed but multiply without check and conquer us when the iron ceases to work efficiently we are killed by the poison we ourselves generate counting the number of ironbearing corpuscles in the blood is now a common method of determining disease it might also be useful in moral diagnosis a microscopical and chemical laboratory attached to the courtroom would give information of more value than some of the evidence now obtained for the anemic and the florid vices need very different treatment an excess or a deficiency of iron in the body is liable to result in criminality a chemical system of morals might be developed on this basis among the ferruginous sins would be placed murder violence and licentiousness among the nonferruginous cowardice sloth and lying the former would be mostly sins of commission the latter sins of omission the virtues could of course be similarly classified the ferruginous virtues would include courage selfreliance and hopefulness the nonferruginous peaceableness meekness and chastity according to this ethical criterion the moral man would be defined as one whose conduct is better than we should expect from the per cent of iron in his blood the reason why iron is able to serve this unique purpose of conveying lifegiving air to all parts of the body is because it rusts so readily oxidation and deoxidation proceed so quietly that the tenderest cells are fed without injury the blood changes from red to blue and vice versa with greater ease and rapidity than in the corresponding alternations of social status in a democracy it is because iron is so rustable that it is so useful the factories with big scrapheaps of rusting machinery are making the most money the pyramids are the most enduring structures raised by the hand of man but they have not sheltered so many people in their forty centuries as our skyscrapers that are already rusting we have to carry on this eternal conflict against rust because oxygen is the most ubiquitous of the elements and iron can only escape its ardent embraces by hiding away in the center of the earth the united elements known to the chemist as iron oxide and to the outside world as rust are among the commonest of compounds and their colors yellow and red like the spanish flag are displayed on every mountainside from the time of tubal cain man has ceaselessly labored to divorce these elements and having once separated them to keep them apart so that the iron may be retained in his service but here as usual man is fighting against nature and his gains as always are only temporary sooner or later his vigilance is circumvented and the metal that he has extricated by the fiery furnace returns to its natural affinity the flint arrowheads the bronze spearpoints the gold ornaments the wooden idols of prehistoric man are still to be seen in our museums but his earliest steel swords have long since crumbled into dust every year the blast furnaces of the world release 72000000 tons of iron from its oxides and every year a large part said to be a quarter of that amount reverts to its primeval forms if so then man after five thousand years of metallurgical industry has barely got three years ahead of nature and should he cease his efforts for a generation there would be little left to show that man had ever learned to extract iron from its ores the old question what becomes of all the pins may be as well asked of rails pipes and threshing machines the end of all iron is the same however many may be its metamorphoses while in the service of man it relapses at last into its original state of oxidation to save a pound of iron from corrosion is then as much a benefit to the world as to produce another pound from the ore in fact it is of much greater benefit for it takes four pounds of coal to produce one pound of steel so whenever a piece of iron is allowed to oxidize it means that four times as much coal must be oxidized in order to replace it and the beds of coal will be exhausted before the beds of iron ore if we are ever to get ahead if we are to gain any respite from this enormous waste of labor and natural resources we must find ways of preventing the iron which we have obtained and fashioned into useful tools from being lost through oxidation now there is only one way of keeping iron and oxygen from uniting and that is to keep them apart a very thin dividing wall will serve for the purpose for instance a film of oil but ordinary oil will rub off so it is better to cover the surface with an oillike linseed which oxidizes to a hard elastic and adhesive coating if with linseed oil we mix iron oxide or some other pigment we have a paint that will protect iron perfectly so long as it is unbroken but let the paint wear off or crack so that air can get at the iron then rust will form and spread underneath the paint on all sides the same is true of the porcelainlike enamel with which our kitchen iron ware is nowadays coated so long as the enamel holds it is all right but once it is broken through at any point it begins to scale off and gets into our food obviously it would be better for some purposes if we could coat our iron with another and less easily oxidized metal than with such dissimilar substances as paint or porcelain now the nearest relative to iron is nickel and a layer of this of any desired thickness may be easily deposited by electricity upon any surface however irregular nickel takes a bright polish and keeps it well so nickel plating has become the favorite method of protection for small objects where the expense is not prohibitive copper plating is used for fine wires a sheet of iron dipped in melted tin comes out coated with a thin adhesive layer of the latter metal such tinned plate commonly known as tin has become the favorite material for pans and cans but if the tin is scratched the iron beneath rusts more rapidly than if the tin were not there for an electrolytic action is set up and the iron being the negative element of the couple suffers at the expense of the tin with zinc it is quite the opposite zinc is negative toward iron so when the two are in contact and exposed to the weather the zinc is oxidized first a zinc plating affords the protection of a swiss guard it holds out as long as possible and when broken it perishes to the last atom before it lets the oxygen get at the iron the zinc may be applied in four different ways 1 it may be deposited by electrolysis as in nickel plating but the zinc coating is more apt to be porous 2 the sheets or articles may be dipped in a bath of melted zinc this gives us the familiar galvanized iron the most useful and when well done the most effective of rust preventives besides these older methods of applying zinc there are now two new ones 3 one is the schoop process by which a wire of zinc or other metal is fed into an oxyhydrogen air blast of such heat and power that it is projected as a spray of minute drops with the speed of bullets and any object subjected to the bombardment of this metallic mist receives a coating as thick as desired the zinc spray is so fine and cool that it may be received on cloth lace or the bare hand the schoop metallizing process has recently been improved by the use of the electric current instead of the blowpipe for melting the metal two zinc wires connected with any electric system preferably the direct are fed into the pistol where the wires meet an electric arc is set up and the melted zinc is sprayed out by a jet of compressed air 4 in the sherardizing process the articles are put into a tight drum with zinc dust and heated to 800 f the zinc at this temperature attacks the iron and forms a series of alloys ranging from pure zinc on the top to pure iron at the bottom of the coating even if this cracks in part the iron is more or less protected from corrosion so long as any zinc remains aluminum is used similarly in the calorizing process for coating iron copper or brass first a surface alloy is formed by heating the metal with aluminum powder then the temperature is raised to a high degree so as to cause the aluminum on the surface to diffuse into the metal and afterwards it is again baked in contact with aluminum dust which puts upon it a protective plating of the pure aluminum which does not oxidize illustration

cast iron carbon as graphite enlarged 500 times 4 steel composed of cementite white and pearlite black enlarged 50 times another way of protecting iron ware from rusting is to rust it this is a sort of prophylactic method like that adopted by modern medicine where inoculation with a mild culture prevents a serious attack of the disease the action of air and water on iron forms a series of compounds and mixtures of them those that contain least oxygen are hard black and magnetic like iron itself those that have most oxygen are red and yellow powders by putting on a tight coating of the black oxide we can prevent or hinder the oxidation from going on into the pulverulent stage this is done in several ways in the bowerbarff process the articles to be treated are put into a closed retort and a current of superheated steam passed through for twenty minutes followed by a current of producer gas carbon monoxide to reduce any higher oxides that may have been formed in the gesner process a current of gasoline vapor is used as the reducing agent the blueing of watch hands buckles and the like may be done by dipping them into an oxidizing bath such as melted saltpeter but in order to afford complete protection the layer of black oxide must be thickened by repeating the process which adds to the time and expense this causes a slight enlargement and the high temperature often warps the ware so it is not suitable for nicely adjusted parts of machinery and of course tools would lose their temper by the heat a new method of rust proofing which is free from these disadvantages is the phosphate process invented by thomas watts coslett an english chemist in 1907 and developed in america by the parker company of detroit this consists simply in dipping the sheet iron or articles into a tank filled with a dilute solution of iron phosphate heated nearly to the boiling point by steam pipes bubbles of hydrogen stream off rapidly at first then slower and at the end of half an hour or longer the action ceases and the process is complete what has happened is that the iron has been converted into a basic iron phosphate to a depth depending upon the density of articles processed any one who has studied elementary qualitative analysis will remember that when he added ammonia to his unknown solution iron and phosphoric acid if present were precipitated together or in other words iron phosphate is insoluble except in acids therefore a superficial film of such phosphate will protect the iron underneath except from acids this film is not a coating added on the outside like paint and enamel or tin and nickel plate it is therefore not apt to scale off and it does not increase the size of the article no high heat is required as in the sherardizing and bowerbarff processes so steel tools can be treated without losing their temper or edge the deposit consisting of ferrous and ferric phosphates mixed with black iron oxide may be varied in composition texture and color it is ordinarily a dull gray and oiling gives a soft mat black more in accordance with modern taste than the shiny nickel plating that delighted our fathers even the military nowadays show more quiet taste than formerly and have abandoned their glittering accoutrements the phosphate bath is not expensive and can be used continuously for months by adding more of the concentrated solution to keep up the strength and removing the sludge that is precipitated besides the iron the solution contains the phosphates of other metals such as calcium or strontium manganese molybdenum or tungsten according to the particular purpose since the phosphating solution does not act on nickel it may be used on articles that have been partly nickelplated so there may be produced for instance a bright raised design against a dull black background then too the surface left by the parker process is finely etched so it affords a good attachment for paint or enamel if further protection is needed even if the enamel does crack the iron beneath is not so apt to rust and scale off the coating these then are some of the methods which are now being used to combat our eternal enemy the rust that doth corrupt all of them are useful in their several ways no one of them is best for all purposes the claim of rustproof is no more to be taken seriously than fireproof we should rather if we were finical have to speak of rustresisting coatings as we do of slowburning buildings nature is insidious and unceasing in her efforts to bring to ruin the achievements of mankind and we need all the weapons we can find to frustrate her destructive determination but it is not enough for us to make iron superficially resistant to rust from the atmosphere we should like also to make it so that it would withstand corrosion by acids then it could be used in place of the large and expensive platinum or porcelain evaporating pans and similar utensils employed in chemical works this requirement also has been met in the noncorrosive forms of iron which have come into use within the last five years one of these tantiron invented by a british metallurgist robert n lennox in 1912 contains 15 per cent of silicon similar products are known as duriron and buflokast in america metilure in france ileanite in italy and neutraleisen in germany it is a silverywhite closegrained iron very hard and rather brittle somewhat like cast iron but with silicon as the main additional ingredient in place of carbon it is difficult to cut or drill but may be ground into shape by the new abrasives it is rustproof and is not attacked by sulfuric nitric or acetic acid hot or cold diluted or concentrated it does not resist so well hydrochloric acid or sulfur dioxide or alkalies the value of iron lies in its versatility it is a dozen metals in one it can be made hard or soft brittle or malleable tough or weak resistant or flexible elastic or pliant magnetic or nonmagnetic more or less conductive to electricity by slight changes of composition or mere differences of treatment no wonder that the medieval mind ascribed these mysterious transformations to witchcraft but the modern micrometallurgist by etching the surface of steel and photographing it shows it up as composite as a block of granite he is then able to pick out its component minerals ferrite austenite martensite pearlite graphite cementite and to show how their abundance shape and arrangement contribute to the strength or weakness of the specimen the last of these constituents cementite is a definite chemical compound an iron carbide fe3c containing 66 per cent of carbon so hard as to scratch glass very brittle and imparting these properties to hardened steel and cast iron with this knowledge at his disposal the ironmaker can work with his eyes open and so regulate his melt as to cause these various constituents to crystallize out as he wants them to besides he is no longer confined to the alloys of iron and carbon he has ransacked the chemical dictionary to find new elements to add to his alloys and some of these rarities have proved to possess great practical value vanadium for instance used to be put into a fine print paragraph in the back of the chemistry book where the class did not get to it until the term closed yet if it had not been for vanadium steel we should have no ford cars tungsten too was relegated to the rear and if the student remembered it at all it was because it bothered him to understand why its symbol should be w instead of t but the student of today studies his lesson in the light of a tungsten wire and relieves his mind by listening to a phonograph record played with a tungstone stylus when i was assistant in chemistry an analysis of steel consisted merely in the determination of its percentage of carbon and i used to take saturday for it so i could have time enough to complete the combustion now the chemists of a steel works laboratory may have to determine also the tungsten chromium vanadium titanium nickel cobalt phosphorus molybdenum manganese silicon and sulfur any or all of them and be spry about it because if they do not get the report out within fifteen minutes while the steel is melting in the electrical furnace the whole batch of 75 tons may go wrong im glad i quit the laboratory before they got to speeding up chemists so the quality of the steel depends upon the presence and the relative proportions of these ingredients and a variation of a tenth of 1 per cent in certain of them will make a different metal out of it for instance the steel becomes stronger and tougher as the proportion of nicked is increased up to about 15 per cent raising the percentage to 25 we get an alloy that does not rust or corrode and is nonmagnetic although both its component metals iron and nickel are by themselves attracted by the magnet with 36 per cent nickel and 5 per cent manganese we get the alloy known as invar because it expands and contracts very little with changes of temperature a bar of the best form of invar will expand less than onemillionth part of its length for a rise of one degree centigrade at ordinary atmospheric temperature for this reason it is used in watches and measuring instruments the alloy of iron with 46 per cent nickel is called platinite because its rate of expansion and contraction is the same as platinum and glass and so it can be used to replace the platinum wire passing through the glass of an electric light bulb a manganese steel of 11 to 14 per cent is too hard to be machined it has to be cast or ground into shape and is used for burglarproof safes and armor plate chrome steel is also hard and tough and finds use in files ball bearings and projectiles titanium which the ironmaker used to regard as his implacable enemy has been drafted into service as a deoxidizer increasing the strength and elasticity of the steel it is reported from france that the addition of threetenths of 1 per cent of zirconium to nickel steel has made it more resistant to the german perforating bullets than any steel hitherto known the new stainless cutlery contains 12 to 14 per cent of chromium with the introduction of harder steels came the need of tougher tools to work them now the virtue of a good tool steel is the same as of a good man it must be able to get hot without losing its temper steel of the oldfashioned sort as everybody knows gets its temper by being heated to redness and suddenly cooled by quenching or plunging it into water or oil but when the point gets heated up again as it does by friction in a lathe it softens and loses its cutting edge so the necessity of keeping the tool cool limited the speed of the machine but about 1868 a sheffield metallurgist robert f mushet found that a piece of steel he was working with did not require quenching to harden it he had it analyzed to discover the meaning of this peculiarity and learned that it contained tungsten a rare metal unrecognized in the metallurgy of that day further investigation showed that steel to which tungsten and manganese or chromium had been added was tougher and retained its temper at high temperature better than ordinary carbon steel tools made from it could be worked up to a white heat without losing their cutting power the new tools of this type invented by efficiency taylor at the bethlehem steel works in the nineties have revolutionized shop practice the world over a tool of the old sort could not cut at a rate faster than thirty feet a minute without overheating but the new tungsten tools will plow through steel ten times as fast and can cut away a ton of the material in an hour by means of these highspeed tools the united states was able to turn out five times the munitions that it could otherwise have done in the same time on the other hand if germany alone had possessed the secret of the modern steels no power could have withstood her a slight superiority in metallurgy has been the deciding factor in many a battle those of my readers who have had the advantages of sunday school training will recall the case described in i samuel 131922 by means of these new metals armor plate has been made invulnerableexcept to projectiles pointed with similar material flying has been made possible through engines weighing no more than two pounds per horse power the cylinders of combustion engines and the casing of cannon have been made to withstand the unprecedented pressure and corrosive action of the fiery gases evolved within castings are made so hard that they cannot be cutsave with tools of the same sort in the highspeed tools now used 20 or 30 per cent of the iron is displaced by other ingredients for example tungsten from 14 to 25 per cent chromium from 2 to 7 per cent vanadium from 12 to 112 per cent carbon from 6 to 8 per cent with perhaps cobalt up to 4 per cent molybdenum or uranium may replace part of the tungsten some of the newer alloys for highspeed tools contain no iron at all that which bears the poetic name of starstone stellite is composed of chromium cobalt and tungsten in varying proportions stellite keeps a hard cutting edge and gets tougher as it gets hotter it is very hard and as good for jewelry as platinum except that it is not so expensive cooperite its rival is an alloy of nickel and zirconium stronger lighter and cheaper than stellite before the war nearly half of the worlds supply of tungsten ore wolframite came from burma but although burma had belonged to the british for a hundred years they had not developed its mineral resources and the tungsten trade was monopolized by the germans all the ore was shipped to germany and the british admiralty was content to buy from the germans what tungsten was needed for armor plate and heavy guns when the war broke out the british had the ore supply but were unable at first to work it because they were not familiar with the processes germany being short of tungsten had to sneak over a little from baltimore in the submarine deutschland in the united states before the war tungsten ore was selling at 650 a unit but by the beginning of 1916 it had jumped to 85 a unit a unit is 1 per cent of tungsten trioxide to the ton that is twenty pounds boulder county colorado and san bernardino california then had mining booms reminding one of older times between may and december 1918 there was manufactured in the united states more than 45500000 pounds of tungsten steel containing some 8000000 pounds of tungsten if tungsten ores were more abundant and the metal more easily manipulated it would displace steel for many purposes it is harder than steel or even quartz it never rusts and is insoluble in acids its expansion by heat is onethird that of iron it is more than twice as heavy as iron and its melting point is twice as high its electrical resistance is half that of iron and its tensile strength is a third greater than the strongest steel it can be worked into wire 0002 of an inch in diameter almost too thin to be seen but as strong as copper wire ten times the size the tungsten wires in the electric lamps are about 03 of an inch in diameter and they give three times the light for the same consumption of electricity as the old carbon filament the american manufacturers of the tungsten bulb have very appropriately named their lamp mazda after the light god of the zoroastrians to get the tungsten into wire form was a problem that long baffled the inventors of the world for it was too refractory to be melted in mass and too brittle to be drawn dr wd coolidge succeeded in accomplishing the feat in 1912 by reducing the tungstic acid by hydrogen and molding the metallic powder into a bar by pressure this is raised to a white heat in the electric furnace taken out and rolled down and the process repeated some fifty times until the wire is small enough so it can be drawn at a red heat through diamond dies of successively smaller apertures the german method of making the lamp filaments is to squirt a mixture of tungsten powder and thorium oxide through a perforated diamond of the desired diameter the filament so produced is drawn through a chamber heated to 2500 c at a velocity of eight feet an hour which crystallizes the tungsten into a continuous thread the first metallic filament used in the electric light on a commercial scale was made of tantalum the metal of tantalus in the period 19051911 over 100000000 tantalus lamps were sold but tungsten displaced them as soon as that metal could be drawn into wire a recent rival of tungsten both as a filament for lamps and hardener for steel is molybdenum one pound of this metal will impart more resiliency to steel than three or four pounds of tungsten the molybdenum steel because it does not easily crack is said to be serviceable for armorpiercing shells gun linings airplane struts automobile axles and propeller shafts in combination with its rival as a tungstenmolybdenum alloy it is capable of taking the place of the intolerably expensive platinum for it resists corrosion when used for spark plugs and tooth plugs european steel men have taken to molybdenum more than americans the salts of this metal can be used in dyeing and photography calcium magnesium and aluminum common enough in their compounds have only come into use as metals since the invention of the electric furnace now the photographer uses magnesium powder for his flashlight when he wants to take a picture of his friends inside the house and the aviator uses it when he wants to take a picture of his enemies on the open field the flares prepared by our government for the war consist of a sheet iron cylinder four feet long and six inches thick containing a stick of magnesium attached to a tightly rolled silk parachute twenty feet in diameter when expanded the whole weighed 32 pounds on being dropped from the plane by pressing a button the rush of air set spinning a pinwheel at the bottom which ignited the magnesium stick and detonated a charge of black powder sufficient to throw off the case and release the parachute the burning flare gave off a light of 320000 candle power lasting for ten minutes as the parachute slowly descended this illuminated the ground on the darkest night sufficiently for the airman to aim his bombs or to take photographs the addition of 5 or 10 per cent of magnesium to aluminum gives an alloy magnalium that is almost as light as aluminum and almost as strong as steel an alloy of 90 per cent aluminum and 10 per cent calcium is lighter and harder than aluminum and more resistant to corrosion the latest german airplane the junker was made entirely of duralumin even the wings were formed of corrugated sheets of this alloy instead of the usual doped cottoncloth duralumin is composed of about 85 per cent of aluminum 5 per cent of copper 5 per cent of zinc and 2 per cent of tin when platinum was first discovered it was so cheap that ingots of it were gilded and sold as gold bricks to unwary purchasers the russian government used it as we use nickel for making small coins but this is an exception to the rule that the demand creates the supply platinum is really a rare metal not merely an unfamiliar one nowhere except in the urals is it found in quantity and since it seems indispensable in chemical and electrical appliances the price has continually gone up russia collapsed into chaos just when the war work made the heaviest demand for platinum so the governments had to put a stop to its use for jewelry and photography the gold brick scheme would now have to be reversed for gold is used as a cheaper metal to adulterate platinum all the members of the platinum family formerly ignored were pressed into service palladium rhodium osmium iridium and these alloyed with gold or silver were employed more or less satisfactorily by the dentist chemist and electrician as substitutes for the platinum of which they had been deprived one of these alloys composed of 20 per cent palladium and 80 per cent gold and bearing the telescoped name of palau palladium aurum makes very acceptable crucibles for the laboratory and only costs half as much as platinum rhotanium is a similar alloy recently introduced the points of our gold pens are tipped with an osmiumiridium alloy it is a pity that this family of noble metals is so restricted for they are unsurpassed in tenacity and incorruptibility they could be of great service to the world in war and peace as the bad child says in his book of beasts i shoot the hippopotamus with bullets made of platinum because if i use leaden ones his hide is sure to flatten em along in the latter half of the last century chemists had begun to perceive certain regularities and relationships among the various elements so they conceived the idea that some sort of a pigeonhole scheme might be devised in which the elements could be filed away in the order of their atomic weights so that one could see just how a certain element known or unknown would behave from merely observing its position in the series mendelef a russian chemist devised the most ingenious of such systems called the periodic law and gave proof that there was something in his theory by predicting the properties of three metallic elements then unknown but for which his arrangement showed three empty pigeonholes sixteen years later all three of these predicted elements had been discovered one by a frenchman one by a german and one by a scandinavian and named from patriotic impulse gallium germanium and scandium this was a triumph of scientific prescience as striking as the mathematical proof of the existence of the planet neptune by leverrier before it had been found by the telescope but although mendelefs law told the truth it gradually became evident that it did not tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth as the lawyers put it as usually happens in the history of science the hypothesis was found not to explain things so simply and completely as was at first assumed the anomalies in the arrangement did not disappear on closer study but stuck out more conspicuously though mendelef had pointed out three missing links he had failed to make provision for a whole group of elements since discovered the inert gases of the heliumargon group as we now know the scheme was built upon the false assumptions that the elements are immutable and that their atomic weights are invariable the elements that the chemists had most difficulty in sorting out and identifying were the heavy metals found in the rare earths there were about twenty of them so mixed up together and so much alike as to baffle all ordinary means of separating them for a hundred years chemists worked over them and quarreled over them before they discovered that they had a commercial value it was a problem as remote from practicality as any that could be conceived the man in the street did not see why chemists should care whether there were two didymiums any more than why theologians should care whether there were two isaiahs but all of a sudden in 1885 the chemical puzzle became a business proposition the rare earths became household utensils and it made a big difference with our monthly gas bills whether the ceria and the thoria in the burner mantles were absolutely pure or contained traces of some of the other elements that were so difficult to separate this sudden change of venue from pure to applied science came about through a viennese chemist dr carl auer later and in consequence known as baron auer von welsbach he was trying to sort out the rare earths by means of the spectroscopic method which consists ordinarily in dipping a platinum wire into a solution of the unknown substance and holding it in a colorless gas flame as it burns off each element gives a characteristic color to the flame which is seen as a series of lines when looked at through the spectroscope but the flash of the flame from the platinum wire was too brief to be studied so dr auer hit upon the plan of soaking a thread in the liquid and putting this in the gas jet the cotton of course burned off at once but the earths held together and when heated gave off a brilliant white light very much like the calcium or limelight which is produced by heating a stick of quicklime in the oxyhydrogen flame but these rare earths do not require any such intense heat as that for they will glow in an ordinary gas jet so the welsbach mantle burner came into use everywhere and rescued the coal gas business from the destruction threatened by the electric light it was no longer necessary to enrich the gas with oil to make its flame luminous for a cheaper fuel gas such as is used for a gas stove will give with a mantle a fine white light of much higher candle power than the ordinary gas jet the mantles are knit in narrow cylinders on machines cut off at suitable lengths soaked in a solution of the salts of the rare earths and dried artificial silk viscose has been found better than cotton thread for the mantles for it is solid not hollow more uniform in quality and continuous instead of being broken up into oneinch fibers there is a great deal of difference in the quality of these mantles as every one who has used them knows some that give a bright glow at first with the gascock only half open will soon break up or grow dull and require more gas to get any kind of a light out of them others will last long and grow better to the last slight impurities in the earths or the gas will speedily spoil the light the best results are obtained from a mixture of 99 parts thoria and 1 part ceria it is the ceria that gives the light yet a little more of it will lower the luminosity the nonchemical reader is apt to be confused by the strange names and their varied terminations but he need not be when he learns that the new metals are given names ending in um such as sodium cerium thorium and that their oxides compounds with oxygen the earths are given the termination a like soda ceria thoria so when he sees a name ending in um let him picture to himself a metal any metal since they mostly look alike lead or silver for example and when he comes across a name ending in a he may imagine a white powder like lime thorium for instance is as its name implies a metal named after the thunder god thor to whom we dedicate one day in each week thursday cerium gets its name from the roman goddess of agriculture by way of the asteroid the chief sources of the material for the welsbach burners is monazite a glittering yellow sand composed of phosphate of cerium with some 5 per cent of thorium in 1916 the united states imported 2500000 pounds of monazite from brazil and india most of which used to go to germany in 1895 we got over a million and a half pounds from the carolinas but the foreign sand is richer and cheaper the price of the salts of the rare metals fluctuates wildly in 1895 thorium nitrate sold at 200 a pound in 1913 it fell to 260 and in 1916 it rose to 8 since the monazite contains more cerium than thorium and the mantles made from it contain more thorium than cerium there is a superfluity of cerium the manufacturers give away a pound of cerium salts with every purchase of a hundred pounds of thorium salts it annoyed welsbach to see the cerium residues thrown away and accumulating around his mantle factory so he set out to find some use for it he reduced the mixed earths to a metallic form and found that it gave off a shower of sparks when scratched an alloy of cerium with 30 or 35 per cent of iron proved the best and was put on the market in the form of automatic lighters a big business was soon built up in austria on the basis of this obscure chemical element rescued from the dumpheap the sale of the cerite lighters in france threatened to upset the finances of the republic which derived large revenue from its monopoly of matchmaking so the french government imposed a tax upon every man who carried one american tourists who bought these lighters in germany used to be much annoyed at being held up on the french frontier and compelled to take out a license during the war the cerium sparklers were much used in the trenches for lighting cigarettes butas those who have seen the better ole will knowthey sometimes fail to strike fire auermetal or ceriumiron alloy was used in munitions to ignite hand grenades and to blazon the flight of trailer shells there are many other pyrophoric lightproducing alloys including steel which our ancestors used with flint before matches and percussion caps were invented there are more than fifty metals known and not half of them have come into common use so there is still plenty of room for the expansion of the science of metallurgy if the reader has not forgotten his arithmetic of permutations he can calculate how many different alloys may be formed by varying the combinations and proportions of these fifty we have seen how quickly elements formerly known only to chemistsand to some of them known only by namehave become indispensable in our daily life any one of those still unutilized may be found to have peculiar properties that fit it for filling a long unfelt want in modern civilization who for instance will find a use for gallium the metal of france it was described in 1869 by mendelef in advance of its advent and has been known in person since 1875 but has not yet been set to work it is such a remarkable metal that it must be good for something if you saw it in a museum case on a cold day you might take it to be a piece of aluminum but if the curator let you hold it in your handwhich he wontit would melt and run over the floor like mercury the melting point is 87 fahr it might be used in thermometers for measuring temperatures above the boiling point of mercury were it not for the peculiar fact that gallium wets glass so it sticks to the side of the tube instead of forming a clear convex curve on top like mercury then there is columbium the american metal it is strange that an element named after columbia should prove so impractical columbium is a metal closely resembling tantalum and tantalum found a use as electric light filaments a columbium lamp should appeal to our patriotism the socalled rare elements are really abundant enough considering the earths crust as a whole though they are so thinly scattered that they are usually overlooked and hard to extract but whenever one of them is found valuable it is soon found available a systematic search generally reveals it somewhere in sufficient quantity to be worked who then will be the first to discover a use for indium germanium terbium thulium lanthanum neodymium scandium samarium and others as unknown to us as tungsten was to our fathers as evidence of the statement that it does not matter how rare an element may be it will come into common use if it is found to be commonly useful we may refer to radium a good rich specimen of radium ore pitchblende may contain as much as one part in 4000000 madame curie the brilliant polish parisian had to work for years before she could prove to the world that such an element existed and for years afterwards before she could get the metal out yet now we can all afford a bit of radium to light up our watch dials in the dark the amount needed for this is infinitesimal if it were more it would scorch our skins for radium is an element in eruption the atom throws off corpuscles at intervals as a roman candle throws off blazing balls some of these particles the alpha rays are atoms of another element helium charged with positive electricity and are ejected with a velocity of 18000 miles a second some of them the beta rays are negative electrons only about one seventhousandth the size of the others but are ejected with almost the speed of light 186000 miles a second if one of the alpha projectiles strikes a slice of zinc sulfide it makes a splash of light big enough to be seen with a microscope so we can now follow the flight of a single atom the luminous watch dials consist of a coating of zinc sulfide under continual bombardment by the radium projectiles sir william crookes invented this radium light apparatus and called it a spinthariscope which is greek for sparkseer evidently if radium is so wasteful of its substance it cannot last forever nor could it have forever existed the elements then ate not necessarily eternal and immutable as used to be supposed they have a natural length of life they are born and die and propagate at least some of them do radium for instance is the offspring of ionium which is the greatgreatgrandson of uranium the heaviest of known elements putting this chemical genealogy into biblical language we might say uranium lived 5000000000 years and begot uranium x1 which lived 246 days and begot uranium x2 which lived 69 seconds and begot uranium 2 which lived 2000000 years and begot ionium which lived 200000 years and begot radium which lived 1850 years and begot niton which lived 385 days and begot radium a which lived 3 minutes and begot radium b which lived 268 minutes and begot radium c which lived 195 minutes and begot radium d which lived 12 years and begot radium e which lived 5 days and begot polonium which lived 136 days and begot lead the figures i have given are the times when half the parent substance has gone over into the next generation it will be seen that the chemist is even more liberal in his allowance of longevity than was moses with the patriarchs it appears from the above that half of the radium in any given specimen will be transformed in about 2000 years half of what is left will disappear in the next 2000 years half of that in the next 2000 and so on the reader can figure out for himself when it will all be gone he will then have the answer to the old eleatic conundrum of when achilles will overtake the tortoise but we may say that after 100000 years there would not be left any radium worth mentioning or in other words practically all the radium now in existence is younger than the human race the lead that is found in uranium and has presumably descended from uranium behaves like other lead but is lighter its atomic weight is only 206 while ordinary lead weighs 207 it appears then that the same chemical element may have different atomic weights according to its ancestry while on the other hand different chemical elements may have the same atomic weight this would have seemed shocking heresy to the chemists of the last century who prided themselves on the immutability of the elements and did not take into consideration their past life or heredity the study of these radioactive elements has led to a new atomic theory i suppose most of us in our youth used to imagine the atom as a little round hard ball but now it is conceived as a sort of solar system with an electropositive nucleus acting as the sun and negative electrons revolving around it like the planets the number of free positive electrons in the nucleus varies from one in hydrogen to 92 in uranium this leaves room for 92 possible elements and of these all but six are more or less certainly known and definitely placed in the scheme the atom of uranium weighing 238 times the atom of hydrogen is the heaviest known and therefore the ultimate limit of the elements though it is possible that elements may be found beyond it just as the planet neptune was discovered outside the orbit of uranus considering the position of uranium and its numerous progeny as mentioned above it is quite appropriate that this element should bear the name of the father of all the gods in these radioactive elements we have come upon sources of energy such as was never dreamed of in our philosophy the most striking peculiarity of radium is that it is always a little warmer than its surroundings no matter how warm these may be slowly spontaneously and continuously it decomposes and we know no way of hastening or of checking it whether it is cooled in liquefied air or heated to its melting point the change goes on just the same an ounce of radium salt will give out enough heat in one hour to melt an ounce of ice and in the next hour will raise this water to the boiling point and so on again and again without cessation for years a fire without fuel a realization of the philosophers lamp that the alchemists sought in vain the total energy so emitted is millions of times greater than that produced by any chemical combination such as the union of oxygen and hydrogen to form water from the heavy white salt there is continually rising a faint firemist like the willothewisp over a swamp this gas is known as the emanation or niton the shining one a pound of niton would give off energy at the rate of 23000 horsepower fine stuff to run a steamer one would think but we must remember that it does not last by the sixth day the power would have fallen off by half besides no one would dare to serve as engineer for the radiation will rot away the flesh of a living man who comes near it causing gnawing ulcers or curing them it will not only break down the complex and delicate molecules of organic matter but will attack the atom itself changing it is believed one element into another again the fulfilment of a dream of the alchemists and its rays unseen and unfelt by us are yet strong enough to penetrate an armorplate and photograph what is behind it but radium is not the most mysterious of the elements but the least so it is giving out the secret that the other elements have kept it suggests to us that all the other elements in proportion to their weight have concealed within them similar stores of energy astronomers have long dazzled our imaginations by calculating the horsepower of the world making us feel cheap in talking about our steam engines and dynamos when a minutest fraction of the waste dynamic energy of the solar system would make us all as rich as millionaires but the heavenly bodies are too big for us to utilize in this practical fashion and now the chemists have become as exasperating as the astronomers for they give us a glimpse of incalculable wealth in the meanest substance for wealth is measured by the available energy of the world and if a few ounces of anything would drive an engine or manufacture nitrogenous fertilizer from the air all our troubles would be over kipling in his sketch with the night mail and wells in his novel the world set free stretched their imaginations in trying to tell us what it would mean to have command of this power but they are a little hazy in their descriptions of the machinery by which it is utilized the atom is as much beyond our reach as the moon we cannot rob its vault of the treasure reading references the foregoing pages will not have achieved their aim unless their readers have become sufficiently interested in the developments of industrial chemistry to desire to

chemistry etc dr slosson is nothing short of a prodigy he is a triplestarred scientist man who can bring down the highest flying scientific fact and tame it so that any of us can live with it and sometimes even love it he can make a fairy tale out of coaltar dyes and a laboratory into a joyful playhouse while it continues functioning gloriously as a laboratory but to readers of creative chemistry it is wasting time to talk about dr slossons style chats on science which has just been published is made up of eightyfive brief chapters or sections or periods each complete in itself dealing with a gorgeous variety of subjects they go from popover stars to soda water from how old is disease to einstein in words of one syllable the reader can begin anywhere but when he begins he will ultimately read the entire series it is good science and good reading it contains some of the best writing dr slosson has ever done the boston transcript says these chats are even more fascinating were that possible than creative chemistry they are more marvelous than the most marvelous of fairy tales even an adequate review could give little idea of the treasures of modern scientific knowledge chats on science contains dr slosson has besides rare scientific knowledge that gift of the godsimagination chats on science by ee slosson is published by the century company 353
