publishers advertisement to meet the calls so frequently made upon as by intelligent visitors to our city for some work descriptive of the mammoth cave we are at length enabled to present the public a succinct but instructive narrative of a visit to this wonder of wonders from the pen of a gentleman who without professing to have explored all that is curious or beautiful or sublime in its vast recesses has yet seen every thing that has been seen by others and has described enough to quicken and enlighten the curiosity of those who have never visited it aware of the embarrassment which most persons experience who design visiting the cave owing to the absence of any printed itinerary of the various routes leading to it we have supplied in the present volume this desideratum from information received from reliable persons residing on the different roads here enumerated the road from louisville to the cave and thence to nashville is graded the entire distance and the greater part of it madamized from louisville to the mouth of salt river twenty miles the country is level with a rich alluvial soil probably at some former period the bed of a lake a few miles below the former place and extending to the latter a chain of elevated hills is seen to the southeast affording beautiful and picturesque situations for country seats and strangely overlooked by the rich and tasteful the river is crossed by a ferry and the traveler is put down at a comfortable inn in the village of west point two miles from the mouth of salt river begins the ascent of muldrows hill the road is excellent and having elevated hills on either side is highly romantic to its summit five miles from the top of this hill to elizabethtown the country is well settled though the improvements are generally indifferentthe soil thin but well adapted to smallgrain and oak the prevailing growth elizabethtown twentyfive miles from the mouth of salt river is quite a pretty and flourishing village built chiefly of brick with several churches and three large inns from this place to nolin creek the distance is ten miles here there is a small town containing some ten or twelve log houses a large saw and grist mill and a comfortable and very neat inn kept by mr mosher immediately after crossing this creek the traveler enters yankee street as the inhabitants style this section of the road for a distance of ten or twelve miles from nolin toward bacon creek the land belongs or did belong to the former postmaster general gideon granger and on either side of the road to the extent of mr gs possessions are settlements made by emigrants from new york and the new england states from bacon creek to munfordsville eight miles the country is pleasantly undulating and here indeed the whole route from elizabethtown to the cave passes through what was until recently a prairie or in the language of the country barrens and renders it highly interesting especially to the botanist from the multitude and variety of flowers with which it abounds during the spring and autumn months munfordsville and woodsonville directly opposite are situated on green river on high and broken ground they are small places in each of which however are comfortable inns boats laden with tobacco and other produce descend from this point and from a considerable distance above to new orleans about two and a half miles beyond munfordsville the new state road to the cave virtually made by dr croghan at a great expense leaves the turnpike and joins it again at the dripping springs eight miles below on the route to nashville this road in going from louisville to nashville is not only the shortest by three and a half miles but to the cave it is from ten to twelve miles shorter than the one taken by visiters previous to its construction it therefore lessens the inconvenience delay and consequent expense to which travelers were formerly subjected the road itself is an excellent one the country through which it passes highly picturesque and dr croghan has entitled himself to the gratitude of the traveling community by his liberality and enterprise in constructing it persons visiting the cave by steamer a boat leaves louisville for bowlinggreen every week will find much to interest them in the admirable locks and dams rendering the navigation of green river safe and good at all seasons for boats of a large class passengers can obtain conveyances at all times and at moderate rates from bowlinggreen by the dripping spring to the cave distant twentytwo miles fifteen miles of this road is madamized the remainder is graded and not inferior to the finished portion the last eight miles from the dripping spring to the cave cannot fail to excite the admiration of every one who delights in beholding wild and beautiful scenery a visit to the cedar springs on this route is alone worth a journey of many miles passengers on the upper turnpike from bardstown to nashville can on reaching glasgow at all times procure conveyances to the cave either by bells or by prewetts knob arrived at the cave the visitor alights at a spacious hotel the general arrangements attendance and cuisine of which are adapted to the most fastidious taste he feels that as far as the creature comforts are necessary to enjoyment the prospect is full of promise nor will he be disappointed and now this first and most important preliminary to a traveler settled to his perfect content he may remain for weeks and experience daily gratification stephen his guide in wandering through some of its two hundred and twentysix avenuesin gazing until he is oppressed with the feeling of their magnificence at some of its fortyseven domesin listening until their drowsy murmurs pain the sense to some of its many waterfallsor haply intent upon discovery he hails some new vista or fretted roof or secret river or unsounded lake or crystal fountain with as much rapture as balboa from that peak in darien gazed on the pacific he is assured that he has a poet and an historian too stephen has linked his name to dome or avenue or river and it is already immortalin the cave independent of the attractions to be found in the cave there is much above ground to gratify the different tastes of visiters there is a capacious ballroom ninety feet by thirty with a fine band of musica tenpin alleyromantic walks and carriagedrives in all directions rendered easy of access by the fine road recently finished the many rare and beautiful flowers in the immediate vicinity of the cave invite to exercise and bouquets as exquisite as were ever culled in garden or greenhouse may be obtained even as late as august the fine sport the neighborhood affords to the hunter and the anglergreen river just at hand offers such store of fish as father walton or his son and disciple cotton were they alive again would love to meditate and angle inand the woods capt scott or christopher north himself might grow weary of the sight of game winged or quadruped interesting facts 1 accidents of no kind have ever occurred in the mammoth cave 2 visiters going in or coming out of the cave are not liable to contract colds on the contrary colds are commonly relieved by a visit in the cave 3 no impure air exists in any part of the cave 4 reptiles of no description have ever been seen in the cave on the contrary they as well as quadrupeds avoid it 5 combustion is perfect in all parts of the cave 6 decomposition and consequent putrefaction are unobservable in all parts of the cave 7 the water of the cave is of the purest kind and besides fresh water there are one or two sulphur springs 8 there are two hundred and twentysix avenues in the cave fortyseven domes eight cataracts and twentythree pits 9 the temperature of the cave is 59 fahrenheit and remains so uniformly winter and summer 10 no sound not even the loudest peal of thunder is heard one quarter of a mile in the cave the author of rambles in the mammoth cave has written a scientific account of the cave embracing its geology mineralogy etc which we could not in time insert in this publication table of distances from louisville to mammoth cave medleys 10

cavekentucky cliffsthe churchsecond hoppersextent of the saltpetre manufacture in 1814 the mammoth cave is situated in the county of edmondson and state of kentucky equidistant from the cities of louisville and nashville about ninety miles from each and immediately upon the nearest road between those two places green river is within half a mile of the cave and since the improvements in its navigation by the construction of locks and dams steamboats can at all seasons ascend to bowling green distant but twentytwo miles and for the greater part of the year to the cave itself in going to the cave from munfordsville you will observe a lofty range of barren highlands to the north which approaches nearer and nearer the cave as you advance until it reaches to within a mile of it this range of highlands or cliffs composed of calcareous rock pursuing its rectilinear course is seen the greater part of the way as you proceed on towards bowling green and at last looses itself in the counties below under this extensive range of cliffs it is conjectured that the great subterranean territory mainly extends itself for a distance of two miles from the cave as you approach it from the southeast the country is level it was until recently a prairie on which however the oak chestnut and hickory are now growing and having no underbrush its smooth verdant openings present here and there no unapt resemblance to the parks of the english nobility emerging from these beautiful woodlands you suddenly have a view of the hotel and adjacent grounds which is truly lovely and picturesque the hotel is a large edifice two hundred feet long by fortyfive wide with piazzas sixteen feet wide extending the whole length of the building both above and below well furnished and kept in a style by mr miller that cannot fail to please the most fastidious epicure the cave is about twohundred yards from the hotel and you proceed to it down a lovely and romantic dell rendered umbrageous by a forest of trees and grape vines and passing by the ruins of saltpetre furnaces and large mounds of ashes you turn abruptly to the right and behold the mouth of the great cavern and as suddenly feel the coldness of its air it is an appalling spectaclehow dark how dismal how dreary descending some thirty feet down rather rude steps of stone you are fairly under the arch of this nether worldbefore you in looking outwards is seen a small stream of water falling from the face of the crowning rock with a wild faltering sound upon the ruins below and disappearing in a deep pitbehind you all is gloom and darkness let us now follow the guidewho placing on his back a canteen of oil lights the lamps and giving one to each person we commence our subterranean journey having determined to confine ourselves for this day to an examination of some of the avenues on this side of the rivers and to resume on a future occasion our visit to the fairy scenes beyond i emphasize the word some of the avenues because no visitor has ever yet seen one in twenty and although i shall attempt to describe only a few of them and in so doing will endeavor to represent things as i saw them and as they impressed me i am not the less apprehensive that my descriptions will appear as unbounded exaggerations so wonderfully vast is the cave so singular its formations and so unique its characteristics at the place where our lamps were lighted are to be seen the wooden pipes which conducted the water as it fell from the ceiling to the vats or saltpetre hoppers and near this spot too are interred the bones of a giant of such vast size is the skeleton at least of such portions of it as remain with regard to this giant or more properly skeleton it may be well to state that it was found by the saltpetre workers far within the cave years ago and was buried by their employer where it now lies to quiet their superstitious fears not however before it was bereft of its head by some fearless antiquary proceeding onward about onehundred feet we reached a door set in a rough stone wall stretched across and completely blocking up the cave which was no sooner opened than our lamps were extinguished by the violence of the wind rushing outwards an accurate estimate of the external temperature may at any time be made by noting the force of the wind as it blows inward or outward when it is very warm without the wind blows outwards with violence but when cold it blows inwards with proportionate force the temperature of the cave winter and summer is invariably the same59 fahrenheit and its atmosphere is perfectly uniform dry and of most extraordinary salubrity our lamps being relighted we soon reached a narrow passage faced on the left side by a wall built by the miners to confine the loose stone thrown up in the course of their operations when gradually descending a short distance we entered the great vestibule or antechamber of the cave what do we now see midnightthe blackness of darknessnothing where is the wall we were lately elbowing out of the way it has vanishedit is lost we are walled in by darkness and darkness canopies us above look againswing your torches aloft aye now you can see it far up a hundred feet above your head a grey ceiling rolling dimly away like a cloud and heavy buttresses bending under the weight curling and toppling over their base begin to project their enormous masses from the shadowy wall how vast how solemn how awful the little bells of the brain are ringing in your ears you hear nothing elsenot even a sigh of airnot even the echo of a drop of water falling from the roof the guide triumphs in your look of amazement and awe he falls to work on certain old wooden ruins to you yet invisible and builds a brace or two of fires by the aid of which you begin to have a better conception of the scene around you you are in the vestibule or antechamber to which the spacious entrance of the cave and the narrow passage that succeeds it should be considered the mere gateway and covered approach it is a basilica of an oval figuretwohundred feet in length by onehundred and fifty wide with a roof which is as flat and level as if finished by the trowel of the plasterer of fifty or sixty or even more feet in height two passages each a hundred feet in width open into it at its opposite extremities but at right angles to each other and as they preserve a straight course for five or sixhundred feet with the same flat roof common to each the appearance to the eye is that of a vast hall in the shape of the letter l expanded at the angle both branches being fivehundred feet long by onehundred wide the passage to the right hand is the great bat room audubon avenue that in the front the beginning of the grand gallery or the main cavern itself the whole of this prodigious space is covered by a single rock in which the eye can detect no break or interruption save at its borders where is a broad sweeping cornice traced in horizontal panelwork exceedingly noble and regular and not a single pier or pillar of any kind contributes to support it it needs no support it is like the arched and ponderous roof of the poets mausoleum by its own weight made stedfast and immoveable the floor is very irregularly broken consisting of vast heaps of the nitrous earth and of the ruins of the hoppers or vats composed of heavy planking in which the miners were accustomed to leach it the hall was in fact one of their chief factory rooms before their day it was a cemetery and here they disinterred many a mouldering skeleton belonging it seems to that gigantic eight or nine feet race of men of past days whose jawbones so many vivacious persons have clapped over their own like horsecollars without laying by a single one to convince the soul of scepticism such is the vestibule of the mammoth cavea hall which hundreds of visitors have passed through without being conscious of its existence the path leading into the grand gallery hugs the wall on the left hand and is besides in a hollow flanked on the right hand by lofty mounds of earth which the visitor if he looks at them at all which he will scarcely do at so early a period after entering will readily suppose to be the opposite walls those who enter the great bat room audubon avenue into which flying visitors are seldom conducted will indeed have some faint suspicion for a moment that they are passing through infinite space but the walls of the cave being so dark as to reflect not one single ray of light from the dim torches and a greater number of them being necessary to disperse the gloom than are usually employed they will still remain in ignorance of the grandeur around them such is the vestibule of the mammoth cave as described by the ingenious author of calavar peter pilgrim c from the vestibule we entered audubon avenue which is more than a mile long fifty or sixty feet wide and as many high the roof or ceiling exhibits as you walk along the appearance of floating cloudsand such is observable in many other parts of the cave near the termination of this avenue a natural well twentyfive feet deep and containing the purest water has been recently discovered it is surrounded by stalagmite columns extending from the floor to the roof upon the incrustations of which when lights are suspended the reflection from the water below and the various objects above and around gives to the whole scene an appearance equally rare and picturesque this spot however being difficult of access is but seldom visited the little bat room cavea branch of audubon avenueis on the left as you advance and not more than threehundred yards from the great vestibule it is but little more than a quarter of a mile in length and is remarkable for its pit of twohundred and eighty feet in depth and as being the hibernal resort of bats tens of thousands of them are seen hanging from the walls in apparently a torpid state during the winter but no sooner does the spring open than they disappear returning from the little bat room and audubon avenue we pass again through the vestibule and enter the main cave or grand gallery this is a vast tunnel extending for miles averaging throughout fifty feet in width by as many in height it is truly a noble subterranean avenue the largest of which man has any knowledge and replete with interest from its varied characteristics and majestic grandeur proceeding down the main cave about a quarter of a mile we came to the kentucky cliffs so called from the fancied resemblance to the cliffs on the kentucky river and descending gradually about twenty feet entered the church when our guide was discovered in the pulpit fifteen feet above us having reached there by a gallery which leads from the cliffs the ceiling here is sixty three feet high and the church itself including the recess cannot be less than one hundred feet in diameter eight or ten feet above and immediately behind the pulpit is the organ loft which is sufficiently capacious for an organ and choir of the largest size there would appear to be something like design in all thishere is a church large enough to accomodate thousands a solid projection of the wall of the cave to serve as a pulpit and a few feet back a place for an organ and choir in this great temple of nature religious service has been frequently held and it requires but a slight effort on the part of a speaker to make himself distinctly heard by the largest congregation sometimes the guides climb up the high and ragged sides and suspend lamps in the crevices and on the projections of the rock thus lighting up a scene of wild grandeur and sublimity concerts too have been held here and the melody of song has been heard such as would delight the ear of a catalini or a malibran leaving the church you will observe on ascending a large embankment of lixiviated earth thrown out by the miners more than thirty years ago the print of wagon wheels and the tracks of oxen as distinctly defined as though they were made but yesterday and continuing on for a short distance you arrive at the second hoppers here are seen the ruins of the old nitre works leaching vats pump frames and two lines of wooden pipes one to lead fresh water from the dripping spring to the vats filled with the nitrous earth and the other to convey the lye drawn from the large reservoir back to the furnace at the mouth of the cave the quantity of nitrous earth contained in the cave is sufficient to supply the whole population of the globe with saltpetre the dirt gives from three to five pounds of nitrate of lime to the bushel requiring a large proportion of fixed alkali to produce the required crystalization and when left in the cave become reimpregnated in three years when saltpetre bore a high price immense quantities were manufactured at the mammoth cave but the return of peace brought the saltpetre from the east indies in competition with the american and drove that of the produce of our country entirely from the market an idea may be formed of the extent of the manufacture of saltpetre at this cave from the fact that the contract for the supply of the fixed alkali alone for the cave for the year 1814 was twenty thousand dollars the price of the article was so high and the profits of the manufacturer so great as to set half the western world gadding after nitre cavesthe gold mines of the day cave hunting in fact became a kind of mania beginning with speculators and ending with hair brained young men who dared for the love of adventure the risk which others ran for profit every hole remarked an old miner the size of a mans body has been penetrated for miles around the mammoth cave but although we found petre earth we never could find a cave worth having chapter ii gothic gallerygothic avenuegood roadmummiesinteresting account of themgothic avenue once called haunted chamberwhy so named adventure of a miner in former days in looking from the ruins of the nitre works to the left and some thirty feet above you will see a large cave connected with which is a narrow gallery sweeping across the main cave and losing itself in a cave which is seen above to your right this latter cave is the gothic avenue which no doubt was at one time connected with the cave opposite and on the same level forming a complete bridge over the main avenue but afterwards broken down and separated by some great convulsion the cave on the left which is filled with sand has been penetrated but a short distance still from its great size at its entrance it is more than probable that were all obstructions removed it might be found to extend for miles illustration entrance to the gothic avenue on stone by t campbell bauer teschemachers lith while examining the old saltpetre works the guide left us without our being aware of it but casting our eyes around we perceived him standing some forty feet above on the projection of a huge rock or tower which commands a view of the grand gallery to a great extent both up and down leaving the main cave and ascending a flight of stairs twenty or thirty feet we entered the gothic avenue so named from the gothic appearance of some of its compartments this avenue is about forty feet wide fifteen feet high and two miles long the ceiling looks in many places as smooth and white as though it had been under the trowel of the most skilful plasterer a good road has been made throughout this cave and such is the temperature and purity of its atmosphere that every visitor must experience their salutary influences in a recess on the left hand elevated a few feet above the floor and about fifty feet from the head of the stairs leading up from the main avenue two mummies long since taken away were to be seen in 1813 they were in good preservation one was a female with her extensive wardrobe placed before her the removal of those mummies from the place in which they were found can be viewed as little less than sacrilege there they had been perhaps for centuries and there they ought to have been left what has become of them i know not one of them it is said was lost in the burning of the cincinnati museum the wardrobe of the female was given to a mr ward of massachusetts who i believe presented it to the british museum two of the miners found a mummy in audubon avenue in 1814 with a view to conceal it for a time they placed large stones over it and marked the walls about the spot so that they might find it at some future period this however they were never able to effect in 1840 the present hotel keeper mr miller learning the above facts went in search of the place designated taking with him very many lights and found the marks on the walls and near to them the mummy it was however so much injured and broken to pieces by the heavy weights which had been placed upon it as to be of little interest or value i have no doubt that if proper efforts were made mummies and other objects of curiosity might be found which would tend to throw light on the early history of the first inhabitants of this continent believing that whatever may relate to these mummies cannot fail to interest i will extract from the recently published narrative of a highly scientific gentleman of new york himself one of the early visitors to the cave on my first visit to the mammoth cave in 1813 i saw a relic of ancient times which requires a minute description this description is from a memorandum made in the cave at the time in the digging of saltpetre earth in the short cave a flat rock was met with by the workmen a little below the surface of the earth in the cave this stone was raised and was about four feet wide and as many long beneath it was a square excavation about three feet deep and as many in length and width in this small nether subterranean chamber sat in solemn silence one of the human species a female with her wardrobe and ornaments placed at her side the body was in a state of perfect preservation and sitting erect the arms were folded up and the hands were laid across the bosom around the two wrists was wound a small cord designed probably to keep them in the posture in which they were first placed around the body and next thereto was wrapped two deerskins these skins appear to have been dressed in some mode different from what is now practised by any people of whom i have any knowledge the hair of the skins was cut off very near the surface the skins were ornamented with the imprints of vines and leaves which were sketched with a substance perfectly white outside of these two skins was a large square sheet which was either wove or knit this fabric was the inner bark of a tree which i judge from appearances to be that of the linn tree in its texture and appearance it resembled the south sea island cloth or matting this sheet enveloped the whole body and the head the hair on the head was cut off within an eighth of an inch of the skin except near the neck where it was an inch long the color of the hair was a dark red the teeth were white and perfect i discovered no blemish upon the body except a wound between two ribs near the backbone one of the eyes had also been injured the finger and toe nails were perfect and quite long the features were regular i measured the length of one of the bones of the arm with a string from the elbow to the wrist joint and they equalled my own in length viz ten and a half inches from the examination of the whole frame i judged the figure to be that of a very tall female say five feet ten inches in height the body at the time it was first discovered weighed but fourteen pounds and was perfectly dry on exposure to the atmosphere it gained in weight by absorbing dampness four pounds many persons have expressed surprise that a human body of great size should weigh so little as many human skeletons of nothing but bone exceed this weight recently some experiments have been made in paris which have demonstrated the fact of the human body being reduced to ten pounds by being exposed to a heated atmosphere for a long period of time the color of the skin was dark not black the flesh was hard and dry upon the bones at the side of the body lay a pair of moccasins a knapsack and an indispensable or reticule i will describe these in the order in which i have named them the moccasins were made of wove or knit bark like the wrapper i have described around the top there was a border to add strength and perhaps as an ornament these were of middling size denoting feet of small size the shape of the moccasins differs but little from the deerskin moccasins worn by the northern indians the knapsack was of wove or knit bark with a deep strong border around the top and was about the size of knapsacks used by soldiers the workmanship of it was neat and such as would do credit as a fabric to a manufacturer of the present day the reticule was also made of knit or wove bark the shape was much like a horsemans valise opening its whole length on the top on the side of the opening and a few inches from it were two rows of hoops one row on each side two cords were fastened to one end of the reticule at the top which passed through the loop on one side and then on the other side the whole length by which it was laced up and secured the edges of the top of the reticule were strengthened with deep fancy borders the articles contained in the knapsack and reticule were quite numerous and are as follows one head cap made of wove or knit bark without any border and of the shape of the plainest night cap seven headdresses made of the quills of large birds and put together somewhat in the same way that feather fans are made except that the pipes of the quills are not drawn to a point but are spread out in straight lines with the top this was done by perforating the pipe of the quill in two places and running two cords through these holes and then winding around the quills and the cord fine thread to fasten each quill in the place designed for it these cords extended some length beyond the quills on each side so that on placing the feathers erect on the head the cords could be tied together at the back of the head this would enable the wearer to present a beautiful display of feathers standing erect and extending a distance above the head and entirely surrounding it these were most splendid head dresses and would be a magnificent ornament to the head of a female at the present dayseveral hundred strings of beads these consisted of very hard brown seed smaller than hemp seed in each of which a small hole had been made and through this hole a small three corded thread similar in appearance and texture to seine twine these were tied up in bunches as a merchant ties up coral beads when he exposes them for sale the red hoofs of fawns on a string supposed to be worn around the neck as a necklace these hoofs were about twenty in number and may have been emblematic of innocence the claw of an eagle with a hole made in it through which a cord was passed so that it could be worn pendent from the neck the jaw of a bear designed to be worn in the same manner as the eagles claw and supplied with a cord to suspend it around the neck two rattlesnakeskins one of these had fourteen rattles upon it these were neatly folded up some vegetable colors done up in leaves a small bunch of deer sinews resembling catgut in appearance several bunches of thread and twine two and three threaded some of which were nearly white seven needles some of these were of horn and some of bone they were smooth and appeared to have been much used these needles had each a knob or whirl on the top and at the other end were brought to a point like a large sail needle they had no eyelets to receive a thread the top of one of these needles was handsomely scalloped a handpiece made of deerskin with a hole through it for the thumb and designed probably to protect the hand in the use of the needle the same as thimbles are now used two whistles about eight inches long made of cane with a joint about one third the length over the joint is an opening extending to each side of the tube of the whistle these openings were about threefourths of an inch long and a quarter of an inch wide and had each a flat reed placed in the opening these whistles were tied together with a cord wound around them i have been thus minute in describing the mute witness from the days of other times and the articles which were deposited within her earthen house of the race of people to whom she belonged when living we know nothing and as to conjecture the reader who gathers from these pages this account can judge of the matter as well as those who saw the remnant of mortality in the subterranean chambers in which she was entombed the cause of the preservation of her body dress and ornaments is no mystery the dry atmosphere of the cave with the nitrate of lime with which the earth that covers the bottom of these nether palaces is so highly impregnated preserves animal flesh and it will neither putrify nor decompose when confined to its unchanging action heat and moisture are both absent from the cave and it is these two agents acting together which produce both animal and vegetable decomposition and putrefaction in the ornaments etc of this mute witness of ages gone we have a record of olden time from which in the absence of a written record we may draw some conclusions in the various articles which constituted her ornaments there were no metallic substances in the make of her dress there is no evidence of the use of any other machinery than the bone and horn needles the beads are of a substance of the use of which for such purposes

tenant of one of our modern tombs with the funeral shroud etc in a state of like preservation with this difference that with the present inhabitants of this section of the globe but few articles of ornament are deposited with the body the features of this ancient member of the human family much resembled those of a tall handsome american woman the forehead was high and the head well formed ye mouldering relics of a race departed your names have perished not a trace remains the gothic avenue was once called the haunted chamber and owed its name to an adventure that befell one of the miners in former days which is thus related by the author of calavar in the lower branch is a room called the salts room which produces considerable quantities of the sulphate of magnesia or of soda we forget whicha mineral that the proprietor of the cave did not fail to turn to account the miner in question was a new and raw handof course neither very well acquainted with the cave itself nor with the approved modes of averting or repairing accidents to which from the nature of their occupation the miners were greatly exposed having been sent one day in charge of an older workman to the salts room to dig a few sacks of the salt and finding that the path to this sequestered nook was perfectly plain and that from the haunted chambers being a single continuous passage without branches it was impossible to wander from it our hero disdained on his second visit to seek or accept assistance and trudged off to his work alone the circumstance being common enough he was speedily forgotten by his brother miners and it was not until several hours after when they all left off their toil for the more agreeable duty of eating their dinner that his absence was remarked and his heroical resolution to make his way alone to the salts room remembered as it was apparent from the time he had been gone that some accident must have happened to him half a dozen men most of them negroes stripped half naked their usual working costume were sent to hunt him up a task supposed to be of no great difficulty unless he had fallen into a pit in the meanwhile the poor miner it seems had succeeded in reaching the salts room filling his sack and retracing his steps half way back to the grand gallery when finding the distance greater than he thought it ought to be the conceit entered his unlucky brain that he might perhaps be going wrong no sooner had the suspicion struck him than he fell into a violent terror dropped his sack ran backwards then returned then ran back againeach time more frightened and bewildered than before until at last he ended his adventure by tumbling over a stone and extinguishing his lamp thus left in the dark not knowing where to turn frightened out of his wits besides he fell to remembering his sinsalways remembered by those who are lost in the caveand praying with all his might for succor but hours passed away and assistance came not the poor fellows frenzy increased he felt himself a doomed man he thought his terrible situation was a judgment imposed on him for his wickedness nay he even believed at last that he was no longer an inhabitant of the earththat he had been translated even in the body to the place of tormentin other words that he was in hell itself the prey of the devils who would presently be let loose upon him it was at this moment the miners in search of him made their appearance they lighted upon his sack lying where he had thrown it and set up a great shout which was the first intimation he had of their approach he started up and seeing them in the distance the half naked negroes in advance all swinging their torches aloft he not doubting they were those identical devils whose appearance he had been expecting took to his heels yelling lustily for mercy nor did he stop notwithstanding the calls of his amazed friends until he had fallen a second time over the rocks where he lay on his face roaring for pity until by dint of much pulling and shaking he was convinced that he was still in the world and the mammoth cave such is the story of the haunted chambers the name having been given to commemorate the incident chapter iii stalagmite pillarsthe bellvulcans furnaceregister rooms stalagmite hall or gothic chapeldevils armchairelephants headlovers leapnapoleons domesalts caveannettis dome resuming our explorations in this most interesting avenue we soon came in sight of stalagmite pillars reaching from the floor to the ceiling once perhaps white and translucent but now black and begrimed with smoke at this point we were startled by the hollow tread of our feet caused by the proximity of another large avenue underneath which the guide assured us he had often visited in this neighborhood too there are a number of stalactites one of which was called the bell which on being struck sounded like the deep bell of a cathedral but it now no longer tolls having been broken in twain by a visiter from philadelphia some years ago further on our way we passed louisas bower and vulcans furnace where there is a heap not unlike cinders in appearance and some dark colored water in which i suppose the great forger used to slake his iron and perhaps his bolts next in order and not very distant are the new and old register rooms here on the ceiling which is as smooth and white as if it had been finished off by the plasterer thousands of names have been traced by the smoke of a candlenames which can create no pleasing associations or recollections names unknown to fame and which might excite disgust when read for the first time on the ceiling which they have disfigured illustration stalagmite hall or gothic chapel on stone by t campbell bauer teschemachers lith soon after leaving the old register room we were halted by our guide who took from us all the lamps excepting one having made certain arrangements he cried aloud come on which we did and in a few moments entered an apartment of surprising grandeur and magnificence this apartment or hall is elliptical in shape and eighty feet long by fifty wide stalagmite columns of vast size nearly block up the two ends and two rows of pillars of smaller dimensions reaching from floor to ceiling and equidistant from the wall on either side extend its entire length against the pillars and in many places from the ceiling our lamps were hanging and lighting up the whole space exhibited to our enraptured sight a scene surpassingly grand and well calculated to inspire feelings of solemnity and awe this is the stalagmite hall or as some call it the gothic chapel which no one can see under such circumstances as did our party without being forcibly reminded of the old very old cathedrals of europe continuing our walk we came to the devils armchair this is a large stalagmite column in the centre of which is formed a capacious seat like most other visiters we seated ourselves in the chair of his satanic majesty and drank sulphur water dipped up from a small basin of rock near the foot of the chair further on we passed a number of stalactites and stalagmites napoleons breastwork behind which we found ashes and burnt cane the elephants head the curtain and arrived at last at the lovers leap the lovers leap is a large pointed rock projecting over a dark and gloomy hollow thirty or more feet deep our guide told us that the young ladies often asked their beaux to take the lovers leap but that he never knew any to love hard enough to attempt it we descended into the hollow immediately below the lovers leap and entered to the left and at rightangle with our previous course a passage or chasm in the rock three feet wide and fifty feet high which conducted us to the lower branch of the gothic avenue at the entrance of this lower branch is an immensely large flat rock called gatewoods dining table to the right of which is a cave which we penetrated as far as the cooling tuba beautiful basin of water six feet wide and three deepinto which a small stream of the purest water pours itself from the ceiling and afterwards finds its way into the flint pit at no great distance returning we wound around gatewoods dining table which nearly blocks up the way and continued our walk along the lower branch more than half a mile passing napoleons dome the cinder banks the crystal pool the salts cave etc etc descending a few feet and leaving the cave which continues onwards we entered on our right a place of great seclusion and grandeur called annettis dome through a crevice in the right wall of the dome is a waterfall the water issues in a stream a foot in diameter from a high cave in the side of the domefalls upon the solid bottom and passes off by a small channel into the cistern which is directly on the pathway of the cave the cistern is a large pit which is usually kept nearly full of water near the end of this branch the lower branch there is a crevice in the ceiling over the last spring through which the sound of water may be heard falling in a cave or open space above highly gratified with what we had now seen in the gothic avenue we concluded to pursue it no further but to retrace our steps to the main cave regretting however that we had not visited the salts cave a branch of the gothic avenue on being told when too late that it would have amply compensated us for our trouble being rich in fine specimens of epsom or glauber salts chapter iv the ballroomwillies springwandering willieoxstallsgiants coffinacuteangle or great bendrange of cabinscurative properties of the cave air long known we are now again in the main cave or grand gallery which continues to increase in interest as we advance eliciting from our party frequent and loud exclamations of admiration and wonder not many steps from the stairs leading down from the gothic avenue into the main cave is the ballroom so called from its singular adaptedness to such a purpose for there is an orchestra fifteen or eighteen feet high large enough to accommodate a hundred or more musicians with a gallery extending back to the level of the high embankment near the gothic avenue besides which the avenue here is lofty wide straight and perfectly level for several hundred feet at the trifling expense of a plank floor seats and lamps a ballroom might be had if not more splendid at all events more grand and magnificent than any other on earth the effect of music here would be truly inspiring but the awful solemnity of the place may in the opinion of many prevent its being used as a temple of terpsichore extremes we are told often meet the same objection has been urged against the caves being used for religious services no clergyman remarked a distinguished divine be he ever so eloquent could concentrate the attention of his congregation in such a place the god of nature speaks too loud here for man to be heard leaving these points to be settled as they may we will proceed onwards the road now is broad and fine and in many places dusty next in order is willies spring a beautifully fluted niche in the left hand wall caused by the continual attrition of water trickling down into a basin below this spring derives its name from that of a young gentleman the son of a highly respectable clergyman of cincinnati who in the spirit of romance assumed the name of wandering willie and taking with him his violin marched on foot to the cave wishing no better place in which to pass the night he selected this spot requesting the guide to call for him in the morning this he did and found him fast asleep upon his bed of earth with his violin beside himever since it has been called willies spring just beyond the spring and near the left wall is the place where the oxen were fed during the time of the miners and strewn around are a great many corncobs to all appearance and in fact perfectly sound although they have lain there for more than thirty years in this neighborhood is a niche of great size in the wall on the left and reaching from the roof to the bottom of a pit more than thirty feet deep down the sides of which water of the purest kind is continually dripping and is afterwards conducted to a large trough from which the invalids obtain their supply of water during their sojourn in the cave near the bottom this pit or well expands into a large room out of which there is no opening it is probable that richardsons spring in the deserted chambers is supplied from this well passing the well cave rocky cave etc etc we arrived at the giants coffin a huge rock on the right thus named from its singular resemblance in shape to a coffin its locality apart from its great size renders it particularly conspicuous as all must pass around it in leaving the main cave to visit the rivers and the thousand wonders beyond at this point commence those incrustations which portraying every imaginable figure on the ceiling afford full scope to the fanciful to picture what they will whether of birds or beasts or creeping things about a hundred yards beyond the coffin the cave makes a majestic curve and sweeping round the great bend or acuteangle resumes its general course here the guide ignited a bengal light this vast amphitheatre became illuminated and a scene of enchantment was exposed to our view poets may conceive but no language can describe the splendor and sublimity of the scene the rapturous exclamations of our party might have been heard from afar both up and down this place of wonders opposite to the great bend is the entrance of the sick room cave so called from the fact of the sudden sickness of a visiter a few years ago supposed to have been caused by his smoking with others cigars in one of its most remote and confined nooks immediately beyond the great bend a row of cabins built for consumptive patients commences all of these are framed buildings with the exception of two which are of stone they stand in line from thirty to one hundred feet apart exhibiting a picturesque yet at the same time a gloomy and mournful appearance they are well furnished and without question would with good and comfortable accommodations pure air and uniform temperature cure the pulmonary consumption the invalids in the cave ought to be cured but i doubt whether the cave air or any thing else can cure confirmed phthisis a knowledge of the curative properties of the cave air is not as is generally supposed of recent date it has been long known a physician of great respectability formerly a member of congress from the district adjoining the cave was so firmly convinced of the medical properties of its air as to express more than twenty years ago as his opinion that the state of kentucky ought to purchase it with a view to establish a hospital in one of its avenues again the author of calavar himself a distinguished professor of medicine makes the following remarks in relation to the cave air as far back as 1832 the date of his visit it is always temperate its purity judging from its effects on the lungs and from other circumstances is remarkable though in what its purity consists i know not but be its composition what it may it is certain its effects upon the spirits and bodily powers of visiters are extremely exhilarating and that it is not less salubrious than enlivening the nitre diggers were a famously healthy set of men it was a common and humane practice to employ laborers of enfeebled constitutions who were soon restored to health and strength though kept at constant labour and more joyous merry fellows were never seen the oxen of which several were kept day and night in the cave hauling the nitrous earth were after a month or two of toil in as fine condition for the shambles as if fattened in the stall the ordinary visiter though rambling a dozen hours or more over paths of the roughest and most difficult kind is seldom conscious of fatigue until he returns to the upper air and then it seems to him at least in the summer season that he has exchanged the atmosphere of paradise for that of a charnel warmed by steamall without is so heavy so dank so dead so mephitic awe and even apprehension if that has been felt soon yield to the influence of the delicious air of the cave and after a time a certain jocund feeling is found mingled with the deepest impressions of sublimity which there are so many objects to awaken i recommend all broken hearted lovers and dyspeptic dandies to carry their complaints to the mammoth cave where they will undoubtedly find themselves translated into very buxom and happy persons before they are aware of it illustration star chamber on stone by t campbell bauer teschemachers lith chapter v star chambersalts roomindian housescross roomsblack chambers a dinner partyhumble chutesolitary carefairy grottochief city or templelees descriptionreturn to the hotel the star chamber next attracted our attention it presents the most perfect optical illusion imaginable in looking up to the ceiling which is here very high you seem to see the very firmament itself studded with stars and afar off a comet with its long bright tail not far from this star chamber may be seen in a cavity in the wall on the right and about twenty feet above the floor an oak pole about ten feet long and six inches in diameter with two round sticks of half the thickness and three feet long tied on to it transversely at about four feet apart by means of a ladder we ascended to the cavity and found the pole to be firmly fixedone end resting on the bottom of the cavity and the other reaching across and forced into a crevice about three feet above we supposed that this was a ladder once used by the former inhabitants of the cave in getting the salts which are incrusted on the walls in many places doct locke of the medical college of ohio is however of the opinion that on it was placed a dead bodysimilar contrivances being used by some indian tribes on which to place their dead although thousands have passed the spot still this was never seen until the fall of 1841 ages have doubtless rolled by since this was placed here and yet it is perfectly sound even the bark which confines the transverse pieces shows no marks of decay we passed through some side cuts as they are called these are caves opening on the sides of the avenues and after running for some distance entering them again some of them exceed half a mile in length but most generally they are short in many of them quartz calcedony red ochre gypsum and salts are found the walking in this part of the avenue being rough we progressed but slowly until we reached the salts room here we found the walls and ceiling covered with salts hanging in crystals the least agitation of the air causing flakes of the crystals to fall like snow in the salts room are the indian houses under the rockssmall spaces or rooms completely coveredsome of which contain ashes and cane partly burnt the cross rooms which we next come to is a grand section of this avenue the ceiling has an unbroken span of one hundred and seventy feet without a column to support it the mouths of two caves are seen from this point neither of which we visited and much to our loss as will appear from the following extract from the notes on the mammoth cave by ef lee esq civil engineer in relation to one of themthe black chambers at the ruins in the black chambers there are a great many large blocks composed of different strata of rocks cemented together resembling the walls pedestals cornices etc of some old castle scattered over the bottom of the cave the avenue here is so wide as to make it quite a task to walk from one side to the other on the right hand beyond the ruins you enter the right branch on the same levelthe ceiling of which is regularly arched through the big chimneys you ascend into an upper room about the size of the main cave the bottom of which is higher than the ceiling of the one below proceeding on we soon heard the low murmurings of a waterfallthe sound of which becomes louder and louder as we advanced until we reached the cataract in the roof are perforations as large as a hogshead on the right hand side from which water is ever falling on ordinary occasions in not very large quantities but after heavy rainsin torrents and with a horrible roar that shakes the walls and resounds afar through the cave it is at such times that these cascades are worthy the name of cataracts which they bear the water falling into a great funnelshaped pit immediately vanishes here we concluded to dine and at quite a fashionable hour4 pm the guide arranged the plates knives and forks wineglasses etc on a huge table of rock and announceddinner is ready we filled our plates with the excellent viands prepared at the cave house and seating ourselves on the rocks or nitre earth partook of our repast with the gusto of gourmands and quaffing ever and anon wines which would have done credit to the astor or tremont house there may be remarked our corpulent friend b a great deal of romance in this way of eatingwith your plate on your lap and seated on a rock or a lump of nitre earthbut for my part i would rather dispense with the poetry of the thing and eat a good dinner whether above or below ground from off a bonafide table and seated in a good substantial chair the proprietor ought to have at all the watering places and they are numerous tables chairs and the necessary table furniture that visitors might partake of their collations in some degree of comfort the guide who by the way is a very intelligent and facetious fellow was much amused at the suggestion of our friend and remarked that the owner of the cave doct croghan lived near louisville and that the only way to get such fixings at the watering places was to write to him on the subject then said b for the sake of those who may follow after us i will take it upon myself to write from this point you have a view of the main avenue on our left pursuing its general course and exhibiting the same solemn grandeur as from the commencementand directly before us the way to the humble chute and the cataract the humble chute is the entrance to the solitary chambers before entering which we must crawl on our hands and knees some fifteen or twenty feet under a low arch it is appropriately named as is the solitary chambers which we have now entered you feel hereto use an expression of one of our partyout of the world without dwelling on the intervening objectsalthough they are numerous and not without interestwe will enter at once the fairy grotto of the solitary cave it is in truth a fairy grotto a countless number of stalactites are seen extending at irregular distances from the roof to the floor of various sizes and of the most fantastic shapessome quite straight some crooked some large and hollowforming irregularly fluted columns and some solid near the ceiling and divided lower down into a great number of small branches like the roots of trees exhibiting the appearance of a coral grove hanging our lamps to the incrustations on the columns the grove of stalactites became faintly lighted up disclosing a scene of extraordinary wildness and beauty this is nothing to what youll see on the other side of the rivers cries our guide smiling at our enthusiastic admiration with all its present beauty this grotto is far from being what it was before it was despoiled and robbed some eight or nine years ago by a set of vandals who through sheer wantonness broke many of the stalactites leaving them strewn on the floora disgustful memorial of their vulgar propensities and barbarianlike conduct returning from the fairy grotto we entered the main cave at the cataract and continued our walk to the chief city or temple which is thus described by lee in his notes on the mammoth cave the temple is an immense vault covering an area of two acres and covered by a single dome of solid rock one hundred and twenty feet high it excels in size the cave of staffa and rivals the celebrated vault in the grotto of antiparos which is said to be the largest in the world in passing through from one end to the other the dome appears to follow like the sky in passing from place to place on the earth in the middle of the dome there is a large mound of rocks rising on one side nearly to the top very steep and forming what is called the mountain when first i ascended this mound from the cave below i was struck with a feeling of awe more deep and intense than any thing that i had ever before experienced i could only observe the narrow circle which was illuminated immediately around me above and beyond was apparently an unlimited space in which the ear could catch not the slightest sound nor the eye find an object to rest upon it was filled with silence and darkness and yet i knew that i was beneath the earth and that this space however large it might be was actually bounded by solid walls my curiosity was rather excited than gratified in order that i might see the whole in one connected view i built fires in many places with the pieces of cane which i found scattered among the rocks then taking my stand on the mountain a scene was presented of surprising magnificence on the opposite side the strata of gray limestone breaking up by steps from the bottom could scarcely be discerned in the distance by the glimmering light above was the lofty dome closed at the top by a smooth oval slab beautifully defined in the outline from which the walls sloped away on the right and left into thick darkness every one has heard of the dome of the mosque of st sophia of st peters and st pauls they are never spoken of but in terms of admiration as the chief works of architecture and among the noblest and most stupendous examples of what man can do when aided by science and yet when compared with the dome of this temple they sink into comparative insignificance such is the surpassing grandeur of natures works illustration chief city or temple on stone by t campbell bauer teschemachers lith to us the temple seemed to merit the glowing description above given but what would lee think on being told that since the discovery of the rivers and the world of beauties beyond them not one person in fifty visits the temple or the fairy grotto they are now looked upon as tame and uninteresting the hour being now late we concluded to proceed no further but to return to the hotel where we arrived at 11 pm chapter vi arrival of a large partysecond visitlamps extinguishedlaughable confusionwooden bowldeserted chambersrichardsons sidesaddle pitthe labyrinthlouisas domegorins domebottomless pit separation of our party on being summoned to breakfast the next morning we ascertained that a large party of ladies and gentlemen had arrived during our absence who like ourselves were prepared to enter the cave they however were for hurrying over the rivers to the distant points beyondwe for examining leisurely the avenues on this side at 8 oclock both parties accompanied by their respective guides and making a very formidable array set out from the hotel happy in the anticipation of the sights to be seen it was amusing to hear the remarks and to witness the horror of some of the party on first beholding the mouth of the cave oh it is so frightfulit is so coldi cannot go in notwithstanding all this curiosity prevailed and down we wentarranged our lamps which being extinguished in passing through the doorway by the strong current of air rushing outwards there arose such a clamor such laughter such screaming such crying out for the guides as though all bedlam had broke loosethe guides exerting themselves to quiet apprehensions and the visiters of yesterday knowing that there was neither danger nor just cause of alarm doing their utmost to counteract their efforts by well feigned exclamations of terror at length the lamps were relighted and order being restored onward we went the vestibule and church were each in turn illuminated to the enthusiastic delight of alleven those of the party who were but now so terrified were loud in their expressions of admiration and wonder arrived at the giants coffin we leave the main cave to enter regions very dissimilar to those we have seen a narrow passage behind the coffin leads to a circular room one hundred feet in diameter with a low roof called the wooden bowl in allusion to its figure or as some say from a wooden bowl having been found here by some old miner this bowl is the vestibule of the deserted chambers on the right are the steeps of time why so called we are left to conjecture down which descending about twenty feet and almost perpendicularly for the first ten we enter the deserted chambers which in their course present features extremely wild terrific and multiform for two hundred yards the ceiling as you advance is rough and broken but further on it is waving white and smooth as if worn by water at richardsons spring the imprint of moccasins and of childrens feet of some bygone age were recently seen there are more pits in the deserted chambers than in any other portion of the cave and among the most noted are the covered pit the sidesaddle pit and the bottomless pit indeed the whole range of these chambers is so interrupted by pits and throughout is so irregular and serpentine and so bewildering from the number of its branches that the visiter doubtful of his footing and uncertain as to his course is soon made sensible of the prudence of the regulation which enjoins him not to leave the guide the covered pit is in a little branch to the left this pit is twelve or fifteen feet in diameter covered with a thin rock around which a narrow crevice extends leaving only a small support on one side there is a large rock resting on the centre of the cover the sound of a waterfall may be heard from the pit but cannot be seen the sidesaddle pit is about twenty feet long and eight feet wide with a margin about three feet high and extending lengthwise ten feet against which one may safely lean and view the interior of the pit and dome after a short walk from this place we came to a ladder on our right which conducted us down about fifteen feet into a narrow pass not more than five feet wide this pass is the labyrinth one end of which leads to the bottomless pit entering it about fifty feet down and the other after various windings now up now down over a bridge and up and down ladders conducts you to one of the chief glories of the cavegorins dome which strange to tell was not discovered until a few years ago immediately behind the ladder there is a narrow opening in the rock extending up very nearly to the cave above which leads about twenty feet back to louisas dome a pretty little place of not more than twelve feet in diameter but of twice that height this dome is directly under the centre of the cave we had just been traversing and when lighted up persons within it can be plainly seen from above through a crevice in the rock arrived at gorins dome we were forcibly struck by the seeming appearance of design in the arrangement of the several parts for the special accommodation of visiterseven with reference to their number the labyrinth which we followed up brought us at its termination to a window or hole about four feet square three feet above the floor opening into the interior of the dome about midway between the bottom and top the wall of rock being at this spot not more than eighteen inches thick and continuing around and on the outside of the dome along a gallery of a few feet in width for twenty or more paces we arrived at another opening of much larger size eligibly disposed and commanding like the first a view of very nearly the whole interior space whilst we are arranging ourselves the guide steals away passes down down one knows not how and is presently seen by the dim light of his lamp fifty feet below standing near the wall on the inside of the dome the dome is of solid rock with sides apparently fluted and polished and perhaps two hundred feet high immediately in front and about thirty feet from the window a huge rock seems suspended from above and arranged in folds like a curtain here we are then the guide fifty feet below us some of the party thrusting their heads and in their anxiety to see their bodies through the window into the vast and gloomy dome of two hundred feet in height the window is not large enough to afford a view to all at once they crowd one on the top of the other the more cautious and those who do not like to be squeezed stand back but still holding fast to the garments of their friends for fear they might in the ecstasy of their feelings leap into the frightful abyss into which they are looking suddenly the guide ignites a bengal light the vast dome is radiant with light above as far as the eye can reach are seen the shining sides of the fluted walls below the yawning gulf is rendered the more terrific by the pallid light exposing to view its vast depth the whole displaying a scene of sublimity and splendor such as words have not power to describe returning we ascended the ladder near louisas dome and continued on having the labyrinth on our right side until it terminates in the bottomless pit this pit terminates also the range of the deserted chambers and was considered the ultima thule of all explorers until within the last few years when mr stephenson of georgetown ky and the intrepid guide stephen conceived the idea of reaching the opposite side by throwing a ladder across the frightful chasm this they accomplished and on this ladder extending across a chasm of twenty feet wide and near two hundred deep did these daring explorers cross to the opposite side and thus open the way to all those splendid discoveries which have added so much to the value and renown of the mammoth cave the bottomless pit is somewhat in the shape of a horseshoe having a tongue of land twenty seven feet long running out into the middle of it from the end of this point of land a substantial bridge has been thrown across to the cave on the opposite side illustration bottomless pit on stone by t campbell bauer teschemachers lith while standing on the bridge the guide lets down a lighted paper into the deep abyss it descends twisting and turning lower and lower and is soon lost in total darkness leaving us to conjecture as to what may be below crossing the bridge to the opposite cave we find ourselves in the midst of rocks of the most gigantic size lying along the edge of the pit and on our left hand above the pit is a dome of great size but which from its position few have seen proceeding along a narrow passage for some distance we arrived at the point from which diverge two noted routesthe winding way and pensico avenue here we called a short halt then wishing our newly formed acquintances transcribers note sic a safe voyage over the deep waters we parted they taking the left hand to the winding way and the rivers and we the right to pensico avenue chapter vii pensico avenuegreat crossingspine apple bushangelicas grotto winding wayfat friend in troublerelief hallbacon chamber bandits hall pensico avenue averages about fifty feet in width with a height of about thirty feet and is said to be two miles long it unites in an eminent degree the truly beautiful with the sublime and is highly interesting throughout its entire extent for a quarter of a mile from the entrance the roof is beautifully arched about twelve feet high and sixty wide and formerly was encrusted with rosettes and other formations nearly all of which have been taken away or demolished leaving this section of the cave quite denuded the walking here is excellent a dozen persons might run abreast for a quarter of a mile to bunyans way a branch of the avenue leading on to the river at this point the avenue changes its features of beauty and regularity for those of wild grandeur and sublimity which it preserves to the end the way no longer smooth and level is frequently interrupted and turned aside by huge rocks which lie tumbled around in all imaginable disorder the roof now becomes very lofty and imposingly magnificent its long pointed or lancet arches forcibly reminding you of the rich and gorgeous ceilings of the old gothic cathedrals at the same time solemnly impressing you with the conviction that this is a building not made with hands no one not dead to all the more refined sensibilities of our nature but must exclaim in beholding the sublime scenes which here present themselves this is not the work of man no one can be here without being reminded of the all pervading presence of the great father of all what but god pervades adjusts and agitates the whole not far from the point at which the avenue assumes the rugged features which now characterize it we separated from our guide he continuing his straightforward course and we descending gradually a few feet and entering a tunnel of fifteen feet wide on our left the ceiling twelve or fourteen feet high perfectly arched and beautifully covered with white incrustations very soon reached the great crossings here the guide jumped down some six or eight feet from the avenue which we had left into the tunnel where we were standing and crossing it climbed up into the avenue which he pursued for a short distance or until it united with the tunnel where he again joined us in separating from then crossing and again uniting with the avenue it describes with it something like the figure 8 the name great crossings is not unapt it was however not given as our intelligent guide veritably assured us in honor of the great crossings where the man lives who killed tecumseh but because two great caves cross here and moreover said he the valiant colonel ought to change the name of his place as no two places in a state should bear the same name and this being the great place ought to have the preference not very far from this point we ascended a hill on our left and walking a short distance over our shoetops in dry nitrous earth in a direction somewhat at a right angle with the avenue below we arrived at the pine apple bush a large column composed of a white soft crumbling material with bifurcations extending from the floor to the ceiling at a short distance either to the right or left you have a fine view of the avenue some twenty feet below both up and down why this crumbling stalactite is called the pine apple bush i cannot divine it stands however in a charming secluded spot inviting to repose and we luxuriated in inhaling the allinspiring air while reclining on the clean soft and dry salt petre earth all lovers of romantic scenery ought to visit this avenue and all dyspeptic hypochondriacs and lovesick despondents should do likewise for there is something wonderfully exhilarating in the air of pensico our friend b remarked while rolling on the salt petre earth at the pine apple bush that he felt especially happy and whether from sympathy air or what not we all partook of the same feeling the guide seeing the position of our fat friend and hearing his remark said laughing most immoderately these sort of feelings would come over one now and then in the cave but wait till you get in the winding way and see how you feel then having descended into the avenue we had left we passed a number of stalactites and stalagmites bearing a remarkable resemblance to coral and a hundred or more paces beyond arrived at a recess on the left lined with innumerable crystals of dogtooth spar shining most brilliantly called angelicas grotto one would think it almost sacrilege to deface a spot like this yet did a clergyman the back of the guide being turned deliberately demolish a number of beautiful crystals to inscribe the initials of his name returning to the head of pensico avenue we turned to our right and entered the narrow pass which leads to the river pursuing which for a few hundred yards descending all the while at one or two places down a ladder or stone steps we came to a path cut through a high and broad embankment of sand which very soon conducted us to the much talked of and anxiously looked for winding way the winding way has in the opinion of many been channeled in the rock by the gradual attrition of water if this be so and appearances seem to support such belief at what early age of the world did the work commence was it not when the earth was without form and void thousands of years perhaps before the date of the mosaic account of the creation the winding way is one hundred and five feet long eighteen inches wide and from three to seven feet deep widening out above sufficiently to admit the free use of ones arms it is throughout tortuous a perfect zigzag the terror of the falstaffs and the ladies of fat fair and forty who have an instinctive dread of the trials to come and are well aware of the merriment that their efforts to force a passage will excite among their companions of less length of girdle into this winding way we entered in indian file and turning our right side then our left twisting this way then that had nearly made good the passage when our fat friend who was puffing and blowing behind us like a high pressure engine cried out halt ahead there i am stuck as tight as a wedge in a log halt we did when the guide looking at our friend who was in truth wedgd in the rocky way and sticking fast cried out i told you when you said at the pine apple bush that you felt especially happy to wait till you got to the winding way to see how you would feel then the imprisoned gentleman soon burst his bonds not however without damage to his indispensables and at length forcing his way into relief hall he cried out in the joy of his heart while stretching himself and wiping the perspiration from his jolly rubicund face never was a name more appropriate given to any placerelief i feel already the expansive faculty of the atmosphere i can now breathe again relief hall which you enter from the winding way at a rightangle is very wide and lofty but not long turning to the right we reached its termination at river hall a distance of perhaps one hundred yards here two routes present themselves the one to the left conducts to the dead sea and the rivers and that to the right to the bacon chamber the bandits hall the mammoth dome and an infinity of other caves domes etc we will speak of the bacon chamber but before doing so let us take our lunch the air or exercise or probably both acted as powerful appetizers and we soon gave proof that we needed not stoughtons bitters to provoke an appetite having discussed a few glasses of excellent hock we left the bacon chamber which is a pretty fair representation of a low ceiling thickly hung with canvassed hams and shoulders and proceeded to the bandits hall up a steep ascent of twenty or thirty feet rendered very difficult by the huge rocks which obstructed the way and over which we were forced to clamber the name is indicative of the spot it is a vast and lofty chamber the floor covered with a mountainous heap of rocks rising amphitheatrically almost to the ceiling and so disposed as to furnish at different elevations galleries or platforms reaching immediately around the chamber itself or leading off into some of its hidden recesses the guide is presently seen standing at a fearful height above and suddenly a bengal light blazes up when the rugged roof the frowning cliffs and the whole chaos of rocks are refulgent in the brilliant glare the sublimity of the scene is beyond the powers of the imagination chapter viii mammoth domefirst discovererslittle dometale of a lampreturn from the bandits hall diverge two caves one of which the left leads you to a multitude of domes and the right to one which par excellence is called the mammoth dome taking the right we arrived after a rugged walk of nearly a mile to a platform which commands an indistinct view of this dome of domes it was discovered by a german gentleman and the guide stephen about two years ago but was not explored until some months after when it was visited by a party of four or five accompanied by two guides and well prepared with ropes c from the platform the guides were let down about twenty feet by means of a rope and upon reaching the ground below they found themselves on the side of a hill which descending about fifty feet brought them immediately under the great dome from the summit of which there is a waterfall this dome is near four hundred feet high and is justly considered one of the most sublime and wonderful spectacles of this most wonderful of caverns from the bottom of the dome they ascended the hill to the place to which they had been lowered from the platform and continuing thence up a very steep hill more than one hundred feet they reached its summit arrived at the summit a scene of awful grandeur and magnificence is presented to the view looking down the declivity you see far below to the left the visiters whom you have left behind standing on the platform or termination of the avenue along which they had come and lower down still the bottom of the great dome itself above two hundred and eighty feet is the ceiling lost in the obscurity of space and distance the height of the ceiling was determined by ef lee civil engineer this fact in regard to the elevation of the ceiling and the locality of the great hall was subsequently ascertained by finding on the summit of the hill a spot never before trodden by man an iron lamp the astonishment of the guides as well as of the whole party on beholding the lamp can be easily imagined and to this day they would have been ignorant of its history but for the accidental circumstance of an old man being at the cave hotel who thirty years ago was engaged as a miner in the saltpetre establishment of wilkins gratz he on being shown the lamp said at once that it had been found under the crevice pit a fact that surprised all that during the time wilkins gratz were engaged in the manufacture of saltpetre a mr gatewood informed wilkins that in all probability the richest nitre earth was under the crevice pit the depth of this pit being then unknown wilkins to ascertain it got a rope of 45 feet long and fastening this identical lamp to the end of it lowered it into the pit in the doing of which the string caught on fire and down fell the lamp wilkins made an offer of two dollars to any one of the miners who would descend the pit and bring up the lamp his offer was accepted by a man who in consequence of his diminutive stature was nicknamed little dave and the rope being made fast about his waist he torch in hand was lowered to the full extent of the fortyfive feet being then drawn up the poor fellow was found to be so excessively alarmed that he could scarcely articulate but having recovered from his fright and again with the full power of utterance he declared that no money could tempt him to try again for the lamp and in excuse for such a determination he related the most marvellous story of what he had seenfar exceeding the wonderful things which the unexampled don quixote de la mancha declared he had seen in the deep cave of montesinos dave was in fact suspended at the height of two hundred and forty feet above the level below such is the history of the lamp as told by the old miner holton the correctness of which was very soon verified for guides having been sent to the place where the lamp was found and persons at the same time stationed at the mouth of the crevice pit their proximity was at once made manifest by the very audible sound of each others voices and by the fact that sticks thrown into the pit fell at the feet of the guides below and were brought out by them the distance from the mouth of the cave to this pit falls short of half a mile yet to reach the grand apartment immediately under it requires a circuit to be made of at least three miles the illumination of that portion of the great dome on the left and of the hall on the top of the hill to the right as seen from the platform was unquestionably one of the most impressive spectacles we had witnessed but to be seen to advantage another position ought to be taken by the spectator and the dome with its towering height and the hall on the summit of the hill with its gigantic stalagmite columns and ceiling two hundred feet high illuminated by the simultaneous ignition of a number of bengal lights judiciously arranged such was the enthusiastic admiration of some foreigners on witnessing an illumination of the great dome and hall that they declared it alone would compensate for a voyage across the atlantic with the partial illumination of the great dome we closed our explorations on this side of the rivers and retracing our steps reached the hotel about sunset at midnight the party which separated from us at the entrance of pensico avenue returned from the points beyond the echo river chapter ix third visitriver halldead seariver styxletheecho river purgatoryeyeless fishsupposed boil of the riverssources and outlet unknown early the next morning having made all the necessary preparations for the grand tour which we were the more anxious to take from the glowing accounts of the party recently returned we entered the cave immediately after an early breakfast and proceeded rapidly on to river hall it was evident from the appearance of the flood here that it had been recently overflown illustration river scene on stone by t campbell bauer teschemachers lith the cave or the river hall remarks a fair and distinguished authoress whose description of the river scenery is so graphic that i cannot do better than transcribe it throughout the river hall descends like the slope of a mountain the ceiling stretches awayaway before you vast and grand as the firmament at midnight going on and gradually ascending and keeping close to the right hand wall you observe on your left a steep precipice over which you can look down by the aid of blazing missiles upon a broad black sheet of water eighty feet below called the dead sea this is an awfully impressive place the sights and sounds of which do not easily pass from memory he who has seen it will have it vividly brought before him by alfieris description of filippo only a transient word or act gives us a short and dubious glimmer that reveals to us the abysses of his beingdark lurid and terrific as the throat of the infernal pool descending from the eminence by a ladder of about twenty feet we find ourselves among piles of gigantic rocks and one of the most picturesque sights in the world is to see a file of men and women passing along those wild and scraggy paths moving slowlyslowly that their lamps may have time to illuminate their skylike ceiling and gigantic wallsdisappearing behind high cliffssinking into ravinestheir lights shining upwards through fissures in the rocksthen suddenly emerging from some abrupt angle standing in the bright gleam of their lamps relieved by the towering black masses around them he who could paint the infinite variety of creation can alone give an adequate idea of this marvellous region as you pass along you hear the roar of invisible waterfalls and at the foot of the slope the river styx lies before you deep and black overarched with rock the first glimpse of it brings to mind the descent of ulysses into hell where the dark rock oerhangs the infernal lake and mingling streams eternal murmurs make across or rather down these unearthly waters the guide can convey but four passengers at once the lamps are fastened to the prow the images of which are reflected in the dismal pool if you are impatient of delay or eager for new adventures you can leave your companions lingering about the shore and cross the styx by a dangerous bridge of precipices overhead in order to do this you must ascend a steep cliff and enter a cave above 300 yards long from an egress of which you find yourself on the bank of the river eighty feet above its surface commanding a view of those in the boat and those waiting on the shore seen from this height the lamps in the canoe glare like fiery eyeballs and the passengers sitting there so hushed and motionless look like shadows the scene is so strangely funereal and spectral that it seems as if the greeks must have witnessed it before they imagined charon conveying ghosts to the dim regions of pluto your companions thus seen do indeed skim along the dusky glades thin airy souls and visionary shades if you turn your eyes from the canoe to the parties of men and women whom you left waiting on the shore you will see them by the gleam of their lamps scattered in picturesque groups looming out in bold relief from the dense darkness around them having passed the styx much the smallest of the rivers you walk over a pile of large rocks and are on the banks of lethe and looking back you will see a line of men and women descending the high hill from the cave which runs over the river styx here are two boats and the parties which have come by the two routes down the styx or over it uniting descend the lethe about a quarter of a mile the ceiling for the entire distance being very highcertainly not less than fifty feet on landing you enter a level and lofty hall called the great walk which stretches to the banks of the echo a distance of three or four hundred yards the echo is truly a river it is wide and deep enough at all times to float the largest steamer at the point of embarkation the arch is very low not more than three feet in an ordinary stage of water being left for a boat to pass through passengers of course are obliged to double up and lie upon each others shoulders in a most uncomfortable way but their suffering is of short duration in two boat lengths they emerge to where the vault of the cave is lofty and wide the boat in which we embarked was sufficiently large to carry twelve persons and our voyage down the river was one of deep indeed of most intense interest the novelty the grandeur the magnificence of every thing around elicited unbounded admiration and wonder all sense of danger had any been experienced before was lost in the solemn quiet sublimity of the scene the rippling of the water caused by the motion of our boat is heard afar off beating under the low arches and in the cavities of the rocks the report of a pistol is as that of the heaviest artillery and long and afar does the echo resound like the muttering of distant thunder the voice of song was raised on this dark deep water and the sound was as that of the most powerful choir a fall band of music on this river of echoes would indeed be overpowering the aquatic excursion was more to our taste than any thing we had seen and never can the impression it made be obliterated from our memories the echo is three quarters of a mile long a rise of the water of merely a few feet connects the three rivers after long and heavy rains these rivers sometimes rise to a perpendicular height of more than fifty feet and then they as well as the cataracts exhibit a most terrific appearance the low arch at the entrance of the echo can not be passed when there is a rise of water of even two feet once or twice parties have been caught on the further side by a sudden rise and for a time their alarm was great not knowing that there was an upper cave through which they could pass that would lead them around the arch to the great walk this upper cave or passage is called purgatory and is for a distance of forty feet so low that persons have to crawl on their faces or as the guides say snake it we were pleased to learn that this passage would soon be sufficiently enlarged to enable persons to walk through erect this accomplished an excursion to clevelands avenue may be made almost entirely by land at the same time that all apprehensions of being caught beyond echo will be removed it is in these rivers that the extraordinary white eyeless fish are caughtwe secured two of them there is not the slightest indication of an organ similar to an eye to be discovered they have been dissected by skillful anatomists who declare that they are not only without eyes but also develope other anomalies in their organization singularly interesting to the naturalist the rivers of mammoth cave were never crossed till 1840 great efforts have been made to discover whence they come and whither they go yet they still remain as much a mystery as everwithout beginning or end like eternity darkly thou glidest onward thou deep and hidden wave the laughing sunshine hath not lookd into thy secret cave thy current makes no music a hollow sound we hear a muffled voice of mystery and know that thou art near no brighter line of verdure follows thy lonely way no fairy moss or lilys cup is freshened by thy play according to the barometrical measurement of professor locke the rivers of the cave are nearly on a level with green river but the report of mr lee civil engineer is widely different he says the bottom of the little bat room pit is one hundred and twenty feet below the bed of green river the bottomless pit is also deeper than the bed of green river and so far as a surveyors level can be relied on the same may be said of the cavern pit and some others the rivers of the cave were unknown at the time of mr lees visit in 1835 but they are unquestionably lower than the bottom of the pits and receive the water which flows from them according to the statement of lee the bed of these rivers is lower than the bed of green river at its junction with the ohio taking for granted that the report of the state engineers as to the extent of fall between a point above the cave and the ohio be correct of which there is no doubt it becomes then continues mr lee in reference to the waters of the cave an object of interesting inquiry to determine in what way it is disposed of if it empties into green river the ohio or the ocean it must run a great distance under ground with a very small descent chapter x

hallserenas arbordining table dinner party and toasthoax of the guidehomeward bound passage conclusion having now left the echo we have a walk of four miles to clevelands avenue the intervening points are of great interest but it would occupy too much time to describe them we will therefore hurry on through the pass of el ghor sillimans avenue and wellingtons gallery to the foot of the ladder which leads up to the elysium of mammoth cave and here for the benefit of the weary and thirsty and of all others whom it may interest coming after us be it known that carneals spring is close at hand and equally near a sulphur spring the water of which equals in quality and quantity that of the farfamed white sulphur spring of virginia at the head of the ladder you find yourself surrounded by overhanging stalactites in the form of rich clusters of grapes hard as flint and round and polished as if done by a sculptors hand this is called marys vineyardthe commencement of clevelands avenue the crowning wonder and glory of this subterranean world proceeding to the right about a hundred feet from this spot over a rough and rather difficult way you reach the base of the height or hill on which stands the holy sepulchre this interesting spot is reached at some hazard as the ascent which is very steep and more than twenty feet high affords no secure footing owing to the loose and shingly character of the surface until the height is gained having achieved this you stand immediately at the beautiful doorway of the chapel or anteroom of the sepulchre this chapel which is perhaps twelve feet square with a low ceiling and decorated in the most gorgeous manner with wellarranged draperies of stalactite of every imaginable shape leads you to the room of the holy sepulchre adjoining which is without ornament or decoration of any kind exhibiting nothing but dark and bare wallslike a charnel house in the centre of this room which stands a few feet below the chapel is to all appearance a grave hewn out of the living rock this is the holy sepulchre a roman catholic priest discovered it about three years ago and with fervent enthusiasm exclaimed the holy sepulchre a name which it has since borne returning from the holy sepulchre we commence our wanderings through clevelands avenuean avenue three miles long seventy feet wide and twelve or fifteen feet highan avenue more rich and gorgeous than any ever revealed to manan avenue abounding in formations such as are no where else to be seen and which the most stupid observer could not behold without feelings of wonder and admiration some of the formations in the avenue have been denominated by professor locke oulophilites or curled leafed stone and in remarking upon them he says they are unlike any thing yet discovered equally beautiful for the cabinet of the amateur and interesting to the geological philosopher and i although a wanderer myself in various climes and somewhat of a mineralogist withal have never seen or heard of such apprehensive that i might in attempting to describe much that i have seen color too highly i will in lieu thereof offer the remarks of an intelligent clergyman extracted from the new york christian observer of a recent date the most imaginative poet never conceived or painted a palace of such exquisite beauty and loveliness as clevelands cabinet into which you now pass were the wealth of princes bestowed on the most skilful lapidaries with the view of rivaling the splendors of this single chamber the attempt would be vain how then can i hope to give you a conception of it you must see it and you will then feel that all attempt at description is futile the cabinet was discovered by mr patten of louisville and mr craig of philadelphia accompanied by the guide stephen and extends in nearly a direct line about one and a half miles the guides say two miles it is a perfect arch of fifty feet span and of an average height of ten feet in the centrejust high enough to be viewed with ease in all its parts it is incrusted from end to end with the most beautiful formations in every variety of form the base of the whole is carbonate sulphate of lime in part of dazzling whiteness and perfectly smooth and in other places crystallized so as to glitter like diamonds in the light growing from this in endlessly diversified forms is a substance resembling selenite translucent and imperfectly laminated it is most probably sulphate of lime a gypsum combined with sulphate of magnesia some of the crystals bear a striking resemblance to branches of celery and all about the same length while others a foot or more in length have the color and appearance of vanilla cream candy others are set in sulphate of lime in the form of a rose and others still roll out from the base in forms resembling the ornaments on the capitol of a corinthian column you see how i am driven for analogies some of the incrustations are massive and splendid others are as delicate as the lily or as fancywork of shell or wax think of traversing an arched way like this for a mile and a half and all the wonders of the tales of youtharabian nights and allseem tame compared with the living growing reality yes growing reality for the process is going on before your eyes successive coats of these incrustations have been perfected and crowded off by others so that hundreds of tons of these gems lie at your feet and are crushed as you pass while the work of restoring the ornaments for natures boudoir is proceeding around you here and there through the whole extent you will find openings in the sides into which you may thrust the person and often stand erect in little grottoes perfectly incrusted with a delicate white substance reflecting the light from a thousand glittering points all the way you might have heard us exclaiming wonderful wonderful o lord how manifold are thy works with general unity of form and appearance there is considerable variety in the cabinet the snowball room for example is a section of the cave described above some 200 feet in length entirely different from the adjacent parts its appearance being aptly indicated by its name if a hundred rude school boys had but an hour before completed their days sport by throwing a thousand snowballs against the roof while an equal number were scattered about the floor and all petrified it would have presented precisely such a scene as you witness in this room of natures frolics so far as i know these snowballs are a perfect anomaly among all the strange forms of crystalization it is the result i presume of an unusual combination of the sulphates of lime and magnesia with a carbonate of the former we found here and elsewhere in the cabinet fine specimens of the sulphate of magnesia or epsom salts a foot or two long and three inches in thickness leaving the quiet and beautiful cabinet you come suddenly upon the rocky mountains furnishing a contrast so bold and striking as almost to startle you clambering up the rough side some thirty feet you pass close under the roof of the cavern you have left and find before you an immense transverse cave 100 feet or more from the ceiling to the floor with a huge pile of rocks half filling the hither sidethey were probably dashed from the roof in the great earthquake of 1811 taking the left hand branch you are soon brought to croghans hall which is nine miles from the mouth and is the farthest point explored in that direction the hall is 50 or 60 feet in diameter and perhaps thirtyfive feet high of a semicircular form fronting you as you enter are massive stalactites ten or fifteen feet in length attached to the rock like sheets of ice and of a brilliant color the rock projects near the floor and then recedes with a regular and graceful curve or swell leaving a cavity of several feet in width between it and the floor at intervals around this swell stalactites of various forms are suspended and behind the sheet of stalactites first described are numerous stalagmites in fanciful forms i brought one away that resembles the horns of the deer being nearly translucent in the centre of this hall a very large stalactite hangs from the roof and a corresponding stalagmite rises from the floor about three feet in height and a foot in diameter of an amber color perfectly smooth and translucent like the other formations on the right is a deep pit down which the water dashes from a cascade that pours from the roof other avenues could most likely be found by sounding the sides of the pit if any one had the courage to attempt the descent we are far enough from terra supra and our dinner which we had left at the vineyard we hastened back to the rocky mountains and took the branch which we left at our right on emerging from the cabinet pursuing the uneven path for some distance we reached serenas arbor which was discovered but three months since by our guide mat the descent to the arbor seemed so perilous from the position of the loose rocks around that several of the party would not venture those of us who scrambled down regarded this as the crowning object of interest the arbor is not more than twelve feet in diameter and of about the same height of a circular form but is of itself floor sides roof and ornaments one perfect seamless stalactite of a beautiful hue and exquisite workmanship folds or blades of stalactitic matter hang like drapery around the sides reaching half way to the floor and opposite the door a canopy of stone projects elegantly ornamented as if it were the restingplace of a fairy bride every thing seemed fresh and new indeed the invisible architect has not quite finished this masterpiece for you can see the pure water trickling down its tiny channels and perfecting the delicate points of some of the stalactites victoria with all her splendor has not in windsor castle so beautiful an apartment as serenas arbor such is the description of clevelands avenue as given by this clerical gentleman it is perfectly graphic and corresponds with all the glowing accounts i have read of this famous place exquisitely beautiful and rare as are the formations in this avenue it will soon be i fear like the grotto of pensicoshorn of its beauties many a little miss to decorate her centre table or boudoir and many a thoughtless dandy to present a specimen to his lady fair have broken from the walls regardless of the published rules prohibiting it those lovely productions of the almighty which required ages to perfect thus destroying in a moment the work of centuries these beautiful and gorgeous formations were encrusted on the walls by the hands of our maker and who so impious as to desecrate themto tear them from their place there they are all lovely and beautiful and there they ought to remain untouched by the hands of man for the admiration and wonder of all future ages if the comparatively small cave of adelburg which belongs to the emperor of austria be placed for the preservation of its formations under the protecting care of the government transcribers note sic as is the case what ought not to be done to preserve the mineralogical treasures in this great cave of america and especially in clevelands cabinet which are worth more than all the caves in europe indeed of the world so far as our knowledge of caverns extends returning from serenas arbor we passed on our left the mouth of an avenue more than three miles long lofty and wide and at its termination there is a hall which in the opinion of the guide is larger than any other in the cave it is as yet without a name equidistant from the commencement and the termination of clevelands avenue is a huge rock nearly circular flat on the top and three feet high this is the dining table more than one hundred persons could be seated around this table on it the guide arranged our dinner and we luxuriated on flesh and fowl and choice old sherry never did a set of fellows enjoy dinner more than we did ours our friend b was perfectly at his ease and happy and in the exuberance of his spirits proposed the following toast prosperity to the subterranean territory of cimmeria large enough if not populous enough for admission into the union as an independent state we emptied our glasses and gave nine hearty cheers in honor of the sentiment a proposition was made to adjourn but b was not inclined to locomotion and opposed it with great warmth insisting that it was too soon to move after such a dinner and that a state of rest was absolutely essential to healthy digestion we had much argument on the motion to adjourn when our sagacious guide stephen with a meaning look interposed saying we had as well be going for the river might take a rise and shut us up here what exclaimed b in utter consternation and with a start literally bouncing from his seat cried aloud lets be off at the same time suiting the action to the word in a second we were all in motion and hurrying past beautiful incrustations through galleries long and tortuous down one hill and up another poor b puffing and blowing and all the while exclaiming against the terrible length and ruggedness of the way we at last reached the echo which we found to our great relief had not risen it seems the guide had used this stratagem for our own advantage to break off our banquet lest it trenched too far upon the night we were too happy in having our fears relieved to fall out with him on our homeward bound passage over the rivers our admiration was rather increased than diminished the deathlike stillness the awful silence the wild grandeur and sublimity of the scene tranquilizing the feeling and disposing to pensive musings and quiet contemplation on a sudden a pistol is fireda tremendous report ensuesits echoes are heard reverberating from wall to wall in caves far away like the low murmuring sound of distant thunderthe spell of silence and deep reverie is brokenwe become roused and animated and the mighty cavern resounds with our song we believe every one will under similar circumstances experience this sudden transition from pensive musings to joyous hilarity leaving the rivers we hastened onward to the outlet to the upper world far ahead we perceive the first dawnings of day shining with a silvery pallid hue on the walls and increasing in brightness as we advance until it bursts forth in all the golden rays and glorious effulgence of the setting sun this parting scene is lovely and interesting we bid adieu to the great monarch of caves we here terminate our subterranean tour standing on the grassy terrace above we inhale the cool pure air and take a last look at the great wonder of wonders to all we would say go and seeexplore the greatest of the almightys subterranean works no description can give you an idea of itneither can inspection of other caves it is the monarch of caves none that have ever been measured can at all compare with it in extent in grandeur in wild solemn serene unadorned majesty it stands entirely aloneit has no brother it has no brother end of the project gutenberg ebook
