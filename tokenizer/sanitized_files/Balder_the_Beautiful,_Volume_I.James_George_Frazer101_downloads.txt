beautiful vol i balder the beautiful the firefestivals of europe and the doctrine of the external soul jg frazer dcl lld littd fellow of trinity college cambridge professor of social anthropology in the university of liverpool in two volumes vol i 1913 preface in this concluding part of the golden bough i have discussed the problem which gives its title to the whole work if i am right the golden bough over which the king of the wood dianas priest at aricia kept watch and ward was no other than a branch of mistletoe growing on an oak within the sacred grove and as the plucking of the bough was a necessary prelude to the slaughter of the priest i have been led to institute a parallel between the king of the wood at nemi and the norse god balder who was worshipped in a sacred grove beside the beautiful sogne fiord of norway and was said to have perished by a stroke of mistletoe which alone of all things on earth or in heaven could wound him on the theory here suggested both balder and the king of the wood personified in a sense the sacred oak of our aryan forefathers and both had deposited their lives or souls for safety in the parasite which sometimes though rarely is found growing on an oak and by the very rarity of its appearance excites the wonder and stimulates the devotion of ignorant men though i am now less than ever disposed to lay weight on the analogy between the italian priest and the norse god i have allowed it to stand because it furnishes me with a pretext for discussing not only the general question of the external soul in popular superstition but also the firefestivals of europe since fire played a part both in the myth of balder and in the ritual of the arician grove thus balder the beautiful in my hands is little more than a stalkinghorse to carry two heavy packloads of facts and what is true of balder applies equally to the priest of nemi himself the nominal hero of the long tragedy of human folly and suffering which has unrolled itself before the readers of these volumes and on which the curtain is now about to fall he too for all the quaint garb he wears and the gravity with which he stalks across the stage is merely a puppet and it is time to unmask him before laying him up in the box to drop metaphor while nominally investigating a particular problem of ancient mythology i have really been discussing questions of more general interest which concern the gradual evolution of human thought from savagery to civilization the enquiry is beset with difficulties of many kinds for the record of mans mental development is even more imperfect than the record of his physical development and it is harder to read not only by reason of the incomparably more subtle and complex nature of the subject but because the readers eyes are apt to be dimmed by thick mists of passion and prejudice which cloud in a far less degree the fields of comparative anatomy and geology my contribution to the history of the human mind consists of little more than a rough and purely provisional classification of facts gathered almost entirely from printed sources if there is one general conclusion which seems to emerge from the mass of particulars i venture to think that it is the essential similarity in the working of the less developed human mind among all races which corresponds to the essential similarity in their bodily frame revealed by comparative anatomy but while this general mental similarity may i believe be taken as established we must always be on our guard against tracing to it a multitude of particular resemblances which may be and often are due to simple diffusion since nothing is more certain than that the various races of men have borrowed from each other many of their arts and crafts their ideas customs and institutions to sift out the elements of culture which a race has independently evolved and to distinguish them accurately from those which it has derived from other races is a task of extreme difficulty and delicacy which promises to occupy students of man for a long time to come indeed so complex are the facts and so imperfect in most cases is the historical record that it may be doubted whether in regard to many of the lower races we shall ever arrive at more than probable conjectures since the last edition of the golden bough was published some thirteen years ago i have seen reason to change my views on several matters discussed in this concluding part of the work and though i have called attention to these changes in the text it may be well for the sake of clearness to recapitulate them here in the first place the arguments of dr edward westermarck have satisfied me that the solar theory of the european firefestivals which i accepted from w mannhardt is very slightly if at all supported by the evidence and is probably erroneous the true explanation of the festivals i now believe to be the one advocated by dr westermarck himself namely that they are purificatory in intention the fire being designed not as i formerly held to reinforce the suns light and heat by sympathetic magic but merely to burn or repel the noxious things whether conceived as material or spiritual which threaten the life of man of animals and of plants this aspect of the firefestivals had not wholly escaped me in former editions i pointed it out explicitly but biassed perhaps by the great authority of mannhardt i treated it as secondary and subordinate instead of primary and dominant out of deference to mannhardt for whose work i entertain the highest respect and because the evidence for the purificatory theory of the fires is perhaps not quite conclusive i have in this edition repeated and even reinforced the arguments for the solar theory of the festivals so that the reader may see for himself what can be said on both sides of the question and may draw his own conclusion but for my part i cannot but think that the arguments for the purificatory theory far outweigh the arguments for the solar theory dr westermarck based his criticisms largely on his own observations of the mohammedan firefestivals of morocco which present a remarkable resemblance to those of christian europe though there seems no reason to assume that herein africa has borrowed from europe or europe from africa so far as europe is concerned the evidence tends strongly to shew that the grand evil which the festivals aimed at combating was witchcraft and that they were conceived to attain their end by actually burning the witches whether visible or invisible in the flames if that was so the wide prevalence and the immense popularity of the firefestivals provides us with a measure for estimating the extent of the hold which the belief in witchcraft had on the european mind before the rise of christianity or rather of rationalism for christianity both catholic and protestant accepted the old belief and enforced it in the old way by the faggot and the stake it was not until human reason at last awoke after the long slumber of the middle ages that this dreadful obsession gradually passed away like a dark cloud from the intellectual horizon of europe yet we should deceive ourselves if we imagined that the belief in witchcraft is even now dead in the mass of the people on the contrary there is ample evidence to show that it only hibernates under the chilling influence of rationalism and that it would start into active life if that influence were ever seriously relaxed the truth seems to be that to this day the peasant remains a pagan and savage at heart his civilization is merely a thin veneer which the hard knocks of life soon abrade exposing the solid core of paganism and savagery below the danger created by a bottomless layer of ignorance and superstition under the crust of civilized society is lessened not only by the natural torpidity and inertia of the bucolic mind but also by the progressive decrease of the rural as compared with the urban population in modern states for i believe it will be found that the artisans who congregate in towns are far less retentive of primitive modes of thought than their rustic brethren in every age cities have been the centres and as it were the lighthouses from which ideas radiate into the surrounding darkness kindled by the friction of mind with mind in the crowded haunts of men and it is natural that at these beacons of intellectual light all should partake in some measure of the general illumination no doubt the mental ferment and unrest of great cities have their dark as well as their bright side but among the evils to be apprehended from them the chances of a pagan revival need hardly be reckoned another point on which i have changed my mind is the nature of the great aryan god whom the romans called jupiter and the greeks zeus whereas i formerly argued that he was primarily a personification of the sacred oak and only in the second place a personification of the thundering sky i now invert the order of his divine functions and believe that he was a skygod before he came to be associated with the oak in fact i revert to the traditional view of jupiter recant my heresy and am gathered like a lost sheep into the fold of mythological orthodoxy the good shepherd who has brought me back is my friend mr w warde fowler he has removed the stone over which i stumbled in the wilderness by explaining in a simple and natural way how a god of the thundering sky might easily come to be afterwards associated with the oak the explanation turns on the great frequency with which as statistics prove the oak is struck by lightning beyond any other tree of the wood in europe to our rude forefathers who dwelt in the gloomy depths of the primaeval forest it might well seem that the riven and blackened oaks must indeed be favourites of the skygod who so often descended on them from the murky cloud in a flash of lightning and a crash of thunder this change of view as to the great aryan god necessarily affects my interpretation of the king of the wood the priest of diana at aricia if i may take that discarded puppet out of the box again for a moment on my theory the priest represented jupiter in the flesh and accordingly if jupiter was primarily a skygod his priest cannot have been a mere incarnation of the sacred oak but must like the deity whose commission he bore have been invested in the imagination of his worshippers with the power of overcasting the heaven with clouds and eliciting storms of thunder and rain from the celestial vault the attribution of weathermaking powers to kings or priests is very common in primitive society and is indeed one of the principal levers by which such personages raise themselves to a position of superiority above their fellows there is therefore no improbability in the supposition that as a representative of jupiter the priest of diana enjoyed this reputation though positive evidence of it appears to be lacking lastly in the present edition i have shewn some grounds for thinking that the golden bough itself or in common parlance the mistletoe on the oak was supposed to have dropped from the sky upon the tree in a flash of lightning and therefore to contain within itself the seed of celestial fire a sort of smouldering thunderbolt this view of the priest and of the bough which he guarded at the peril of his life has the advantage of accounting for the importance which the sanctuary at nemi acquired and the treasure which it amassed through the offerings of the faithful for the shrine would seem to have been to ancient what loreto has been to modern italy a place of pilgrimage where princes and nobles as well as commoners poured wealth into the coffers of diana in her green recess among the alban hills just as in modern times kings and queens vied with each other in enriching the black virgin who from her holy house on the hillside at loreto looks out on the blue adriatic and the purple apennines such pious prodigality becomes more intelligible if the greatest of the gods was indeed believed to dwell in human shape with his wife among the woods of nemi these are the principal points on which i have altered my opinion since the last edition of my book was published the mere admission of such changes may suffice to indicate the doubt and uncertainty which attend enquiries of this nature the whole fabric of ancient mythology is so foreign to our modern ways of thought and the evidence concerning it is for the most part so fragmentary obscure and conflicting that in our attempts to piece together and interpret it we can hardly hope to reach conclusions that will completely satisfy either ourselves or others in this as in other branches of study it is the fate of theories to be washed away like childrens castles of sand by the rising tide of knowledge and i am not so presumptuous as to expect or desire for mine an exemption from the common lot i hold them all very lightly and have used them chiefly as convenient pegs on which to hang my collections of facts for i believe that while theories are transitory a record of facts has a permanent value and that as a chronicle of ancient customs and beliefs my book may retain its utility when my theories are as obsolete as the customs and beliefs themselves deserve to be i cannot dismiss without some natural regret a task which has occupied and amused me at intervals for many years but the regret is tempered by thankfulness and hope i am thankful that i have been able to conclude at least one chapter of the work i projected a long time ago i am hopeful that i may not now be taking a final leave of my indulgent readers but that as i am sensible of little abatement in my bodily strength and of none in my ardour for study they will bear with me yet a while if i should attempt to entertain them with fresh subjects of laughter and tears drawn from the comedy and the tragedy of mans endless quest after happiness and truth jg frazer cambridge 17th october 1913 contents preface pp vxii chapter ibetween heaven and earth pp 121 1 not to touch the earth pp 118the

imitations of the sun 334 the wheel which is sometimes used to kindle the fire by friction may also be an imitation of the sun 334336 the influence which the bonfires are supposed to exert on the weather and vegetation may be thought to be due to an increase of solar heat produced by the fires 336338 the effect which the bonfires are supposed to have in fertilizing cattle and women may also be attributed to an increase of solar heat produced by the fires 338 sq the carrying of lighted torches about the country at the festivals may be explained as an attempt to diffuse the suns heat 339341 3 the purificatory theory of the firefestivals pp 341346theory that the fires at the festivals are purificatory being intended to burn up all harmful things 341 the purificatory or destructive effect of the fires is often alleged by the people who light them and there is no reason to reject this explanation 341 sq the great evil against which the fire at the festivals appears to be directed is witchcraft 342 among the evils for which the firefestivals are deemed remedies the foremost is cattledisease and cattledisease is often supposed to be an effect of witchcraft 343 sq again the bonfires are thought to avert hail thunder lightning and various maladies all of which are attributed to the maleficent arts of witches 344 sq the burning wheels rolled down hill and the burning discs thrown into the air may be intended to burn the invisible witches 345 sq on this view the fertility supposed to follow the use of fire results indirectly from breaking the spells of witches 346 on the whole the theory of the purificatory or destructive intention of the firefestivals seems the more probable 346 transcribers note the brief descriptions often found enclosed in square brackets are sidenotes which appeared in the original book in the margins of the paragraph following the sidenote footnotes were originally at the bottoms of the printed pages chapter i between heaven and earth 1 not to touch the earth the priest of aricia and the golden bough we have travelled far since we turned our backs on nemi and set forth in quest of the secret of the golden bough with the present volume we enter on the last stage of our long journey the reader who has had the patience to follow the enquiry thus far may remember that at the outset two questions were proposed for answer why had the priest of aricia to slay his predecessor and why before doing so had he to pluck the golden bough1 of these two questions the first has now been answered the priest of aricia if i am right was one of those sacred kings or human divinities on whose life the welfare of the community and even the course of nature in general are believed to be intimately dependent it does not appear that the subjects or worshippers of such a spiritual potentate form to themselves any very clear notion of the exact relationship in which they stand to him probably their ideas on the point are vague and fluctuating and we should err if we attempted to define the relationship with logical precision all that the people know or rather imagine is that somehow they themselves their cattle and their crops are mysteriously bound up with their divine king so that according as he is well or ill the community is healthy or sickly the flocks and herds thrive or languish with disease and the fields yield an abundant or a scanty harvest the worst evil which they can conceive of is the natural death of their ruler whether he succumb to sickness or old age for in the opinion of his followers such a death would entail the most disastrous consequences on themselves and their possessions fatal epidemics would sweep away man and beast the earth would refuse her increase nay the very frame of nature itself might be dissolved to guard against these catastrophes it is necessary to put the king to death while he is still in the full bloom of his divine manhood in order that his sacred life transmitted in unabated force to his successor may renew its youth and thus by successive transmissions through a perpetual line of vigorous incarnations may remain eternally fresh and young a pledge and security that men and animals shall in like manner renew their youth by a perpetual succession of generations and that seedtime and harvest and summer and winter and rain and sunshine shall never fail that if my conjecture is right was why the priest of aricia the king of the wood at nemi had regularly to perish by the sword of his successor what was the golden bough but we have still to ask what was the golden bough and why had each candidate for the arician priesthood to pluck it before he could slay the priest these questions i will now try to answer sacred kings and priests forbidden to touch the ground with their feet it will be well to begin by noticing two of those rules or taboos by which as we have seen the life of divine kings or priests is regulated the first of the rules to which i desire to call the readers attention is that the divine personage may not touch the ground with his foot this rule was observed by the supreme pontiff of the zapotecs in mexico he profaned his sanctity if he so much as touched the ground with his foot2 montezuma emperor of mexico never set foot on the ground he was always carried on the shoulders of noblemen and if he lighted anywhere they laid rich tapestry for him to walk upon3 for the mikado of japan to touch the ground with his foot was a shameful degradation indeed in the sixteenth century it was enough to deprive him of his office outside his palace he was carried on mens shoulders within it he walked on exquisitely wrought mats4 the king and queen of tahiti might not touch the ground anywhere but within their hereditary domains for the ground on which they trod became sacred in travelling from place to place they were carried on the shoulders of sacred men they were always accompanied by several pairs of these sanctified attendants and when it became necessary to change their bearers the king and queen vaulted on to the shoulders of their new bearers without letting their feet touch the ground5 it was an evil omen if the king of dosuma touched the ground and he had to perform an expiatory ceremony6 within his palace the king of persia walked on carpets on which no one else might tread outside of it he was never seen on foot but only in a chariot or on horseback7 in old days the king of siam never set foot upon the earth but was carried on a throne of gold from place to place8 formerly neither the kings of uganda nor their mothers nor their queens might walk on foot outside of the spacious enclosures in which they lived whenever they went forth they were carried on the shoulders of men of the buffalo clan several of whom accompanied any of these royal personages on a journey and took it in turn to bear the burden the king sat astride the bearers neck with a leg over each shoulder and his feet tucked under the bearers arms when one of these royal carriers grew tired he shot the king on to the shoulders of a second man without allowing the royal feet to touch the ground in this way they went at a great pace and travelled long distances in a day when the king was on a journey the bearers had a special hut in the kings enclosure in order to be at hand the moment they were wanted9 among the bakuba or rather bushongo a nation in the southern region of the congo down to a few years ago persons of the royal blood were forbidden to touch the ground they must sit on a hide a chair or the back of a slave who crouched on hands and feet their feet rested on the feet of others when they travelled they were carried on the backs of men but the king journeyed in a litter supported on shafts10 among the ibo people about awka in southern nigeria the priest of the earth has to observe many taboos for example he may not see a corpse and if he meets one on the road he must hide his eyes with his wristlet he must abstain from many foods such as eggs birds of all sorts mutton dog bushbuck and so forth he may neither wear nor touch a mask and no masked man may enter his house if a dog enters his house it is killed and thrown out as priest of the earth he may not sit on the bare ground nor eat things that have fallen on the ground nor may earth be thrown at him11 according to ancient brahmanic ritual a king at his inauguration trod on a tigers skin and a golden plate he was shod with shoes of boars skin and so long as he lived thereafter he might not stand on the earth with his bare feet12 certain persons on certain occasions forbidden to touch the ground with their feet but besides persons who are permanently sacred or tabooed and are therefore permanently forbidden to touch the ground with their feet there are others who enjoy the character of sanctity or taboo only on certain occasions and to whom accordingly the prohibition in question only applies at the definite seasons during which they exhale the odour of sanctity thus among the kayans or bahaus of central borneo while the priestesses are engaged in the performance of certain rites they may not step on the ground and boards are laid for them to tread on13 at a funeral ceremony observed by night among the michemis a tibetan tribe near the northern frontier of assam a priest fantastically bedecked with tigers teeth manycoloured plumes bells and shells executed a wild dance for the purpose of exorcising the evil spirits then all fires were extinguished and a new light was struck by a man suspended by his feet from a beam in the ceiling he did not touch the ground we are told in order to indicate that the light came from heaven14 again newly born infants are strongly tabooed accordingly in loango they are not allowed to touch the earth15 among the iluvans of malabar the bridegroom on his weddingday is bathed by seven young men and then carried or walks on planks from the bathingplace to the marriage booth he may not touch the ground with his feet16 with the dyaks of landak and tajan two districts of dutch borneo it is a custom that for a certain time after marriage neither bride nor bridegroom may tread on the earth17 warriors again on the warpath are surrounded so to say by an atmosphere of taboo hence some indians of north america might not sit on the bare ground the whole time they were out on a warlike expedition18 in laos the hunting of elephants gives rise to many taboos one of them is that the chief hunter may not touch the earth with his foot accordingly when he alights from his elephant the others spread a carpet of leaves for him to step upon19 german wiseacres recommended that when witches were led to the block or the stake they should not be allowed to touch the bare earth and a reason suggested for the rule was that if they touched the earth they might make themselves invisible and so escape the sagacious author of the stripedpetticoat philosophy in the eighteenth century ridicules the idea as mere silly talk he admits indeed that the women were conveyed to the place of execution in carts but he denies that there is any deep significance in the cart and he is prepared to maintain this view by a chemical analysis of the timber of which the cart was built to clinch his argument he appeals to plain matter of fact and his own personal experience not a single instance he assures us with apparent satisfaction can be produced of a witch who escaped the axe or the fire in this fashion i have myself says he in my youth seen divers witches burned some at arnstadt some at ilmenau some at schwenda a noble village between arnstadt and ilmenau and some of them were pardoned and beheaded before being burned they were laid on the earth in the place of execution and beheaded like any other poor sinner whereas if they could have escaped by touching the earth not one of them would have failed to do so20 sacred or tabooed persons apparently thought to be charged with a mysterious virtue like a fluid which will run to waste or explode if it touches the ground apparently holiness magical virtue taboo or whatever we may call that mysterious quality which is supposed to pervade sacred or tabooed persons is conceived by the primitive philosopher as a physical substance or fluid with which the sacred man is charged just as a leyden jar is charged with electricity and exactly as the electricity in the jar can be discharged by contact with a good conductor so the holiness or magical virtue in the man can be discharged and drained away by contact with the earth which on this theory serves as an excellent conductor for the magical fluid hence in order to preserve the charge from running to waste the sacred or tabooed personage must be carefully prevented from touching the ground in electrical language he must be insulated if he is not to be emptied of the precious substance or fluid with which he as a vial is filled to the brim and in many cases apparently the insulation of the tabooed person is recommended as a precaution not merely for his own sake but for the sake of others for since the virtue of holiness or taboo is so to say a powerful explosive which the smallest touch may detonate it is necessary in the interest of the general safety to keep it within narrow bounds lest breaking out it should blast blight and destroy whatever it comes into contact with things as well as persons can be charged with the mysterious quality of holiness or taboo and when so charged they must be kept from contact with the ground but things as well as persons are often charged with the mysterious quality of holiness or taboo hence it frequently becomes necessary for similar reasons to guard them also from coming into contact with the ground lest they should in like manner be drained of their valuable properties and be reduced to mere commonplace material objects empty husks from which the good grain has been eliminated thus for example the most sacred object of the arunta tribe in central australia is or rather used to be a pole about twenty feet high which is completely smeared with human blood crowned with an imitation of a human head and set up on the ground where the final initiatory ceremonies of young men are performed a young gumtree is chosen to form the pole and it must be cut down and transported in such a way that it does not touch the earth till it is erected in its place on the holy ground apparently the pole represents some famous ancestor of the olden time21 festival of the wild manog tree in british new guinea again at a great dancing festival celebrated by the natives of bartle bay in british new guinea a wild mango tree plays a prominent part the tree must be selfsown that is really wild and so young that it has never flowered it is chosen in the jungle some five or six weeks before the festival and a circle is cleared round its trunk from that time the master of the ceremonies and some eight to twenty other men who have aided him in choosing the tree and in clearing the jungle become strictly holy or tabooed they sleep by themselves in a house into which no one else may intrude they may not wash or drink water nor even allow it accidentally to touch their bodies they are forbidden to eat boiled food and the fruit of mango trees they may drink only the milk of a young coconut which has been baked and they may eat certain fruits and vegetables such as pawpaws carica papaya and sugarcane but only on condition that they have been baked all refuse of their food is kept in baskets in their sleepinghouse and may not be removed from it till the festival is over at the time when the men begin to observe these rules of abstinence some six to ten women members of the same clan as the master of the ceremonies enter on a like period of mortification avoiding the company of the other sex and refraining from water all boiled food and the fruit of the mango tree these fasting men and women are the principal dancers at the festival the dancing takes place on a special platform in a temporary village which has been erected for the purpose when the platform is about to be set up the fasting men rub the stepping posts and then suck their hands for the purpose of extracting the ghost of any dead man that might chance to be in the post and might be injured by the weight of the platform pressing down on him having carefully extracted these poor souls the men carry them away tenderly and set them free in the forest or the long grass the wild mango tree not allowed to touch the ground on the day before the festival one of the fasting men cuts down the chosen mango tree in the jungle with a stone adze which is never afterwards put to any other use an iron tool may not be used for the purpose though iron tools are now common enough in the district in cutting down the mango they place nets on the ground to catch any leaves or twigs that might fall from the tree as it is being felled and they surround the trunk with new mats to receive the chips which fly out under the adze of the woodman for the chips may not drop on the earth once the tree is down it is carried to the centre of the temporary village the greatest care being taken to prevent it from coming into contact with the ground but when it is brought into the village the houses are connected with the top of the mango by means of long vines decorated with the streamers in the afternoon the fasting men and women begin to dance the men bedizened with gay feathers armlets streamers and anklets the women flaunting in particoloured petticoats and sprigs of croton leaves which wave from their waistbands as they dance the dancing stops at sundown and when the full moon rises over the shoulder of the eastern hill for the date of the festival seems to be determined with reference to the time of the moon two chiefs mount the gables of two houses on the eastern side of the square and their dusky figures standing sharply out against the moonlight pray to the evil spirits to go away and not to hurt the people next morning pigs are killed by being speared as slowly as possible in order that they may squeal loud and long for the people believe that the mango trees hear the squealing and are pleased at the sound and bear plenty of fruit whereas if they heard no squeals they would bear no fruit however the trees have to content themselves with the squeals the flesh of the pigs is eaten by the people this ends the festival final disposition of the wild mango tree next day the mango is taken down from the platform wrapt in new mats and carried by the fasting men to their sleeping house where it is hung from the roof but after an interval it may be of many months the tree is brought forth again as to the reason for its reappearance in public opinions are divided but some say that the tree itself orders the master of the ceremonies to bring it forth appearing to him in his dreams and saying let me smell the smoking fat of pigs so will your pigs be healthy and your crops will grow be that as it may out it comes conducted by the fasting men in their dancing costume and with it come in the solemn procession all the pots spoons cups and so forth used by the fasting men during their period of holiness or taboo also all the refuse of their food which has been collected for months and all the fallen leaves and chips of the mango in their bundles of mats these holy relics are carried in front and the mango tree itself brings up the rear of the procession while these sacred objects are being handed out of the house the men who are present rush up wipe off the hallowed dust which has accumulated on them and smear it over their own bodies no doubt in order to steep themselves in their blessed influence thus the tree is carried as before to the centre of the temporary village care being again taken not to let it touch the ground then one of the fasting men takes from a basket a number of young green mangoes cuts them in pieces and places them with his own hands in the mouths of his fellows the other fasting men who chew the pieces small and turning round spit the morsels in the direction of the setting sun in order that the sun should carry the mango bits over the whole country and everyone should know a portion of the mango tree is then broken off and in the evening it is burnt along with the bundles of leaves chips and refuse of food which have been stored up what remains of the tree is taken to the house of the master of the ceremonies and hung over the fireplace it will be brought out again at intervals and burned bit by bit till all is consumed whereupon a new mango will be cut down and treated in like manner the ashes of the holy fire on each occasion are gathered by the people and preserved in the house of the master of the ceremonies22 the ceremony apparently intended to fertilize the mango trees the meaning of these ceremonies is not explained by the authorities who describe them but we may conjecture that they are intended to fertilize the mango trees and cause them to bear a good crop of fruit the central feature of the whole ritual is a wild mango tree so young that it has never flowered the men who cut it down carry it into the village and dance at the festival are forbidden to eat mangoes pigs are killed in order that their dying squeals may move the mango trees to bear fruit at the end of the ceremonies pieces of young green mangoes are solemnly placed in the mouths of the fasting men and are by them spurted out towards the setting sun in order that the luminary may carry the fragments to every part of the country and finally when after a longer or shorter interval the tree is wholly consumed its place is supplied by another all these circumstances are explained simply and naturally by the supposition that the young mango tree is taken as a representative of mangoes generally that the dances are intended to quicken it and that it is preserved like a maypole of old in england as a sort of general fund of vegetable life till the fund being exhausted by the destruction of the tree it is renewed by the importation of a fresh young tree from the forest we can therefore understand why as a storehouse of vital energy the tree should be carefully kept from contact with the ground lest the pentup and concentrated energy should escape and dribbling away into the earth be dissipated to no purpose sacred objects of various sorts not allowed to touch the ground to take other instances of what we may call the conservation of energy in magic or religion by insulating sacred bodies from the ground the natives of new britain have a secret society called the dukduk the members of which masquerade in petticoats of leaves and tall headdresses of wickerwork shaped like candle extinguishers which descend to the shoulders of the wearers completely concealing their faces thus disguised they dance about to the awe and terror real or assumed of the women and uninitiated who take or pretend to take them for spirits when lads are being initiated into the secrets of this august society the adepts cut down some very large and heavy bamboos one for each lad and the novices carry them carefully wrapt up in leaves to the sacred ground where they arrive very tired and weary for they may not let the bamboos touch the ground nor the sun shine on them outside the fence of the enclosure every lad deposits his bamboo on a couple of forked sticks and covers it up with nut leaves23 among the carrier indians of northwestern america who burned their dead the ashes of a chief used to be placed in a box and set on the top of a pole beside his hut the box was never allowed to touch the ground24 in the omaha tribe of north american indians the sacred clam shell of the elk clan was wrapt up from sight in a mat placed on a stand and never suffered to come in contact with the earth25 the cherokees and kindred indian tribes of the united states used to have certain sacred boxes or arks which they regularly took with them to war such a holy ark consisted of a square wooden box which contained certain consecrated vessels made by beloved superannuated women and of such various antiquated forms as would have puzzled adam to have given significant names to each the leader of a war party and his attendant bore the ark by turns but they never set it on the ground nor would they themselves sit on the bare earth while they were carrying it against the enemy where stones were plentiful they rested the ark on them but where no stones were to be found they deposited it on short logs the indian ark is deemed so sacred and dangerous to be touched either by their own sanctified warriors or the spoiling enemy that they durst not touch it upon any account it is not to be meddled with by any except the war chieftain and his waiter under the penalty of incurring great evil nor would the most inveterate enemy touch it in the woods for the very same reason after their return home they used to hang the ark on the leaders redpainted war pole26 at sipi near simla in northern india an annual fair is held at which men purchase wives a square box with a domed top figures prominently at the fair it is fixed on two poles to be carried on mens shoulders and long heavilyplaited petticoats hang from it nearly to the ground three sides of the box are adorned with the head and shoulders of a female figure and the fourth side with a black yaks tail four men bear the poles each carrying an axe in his right hand they dance round with a swinging rhythmical step to the music of drums and a pipe the dance goes on for hours and is thought to avert illluck from the fair it is said that the box is brought to simla from a place sixty miles off by relays of men who may not stop nor set the box on the ground the whole way27 in scotland when water was carried from sacred wells to sick people the watervessel might not touch the earth28 in some parts of aberdeenshire the last bunch of standing corn which is commonly viewed as very sacred being the last refuge of the cornspirit retreating before the reapers is not suffered to touch the ground the master or gueedman sits down and receives each handful of corn as it is cut on his lap29 sacred food not allowed to touch the earth again sacred food may not under certain circumstances be brought into contact with the earth some of the aborigines of victoria used to regard the fat of the emu as sacred believing that it had once been the fat of the black man in taking it from the bird or giving it to another they handled it reverently any one who threw away the fat or flesh of the emu was held accursed the late mr thomas observed on one occasion at nerrenerrewarreen a remarkable exhibition of the effects of this superstition an aboriginal childone attending the schoolhaving eaten some part of the flesh of an emu threw away the skin the skin fell to the ground and this being observed by his parents they showed by their gestures every token of horror they looked upon their child as one utterly lost his desecration of the bird was regarded as a sin for which there was no atonement30 the roumanians of transylvania believe that every freshbaked loaf of wheaten bread is sacred and should a piece inadvertently fall to the ground it is hastily picked up carefully wiped and kissed and if soiled thrown into the firepartly as an offering to the dead and partly because it were a heavy sin to throw away or tread upon any particle of it31 at certain festivals in southeastern borneo the food which is consumed in the common house may not touch the ground hence a little before the festivals take place footbridges made of thin poles are constructed from the private dwellings to the common house32 when hall was living with the esquimaux and grew tired of eating walrus one of the women brought the head and neck of a reindeer for him to eat this venison had to be completely wrapt up before it was brought into the house and once in the house it could only be placed on the platform which served as a bed to have placed it on the floor or on the platform behind the firelamp among the walrus muskox and polarbear meat which occupy a goodly portion of both of these places would have horrified the whole town as according to the actual belief of the innuits not another walrus could be secured this year and there would ever be trouble in catching any more33 but in this case the real scruple appears to have been felt not so much at placing the venison on the ground as at bringing it into contact with walrus meat34 magical implements and remedies thought to lose their virtue by contact with the ground sometimes magical implements and remedies are supposed to lose their virtue by contact with the ground the volatile essence with which they are impregnated being no doubt drained off into the earth thus in the boulia district of queensland the magical bone which the native sorcerer points at his victim as a means of killing him is never by any chance allowed to touch the earth35 the wives of rajahs in macassar a district of southern celebes pride themselves on their luxuriant tresses and are at great pains to oil and preserve them should the hair begin to grow thin the lady resorts to many devices to stay the ravages of time among other things she applies to her locks a fat extracted from crocodiles and venomous snakes the unguent is believed to be very efficacious but during its application the womans feet may not come into contact with the ground or all the benefit of the nostrum would be lost36 some people in antiquity believed that a woman in hard labour would be delivered if a spear which had been wrenched from a mans body without touching the ground were thrown over the house where the sufferer lay again according to certain ancient writers arrows which had been extracted from a body without coming into contact with the earth and laid under sleepers acted as a lovecharm37 among the peasantry of the northeast of scotland the prehistoric weapons called celts went by the name of thunderbolts and were coveted as the sure bringers of success always provided that they were not allowed to fall to the ground38 serpents eggs or snake stones in ancient gaul certain glass or paste beads attained great celebrity as amulets under the name of serpents eggs it was believed that serpents coiling together in a wriggling writhing mass generated them from their slaver and shot them into the air from their hissing jaws if a man was bold and dexterous enough to catch one of these eggs in his cloak before it touched the ground he rode off on horseback with it at full speed pursued by the whole pack of serpents till he was saved by the interposition of a river which the snakes could not pass the proof of the egg being genuine was that if it were thrown into a stream it would float up against the current even though it were hooped in gold the druids held these beads in high esteem according to them the precious objects could only be obtained on a certain day of the moon and the peculiar virtue that resided in them was to secure success in law suits and free access to kings pliny knew of a gaulish knight who was executed by the emperor claudius for wearing one of these amulets39 under the name of snake stones glain neidr or adder stones the beads are still known in those parts of our own country where the celtic population has lingered with its immemorial superstitions down to the present or recent times and the old story of the origin of the beads from the slaver of serpents was believed by the modern peasantry of cornwall wales and scotland as by the druids of ancient gaul in cornwall the time when the serpents united to fashion the beads was commonly said to be at or about midsummer eve in wales it was usually thought to be spring especially the eve of may day and even within recent years persons in the principality have affirmed that they witnessed the great vernal congress of the snakes and saw the magic stone in the midst of the froth the welsh peasants believe the beads to possess medicinal virtues of many sorts and to be particularly efficacious for all maladies of the eyes in wales and ireland the beads sometimes went by the name of the magicians or druids glass gleini na droedh and glaine nan druidhe specimens of them may be seen in museums some have been found in british barrows they are of glass of various colours green blue pink red brown and so forth some plain and some ribbed some are streaked with brilliant hues the beads are perforated and in the highlands of scotland the hole is explained by saying that when the bead has just been conflated by the serpents jointly one of the reptiles sticks his tail through the still viscous glass an englishman who visited scotland in 1699 found many of these beads in use throughout the country they were hung from childrens necks to protect them from whooping cough and other ailments snake stones were moreover a charm to ensure prosperity in general and to repel evil spirits when one of these priceless treasures was not on active service the owner kept it in an iron box to guard it against fairies who as is well known cannot abide iron40 medicinal plants water are not allowed to touch the earth pliny mentions several medicinal plants which if they were to retain their healing virtue ought not to be allowed to touch the earth41 the curious medical treatise of marcellus a native of bordeaux in the fourth century of our era abounds with prescriptions of this sort and we can well believe the writer when he assures us that he borrowed many of his quaint remedies from the lips of common folk and peasants rather than from the books of the learned42 thus he tells us that certain white stones found in the stomachs of young swallows assuage the most persistent headache always provided that their virtue be not impaired by contact with the ground43 another of his cures for the same malady is a wreath of fleabane placed on the head but it must not touch the earth44 on the same condition a decoction of the root of elecampane in wine kills worms a fern found growing on a tree relieves the stomachache and the pasternbone of a hare is an infallible remedy for colic provided first it be found in the dung of a wolf second that it docs not touch the ground and third that it is not touched by a woman45 another cure for colic is effected by certain hocuspocus with a scrap of wool from the forehead of a firstborn lamb if only the lamb instead of being allowed to fall to the ground has been caught by hand as it dropped from its dam46 in andjra a district of morocco the people attribute many magical virtues to rainwater which has fallen on the twentyseventh day of april old style accordingly they collect it and use it for a variety of purposes mixed with tar and sprinkled on the doorposts it prevents snakes and scorpions from entering the house sprinkled on heaps of threshed corn it protects them from the evil eye mixed with an egg henna and seeds of cress it is an invaluable medicine for sick cows poured over a plate on which a passage of the koran has been written it strengthens the memory of schoolboys who drink it and if you mix it with cowdung and red earth and paint rings with the mixture round the trunks of your figtrees at sunset on midsummer day you may depend on it that the trees will bear an excellent crop and will not shed their fruit untimely on the ground but in order to preserve these remarkable properties it is absolutely essential that the water should on no account be allowed to touch the ground some say too that it should not be exposed to the sun nor breathed upon by anybody47 again the moors ascribe great magical efficacy to what they call the sultan of the oleander which is a stalk of oleander with a cluster of four pairs of leaves springing from it they think that the magical virtue is greatest if the stalk has been cut immediately before midsummer but when the plant is brought into the house the branches may not touch the ground lest they should lose their marvellous qualities48 in the olden days before a lithuanian or prussian farmer went forth to plough for the first time in spring he called in a wizard to perform a certain ceremony for the good of the crops the sage seized a mug of beer with his teeth quaffed the liquor and then tossed the mug over his head this signified that the corn in that year should grow taller than a man but the mug might not fall to the ground it had to be caught by somebody stationed at the wizards back for if it fell to the ground the consequence naturally would be that the corn also would be laid low on the earth49 2 not to see the sun sacred persons not allowed to see the sun the second rule to be here noted is that the sun may not shine upon the divine person this rule was observed both by the mikado and by the pontiff of the zapotecs the latter was looked upon as a god whom the earth was not worthy to hold nor the sun to shine upon50 the japanese would not allow that the mikado should expose his sacred person to the open air and the sun was not thought worthy to shine on his head51 the indians of granada in south america kept those who were to be rulers or commanders whether men or women locked up for several years when they were children some of them seven years and this so close that they were not to see the sun for if they should happen to see it they forfeited their lordship eating certain sorts of food appointed and those who were their keepers at certain times went into their retreat or prison and scourged them severely52 thus for example the heir to the throne of bogota who was not the son but the sisters son of the king had to undergo a rigorous training from his infancy he lived in complete retirement in a temple where he might not see the sun nor eat salt nor converse with a woman he was surrounded by guards who observed his conduct and noted all his actions if he broke a single one of the rules laid down for him he was deemed infamous and forfeited all his rights to the throne53 so too the heir to the kingdom of sogamoso before succeeding to the crown had to fast for seven years in the temple being shut up in the dark and not allowed to see the sun or light54 the prince who was to become inca of peru had to fast for a month without seeing light55 on the day when a brahman student of the veda took a bath to signify that the time of his studentship was at an end he entered a cowshed before sunrise hung over the door a skin with the hair inside and sat there on that day the sun should not shine upon him56 tabooed persons not allowed to see the sun certain persons forbidden to see fire again women after childbirth and their offspring are more or less tabooed all the world over hence in corea the rays of the sun are rigidly excluded from both mother and child for a period of twentyone or a hundred days according to their rank after the birth has taken place57 among some of the tribes on the northwest coast of new guinea a woman may not leave the house for months after childbirth when she does go out she must cover her head with a hood or mat for if the sun were to shine upon her it is thought that one of her male relations would die58 again mourners are everywhere taboo accordingly in mourning the ainos of japan wear peculiar caps in order that the sun may not shine upon their heads59 during a solemn fast of three days the indians of costa rica eat no salt speak as little as possible light no fires and stay strictly indoors or if they go out during the day they carefully cover themselves from the light of the sun believing that exposure to the suns rays would turn them black60 on yule night it has been customary in parts of sweden from time immemorial to go on pilgrimage whereby people learn many secret things and know what is to happen in the coming year as a preparation for this pilgrimage some secrete themselves for three days previously in a dark cellar so as to be shut out altogether from the light of heaven others retire at an early hour of the preceding morning to some outoftheway place such as a hayloft where they bury themselves in the hay that they may neither see nor hear any living creature and here they remain in silence and fasting until after sundown whilst there are those who think it sufficient if they rigidly abstain from food on the day before commencing their wanderings during this period of probation a man ought not to see fire but should this have happened he must strike a light with flint and steel whereby the evil that would otherwise have ensued will be obviated61 during the sixteen days that a pima indian is undergoing purification for killing an apache he may not see a blazing fire62 the story of prince sunless acarnanian peasants tell of a handsome prince called sunless who would die if he saw the sun so he lived in an underground palace on the site of the ancient oeniadae but at night he came forth and crossed the river to visit a famous enchantress who dwelt in a castle on the further bank she was loth to part with him every night long before the sun was up and as he turned a deaf ear to all her entreaties to linger she hit upon the device of cutting the throats of all the cocks in the neighbourhood so the prince whose ear had learned to expect the shrill clarion of the birds as the signal of the growing light tarried too long and hardly had he reached the ford when the sun rose over the aetolian mountains and its fatal beams fell on him before he could regain his dark abode63 notes 1 the magic art and the evolution of kings i 44 2 hh bancroft native races of the pacific

at puberty 1 seclusion of girls at puberty in africa girls at puberty forbidden to touch the ground and to see the sun seclusion of girls at puberty among the akamba seclusion of girls at puberty among the baganda now it is remarkable that the foregoing two rulesnot to touch the ground and not to see the sunare observed either separately or conjointly by girls at puberty in many parts of the world thus amongst the negroes of loango girls at puberty are confined in separate huts and they may not touch the ground with any part of their bare body64 among the zulus and kindred tribes of south africa when the first signs of puberty shew themselves while a girl is walking gathering wood or working in the field she runs to the river and hides herself among the reeds for the day so as not to be seen by men she covers her head carefully with her blanket that the sun may not shine on it and shrivel her up into a withered skeleton as would result from exposure to the suns beams after dark she returns to her home and is secluded in a hut for some time65 during her seclusion which lasts for about a fortnight neither she nor the girls who wait upon her may drink any milk lest the cattle should die and should she be overtaken by the first flow while she is in the fields she must after hiding in the bush scrupulously avoid all pathways in returning home66 a reason for this avoidance is assigned by the akamba of british east africa whose girls under similar circumstances observe the same rule a girls first menstruation is a very critical period of her life according to akamba beliefs if this condition appears when she is away from the village say at work in the fields she returns at once to her village but is careful to walk through the grass and not on a path for if she followed a path and a stranger accidentally trod on a spot of blood and then cohabited with a member of the opposite sex before the girl was better again it is believed that she would never bear a child she remains at home till the symptoms have ceased and during this time she may be fed by none but her mother when the flux is over her father and mother are bound to cohabit with each other else it is believed that the girl would be barren all her life67 similarly among the baganda when a girl menstruated for the first time she was secluded and not allowed to handle food and at the end of her seclusion the kinsman with whom she was staying for among the baganda young people did not reside with their parents was obliged to jump over his wife which with the baganda is regarded as equivalent to having intercourse with her should the girl happen to be living near her parents at the moment when she attained to puberty she was expected on her recovery to inform them of the fact whereupon her father jumped over her mother were this custom omitted the baganda like the akamba thought that the girl would never have children or that they would die in infancy68 thus the pretence of sexual intercourse between the parents or other relatives of the girl was a magical ceremony to ensure her fertility it is significant that among the baganda the first menstruation was often called a marriage and the girl was spoken of as a bride69 these terms so applied point to a belief like that of the siamese that a girls first menstruation results from her defloration by one of a host of aerial spirits and that the wound thus inflicted is repeated afterwards every month by the same ghostly agency70 for a like reason probably the baganda imagine that a woman who does not menstruate exerts a malign influence on gardens and makes them barren71 if she works in them for not being herself fertilized by a spirit how can she fertilize the garden seclusion of girls at puberty among the tribes of the tanganyika plateau among the amambwe winamwanga alungu and other tribes of the great plateau to the west of lake tanganyika when a young girl knows that she has attained puberty she forthwith leaves her mothers hut and hides herself in the long grass near the village covering her face with a cloth and weeping bitterly towards sunset one of the older womenwho as directress of the ceremonies is called nachimbusa follows her places a cookingpot by the crossroads and boils therein a concoction of various herbs with which she anoints the neophyte at nightfall the girl is carried on the old womans back to her mothers hut when the customary period of a few days has elapsed she is allowed to cook again after first whitewashing the floor of the hut but by the following month the preparations for her initiation are complete the novice must remain in her hut throughout the whole period of initiation and is carefully guarded by the old women who accompany her whenever she leaves her quarters veiling her head with a native cloth the ceremonies last for at least one month during this period of seclusion drumming and songs are kept up within the mothers hut by the village women and no male except it is said the father of twins is allowed to enter the directress of the rites and the older women instruct the young girl as to the elementary facts of life the duties of marriage and the rules of conduct decorum and hospitality to be observed by a married woman amongst other things the damsel must submit to a series of tests such as leaping over fences thrusting her head into a collar made of thorns and so on the lessons which she receives are illustrated by mud figures of animals and of the common objects of domestic life moreover the directress of studies embellishes the walls of the hut with rude pictures each with its special significance and song which must be understood and learned by the girl72 in the foregoing account the rule that a damsel at puberty may neither see the sun nor touch the ground seems implied by the statement that on the first discovery of her condition she hides in long grass and is carried home after sunset on the back of an old woman seclusion of girls at puberty among the tribes of british central africa among the nyanjaspeaking tribes of central angoniland in british central africa when a young girl finds that she has become a woman she stands silent by the pathway leading to the village her face wrapt in her calico an old woman finding her there takes her off to a stream to bathe after that the girl is secluded for six days in the old womans hut she eats her porridge out of an old basket and her relish in which no salt is put from a potsherd the basket is afterwards thrown away on the seventh day the aged matrons gather together go with the girl to a stream and throw her into the water in returning they sing songs and the old woman who directs the proceedings carries the maiden on her back then they spread a mat and fetch her husband and set the two down on the mat and shave his head when it is dark the old women escort the girl to her husbands hut there the ndiwo relish is cooking on the fire during the night the woman rises and puts some salt in the pot next morning before dawn while all is dark and the villagers have not yet opened their doors the young married woman goes off and gives some of the relish to her mother and to the old woman who was mistress of the ceremony this relish she sets down at the doors of their houses and goes away and in the morning when the sun has risen and all is light in the village the two women open their doors and there they find the relish with the salt in it and they take of it and rub it on their feet and under their armpits and if there are little children in the house they eat of it and if the young wife has a kinsman who is absent from the village some of the relish is put on a splinter of bamboo and kept against his return that when he comes he too may rub his feet with it but if the woman finds that her husband is impotent she does not rise betimes and go out in the dark to lay the relish at the doors of her mother and the old woman and in the morning when the sun is up and all the village is light the old women open their doors and see no relish there and they know what has happened and so they go wilily to work for they persuade the husband to consult the diviner that he may discover how to cure his impotence and while he is closeted with the wizard they fetch another man who finishes the ceremony with the young wife in order that the relish may be given out and that people may rub their feet with it but if it happens that when a girl comes to maturity she is not yet betrothed to any man and therefore has no husband to go to the matrons tell her that she must go to a lover instead and this is the custom which they call chigango so in the evening she takes her cooking pot and relish and hies away to the quarters of the young bachelors and they very civilly sleep somewhere else that night and in the morning the girl goes back to the kuka hut73 abstinence from salt associated with a rule of chastity in many tribes from the foregoing account it appears that among these tribes no sooner has a girl attained to womanhood than she is expected and indeed required to give proof of her newly acquired powers by cohabiting with a man whether her husband or another and the abstinence from salt during the girls seclusion is all the more remarkable because as soon as the seclusion is over she has to use salt for a particular purpose to which the people evidently attach very great importance since in the event of her husband proving impotent she is even compelled apparently to commit adultery in order that the salted relish may be given out as usual in this connexion it deserves to be noted that among the wagogo of german east africa women at their monthly periods may not sleep with their husbands and may not put salt in food74 a similar rule is observed by the nyanjaspeaking tribes of central angoniland with whose puberty customs we are here concerned among them we are told some superstition exists with regard to the use of salt a woman during her monthly sickness must on no account put salt into any food she is cooking lest she give her husband or children a disease called tsempo chitsoko soko but calls a child to put it in or as the song goes natira nichere ni bondo chifukwa nkupanda mwana and pours in the salt by placing it on her knee because there is no child handy should a party of villagers have gone to make salt all sexual intercourse is forbidden among the people of the village until the people who have gone to make the salt from grass return when they do come back they must make their entry into the village at night and no one must see them then one of the elders of the village sleeps with his wife she then cooks some relish into which she puts some of the salt this relish is handed round to the people who went to make the salt who rub it on their feet and under their armpits75 hence it would seem that in the mind of these people abstinence from salt is somehow associated with the idea of chastity the same association meets us in the customs of many peoples in various parts of the world for example ancient hindoo ritual prescribed that for three nights after a husband had brought his bride home the two should sleep on the ground remain chaste and eat no salt76 among the baganda when a man was making a net he had to refrain from eating salt and meat and from living with his wife these restrictions he observed until the net took its first catch of fish similarly so long as a fishermans nets or traps were in the water he must live apart from his wife and neither he nor she nor their children might eat salt or meat77 evidence of the same sort could be multiplied78 but without going into it further we may say that for some reason which is not obvious to us primitive man connects salt with the intercourse of the sexes and therefore forbids the use of that condiment in a variety of circumstances in which he deems continence necessary or desirable as there is nothing which the savage regards as a greater bar between the sexes than the state of menstruation he naturally prohibits the use of salt to women and girls at their monthly periods seclusion of girls at puberty among the tribes about lake nyassa and on the zambesi with the awankonde a tribe at the northern end of lake nyassa it is a rule that after her first menstruation a girl must be kept apart with a few companions of her own sex in a darkened house the floor is covered with dry banana leaves but no fire may be lit in the house which is called the house of the awasungu that is of maidens who have no hearts79 when a girl reaches puberty the wafiomi of eastern africa hold a festival at which they make a noise with a peculiar kind of rattle after that the girl remains for a year in the large common hut tembe where she occupies a special compartment screened off from the mens quarters she may not cut her hair or touch food but is fed by other women at night however she quits the hut and dances with young men80 among the barotse or marotse of the upper zambesi when a girl arrives at the age of puberty she is sent into the fields where a hut is constructed far from the village there with two or three companions she spends a month returning home late and starting before dawn in order not to be seen by the men the women of the village visit her bringing food and honey and singing and dancing to amuse her at the end of a month her husband comes and fetches her it is only after this ceremony that women have the right to smear themselves with ochre81 we may suspect that the chief reason why the girl during her seclusion may visit her home only by night is a fear not so much lest she should be seen by men as that she might be seen by the sun among the wafiomi as we have just learned the young woman in similar circumstances is even free to dance with men provided always that the dance is danced at night the ceremonies among the barotse or marotse are somewhat more elaborate for a girl of the royal family she is shut up for three months in a place which is kept secret from the public only the women of her family know where it is there she sits alone in the darkness of the hut waited on by female slaves who are strictly forbidden to speak and may communicate with her and with each other only by signs during all this time though she does nothing she eats much and when at last she comes forth her appearance is quite changed so fat has she grown she is then led by night to the river and bathed in presence of all the women of the village next day she flaunts before the public in her gayest attire her head bedecked with ornaments and her face mottled with red paint so everybody knows what has happened82 seclusion of girls at puberty among the thonga on delagoa bay among the northern clans of the thonga tribe in southeastern africa about delagoa bay when a girl thinks that the time of her nubility is near she chooses an adoptive mother perhaps in a neighbouring village when the symptoms appear she flies away from her own village and repairs to that of her adopted mother to weep near her after that she is secluded with several other girls in the same condition for a month they are shut up in a hut and whenever they come outside they must wear a dirty greasy cloth over their faces as a veil every morning they are led to a pool and plunged in the water up to their necks initiated girls or women accompany them singing obscene songs and driving away with sticks any man who meets them for no man may see a girl during this time of seclusion if he saw her it is said that he would be struck blind on their return from the river the girls are again imprisoned in the hut where they remain wet and shivering for they may not go near the fire to warm themselves during their seclusion they listen to lascivious songs sung by grown women and are instructed in sexual matters at the end of the month the adoptive mother brings the girl home to her true mother and presents her with a pot of beer83 seclusion of girls at puberty among the caffre tribes of south africa among the caffre tribes of south africa the period of a girls seclusion at puberty varies with the rank of her father if he is a rich man it may last twelve days if he is a chief it may last twentyfour days84 and when it is over the girl rubs herself over with red earth and strews finely powdered red earth on the ground before she leaves the hut where she has been shut up finally though she was forbidden to drink milk all the days of her separation she washes out her mouth with milk and is from that moment regarded as a fullgrown woman85 afterwards in the dusk of the evening she carries away all the objects with which she came into contact in the hut during her seclusion and buries them secretly in a sequestered spot86 when the girl is a chiefs daughter the ceremonies at her liberation from the hut are more elaborate than usual she is led forth from the hut by a son of her fathers councillor who wearing the wings of a blue crane the badge of bravery on his head escorts her to the cattle kraal where cows are slaughtered and dancing takes place large skins full of milk are sent to the spot from neighbouring villages and after the dances are over the girl drinks milk for the first time since the day she entered into retreat but the first mouthful is drunk by the girls aunt or other female relative who had charge of her during her seclusion and a little of it is poured on the fireplace87 amongst the zulus when the girl was a princess royal the end of her time of separation was celebrated by a sort of saturnalia law and order were for the time being in abeyance every man woman and child might appropriate any article of property the king abstained from interfering and if during this reign of misrule he was robbed of anything he valued he could only recover it by paying a fine88 among the basutos when girls at puberty are bathed as usual by the matrons in a river they are hidden separately in the turns and bends of the stream and told to cover their heads as they will be visited by a large serpent their limbs are then plastered with clay little masks of straw are put on their faces and thus arrayed they daily follow each other in procession singing melancholy airs to the fields there to learn the labours of husbandry in which a great part of their adult life will be passed89 we may suppose though we are not told that the straw masks which they wear in these processions are intended to hide their faces from the gaze of men and the rays of the sun seclusion of girls at puberty in the lower congo among the tribes in the lower valley of the congo such as the bavili when a girl arrives at puberty she has to pass two or three months in seclusion in a small hut built for the purpose the hair of her head is shaved off and every day the whole of her body is smeared with a red paint takulla made from a powdered wood mixed with water some of her companions reside in the hut with her and prepare the paint for her use a woman is appointed to take charge of the hut and to keep off intruders at the end of her confinement she is taken to water by the women of her family and bathed the paint is rubbed off her body her arms and legs are loaded with brass rings and she is led in solemn procession under an umbrella to her husbands house if these ceremonies were not performed the people believe that the girl would be barren or would give birth to monsters that the rain would cease to fall the earth to bear fruit and the fishing to be successful90 such serious importance do these savages ascribe to the performance of rites which to us seem so childish 2 seclusion of girls at puberty in new ireland new guinea and indonesia seclusion of girls at puberty in new ireland in new ireland girls are confined for four or five years in small cages being kept in the dark and not allowed to set foot on the ground the custom has been thus described by an eyewitness i heard from a teacher about some strange custom connected with some of the young girls here so i asked the chief to take me to the house where they were the house was about twentyfive feet in length and stood in a reed and bamboo enclosure across the entrance to which a bundle of dried grass was suspended to show that it was strictly tabu inside the house were three conical structures about seven or eight feet in height and about ten or twelve feet in circumference at the bottom and for about four feet from the ground at which point they tapered off to a point at the top these cages were made of the broad leaves of the pandanustree sewn quite close together so that no light and little or no air could enter on one side of each is an opening which is closed by a double door of plaited cocoanut tree and pandanustree leaves about three feet from the ground there is a stage of bamboos which forms the floor in each of these cages we were told there was a young woman confined each of whom had to remain for at least four or five years without ever being allowed to go outside the house i could scarcely credit the story when i heard it the whole thing seemed too horrible to be true i spoke to the chief and told him that i wished to see the inside of the cages and also to see the girls that i might make them a present of a few beads he told me that it was tabu forbidden for any men but their own relations to look at them but i suppose the promised beads acted as an inducement and so he sent away for some old lady who had charge and who alone is allowed to open the doors while we were waiting we could hear the girls talking to the chief in a querulous way as if objecting to something or expressing their fears the old woman came at length and certainly she did not seem a very pleasant jailor or guardian nor did she seem to favour the request of the chief to allow us to see the girls as she regarded us with anything but pleasant looks however she had to undo the door when the chief told her to do so and then the girls peeped out at us and when told to do so they held out their hands for the beads i however purposely sat at some distance away and merely held out the beads to them as i wished to draw them quite outside that i might inspect the inside of the cages this desire of mine gave rise to another difficulty as these girls were not allowed to put their feet to the ground all the time they were confined in these places however they wished to get the beads and so the old lady had to go outside and collect a lot of pieces of wood and bamboo which she placed on the ground and then going to one of the girls she helped her down and held her hand as she stepped from one piece of wood to another until she came near enough to get the beads i held out to her i then went to inspect the inside of the cage out of which she had come but could scarcely put my head inside of it the atmosphere was so hot and stifling it was clean and contained nothing but a few short lengths of bamboo for holding water there was only room for the girl to sit or lie down in a crouched position on the bamboo platform and when the doors are shut it must be nearly or quite dark inside the girls are never allowed to come out except once a day to bathe in a dish or wooden bowl placed close to each cage they say that they perspire profusely they are placed in these stifling cages when quite young and must remain there until they are young women when they are taken out and have each a great marriage feast provided for them one of them was about fourteen or fifteen years old and the chief told us that she had been there for five years but would soon be taken out now the other two were about eight and ten years old and they have to stay there for several years longer91 a more recent observer has described the custom as it is observed on the western coast of new ireland he says a buck is the name of a little house not larger than an ordinary hencoop in which a little girl is shut up sometimes for weeks only and at other times for months briefly stated the custom is this girls on attaining puberty or betrothal are enclosed in one of these little coops for a considerable time they must remain there night and day we saw two of these girls in two coops the girls were not more than ten years old still they were lying in a doubledup position as their little houses would not admit of them lying in any other way these two coops were inside a large house but the chief in consideration of a present of a couple of tomahawks ordered the ends to be torn out of the house to admit the light so that we might photograph the buck the occupant was allowed to put her face through an opening to be photographed in consideration of another present92 as a consequence of their long enforced idleness in the shade the girls grow fat and their dusky complexion bleaches to a more pallid hue both their corpulence and their pallor are regarded as beauties93 seclusion of girls at puberty in new guinea borneo ceram and yap in kabadi a district of british new guinea daughters of chiefs when they are about twelve or thirteen years of age are kept indoors for two or three years never being allowed under any pretence to descend from the house and the house is so shaded that the sun cannot shine on them94 among the yabim and bukaua two neighbouring and kindred tribes on the coast of german new guinea a girl at puberty is secluded for some five or six weeks in an inner part of the house but she may not sit on the floor lest her uncleanness should cleave to it so a log of wood is placed for her to squat on moreover she may not touch the ground with her feet hence if she is obliged to quit the house for a short time she is muffled up in mats and walks on two halves of a coconut shell which are fastened like sandals to her feet by creeping plants during her seclusion she is in charge of her aunts or other female relatives at the end of the time she bathes her person is loaded with ornaments her face is grotesquely painted with red stripes on a white ground and thus adorned she is brought forth in public to be admired by everybody she is now marriageable95 among the ot danoms of borneo girls at the age of eight or ten years are shut up in a little room or cell of the house and cut off from all intercourse with the world for a long time the cell like the rest of the house is raised on piles above the ground and is lit by a single small window opening on a lonely place so that the girl is in almost total darkness she may not leave the room on any pretext whatever not even for the most necessary purposes none of her family may see her all the time she is shut up but a single slave woman is appointed to wait on her during her lonely confinement which often lasts seven years the girl occupies herself in weaving mats or with other handiwork her bodily growth is stunted by the long want of exercise and when on attaining womanhood she is brought out her complexion is pale and waxlike she is now shewn the sun the earth the water the trees and the flowers as if she were newly born then a great feast is made a slave is killed and the girl is smeared with his blood96 in ceram girls at puberty were formerly shut up by themselves in a hut which was kept dark97 in yap one of the caroline islands should a girl be overtaken by her first menstruation on the public road she may not sit down on the earth but must beg for a coconut shell to put under her she is shut up for

and shell ornaments in her ears on her chest and on her back she squats in the midst of the bushes which are piled so high round about her that only her head is visible in this state of seclusion she must remain for three months all this time the sun may not shine upon her but at night she is allowed to slip out of the hut and the bushes that hedge her in are then changed she may not feed herself or handle food but is fed by one or two old women her maternal aunts who are especially appointed to look after her one of these women cooks food for her at a special fire in the forest the girl is forbidden to eat turtle or turtle eggs during the season when the turtles are breeding but no vegetable food is refused her no man not even her own father may come into the house while her seclusion lasts for if her father saw her at this time he would certainly have bad luck in his fishing and would probably smash his canoe the very next time he went out in it at the end of the three months she is carried down to a freshwater creek by her attendants hanging on to their shoulders in such a way that her feet do not touch the ground while the women of the tribe form a ring round her and thus escort her to the beach arrived at the shore she is stripped of her ornaments and the bearers stagger with her into the creek where they immerse her and all the other women join in splashing water over both the girl and her bearers when they come out of the water one of the two attendants makes a heap of grass for her charge to squat upon the other runs to the reef catches a small crab tears off its claws and hastens back with them to the creek here in the meantime a fire has been kindled and the claws are roasted at it the girl is then fed by her attendants with the roasted claws after

seclusion she may eat nothing that lives in salt water or a snake would kill her an old woman waits upon her and supplies her with roots yams and water100 some tribes are wont to bury their girls at such seasons more or less deeply in the ground perhaps in order to hide them from the light of the sun thus the larrakeeyah tribe in the northern territory of south australia used to cover a girl up with dirt for three days at her first monthly period101 in similar circumstances the otati tribe on the east coast of the cape york peninsula make an excavation in the ground where the girl squats a

of bushes except in front where her mother kindles a fire here the girl stays all day sitting with her arms crossed and the palms of her hands resting on the sand she may not move her arms except to

stuck in her hair she may speak to nobody but her mother indeed nobody else would think of coming near her at evening she lays hold of the two diggingsticks and by their help frees herself from the superincumbent weight of sand and returns to the camp next morning she is again buried in the sand under the shade of the tree and remains there again till evening this she does daily for five days on her return at evening on the fifth day her mother decorates her with a waistband a foreheadband and a necklet of pearlshell ties green parrot feathers round her arms and wrists and across her chest and smears her body back and front from the waist upwards with blotches of red white and yellow paint she has in like manner to be buried in the sand at her second and third menstruations but at the

not being again buried at the end of the symptoms she stands over hot stones and water is poured over her till trickling from her body on the stones it is converted into steam and envelops her in a cloud of vapour then she is painted with red and white stripes and returns to the camp if her future husband has already been chosen she goes to him and they eat some food together which the girl has previously brought from the bush105 in prince of wales island torres strait the treatment of the patient is similar but lasts for about two months during the day she lies covered up with sand in a

wrists and ankles to secure long life at this time they are careful that the dishes out of which they eat are used by no other person and wholly devoted to their own use during this period they eat nothing but dog fish and starvation only will drive them to eat either fresh fish or meat when their first periodical sickness comes on they are fed by their mothers or nearest female relation by

refrain from eating anything fresh for one year after her first monthly sickness she may however eat partridge but it must be cooked in the crop of the bird to render it harmless i would have thought it impossible to perform this feat had i not seen it done the crop is blown out and a small bent willow put round the mouth it is then filled with water and the meat being first minced up put in also then put on the fire and boiled till cooked their reason for hanging fringes before their eyes is to hinder any bad medicine man from harming them during this critical period they are very careful not to drink whilst facing a medicine man and do so only when their backs are turned to him all these habits are left off when the girl is a recognised woman with the exception of their going out of the lodge and remaining in a hut every time their periodical sickness comes on this is a rigidly observed law with both single and married women120 seclusion of girls at puberty among the tinneh indians of alaska among the hareskin tinneh a girl at puberty was secluded for five days in a hut made specially for the purpose she might only drink out of a tube made from a swans bone and for a month she

lasts exactly a lunar month for the day of the moon on which the symptoms first occur is noted and she is sequestered until the same day of the next moon if the season is winter a corner of the house is curtained off for her use by a blanket or a sheet of canvas if it is summer a small tent is erected for her near the common one here she lives and sleeps she wears a long robe and a large hood which she must pull down over her eyes whenever she leaves the hut and she must keep it down till she returns she may not speak to a man nor see his face much less touch his clothes or anything that

bone without applying her lips to the cup she may eat no fresh meat or fish except the flesh of the porcupine she may not undress but sleeps with all her clothes on even her mittens in her socks she wears next to the skin the horny soles cut from the feet of a porcupine in order that for the rest of her life her shoes may never wear out round her waist she wears a cord to which are tied the heads of femurs of a porcupine because of all animals known to the tinneh the porcupine suffers least in parturition it simply drops its young and continues to walk or skip about as if nothing had happened hence it is easy to see that a girl who wears these portions of a porcupine about her waist will be delivered just as easily as the animal to make quite sure of this if anybody happens to kill a porcupine big with young while the girl is undergoing her period of separation the foetus is given to her and she lets it slide down between her shirt and her body so as to fall on the ground like an infant122 here the imitation of childbirth is a piece of homoeopathic or imitative magic designed to facilitate the effect which it simulates123 seclusion of girls at puberty among the thompson indians of british columbia among the thompson indians of british columbia when a girl attained puberty she was at once separated from all the people a conical hut of fir branches and bark was erected at some little distance from the other houses and in it the girl had to squat on her heels during the day often a deep circular hole was dug in the hut and the girl squatted in the hole with her head projecting above the surface of the ground she might quit the hut for various purposes in the early morning but had always to be back at sunrise on the first appearance of the symptoms her face was painted red all over and the paint was renewed every morning during her term of seclusion a heavy blanket swathed her body from top to toe and during the first four days she wore a conical cap made of small fir branches which reached below the breast but left an opening for the face in her hair was fastened an implement made of deerbone with which she scratched herself for the first four days she might neither wash nor eat but a little water was given her in a birchbark cup painted red and she sucked up the liquid through a tube made out of the leg of a crane a swan or a goose for her lips might not touch the surface of the water after the four days she was allowed during the rest of the period of isolation to eat to wash to lie down to comb her hair and to drink of streams and springs but in drinking at these sources she had still to use her tube otherwise the spring would dry up while her seclusion lasted she performed by night various ceremonies which were supposed to exert a beneficial influence on her future life for example she ran as fast as she could praying at the same time to the earth or nature that she might be fleet of foot and tireless of limb she dug trenches in order that in after life she might be able to dig well and to work hard these and other ceremonies she repeated for four nights or mornings in succession four times each morning and each time she supplicated the dawn of the day among the lower thompson indians she carried a staff for one night and when the day was breaking she leaned the staff against the stump of a tree and prayed to the dawn that she might be blessed with a good husband who was symbolized by the staff she also wandered some nights to lonely parts of the mountains where she would dance imploring the spirits to pity and protect her during her future life then the dance and prayer over she would lie down on the spot and fall asleep again she carried four stones in her bosom to a spring where she spat upon the stones and threw them one after the other into the water praying that all disease might leave her as these stones did also she ran four times in the early morning with two small stones in her bosom and as she ran the stones slipped down between her bare body and her clothes and fell to the ground at the same time she prayed to the dawn that when she should be with child she might be delivered as easily as she was delivered of these stones but whatever exercises she performed or prayers she offered on the lonely mountains during the hours of darkness or while the morning light was growing in the east she must always be back in her little hut before the sun rose there she often passed the tedious hours away picking the needles one by one from the cones on two large branches of fir which hung from the roof of her hut on purpose to provide her with occupation and as she picked she prayed to the firbranch that she might never be lazy but always quick and active at work during her seclusion too she had to make miniatures of all the articles that indian women make or used to make such as baskets mats ropes and thread this she did in order that afterwards she might be able to make the real things properly four large firbranches also were placed in front of the hut so that when she went out or in she had to step over them the branches were renewed every morning and the old ones thrown away into the water while the girl prayed may i never bewitch any man nor my fellowwomen may it never happen the first four times that she went out and in she prayed to the firbranches saying if ever i step into trouble or difficulties or step unknowingly inside the magical spell of some person may you help me o firbranches with your power every day she painted her face afresh and she wore strings of parts of deerhoofs round her ankles and knees and tied to her waistband on either side which rattled when she walked or ran even the shape of the hut in which she lived was adapted to her future rather than to her present needs and wishes if she wished to be tall the hut was tall if she wished to be short it was low sometimes so low that there was not room in it for her to stand erect and she would lay the palm of her hand on the top of her head and pray to the dawn that she might grow no taller her seclusion lasted four months the indians say that long ago it extended over a year and that fourteen days elapsed before the girl was permitted to wash for the first time the dress which she wore during her time of separation was afterwards taken to the top of a hill and burned and the rest of her clothes were hung up on trees124 seclusion of girls at puberty among the lillooet indians of british columbia among the lillooet indians of british columbia neighbours of the thompsons the customs observed by girls at puberty were similar the damsels were secluded for a period of not less than one year nor more than four years according to their own inclination and the wishes of their parents among the upper lillooets the hut in which the girl lodged was made of bushy firtrees set up like a conical tent the inner branches being lopped off while the outer branches were closely interwoven and padded to form a roof every month or halfmonth the hut was shifted to another site or a new one erected by day the girl sat in the hut for the first month she squatted in a hole dug in the middle of it and she passed the time making miniature baskets of birchbark and other things praying that she might be able to make the real things well in after years at the dusk of the evening she left the hut and wandered about all night but she returned before the sun rose before she quitted the hut at nightfall to roam abroad she painted her face red and put on a mask of firbranches and in her hand as she walked she carried a basketrattle to frighten ghosts and guard herself from evil among the lower lillooets the girls mask was often made of goatskin covering her head neck shoulders and breast and leaving only a narrow opening from the brow to the chin during the nocturnal hours she performed many ceremonies thus she put two smooth stones in her bosom and ran and as they fell down between her body and her clothes she prayed saying may i always have easy childbirths now one of these stones represented her future child and the other represented the afterbirth also she dug trenches praying that in the years to come she might be strong and tireless in digging roots she picked leaves and needles from the firtrees praying that her fingers might be nimble in picking berries and she tore sheets of birchbark into shreds dropping the shreds as she walked and asking that her hands might never tire and that she might make neat and fine work of birchbark moreover she ran and walked much that she might be light of foot and every evening when the shadows were falling and every morning when the day was breaking she prayed to the dusk of the evening or to the dawn of day saying o dawn of day or o dusk as it might be may i be able to dig roots fast and easily and may i always find plenty all her prayers were addressed to the dusk of the evening or the dawn of day she supplicated both asking for long life health wealth and happiness125 seclusion of girls at puberty among the shuswap indians of british columbia among the shuswap indians of british columbia who are neighbours of the thompsons and lillooets a girl on reaching maturity has to go through a great number of ceremonies she must leave the village and live alone in a small hut on the mountains she cooks her own food and must not eat anything that bleeds she is forbidden to touch her head for which purpose she uses a comb with three points neither is she allowed to scratch her body except with a painted deerbone she wears the bone and the comb suspended from her belt she drinks out of a painted cup of birchbark and neither more nor less than the quantity it holds every night she walks about her hut and plants willow twigs which she has painted and to the ends of which she has attached pieces of cloth into the ground it is believed that thus she will become rich in later life in order to become strong she should climb trees and try to break off their points she plays with lehal sticks that her future husbands might have good luck when gambling126 during the day the girl stays in her hut and occupies herself in making miniature bags mats and baskets in sewing and embroidery in manufacturing thread twine and so forth in short she makes a beginning of all kinds of womans work in order that she may be a good housewife in after life by night she roams the mountains and practises running climbing carrying burdens and digging trenches so that she may be expert at digging roots if she has wandered far and daylight overtakes her she hides herself behind a veil of fir branches for no one except her instructor or nearest relatives should see her face during her period of seclusion she wore a large robe painted red on the breast and sides and her hair was done up in a knot at each ear127 seclusion of girls at puberty among the delaware and cheyenne indians ceremonies of the same general type were probably observed by girls at puberty among all the indian tribes of north america but the record of them is far less full for the central and eastern tribes perhaps because the settlers who first came into contact with the red man in these regions were too busy fighting him to find leisure even if they had the desire to study his manners and customs however among the delaware indians a tribe in the extreme east of the continent we read that when a delaware girl has her first monthly period she must withdraw into a hut at some distance from the village her head is wrapped up for twelve days so that she can see nobody and she must submit to frequent vomits and fasting and abstain from all labor after this she is washed and new clothed but confined to a solitary life for two months at the close of which she is declared marriageable128 again among the cheyennes an indian tribe of the missouri valley a girl at her first menstruation is painted red all over her body and secluded in a special little lodge for four days however she may remain in her fathers lodge provided that there are no charms medicine no sacred bundle and no shield in it or that these and all other objects invested with a sacred character have been removed for four days she may not eat boiled meat the flesh of which she partakes must be roasted over coals young men will not eat from the dish nor drink from the pot which has been used by her because they believe that were they to do so they would be wounded in the next fight she may not handle nor even touch any weapon of war or any sacred object if the camp moves she may not ride a horse but is mounted on a mare129 seclusion of girls at puberty among the esquimaux among the esquimaux also in the extreme north of the continent who belong to an entirely different race from the indians the attainment of puberty in the female sex is or used to be the occasion of similar observances thus among the koniags an esquimau people of alaska a girl at puberty was placed in a small hut in which she had to remain on her hands and knees for six months then the hut was enlarged a little so as to allow her to straighten her back but in this posture she had to remain for six months more all this time she was regarded as an unclean being with whom no one might hold intercourse at the end of the year she was received back by her parents and a great feast held130 again among the malemut and southward from the lower yukon and adjacent districts when a girl reaches the age of puberty she is considered unclean for forty days and must therefore live by herself in a corner of the house with her face to the wall always keeping her hood over her head and her hair hanging dishevelled over her eyes but if it is summer she commonly lives in a rough shelter outside the house she may not go out by day and only once at night when every one else is asleep at the end of the period she bathes and is clothed in new garments whereupon she may be taken in marriage during her seclusion she is supposed to be enveloped in a peculiar atmosphere of such a sort that were a young man to come near enough for it to touch him it would render him visible to every animal he might hunt so that his luck as a hunter would be gone131 5 seclusion of girls at puberty among the indians of south america seclusion of girls at puberty among the guaranis chiriguanos and lengua indians of south america when symptoms of puberty appeared on a girl for the first time the guaranis of southern brazil on the borders of paraguay used to sew her up in her hammock leaving only a small opening in it to allow her to breathe in this condition wrapt up and shrouded like a corpse she was kept for two or three days or so long as the symptoms lasted and during this time she had to observe a most rigorous fast after that she was entrusted to a matron who cut the girls hair and enjoined her to abstain most strictly from eating flesh of any kind until her hair should be grown long enough to hide her ears meanwhile the diviners drew omens of her future character from the various birds or animals that flew past or crossed her path if they saw a parrot they would say she was a chatterbox if an owl she was lazy and useless for domestic labours and so on132 in similar circumstances the chiriguanos of southeastern bolivia hoisted the girl in her hammock to the roof where she stayed for a month the second month the hammock was let halfway down from the roof and in the third month old women armed with sticks entered the hut and ran about striking everything they met saying they were hunting the snake that had wounded the girl133 the lengua indians of the paraguayan chaco under similar circumstances hang the girl in her hammock from the roof of the house but they leave her there only three days and nights during which they give her nothing to eat but a little paraguay tea or boiled maize only her mother or grandmother has access to her nobody else approaches or speaks to her if she is obliged to leave the hammock for a little her friends take great care to prevent her from touching the boyrusu which is an imaginary serpent that would swallow her up she must also be very careful not to set foot on the droppings of fowls or animals else she would suffer from sores on the throat and breast on the third day they let her down from the hammock cut her hair and make her sit in a corner of the room with her face turned to the wall she may speak to nobody and must abstain from flesh and fish these rigorous observances she must practise for nearly a year many girls die or are injured for life in consequence of the hardships they endure at this time their only occupations during their seclusion are spinning and weaving134 seclusion of girls at puberty among the yuracares of bolivia among the yuracares an indian tribe of bolivia at the eastern foot of the andes when a girl perceives the signs of puberty she informs her parents the mother weeps and the father constructs a little hut of palm leaves near the house in this cabin he shuts up his daughter so that she cannot see the light and there she remains fasting rigorously for four days meantime the mother assisted by the women of the neighbourhood has brewed a large quantity of the native intoxicant called chicha and poured it into wooden troughs and palm leaves on the morning of the fourth day three hours before the dawn the girls father having arrayed himself in his savage finery summons all his neighbours with loud cries the damsel is seated on a stone and every guest in turn cuts off a lock of her hair and running away hides it in the hollow trunk of a tree in the depths of the forest when they have all done so and seated themselves again gravely in the circle the girl offers to each of them a calabash full of very strong chicha before the wassailing begins the various fathers perform a curious operation on the arms of their sons who are seated beside them the operator takes a very sharp bone of an ape rubs it with a pungent spice and then pinching up the skin of his sons arm he pierces it with the bone through and through as a surgeon might introduce a seton this operation he repeats till the young mans arm is riddled with holes at regular intervals from the shoulder to the wrist almost all who take part in the festival are covered with these wounds which the indians call culucute having thus prepared themselves to spend a happy day they drink play on flutes sing and dance till evening rain thunder and lightning should they befall have no effect in damping the general enjoyment or preventing its continuance till after the sun has set the motive for perforating the arms of the young men is to make them skilful hunters at each perforation the sufferer is cheered by the promise of another sort of game or fish which the surgical operation will infallibly procure for him the same operation is performed on the arms and legs of the girls in order that they may be brave and strong even the dogs are operated on with the intention of making them run down the game better for five or six months afterwards the damsel must cover her head with bark and refrain from speaking to men the yuracares think that if they did not submit a young girl to this severe ordeal her children would afterwards perish by accidents of various kinds such as the sting of a serpent the bite of a jaguar the fall of a tree the wound of an arrow or what not135 seclusion of girls at puberty among the indians of the gran chaco among the matacos or mataguayos an indian tribe of the gran chaco a girl at puberty has to remain in seclusion for some time she lies covered up with branches or other things in a corner of the hut seeing no one and speaking to no one and during this time she may eat neither flesh nor fish meantime a man beats a drum in front of the house136 similarly among the tobas another indian tribe of the same region when a chiefs daughter has just attained to womanhood she is shut up for two or three days in the house all the men of the tribe scour the country to bring in game and fish for a feast and a mataco indian is engaged to drum sing and dance in front of the house without cessation day and night till the festival is over as the merrymaking lasts for two or three weeks the exhaustion of the musician at the end of it may be readily conceived meat and drink are supplied to him on the spot where he pays his laborious court to the muses the proceedings wind up with a saturnalia and a drunken debauch137 among the yaguas an indian tribe of the upper amazon a girl at puberty is shut up for three months in a lonely hut in the forest where her mother brings her food daily138 when a girl of the peguenches tribe perceives in herself the first signs of womanhood she is secluded by her mother in a corner of the hut screened off with blankets and is warned not to lift up her eyes on any man next day very early in the morning and again after sunset she is taken out by two women and made to run till she is tired in the interval she is again secluded in her corner on the following day she lays three packets of wool beside the path near the house to signify that she is now a woman139 among the passes mauhes and other tribes of brazil the young woman in similar circumstances is hung in her hammock from the roof and has to fast there for a month or as long as she can hold out140 one of the early settlers in brazil about the middle of the sixteenth century has described the severe ordeal which damsels at puberty had to undergo among the indians on the southeast coast of that country near what is now rio de janeiro when a girl had reached this critical period of life her hair was burned or shaved off close to the head then she was placed on a flat stone and cut with the tooth of an animal from the shoulders all down the back till she ran with blood next the ashes of a wild gourd were rubbed into the wounds the girl was bound hand and foot and hung in a hammock being enveloped in it so closely that no one could see her here she had to stay for three days without eating or drinking when the three days were over she stepped out of the hammock upon the flat stone for her feet might not touch the ground if she had a call of nature a female relation took the girl on her back and carried her out taking with her a live coal to prevent evil influences from entering the girls body being replaced in her hammock she was now allowed to get some flour boiled roots and water but might not taste salt or flesh thus she continued to the end of the first monthly period at the expiry of which she was gashed on the breast and belly as well as all down the back during the second month she still stayed in her hammock but her rule of abstinence was less rigid and she was allowed to spin the third month she was blackened with a certain pigment and began to go about as usual141 seclusion of girls at puberty among the indians of guiana custom of beating the girls and of causing them to be stung by ants amongst the macusis of british guiana when a girl shews the first signs of puberty she is hung in a hammock at the highest point of the hut for the first few days she may not leave the hammock by day but at night she must come down light a fire and spend the night beside it else she would break out in sores on her neck throat and other parts of her body so long as the symptoms are at their height she must fast rigorously when they have abated she may come down and take up her abode in a little compartment that is made for her in the darkest corner of the hut in the morning she may cook her food but it must be at a separate fire and in a vessel of her own after about ten days the magician comes and undoes the spell by muttering charms and breathing on her and on the more valuable of the things with which she has come in contact the pots and drinkingvessels which she used are broken and the fragments buried after her first bath the girl must submit to be beaten by her mother with thin rods without uttering a cry at the end of the second period she is again beaten but not afterwards she is now clean and can mix again with people142 other indians of guiana after keeping the girl in her hammock at the top of the hut for a month expose her to certain large ants whose bite is very painful143 sometimes in addition to being stung with ants the sufferer has to fast day and night so long as she remains slung up on high in her hammock so that when she comes down she is reduced to a skeleton the intention of stinging her with ants is said to be to make her strong to bear the burden of maternity144 amongst the uaupes of brazil a girl at puberty is secluded in the house for a month and allowed only a small quantity of bread and water then she is taken out into the midst of her relations and friends each of whom gives her four or five blows with pieces of sipo an elastic climber till she falls senseless or dead if she recovers the operation is repeated four times at intervals of six hours and it is considered an offence to the parents not to strike hard meantime pots of meats and fish have been made ready the sipos are dipped into them and then given to the girl to lick who is now considered a marriageable woman145 custom in south america of causing young men to be stung with ants as an initiatory rite the custom of stinging the girl at such times with ants or beating her with rods is intended we may be sure not as a punishment or a test of endurance but as a purification the object being to drive away the malignant influences with which a girl in this condition is believed to be beset and enveloped examples of purification by beating by incisions in the flesh and by stinging with ants have already come before us146 in some indian tribes of brazil and guiana young men do not rank as warriors and may not marry till they have passed through a terrible ordeal which consists in being stung by swarms of venomous ants whose bite is like fire thus among the mauhes on the tapajos river a southern tributary of the amazon boys of eight to ten years are obliged to thrust their arms into sleeves stuffed with great ferocious ants which the indians call tocandeira cryptocerus atratus f when the young victim shrieks with pain an excited mob of men dances round him shouting and encouraging him till he falls exhausted to the ground he is then committed to the care of old women who treat his fearfully swollen arms with fresh juice of the manioc and on his recovery he has to shew his strength and skill in bending a bow this cruel ordeal is commonly repeated again and again till the lad has reached his fourteenth year and can bear the agony without betraying any sign of emotion then he is a man and can marry a lads age is reckoned by the number of times he has passed through the ordeal147 an eyewitness has described how a young mauhe hero bore the torture with an endurance more than spartan dancing and singing with his arms cased in the terrible mittens before every cabin of the great common house till pallid staggering and with chattering teeth he triumphantly laid the gloves before the old chief and received the congratulations of the men and the caresses of the women then breaking away from his friends and admirers he threw himself into the river and remained in its cool soothing water till nightfall148 similarly among the ticunas of the upper amazon on the border of peru the young man who would take his place among the warriors must plunge his arm into a sort of basket full of venomous ants and keep it there for several minutes without uttering a cry he generally falls backwards and sometimes succumbs to the fever which ensues hence as soon as the ordeal is over the women are prodigal of their attentions to him and rub the swollen arm with a particular kind of herb149 ordeals of this sort appear to be in vogue among the indians of the rio negro as well as of the amazon150 among the rucuyennes a tribe of indians in the north of brazil on the borders of guiana young men who are candidates for marriage must submit to be stung all over their persons not only with ants but with wasps which are applied to their naked bodies in curious instruments of trelliswork shaped like fantastic quadrupeds or birds the patient invariably falls down in a swoon and is carried like dead to his hammock where he is tightly lashed with cords as they come to themselves they writhe in agony so that their hammocks rock violently to and fro causing the hut to shake as if it were about to collapse this dreadful ordeal is called by the indians a marak151 custom of causing men and women to be stung with ants to improve their character and health or to render them invulnerable the same ordeal under the same name is also practised by the wayanas an indian tribe of french guiana but with them we are told it is no longer deemed an indispensable preliminary to marriage it is rather a sort of national medicine administered chiefly to the youth of both sexes applied to men the marak as it is called sharpens them prevents them from being heavy and lazy makes them active brisk industrious imparts strength and helps them to shoot well with the bow without it the indians would always be slack and rather sickly would always have a little fever and would lie perpetually in their hammocks as for the women the marak keeps them from going to sleep renders them active alert brisk gives them strength and a liking for work makes them good housekeepers good workers at the stockade good makers of cachiri every one undergoes the marak at least twice in his life sometimes thrice and oftener if he likes it may be had from the age of about eight years and upward and no one thinks it odd that a man of forty should voluntarily submit to it152 similarly the indians of st juan capistrano in california used to be branded on some part of their bodies generally on the right arm but sometimes on the leg also not as a proof of manly fortitude but because they believed that the custom added greater strength to the nerves and gave a better pulse for the management of the bow afterwards they were whipped with nettles and covered with ants that they might become robust and the infliction was always performed in summer during the months of july and august when the nettle was in its most fiery state they gathered small bunches which they fastened together and the poor deluded indian was chastised by inflicting blows with them upon his naked limbs until unable to walk and then he was carried to the nest of the nearest and most furious species of ants and laid down among them while some of his friends with sticks kept annoying the insects to make them still more violent what torments did they not undergo what pain what hellish inflictions yet their faith gave them power to endure all without a murmur and they remained as if dead having undergone these dreadful ordeals they were considered as invulnerable and believed that the arrows of their enemies could no longer harm them153 among the alur a tribe inhabiting the southwestern region of the upper nile to bury a man in an anthill and leave him there for a while is the regular treatment for insanity154 in such cases the beating or stinging was originally a purification at a later time it is interpreted as a test of courage and endurance in like manner it is probable that beating or scourging as a religious or ceremonial rite was originally a mode of purification it was meant to wipe off and drive away a dangerous contagion whether personified as demoniacal or not which was supposed to be adhering physically though invisibly to the body of the sufferer155 the pain inflicted on the person beaten was no more the object of the beating than it is of a surgical operation with us it was a necessary accident that was all in later times such customs were interpreted otherwise and the pain from being an accident became the prime object of the ceremony which was now regarded either as a test of endurance imposed upon persons at critical epochs of life or as a mortification of the flesh well pleasing to the god but asceticism under any shape or form is never primitive the savage it is true in certain circumstances will voluntarily subject himself to pains and privations which appear to us wholly needless but he never acts thus unless he believes that some solid temporal advantage is to be gained by so doing pain for the sake of pain whether as a moral discipline in this life or as a means of winning a glorious immortality hereafter is not an object which he sets himself deliberately to pursue this explanation confirmed with reference to the beating of girls at puberty among the south american indians treatment of a girl at puberty among the banivas of the orinoco symptoms of puberty in a girl regarded as wounds inflicted by a demon if this view is correct we can understand why so many indian tribes of south america compel the youth of both sexes to submit to these painful and sometimes fatal ordeals they imagine that in this way they rid the young folk of certain evils inherent in youth especially at the critical age of puberty and when they picture to themselves the evils in a personal form as dangerous spirits or demons the ceremony of their expulsion may in the strict sense be termed an exorcism this certainly appears to be the interpretation which the banivas of the orinoco put upon the cruel scourgings which they inflict on girls at puberty at her first menstruation a baniva girl must pass several days and nights in her hammock almost motionless and getting nothing to eat and drink but water and a little manioc while she lies there the suitors for her hand apply to her father and he who can afford to give most for her or can prove himself the best man is promised the damsel in marriage the fast over some old men enter the hut bandage the girls eyes cover her head with a bonnet of which the fringes fall on her shoulders and then lead her forth and tie her to a post set up in an open place the head of the post is carved in the shape of a grotesque face none but the old men may witness what follows were a woman caught peeping and prying it would go ill with her she would be marked out for the vengeance of the demon who would make her expiate her crime at the very next moon by madness or death every participant in the ceremony comes armed with a scourge of cords or of fish skins some of them reinforce the virtue of the instrument by tying little sharp stones to the end of the thongs then to the dismal and deafening notes of shelltrumpets blown by two or three supernumeraries the men circle round and round the post every one applying his scourge as he passes to the girls back till it streams with blood at last the musicians winding tremendous blasts on their trumpets against the demon advance and touch the post in which he is supposed to be incorporate then the blows cease to descend the girl is untied often in a fainting state and carried away to have her wounds washed and simples applied to them the youngest of the executioners or rather of the exorcists hastens to inform her betrothed husband of the happy issue of the exorcism the spirit he says had cast thy beloved into a sleep as deep almost as that of death but we have rescued her from his attacks and laid her down in such and such a place go seek her then going from house to house through the village he cries to the inmates come let us burn the demon who would have taken possession of such and such a girl our friend the bridegroom at once carries his wounded and suffering bride to his own house and all the people gather round the post for the pleasure of burning it and the demon together a great pile of firewood has meanwhile been heaped up about it and the women run round the pyre cursing in shrill voices the wicked spirit who has wrought all this evil the men join in with hoarser cries and animate themselves for the business in hand by deep draughts of an intoxicant which has been provided for the occasion by the parentsinlaw soon the bridegroom having committed the bride to the care of his mother appears on the scene brandishing a lighted torch he addresses the demon with bitter mockery and reproaches informs him that the fair creature on whom he the demon had nefarious designs is now his the bridegrooms blooming spouse and shaking his torch at the grinning head on the post he screams out this is how the victims of thy persecution take vengeance on thee with these words he puts a light to the pyre at once the drums strike up the trumpets blare and men women and children begin to dance in two long rows they dance the men on one side the women on the other advancing till they almost touch and then retiring again after that the two rows join hands and forming a huge circle trip it round and round the blaze till the post with its grotesque face is consumed in the flames and nothing of the pyre remains but a heap of red and glowing embers the evil spirit has been destroyed thus delivered from her persecutor the young wife will be free from sickness will not die in childbed and will bear many children to her husband156 from this account it appears that the banivas attribute the symptoms of puberty in girls to the wounds inflicted on them by an amorous devil who however can be not only exorcised but burnt to ashes at the stake 6 seclusion of girls at puberty in india and cambodia seclusion of girls at puberty among the hindoos seclusion of girls at puberty in southern india when a hindoo maiden reaches maturity she is kept in a dark room for four days and is forbidden to see the sun she is regarded as unclean no one may touch her her diet is restricted to boiled rice milk sugar curd and tamarind without salt on the morning of the fifth day she goes to a neighbouring tank accompanied by five women whose husbands are alive smeared with turmeric water they all bathe and return home throwing away the mat and other things that were in the room157 the rarhi brahmans of bengal compel a girl at puberty to live alone and do not allow her to see the face of any male for three days she remains shut up in a dark room and has to undergo certain penances fish flesh and sweetmeats are forbidden her she must live upon rice and ghee158 among the tiyans of malabar a girl is thought to be polluted for four days from the beginning of her first menstruation during this time she must keep to the north side of the house where she sleeps on a grass mat of a particular kind in a room festooned with garlands of young coconut leaves another girl keeps her company and sleeps with her but she may not touch any other person tree or plant further she may not see the sky and woe betide her if she catches sight of a crow or a cat her diet must be strictly vegetarian without salt tamarinds or chillies she is armed against evil spirits by a knife which is placed on the mat or carried on her person159 among the kappiliyans of madura and tinnevelly a girl at her first monthly period remains under pollution for thirteen days either in a corner of the house which is screened off for her use by her maternal uncle or in a temporary hut which is erected by the same relative on the common land of the village on the thirteenth day she bathes in a tank and on entering the house steps over a pestle and a cake near the entrance some food is placed and a dog is allowed to partake of it but his enjoyment is marred by suffering for while he eats he receives a sound thrashing and the louder he howls the better for the larger will be the family to which the young woman will give birth should there be no howls there will be no children the temporary hut in which the girl passed the days of her seclusion is burnt down and the pots which she used are smashed to shivers160 similarly among the parivarams of madura when a girl attains to puberty she is kept for sixteen days in a hut which is guarded at night by her relations and when her sequestration is over the hut is burnt down and the pots she used are broken into very small pieces because they think that if rainwater gathered in any of them the girl would be childless161 the pulayars of travancore build a special hut in the jungle for the use of a girl at puberty there she remains for seven days no one else may enter the hut not even her mother women stand a little way off and lay down food for her at the end of the time she is brought home clad in a new or clean cloth and friends are treated to betelnut toddy and arack162 among the singhalese a girl at her first menstruation is confined to a room where she may neither see nor be seen by any male after being thus secluded for two weeks she is taken out with her face covered and is bathed by women at the back of the house near the bathingplace are kept branches of any milkbearing tree usually of the jaktree in some cases while the time of purification or uncleanness lasts the maiden stays in a separate hut which is afterwards burnt down163 seclusion of girls at puberty in cambodia in cambodia a girl at puberty is put to bed under a mosquito curtain where she should stay a hundred days usually however four five ten or twenty days are thought enough and even this in a hot climate and under the close meshes of the curtain is sufficiently trying164 according to another account a cambodian maiden at puberty is said to enter into the shade during her retirement which according to the rank and position of her family may last any time from a few days to several years she has to observe a number of rules such as not to be seen by a strange man not to eat flesh or fish and so on she goes nowhere not even to the pagoda but this state of seclusion is discontinued during eclipses at such times she goes forth and pays her devotions to the monster who is supposed to cause eclipses by catching the heavenly bodies between his teeth165 this permission to break her rule of retirement and appear abroad during an eclipse seems to shew how literally the injunction is interpreted which forbids maidens entering on womanhood to look upon the sun 7 seclusion of girls at puberty in folktales traces of the seclusion of girls at puberty in folktales danish story of the girl who might not see the sun a superstition so widely diffused as this might be expected to leave traces in legends and folktales and it has done so in a danish story we read of a princess who was fated to be carried off by a warlock if ever the sun shone on her before she had passed her thirtieth year so the king her father kept her shut up in the palace and had all the windows on the east south and west sides blocked up lest a sunbeam should fall on his darling child and he should thus lose her for ever only at evening when the sun was down might she walk for a little in the beautiful garden of the castle in time a prince came awooing followed by a train of gorgeous knights and squires on horses all ablaze with gold and silver the king said the prince might have his daughter to wife on condition that he would not carry her away to his home till she was thirty years old but would live with her in the castle where the windows looked out only to the north the prince agreed so married they were the bride was only fifteen and fifteen more long weary years must pass before she might step out of the gloomy donjon breathe the fresh air and see the sun but she and her gallant young bridegroom loved each other and they were happy often they sat hand in hand at the window looking out to the north and talked of what they would do when they were free still it was a little dull to look out always at the same window and to see nothing but the castle woods and the distant hills and the clouds drifting silently over them well one day it happened that all the people in the castle had gone away to a neighbouring castle to witness a tournament and other gaieties and the two young folks were left as usual all alone at the window looking out to the north they sat silent for a time gazing away to the hills it was a grey sad day the sky was overcast and the weather seemed to draw to rain at last the prince said there will be no sunshine today what if we were to drive over and join the rest at the tournament his young wife gladly consented for she longed to see more of the world than those eternal green woods and those eternal blue hills which were all she ever saw from the window so the horses were put into the coach and it rattled up to the door and in they got and away they drove at first all went well the clouds hung low over the woods the wind sighed in the trees a drearier day you could hardly imagine so they joined the rest at the other castle and took their seats to watch the jousting in the lists so intent were they in watching the gay spectacle of the prancing steeds the fluttering pennons and the glittering armour of the knights that they failed to mark the change the fatal change in the weather for the wind was rising and had begun to disperse the clouds and suddenly the sun broke through and the glory of it fell like an aureole on the young wife and at once she vanished away no sooner did her husband miss her from his side than he too mysteriously disappeared the tournament broke up in confusion the bereft father hastened home and shut himself up in the dark castle from which the light of life had departed the green woods and the blue hills could still be seen from the window that looked to the north but the young faces that had gazed out of it so wistfully were gone as it seemed for ever166 tyrolese story of the girl who might not see the sun a tyrolese story tells how it was the doom of a lovely maiden with golden hair to be transported into the belly of a whale if ever a sunbeam fell on her hearing of the fame of her beauty the king of the country sent for her to be his bride and her brother drove the fair damsel to the palace in a carefully closed coach himself sitting on the box and handling the reins on the way they overtook two hideous witches who pretended they were weary and begged for a lift in the coach at first the brother refused to take them in but his tenderhearted sister entreated him to have compassion on the two poor footsore women for you may easily imagine that she was not acquainted with their true character so down he got rather surlily from the box opened the coach door and in the two witches stepped laughing in their sleeves but no sooner had the brother mounted the box and whipped up the horses than one of the two wicked witches bored a hole in the closed coach a sunbeam at once shot through the hole and fell on the fair damsel so she vanished from the coach and was spirited away into the belly of a whale in the neighbouring sea you can imagine the consternation of the king when the coach door opened and instead of his blooming bride out bounced two hideous hags167 modern greek stories of the maid who might not see the sun in a modern greek folktale the fates predict that in her fifteenth year a princess must be careful not to let the sun shine on her for if this were to happen she would be turned into a lizard168 in another modern greek tale the sun bestows a daughter upon a childless woman on condition of taking the child back to himself when she is twelve years old so when the child was twelve the mother closed the doors and windows and stopped up all the chinks and crannies to prevent the sun from coming to fetch away her daughter but she forgot to stop up the keyhole and a sunbeam streamed through it and carried off the girl169 in a sicilian story a seer foretells that a king will have a daughter who in her fourteenth year will conceive a child by the sun so when the child was born the king shut her up in a lonely tower which had no window lest a sunbeam should fall on her when she was nearly fourteen years old it happened that her parents sent her a piece of roasted kid in which she found a sharp bone with this bone she scraped a hole in the wall and a sunbeam shot through the hole and got her with child170 the story of danae and its parallel in a kirghiz legend the old greek story of danae who was confined by her father in a subterranean chamber or a brazen tower but impregnated by zeus who reached her in the shape of a shower of gold171 perhaps belongs to the same class of tales it has its counterpart in the legend which the kirghiz of siberia tell of their ancestry a certain khan had a fair daughter whom he kept in a dark iron house that no man might see her an old woman tended her and when the girl was grown to maidenhood she asked the old woman where do you go so often my child said the old dame there is a bright world in that bright world your father and mother live and all sorts of people live there that is where i go the maiden said good mother i will tell nobody but shew me that bright world so the old woman took the girl out of the iron house but when she saw the bright world the girl tottered and fainted and the eye of god fell upon her and she conceived her angry father put her in a golden chest and sent her floating away fairy gold can float in fairyland over the wide sea172 the shower of gold in the greek story and the eye of god in the kirghiz legend probably stand for sunlight and the sun impregnation of women by the sun in legends the idea that women may be impregnated by the sun is not uncommon in legends thus for example among the indians of guacheta in colombia it is said a report once ran that the sun would impregnate one of their maidens who should bear a child and yet remain a virgin the chief had two daughters and was very desirous that one of them should conceive in this miraculous manner so every day he made them climb a hill to the east of his house in order to be touched by the first beams of the rising sun his wishes were fulfilled for one of the damsels conceived and after nine months gave birth to an emerald so she wrapped it in cotton and placed it in her bosom and in a few days it turned into a child who received the name of garanchacha and was universally recognized as a son of the sun173 again the samoans tell of a woman named mangamangai who became pregnant by looking at the rising sun her son grew up and was named child of the sun at his marriage he applied to his mother for a dowry but she bade him apply to his father the sun and told him how to go to him so one morning he took a long vine and made a noose in it then climbing up a tree he threw the noose over the sun and caught him fast thus arrested in his progress the luminary asked him what he wanted and being told by the young man that he wanted a present for his bride the sun obligingly packed up a store of blessings in a basket with which the youth descended to the earth174 traces in marriage customs of the belief that women can be impregnated by the sun even in the marriage customs of various races we may perhaps detect traces of this belief that women can be impregnated by the sun thus amongst the chaco indians of south america a newly married couple used to sleep the first night on a mares or bullocks skin with their heads towards the west for the marriage is not considered ratified till the rising sun shines on their feet the succeeding morning175 at old hindoo marriages the first ceremony was the impregnationrite garbhadhana during the previous day the bride was made to look towards the sun or to be in some way exposed to its rays176 amongst the turks of siberia it was formerly the custom on the morning after the marriage to lead the young couple out of the hut to greet the rising sun the same custom is said to be still practised in iran and central asia under a belief that the beams of the rising sun are the surest means of impregnating the new bride177 belief in the impregnation of women by the moon and as some people think that women may be gotten with child by the sun so others imagine that they can conceive by the moon according to the greenlanders the moon is a young man and he now and then comes down to give their wives a visit and caress them for which reason no woman dare sleep lying upon her back without she first spits upon her fingers and rubs her belly with it for the same reason the young maids are afraid to stare long at the moon imagining they may get a child by the bargain178 similarly breton peasants are reported to believe that women or girls who expose their persons to the moonlight may be impregnated by it and give birth to monsters179 8 reasons for the seclusion of girls at puberty the reason for the seclusion of women at puberty is the dread of menstruous blood the motive for the restraints so commonly imposed on girls at puberty is the deeply engrained dread which primitive man universally entertains of menstruous blood he fears it at all times but especially on its first appearance hence the restrictions under which women lie at their first menstruation are usually more stringent than those which they have to observe at any subsequent recurrence of the mysterious flow some evidence of the fear and of the customs based on it has been cited in an earlier part of this work180 but as the terror for it is nothing less which the phenomenon periodically strikes into the mind of the savage has deeply influenced his life and institutions it may be well to illustrate the subject with some further examples dread and seclusion of menstruous women among the aborigines of australia thus in the encounter bay tribe of south australia there is or used to be a superstition which obliges a woman to separate herself from the camp at the time of her monthly illness when if a young man or boy should approach she calls out and he immediately makes a circuit to avoid her if she is neglectful upon this point she exposes herself to scolding and sometimes to severe beating by her husband or nearest relation because the boys are told from their infancy that if they see the blood they will early become greyheaded and their strength will fail prematurely181 and of the south australian aborigines in general we read that there is a custom requiring all boys and uninitiated young men to sleep at some distance from the huts of the adults and to remove altogether away in the morning as soon as daylight dawns and the natives begin to move about this is to prevent their seeing the women some of whom may be menstruating and if looked upon by the young males it is supposed that dire results will follow182 and amongst these tribes women in their courses are not allowed to eat fish of any kind or to go near the water at all it being one of their superstitions that if a female in that state goes near the water no success can be expected by the men in fishing183 similarly among the natives of the murray river menstruous women were not allowed to go near water for fear of frightening the fish they were also not allowed to eat them for the same reason a woman during such periods would never cross the river in a canoe or even fetch water for the camp it was sufficient for her to say thama to ensure her husband getting the water himself184 the dieri of central australia believe that if women at these times were to eat fish or bathe in a river the fish would all die and the water would dry up in this tribe a mark made with red ochre round a womans mouth indicates that she has her courses no one would offer fish to such a woman185 the arunta of central australia forbid menstruous women to gather the irriakura bulbs which form a staple article of diet for both men and women they believe that were a woman to break this rule the supply of bulbs would fail186 among the aborigines of victoria the wife at her monthly periods had to sleep on the opposite side of the fire from her husband she might partake of nobodys food and nobody would partake of hers for people thought that if they ate or drank anything that had been touched by a woman in her courses it would make them weak or ill unmarried girls and widows at such times had to paint their heads and the upper parts of their bodies red187 no doubt as a danger signal severe penalties inflicted for breaches of the custom of seclusion in some australian tribes the seclusion of menstruous women was even more rigid and was enforced by severer penalties than a scolding or a beating thus with regard to certain tribes of new south wales and southern queensland we are told that during the monthly illness the woman is not allowed to touch anything that men use or even to walk on a path that any man frequents on pain of death188 again there is a regulation relating to camps in the wakelbura tribe which forbids the women coming into the encampment by the same path as the men any violation of this rule would in a large camp be punished with death the reason for this is the dread with which they regard the menstrual period of women during such a time a woman is kept entirely away from the camp half a mile at least a woman in such a condition has boughs of some tree of her totem tied round her loins and is constantly watched and guarded for it is thought that should any male be so unfortunate as to see a woman in such a condition he would die if such a woman were to let herself be seen by a man she would probably be put to death when the woman has recovered she is painted red and white her head covered with feathers and returns to the camp189 dread and seclusion of menstruous women in the torres straits islands new guinea galela and sumatra in muralug one of the torres straits islands a menstruous woman may not eat anything that lives in the sea else the natives believe that the fisheries would fail again in mabuiag another of these islands women who have their courses on them may not eat turtle flesh nor turtle eggs probably for a similar reason and during the season when the turtles are pairing the restrictions laid on such a woman are much severer she may not even enter a house in which there is turtle flesh nor approach a fire on which the flesh is cooking she may not go near the sea and she should not walk on the beach below highwater mark nay the infection extends to her husband who may not himself harpoon or otherwise take an active part in catching turtle however he is permitted to form one of the crew on a turtling expedition provided he takes the precaution of rubbing his armpits with certain leaves to which no doubt a disinfectant virtue is ascribed190 among the kai of german new guinea women at their monthly sickness must live in little huts built for them in the forest they may not enter the cultivated fields for if they did go to them and the pigs were to taste of the blood it would inspire the animals with an irresistible desire to go likewise into the fields where they would commit great depredations on the growing crops hence the issue from women at these times is carefully buried to prevent the pigs from getting at it and conversely if the pigs often break into the fields the blame is laid on the women who by the neglect of these elementary precautions have put temptation in the way of the swine191 in galela to the west of new guinea women at their monthly periods may not enter a tobaccofield or the plants would be attacked by disease192 the minangkabauers of sumatra are persuaded that if a woman in her unclean state were to go near a ricefield the crop would be spoiled193 dread and seclusion of menstruous women among the tribes of south africa the bushmen of south africa think that by a glance of a girls eye at the time when she ought to be kept in strict retirement men become fixed in whatever position they happen to occupy with whatever they were holding in their hands and are changed into trees that talk194 cattlerearing tribes of south africa hold that their cattle would die if the milk were drunk by a menstruous woman195 and they fear the same disaster if a drop of her blood were to fall on the ground and the oxen were to pass over it to prevent such a calamity women in general not menstruous women only are forbidden to enter the cattle enclosure and more than that they may not use the ordinary paths in entering the village or in passing from one hut to another they are obliged to make circuitous tracks at the back of the huts in order to avoid the ground in the middle of the village where the cattle stand or lie down these womens tracks may be seen at every caffre village196 dread and seclusion of menstruous women among the tribes of central and east africa similarly among the bahima a cattlebreeding tribe of ankole in central africa no menstruous woman may drink milk lest by so doing she should injure the cows and she may not lie on her husbands bed no doubt lest she should injure him indeed she is forbidden to lie on a bed at all and must sleep on the ground her diet is restricted to vegetables and beer197 among the baganda in like manner no menstruous woman might drink milk or come into contact with any milkvessel198 and she might not touch anything that belonged to her husband nor sit on his mat nor cook his food if she touched anything of his at such a time it was deemed equivalent to wishing him dead or to actually working magic for his destruction199 were she to handle any article of his he would surely fall ill were she to handle his weapons he would certainly be killed in the next battle even a woman who did not menstruate was believed by the baganda to be a source of danger to her husband indeed capable of killing him hence before he went to war he used to wound her slightly with his spear so as to draw blood this was thought to ensure his safe return200 apparently the notion was that if the wife did not lose blood in one way or another her husband would be bled in war to make up for her deficiency so by way of guarding against this undesirable event he took care to relieve her of a little superfluous blood before he repaired to the field of honour further the baganda would not suffer a menstruous woman to visit a well if she did so they feared that the water would dry up and that she herself would fall sick and die unless she confessed her fault and the medicineman made atonement for her201 among the akikuyu of british east africa if a new hut is built in a village and the wife chances to menstruate in it on the day she lights the first fire there the hut must be broken down and demolished the very next day the woman may on no account sleep a second night in it there is a curse thahu both on her and on it202 in the suk tribe of british east africa warriors may not eat anything that has been touched by menstruous women if they did so it is believed that they would lose their virility in the rain they will shiver and in the heat they will faint suk men and women take their meals apart because the men fear that one or more of the women may be menstruating203 the anyanja of british central africa at the southern end of lake nyassa think that a man who should sleep with a woman in her courses would fall sick and die unless some remedy were applied in time and with them it is a rule that at such times a woman should not put any salt into the food she is cooking otherwise the people who partook of the food salted by her would suffer from a certain disease called tsempo hence to obviate the danger she calls a child to put the salt into the dish204 dread and seclusion of menstruous women among the tribes of west africa among the hos a tribe of ewe negroes of togoland in west africa so long as a wife has her monthly sickness she may not cook for her husband nor lie on his bed nor sit on his stool an infraction of these rules would assuredly it is believed cause her husband to die if her husband is a priest or a magician or a chief she may not pass the days of her uncleanness in the house but must go elsewhere till she is clean205 among the ewe negroes of this region each village has its huts where women who have their courses on them must spend their time secluded from intercourse with other people sometimes these huts stand by themselves in public places sometimes they are mere shelters built either at the back or front of the ordinary dwellinghouses a woman is punishable if she does not pass the time of her monthly sickness in one of these huts or shelters provided for her use thus if she shews herself in her own house or even in the yard of the house she may be fined a sheep which is killed its flesh divided among the people and its blood poured on the image of the chief god as a sinoffering to expiate her offence she is also forbidden to go to the place where the villagers draw water and if she breaks the rule she must give a goat to be killed its flesh is distributed and its blood diluted with water and mixed with herbs is sprinkled on the wateringplace and on the paths leading to it were any woman to disregard these salutary precautions the chief fetishman in the village would fall sick and die which would be an irreparable loss to society206 powerful influence ascribed to menstruous blood in arab legend the miraculous virtue ascribed to menstruous blood is well illustrated in a story told by the arab chronicler tabari he relates how sapor king of persia besieged the strong city of atrae in the desert of mesopotamia for several years without being able to take it but the king of the city whose name was daizan had a daughter and when it was with her after the manner of women she went forth from the city and dwelt for a time in the suburb for such was the custom of the place now it fell out that while she tarried there sapor saw her and loved her and she loved him for he was a handsome man and she a lovely maid and she said to him what will you give me if i shew you how you may destroy the walls of this city and slay my father and he said to her i will give you what you will and i will exalt you above my other wives and will set you nearer to me than them all then she said to him take a greenish dove with a ring about its neck and write something on its foot with the menstruous blood of a blueeyed maid then let the bird loose and it will perch on the walls of the city and they will fall down for that says the arab historian was the talisman of the city which could not be destroyed in any other way and sapor did as she bade him and the city fell down in a heap and he stormed it and slew daizan on the spot207 dread and seclusion of menstruous women among the jews and in syria according to the talmud if a woman at the beginning of her period passes between two men she thereby kills one of them if she passes between them towards the end of her period she only causes them to quarrel violently208 maimonides tells us that down to his time it was a common custom in the east to keep women at their periods in a separate house and to burn everything on which they had trodden a man who spoke with such a woman or who was merely exposed to the same wind that blew over her became thereby unclean209 peasants of the lebanon think that menstruous women are the cause of many misfortunes their shadow causes flowers to wither and trees to perish it even arrests the movements of serpents if one of them mounts a horse the animal might die or at least be disabled for a long time210 in syria to this day a woman who has her courses on her may neither salt nor pickle for the people think that whatever she pickled or salted would not keep211 the toaripi of new guinea doubtless for a similar reason will not allow women at such times to cook212 dread and seclusion of menstruous women in india the bhuiyars a dravidian tribe of south mirzapur are said to feel an intense dread of menstrual pollution every house has two doors one of which is used only by women in this condition during her impurity the wife is fed by her husband apart from the rest of the family and whenever she has to quit the house she is obliged to creep out on her hands and knees in order not to defile the thatch by her touch213 the kharwars another aboriginal tribe of the same district keep their women at such seasons in the outer verandah of the house for eight days and will not let them enter the kitchen or the cowhouse during this time the unclean woman may not cook nor even touch the cooking vessels when the eight days are over she bathes washes her clothes and returns to family life214 hindoo women seclude themselves at their monthly periods and observe a number of rules such as not to drink milk not to milk cows not to touch fire not to lie on a high bed not to walk on common paths not to cross the track of animals not to walk by the side of flowering plants and not to observe the heavenly bodies215 the motive for these restrictions is not mentioned but probably it is a dread of the baleful influence which is supposed to emanate from women at these times the parsees who reverence fire will not suffer menstruous women to see it or even to look on a lighted taper216 during their infirmity the women retire from their houses to little lodges in the country whither victuals are brought to them daily at the end of their seclusion they bathe and send a kid a fowl or a pigeon to the priest as an offering217 in annam a woman at her monthly periods is deemed a centre of impurity and contact with her is avoided she is subject to all sorts of restrictions which she must observe herself and which others must observe towards her she may not touch any food which is to be preserved by salting whether it be fish flesh or vegetables for were she to touch it the food would putrefy she may not enter any sacred place she may not be present at any religious ceremony the linen which she wears at such times must be washed by herself at sunrise never at night on reaching puberty girls may not touch flowers or the fruits of certain trees for touched by them the flowers would fade and the fruits fall to the ground it is on account of their reputation for impurity that the women generally live isolated in every house they have an apartment reserved for them and they never eat at the same table as the men for the same reason they are excluded from all religious ceremonies they may only be present at family ceremonies but without ever officiating in them218 dread and seclusion of menstruous women among the indians of south and central america the guayquiries of the orinoco think that when a woman has her courses everything upon which she steps will die and that if a man treads on the place where she has passed his legs will immediately swell up219 among the guaraunos of the same great river women at their periods are regarded as unclean and kept apart in special huts where all that they need is brought to them220 in like manner among the piapocos an indian tribe on the guayabero a tributary of the orinoco a menstruous woman is secluded from her family every month for four or five days she passes the time in a special hut whither her husband brings her food and at the end of the time she takes a bath and resumes her usual occupations221 so among the indians of the mosquito territory in central america when a woman is in her courses she must quit the village for seven or eight days a small hut is built for her in the wood and at night some of the village girls go and sleep with her to keep her company or if the nights are dark and jaguars are known to be prowling in the neighbourhood her husband will take his gun or bow and sleep in a hammock near her she may neither handle nor cook food all is prepared and carried to her when the sickness is over she bathes in the river puts on clean clothes and returns to her household duties222 among the bribri indians of costa rica a girl at her first menstruation retires to a hut built for the purpose in the forest and there she must stay till she has been purified by a medicineman who breathes on her and places various objects such as feathers the beaks of birds the teeth of beasts and so forth upon her body a married woman at her periods remains in the house with her husband but she is reckoned unclean bukuru and must avoid all intimate relations with him she uses for plates only banana leaves which when she has done with them she throws away in a sequestered spot for should a cow find and eat them the animal would waste away and perish also she drinks only out of a special vessel because any person who should afterwards drink out of the same vessel would infallibly pine away and die223 dread and seclusion of menstruous women among the indians of north america among most tribes of north american indians the custom was that women in their courses retired from the camp or the village and lived during the time of their uncleanness in special huts or shelters which were appropriated to their use there they dwelt apart eating and sleeping by themselves warming themselves at their own fires and strictly abstaining from all communications with men who shunned them just as if they were stricken with the plague no article of furniture used in these menstrual huts might be used in any other not even the flint and steel with which in the old days the fires were kindled no one would borrow a light from a woman in her seclusion if a white man in his ignorance asked to light his pipe at her fire she would refuse to grant the request telling him that it would make his nose bleed and his head ache and that he would fall sick in consequence if an indians wooden pipe cracked his friends would think that he had either lit it at one of these polluted fires or had held some converse with a woman during her retirement which was esteemed a most disgraceful and wicked thing to do decent men would not approach within a certain distance of a woman at such times and if they had to convey anything to her they would stand some forty or fifty paces off and throw it to her everything which was touched by her hands during this period was deemed ceremonially unclean indeed her touch was thought to convey such pollution that if she chanced to lay a finger on a chiefs lodge or his gun or anything else belonging to him it would be instantly destroyed if she crossed the path of a hunter or a warrior his luck for that day at least would be gone were she not thus secluded it was supposed that the men would be attacked by diseases of various kinds which would prove mortal in some tribes a woman who infringed the rules of separation might have to answer with her life for any misfortunes that might happen to individuals or to the tribe in consequence as it was supposed of her criminal negligence when she quitted her tent or hut to go into retirement the fire in it was extinguished and the ashes thrown away outside of the village and a new fire was kindled as if the old one had been defiled by her presence at the end of their seclusion the women bathed in running streams and returned to their usual occupations224 dread and seclusion of menstruous women among the creek choctaw omaha and cheyenne indians thus to take examples the creek and kindred indians of the united states compelled women at menstruation to live in separate huts at some distance from the village there the women had to stay at the risk of being surprised and cut off by enemies it was thought a most horrid and dangerous pollution to go near the women at such times and the danger extended to enemies who if they slew the women had to cleanse themselves from the pollution by means of certain sacred herbs and roots225 similarly the choctaw women had to quit their huts during their monthly periods and might not return till after they had been purified while their uncleanness lasted they had to prepare their own food the men believed that if they were to approach a menstruous woman they would fall ill and that some mishap would overtake them when they went to the wars226 when an omaha woman has her courses on her she retires from the family to a little shelter of bark or grass supported by sticks where she kindles a fire and cooks her victuals alone her seclusion lasts four days during this time she may not approach or touch a horse for the indians believe that such contamination would impoverish or weaken the animal227 among the potawatomis the women at their monthly periods are not allowed to associate with the rest of the nation they are completely laid aside and are not permitted to touch any article of furniture or food which the men have occasion to use if the indians be stationary at the time the women are placed outside of the camp if on a march they are not allowed to follow the trail but must take a different path and keep at a distance from the main body228 among the cheyennes menstruous women slept in special lodges the men believed that if they slept with their wives at such times they would probably be wounded in their next battle a man who owned a shield had very particularly to be on his guard against women in their courses he might not go into a lodge where one of them happened to be nor even into a lodge where one of them had been until a ceremony of purification had been performed sweet grass and juniper were burnt in the tent and the pegs were pulled up and the covering thrown back as if the tent were about to be struck after this pretence of decamping from the polluted spot the owner of the shield might enter the tent229 dread and seclusion of menstruous women among the indians of british columbia the stseelis indians of british columbia imagined that if a menstruous woman were to step over a bundle of arrows the arrows would thereby be rendered useless and might even cause the death of their owner and similarly that if she passed in front of a hunter who carried a gun the weapon would never shoot straight again neither her husband nor her father would dream of going out to hunt while she was in this state and even if he had wished to do so the other hunters would not go with him hence to keep them out of harms way the women both married and unmarried were secluded at these times for four days in shelters230 among the thompson indians of british columbia every woman had to isolate herself from the rest of the people during every recurring period of menstruation and had to live some little way off in a small brush or bark lodge made for the purpose at these times she was considered unclean must use cooking and eating utensils of her own and was supplied with food by some other woman if she smoked out of a pipe other than her own that pipe would ever afterwards be hot to smoke if she crossed in front of a gun that gun would thenceforth be useless for the war or the chase unless indeed the owner promptly washed the weapon in medecine or struck the woman with it once on each principal part of her body if a man ate or had any intercourse with a menstruous woman nay if he merely wore clothes or mocassins made or patched by her he would have bad luck in hunting and the bears would attack him fiercely before being admitted again among the people she had to change all her clothes and wash several times in clear water the clothes worn during her isolation were hung on a tree to be used next time or to be washed for one day after coming back among the people she did not cook food were a man to eat food cooked by a woman at such times he would have incapacitated himself for hunting and exposed himself to sickness or death231 dread and seclusion of menstruous women among the chippeway indians among the chippeways and other indians of the hudson bay territory menstruous women are excluded from the camp and take up their abode in huts of branches they wear long hoods which effectually conceal the head and breast they may not touch the household furniture nor any objects used by men for their touch is supposed to defile them so that their subsequent use would be followed by certain mischief or misfortune such as disease or death they must drink out of a swans bone they may not walk on the common paths nor cross the tracks of animals they are never permitted to walk on the ice of rivers or lakes or near the part where the men are hunting beaver or where a fishingnet is set for fear of averting their success they are also prohibited at those times from partaking of the head of any animal and even from walking in or crossing the track where the head of a deer moose beaver and many other animals have lately been carried either on a sledge or on the back to be guilty of a violation of this custom is considered as of the greatest importance because they firmly believe that it would be a means of preventing the hunter from having an equal success in his future excursions232 so the lapps forbid women at menstruation to walk on that part of the shore where the fishers are in the habit of setting out their fish233 and the esquimaux of bering strait believe that if hunters were to come near women in their courses they would catch no game234 dread and seclusion of menstruous women among the tinneh or dn indians customs and beliefs of the carrier indians in regard to menstruous women but the beliefs and superstitions of this sort that prevail among the western tribes of the great dn or tinneh stock to which the chippeways belong have been so well described by an experienced missionary that i will give his description in his own words prominent among the ceremonial rites of these indians he says are the observances peculiar to the fair sex and many of them are remarkably analogous to those practised by the hebrew women so much so that were it not savouring of profanity the ordinances of the dn ritual code might be termed a new edition revised and considerably augmented of the mosaic ceremonial law among the carriers235 as soon as a girl has experienced the first flow of the menses which in the female constitution are a natural discharge her father believed himself under the obligation of atoning for her supposedly sinful condition by a small impromptu distribution of clothes among the natives this periodical state of women was considered as one of legal impurity fateful both to the man who happened to have any intercourse however indirect with her and to the woman herself who failed in scrupulously observing all the rites prescribed by ancient usage for persons in her condition seclusion of carrier girls at puberty upon entering into that stage of her life the maiden was immediately sequestered from company even that of her parents and compelled to dwell in a small branch hut by herself away from beaten paths and the gaze of passersby as she was supposed to exercise malefic influence on any man who might inadvertently glance at her she had to wear a sort of headdress combining in itself the purposes of a veil a bonnet and a mantlet it was made of tanned skin its forepart was shaped like a long fringe completely hiding from view the face and breasts then it formed on the head a closefitting cap or bonnet and finally fell in a broad band almost to the heels this headdress was made and publicly placed on her head by a paternal aunt who received at once some present from the girls father when three or four years later the period of sequestration ceased only this same aunt had the right to take off her nieces ceremonial headdress furthermore the girls fingers wrists and legs at the ankles and immediately below the knees were encircled with ornamental rings and bracelets of sinew intended as a protection against the malign influences she was supposed to be possessed with236 to a belt girding her waist were suspended two bone implements called respectively tsoenkuz bone tube and tsiltsoet head scratcher the former was a hollowed swan bone to drink with any other mode of drinking being unlawful to her the latter was forklike and was called into requisition whenever she wanted to scratch her headimmediate contact of the fingers with the head being reputed injurious to her health while thus secluded she was called asta that is interred alive in carrier and she had to submit to a rigorous fast and abstinence her only allowed food consisted of dried fish boiled in a small bark vessel which nobody else must touch and she had to abstain especially from meat of any kind as well as fresh fish nor was this all she had to endure even her contact however remote with these two articles of diet was so dreaded that she could not cross the public paths or trails or the tracks of animals whenever absolute necessity constrained her to go beyond such spots she had to be packed or carried over them lest she should contaminate the game or meat which had passed that way or had been brought over these paths and also for the sake of selfpreservation against tabooed and consequently to her deleterious food in the same way she was never allowed to wade in streams or lakes for fear of causing death to the fish it was also a prescription of the ancient ritual code for females during this primary condition to eat as little as possible and to remain lying down especially in course of each monthly flow not only as a natural consequence of the prolonged fast and resulting weakness but chiefly as an exhibition of a becoming penitential spirit which was believed to be rewarded by long life and continual good health in after years seclusion of carrier women at their monthly periods reasons for the seclusion of menstruous women among the indians these mortifications or seclusion did not last less than three or four years useless to say that during all that time marriage could not be thought of since the girl could not so much as be seen by men when married the same sequestration was practised relatively to husband and fellowvillagerswithout the particular headdress and rings spoken ofon the occasion of every recurring menstruation sometimes it was protracted as long as ten days at a time especially during the first years of cohabitation even when she returned to her mate she was not permitted to sleep with him on the first nor frequently on the second night but would choose a distant corner of the lodge to spread her blanket as if afraid to defile him with her dread uncleanness237 elsewhere the same writer tells us that most of the devices to which these indians used to resort for the sake of ensuring success in the chase were based on their regard for continence and their excessive repugnance for and dread of menstruating women238 but the strict observances imposed on tinneh or dn women at such times were designed at the same time to protect the women themselves from the evil consequences of their dangerous condition thus it was thought that women in their courses could not partake of the head heart or hind part of an animal that had been caught in a snare without exposing themselves to a premature death through a kind of rabies they might not cut or carve salmon because to do so would seriously endanger their health and especially would enfeeble their arms for life and they had to abstain from cutting up the grebes which are caught by the carriers in great numbers every spring because otherwise the blood with which these fowls abound would occasion haemorrhage or an unnaturally prolonged flux in the transgressor239 similarly indian women of the thompson tribe abstained from venison and the flesh of other large game during menstruation lest the animals should be displeased and the menstrual flow increased240 for a similar reason probably shuswap girls during their seclusion at puberty are forbidden to eat anything that bleeds241 the same principle may perhaps partly explain the rule of which we have had some examples that women at such times should refrain from fish and flesh and restrict themselves to a vegetable diet similar rules of seclusion enjoined on menstruous women in ancient hindoo persian and hebrew codes the philosophic student of human nature will observe or learn without surprise that ideas thus deeply ingrained in the savage mind reappear at a more advanced stage of society in those elaborate codes which have been drawn up for the guidance of certain peoples by lawgivers who claim to have derived the rules they inculcate from the direct inspiration of the deity however we may explain it the resemblance which exists between the earliest official utterances of the deity and the ideas of savages is unquestionably close and remarkable whether it be as some suppose that god communed face to face with man in those early days or as others maintain that man mistook his wild and wandering thoughts for a revelation from heaven be that as it may certain it is that the natural uncleanness of woman at her monthly periods is a conception which has occurred or been revealed with singular unanimity to several ancient legislators the hindoo lawgiver manu who professed to have received his institutes from the creator brahman informs us that the wisdom the energy the strength the sight and the vitality of a man who approaches a woman in her courses will utterly perish whereas if he avoids her his wisdom energy strength sight and vitality will all increase242 the persian lawgiver zoroaster who if we can take his word for it derived his code from the mouth of the supreme being ahura mazda devoted special attention to the subject according to him the menstrous flow at least in its abnormal manifestations is a work of ahriman or the devil therefore so long as it lasts a woman is unclean and possessed of the demon she must be kept confined apart from the faithful whom her touch would defile and from the fire which her very look would injure she is not allowed to eat as much as she wishes as the strength she might acquire would accrue to the fiends her food is not given her from hand to hand but is passed to her from a distance in a long leaden spoon243 the hebrew lawgiver moses whose divine legation is as little open to question as that of manu and zoroaster treats the subject at still greater length but i must leave to the reader the task of comparing the inspired ordinances on this head with the merely human regulations of the carrier indians which they so closely resemble superstitions as to menstruous women in ancient and modern europe amongst the civilized nations of europe the superstitions which cluster round this mysterious aspect of womans nature are not less extravagant than those which prevail among savages in the oldest existing cyclopaediathe natural history of plinythe list of dangers apprehended from menstruation is longer than any furnished by mere barbarians according to pliny the touch of a menstruous woman turned wine to vinegar blighted crops killed seedlings blasted gardens brought down the fruit from trees dimmed mirrors blunted razors rusted iron and brass especially at the waning of the moon killed bees or at least drove them from their hives caused mares to miscarry and so forth244 similarly in various parts of europe it is still believed that if a woman in her courses enters a brewery the beer will turn sour if she touches beer wine vinegar or milk it will go bad if she makes jam it will not keep if she mounts a mare it will miscarry if she touches buds they will wither if she climbs a cherry tree it will die245 in brunswick people think that if a menstruous woman assists at the killing of a pig the pork will putrefy246 in the greek island of calymnos a woman at such times may not go to the well to draw water nor cross a running stream nor enter the sea her presence in a boat is said to raise storms247 the intention of secluding menstruous women is to neutralize the dangerous influences which are thought to emanate from them in that condition suspension between heaven and earth thus the object of secluding women at menstruation is to neutralize the dangerous influences which are supposed to emanate from them at such times that the danger is believed to be especially great at the first menstruation appears from the unusual precautions taken to isolate girls at this crisis two of these precautions have been illustrated above namely the rules that the girl may not touch the ground nor see the sun the general effect of these rules is to keep her suspended so to say between heaven and earth whether enveloped in her hammock and slung up to the roof as in south america or raised above the ground in a dark and narrow cage as in new ireland she may be considered to be out of the way of doing mischief since being shut off both from the earth and from the sun she can poison neither of these great sources of life by her deadly contagion in short she is rendered harmless by being in electrical language insulated but the precautions thus taken to isolate or insulate the girl are dictated by a regard for her own safety as well as for the safety of others for it is thought that she herself would suffer if she were to neglect the prescribed regimen thus zulu girls as we have seen believe that they would shrivel to skeletons if the sun were to shine on them at puberty and in some brazilian tribes the young women think that a transgression of the rules would entail sores on the neck and throat in short the girl is viewed as charged with a powerful force which if not kept within bounds may prove destructive both to herself and to all with whom she comes in contact to repress this force within the limits necessary for the safety of all concerned is the object of the taboos in question the same explanation applies to the similar rules of seclusion observed by divine kings and priests suspension between heaven and earth the same explanation applies to the observance of the same rules by divine kings and priests the uncleanness as it is called of girls at puberty and the sanctity of holy men do not to the primitive mind differ materially from each other they are only different manifestations of the same mysterious energy which like energy in general is in itself neither good nor bad but becomes beneficent or maleficent according to its application248 accordingly if like girls at puberty divine personages may neither touch the ground nor see the sun the reason is on the one hand a fear lest their divinity might at contact with earth or heaven discharge itself with fatal violence on either and on the other hand an apprehension that the divine being thus drained of his ethereal virtue might thereby be incapacitated for the future performance of those magical functions upon the proper discharge of which the safety of the people and even of the world is believed to hang thus the rules in question fall under the head of the taboos which we examined in the second part of this work249 they are intended to preserve the life of the divine person and with it the life of his subjects and worshippers nowhere it is thought can his precious yet dangerous life be at once so safe and so harmless as when it is neither in heaven nor in earth but as far as possible suspended between the two250 stories of immortality attained by suspension between heaven and earth in legends and folktales which reflect the ideas of earlier ages we find this suspension between heaven and earth attributed to beings who have been endowed with the coveted yet burdensome gift of immortality the wizened remains of the deathless sibyl are said to have been preserved in a jar or urn which hung in a temple of apollo at cumae and when a group of merry children tired perhaps of playing in the sunny streets sought the shade of the temple and amused themselves by gathering underneath the familiar jar and calling out sibyl what do you wish a hollow voice like an echo used to answer from the urn i wish to die251 a story taken down from the lips of a german peasant at thomsdorf relates that once upon a time there was a girl in london who wished to live for ever so they say london london is a fine town a maiden prayed to live for ever and still she lives and hangs in a basket in a church and every st johns day about the hour of noon she eats a roll of bread252 another german story tells of a lady who resided at danzig and was so rich and so blest with all that life can give that she wished to live always so when she came to her latter end she did not really die but only looked like dead and very soon they found her in a hollow of a pillar in the church half standing and half sitting motionless she stirred never a limb but they saw quite plainly that she was alive and she sits there down to this blessed day every new years day the sacristan comes and puts a morsel of the holy bread in her mouth and that is all she has to live on long long has she rued her fatal wish who set this transient life above the eternal joys of heaven253 a third german story tells of a noble damsel who cherished the same foolish wish for immortality so they put her in a basket and hung her up in a church and there she hangs and never dies though many a year has come and gone since they put her there but every year on a certain day they give her a roll and she eats it and cries out for ever for ever for ever and when she has so cried she falls silent again till the same time next year and so it will go on for ever and for ever254 a fourth story taken down near oldenburg in holstein tells of a jolly dame that ate and drank and lived right merrily and had all that heart could desire and she wished to live always for the first hundred years all went well but after that she began to shrink and shrivel up till at last she could neither walk nor stand nor eat nor drink but die she could not at first they fed her as if she were a little child but when she grew smaller and smaller they put her in a glass bottle and hung her up in the church and there she still hangs in the church of st mary at lbeck she is as small as a mouse but once a year she stirs255 notes 64 pechuelloesche indiscretes aus loango zeitschrift fr

pointed out that beating or scourging is inflicted on inanimate objects expressly for the purpose indicated in the text thus the indians of costa rica hold that there are two kinds of ceremonial uncleanness nya and bukur anything that has been connected with a death is nya but bukur is much more virulent it can not only make one sick but kill bukur emanates in a variety of ways arms utensils even houses become affected by it after long disuse and before they can be used again must be purified in the case of portable objects left undisturbed for a long time the custom is to beat them with a stick before touching them i have seen a woman take a long walkingstick and beat a basket hanging from the roof of a house by a cord on asking what that was for i was told that the basket contained her treasures that she would probably want to take something out the next day and that she was driving off the bukur a house long unused must be swept and then the person who is purifying it must take a stick and beat not only the movable objects but the beds posts and in short every accessible part of the interior the next day it is fit for occupation a place not visited for a long time or reached for the first time is bukur on our return from the ascent of pico blanco nearly all the party suffered from little calenturas the result of extraordinary exposure to wet and cold and of want of food the indians said that the peak was especially bukur since nobody had ever been on it before one day mr gabb took down some dusty blowguns amid cries of bukur from the indians some weeks afterwards a boy died and the indians firmly believed that the bukur of the blowguns had killed him from all the foregoing it would seem that bukur is a sort of evil spirit that takes possession of the object and resents being disturbed but i have never been able to learn from the indians that they consider it so they seem to think of it as a property the object acquires but the worst bukur of all is that of a young woman in her first pregnancy she infects the whole neighbourhood persons going from the house where she lives carry the infection with them to a distance and all the deaths or other serious misfortunes in the vicinity are laid to her charge in the old times when the savage laws and customs were in full force it was not an uncommon thing for the husband of such a woman to pay damages for

displeased and he went in the guise of an old woman to frigg who told him that the weapons of the gods could not wound balder since she had made them all swear not to hurt him then loki asked have all things sworn to spare balder she answered east of walhalla grows a plant called mistletoe it seemed to me too young to swear so loki went and pulled the mistletoe and took it to the assembly of the gods there he found the blind god hother standing at the outside of the circle loki asked him why do you not shoot at balder hother answered because i do not see where he stands besides i have no weapon then said loki do like the rest and shew balder honour as they all do i will shew you where he stands and do you shoot at him with this twig hother took the mistletoe and threw it at balder as loki directed him the mistletoe struck balder and pierced him through and through and he fell down dead and that was the greatest misfortune that ever befell gods and men for a while the gods stood speechless then they lifted up their voices and wept bitterly they took balders body and brought it to the seashore there stood balders ship it was called ringhorn and was the hugest of all ships the gods wished to launch the ship and to burn balders body on it but the ship would not stir so they sent for a giantess called hyrrockin she came riding on a wolf and gave the ship such a push that fire flashed from the rollers and all the earth shook then balders body was taken and placed on the funeral pile upon his ship when his wife nanna saw that her heart burst for sorrow and she died so she was laid on the funeral pile with her husband and fire was put to it balders horse too with all its trappings was burned on the pile256 tale of balder in the older edda in the older or poetic edda the tragic tale of balder is hinted at rather than told at length among the visions which the norse sibyl sees and describes in the weird prophecy known as the voluspa is one of the fatal mistletoe i behold says she fate looming for balder wodens son the bloody victim there stands the mistletoe slender and delicate blooming high above the ground out of this shoot so slender to look on there shall grow a harmful fateful shaft hod shall shoot it but frigga in fenhall shall weep over the woe of walhall257 yet looking far into the future the sibyl sees a brighter vision of a new heaven and a new earth where the fields unsown shall yield their increase and all sorrows shall be healed then balder will come back to dwell in odins mansions of bliss in a hall brighter than the sun shingled with gold where the righteous shall live in joy for ever more258 the story of balder as related by saxo grammaticus writing about the end of the twelfth century the old danish historian saxo grammaticus tells the story of balder in a form which professes to be historical according to him balder and hother were rival suitors for the hand of nanna daughter of gewar king of norway now balder was a demigod and common steel could not wound his sacred body the two rivals encountered each other in a terrific battle and though odin and thor and the rest of the gods fought for balder yet was he defeated and fled away and hother married the princess nevertheless balder took heart of grace and again met hother in a stricken field but he fared even worse than before for hother dealt him a deadly wound with a magic sword which he had received from miming the satyr of the woods and after lingering three days in pain balder died of his hurt and was buried with royal honours in a barrow259 balder worshipped in norway whether he was a real or merely a mythical personage balder was worshipped in norway on one of the bays of the beautiful sogne fiord which penetrates far into the depths of the solemn norwegian mountains with their sombre pineforests and their lofty cascades dissolving into spray before they reach the dark water of the fiord far below balder had a great sanctuary it was called balders grove a palisade enclosed the hallowed ground and within it stood a spacious temple with the images of many gods but none of them was worshipped with such devotion as balder so great was the awe with which the heathen regarded the place that no man might harm another there nor steal his cattle nor defile himself with women but women cared for the images of the gods in the temple they warmed them at the fire anointed them with oil and dried them with cloths260 the legendary death of balder resembles the legendary death of the persian hero isfendiyar in the epic of firdusi it might be rash to affirm that the romantic figure of balder was nothing but a creation of the mythical fancy a radiant phantom conjured up as by a wizards wand to glitter for a time against the gloomy background of the stern norwegian landscape it may be so yet it is also possible that the myth was founded on the tradition of a hero popular and beloved in his lifetime who long survived in the memory of the people gathering more and more of the marvellous about him as he passed from generation to generation of storytellers at all events it is worth while to observe that a somewhat similar story is told of another national hero who may well have been a real man in his great poem the epic of kings which is founded on persian traditions the poet firdusi tells us that in the combat between rustem and isfendiyar the arrows of the former did no harm to his adversary because zerdusht had charmed his body against all dangers so that it was like unto brass but simurgh the bird of god shewed rustem the way he should follow in order to vanquish his redoubtable foe he rode after her and they halted not till they came to the seashore there she led him into a garden where grew a tamarisk tall and strong and the roots thereof were in the ground but the branches pierced even unto the sky then the bird of god bade rustem break from the tree a branch that was long and slender and fashion it into an arrow and she said only through his eyes can isfendiyar be wounded if therefore thou wouldst slay him direct this arrow unto his forehead and verily it shall not miss its aim rustem did as he was bid and when next he fought with isfendiyar he shot the arrow at him and it pierced his eye and he died great was the mourning for isfendiyar for the space of one year men ceased not to lament for him and for many years they shed bitter tears for that arrow and they said the glory of iran hath been laid low261 the myth of balder was perhaps acted as a magical ceremony the two chief incidents of the myth namely the pulling of the mistletoe and the death and burning of the god have perhaps their counterparts in popular ritual whatever may be thought of an historical kernel underlying a mythical husk in the legend of balder the details of the story suggest that it belongs to that class of myths which have been dramatized in ritual or to put it otherwise which have been performed as magical ceremonies for the sake of producing those natural effects which they describe in figurative language a myth is never so graphic and precise in its details as when it is so to speak the book of the words which are spoken and acted by the performers of the sacred rite that the norse story of balder was a myth of this sort will become probable if we can prove that ceremonies resembling the incidents in the tale have been performed by norsemen and other european peoples now the main incidents in the tale are twofirst the pulling of the mistletoe and second the death and burning of the god and both of them may perhaps be found to have had their counterparts in yearly rites observed whether separately or conjointly by people in various parts of europe these rites will be described and discussed in the following chapters we shall begin with the annual festivals of fire and shall reserve the pulling of the mistletoe for consideration later on notes 256 die edda bersetzt von k

bonfires on certain days of the year dancing round them and leaping over them effigies are sometimes burnt in the fires all over europe the peasants have been accustomed from time immemorial to kindle bonfires on certain days of the year and to dance round or leap over them customs of this kind can be traced back on historical evidence to the middle ages262 and their analogy to similar customs observed in antiquity goes with strong internal evidence to prove that their origin must be sought in a period long prior to the spread of christianity indeed the earliest proof of their observance in northern europe is furnished by the attempts made by christian synods in the eighth century to put them down as heathenish rites263 not uncommonly effigies are burned in these fires or a pretence is made of burning a living person in them and there are grounds for believing that anciently human beings were actually burned on these occasions a general survey of the customs in question will bring out the traces of human sacrifice and will serve at the same time to throw light on their meaning264 seasons of the year at which the bonfires are lit the seasons of the year when these bonfires are most commonly lit are spring and midsummer but in some places they are kindled also at the end of autumn or during the course of the winter particularly on hallow een the thirtyfirst of october christmas day and the eve of twelfth day we shall consider them in the order in which they occur in the calendar year the earliest of them is the winter festival of the eve of twelfth day the fifth of january but as it has been already described in an earlier part of this work265 we shall pass it over here and begin with the firefestivals of spring which usually fall on the first sunday of lent quadragesima or invocavit266 easter eve and may day custom of kindling bonfires on the first sunday in lent in the belgian ardennes the custom of kindling bonfires on the first sunday in lent has prevailed in belgium the north of france and many parts of germany thus in the belgian ardennes for a week or a fortnight before the day of the great fire as it is called children go about from farm to farm collecting fuel at grand halleux any one who refuses their request is pursued next day by the children who try to blacken his face with the ashes of the extinct fire when the day has come they cut down bushes especially juniper and broom and in the evening great bonfires blaze on all the heights it is a common saying that seven bonfires should be seen if the village is to be safe from conflagrations if the meuse happens to be frozen hard at the time bonfires are lit also on the ice at grand halleux they set up a pole called makral or the witch in the midst of the pile and the fire is kindled by the man who was last married in the village in the neighbourhood of morlanwelz a straw man is burnt in the fire young people and children dance and sing round the bonfires and leap over the embers to secure good crops or a happy marriage within the year or as a means of guarding themselves against colic in brabant on the same sunday down to the beginning of the nineteenth century women and men disguised in female attire used to go with burning torches to the fields where they danced and sang comic songs for the purpose as they alleged of driving away the wicked sower who is mentioned in the gospel for the day at maeseyck and in many villages of limburg on the evening of the day children run through the streets carrying lighted torches then they kindle little fires of straw in the fields and dance round them at ensival old folks tell young folks that they will have as many easter eggs as they see bonfires on this day267 at pturages in the province of hainaut down to about 1840 the custom was observed under the name of escouvion or scouvion every year on the first sunday of lent which was called the day of the little scouvion young folks and children used to run with lighted torches through the gardens and orchards as they ran they cried at the pitch of their voices bear apples bear pears and cherries all black to scouvion at these words the torchbearer whirled his blazing brand and hurled it among the branches of the appletrees the peartrees and the cherrytrees the next sunday was called the day of the great scouvion and the same race with lighted torches among the trees of the orchards was repeated in the afternoon till darkness fell the same custom was observed on the same two days at wasmes268 in the neighbourhood of lige where the lenten fires were put down by the police about the middle of the nineteenth century girls thought that by leaping over the fires without being smirched they made sure of a happy marriage elsewhere in order to get a good husband it was necessary to see seven of the bonfires from one spot in famenne a district of namur men and cattle who traversed the lenten fires were thought to be safe from sickness and witchcraft anybody who saw seven such fires at once had nothing to fear from sorcerers an old saying ran that if you do not light the great fire god will light it for you which seems to imply that the kindling of the bonfires was deemed a protection against conflagrations throughout the year269 bonfires on the first sunday of lent in the french department of the ardennes in the french department of the ardennes the whole village used to dance and sing round the bonfires which were lighted on the first sunday in lent here too it was the person last married sometimes a man and sometimes a woman who put the match to the fire the custom is still kept up very commonly in the district cats used to be burnt in the fire or roasted to death by being held over it and while they were burning the shepherds drove their flocks through the smoke and flames as a sure means of guarding them against sickness and witchcraft in some communes it was believed that the livelier the dance round the fire the better would be the crops that year270 in the vosges mountains it is still customary to light great fires on the heights and around the villages on the first sunday in lent and at rupt and elsewhere the right of kindling them belongs to the person who was last married round the fires the people dance and sing merrily till the flames have died out then the master of the fire as they call the man who kindled it invites all who contributed to the erection of the pile to follow him to the nearest tavern where they partake of good cheer at dommartin they say that if you would have the hemp tall it is absolutely necessary that the women should be tipsy on the evening of this day271 at pinal in the vosges on the first sunday in lent bonfires used to be kindled at various places both in the town and on the banks of the moselle they consisted of pyramids of sticks and faggots which had been collected some days earlier by young folks going from door to door when the flames blazed up the names of various couples whether young or old handsome or ugly rich or poor were called out and the persons thus linked in mock marriage were forced whether they liked it or not to march arm in arm round the fire amid the laughter and jests of the crowd the festivity lasted till the fire died out and then the spectators dispersed through the streets stopping under the windows of the houses and proclaiming the names of the fchenots and fchenottes or valentines whom the popular voice had assigned to each other these couples had to exchange presents the mock bridegroom gave his mock bride something for her toilet while she in turn presented him with a cockade of coloured ribbon next sunday if the weather allowed it all the couples arrayed in their best attire and attended by their relations repaired to the wood of saint antony where they mounted a famous stone called the danserosse or danseresse here they found cakes and refreshments of all sorts and danced to the music of a couple of fiddlers the evening bell ringing the angelus gave the signal to depart as soon as its solemn chime was heard every one quitted the forest and returned home the exchange of presents between the valentines went by the name of ransom or redemption rachat because it was supposed to redeem the couple from the flames of the bonfire any pair who failed thus to ransom themselves were not suffered to share the merrymaking at the great stone in the forest and a pretence was made of burning them in small fires kindled before their own doors272 bonfires on the first sunday of lent in franchecomt in the french province of franchecomt to the west of the jura mountains the first sunday of lent is known as the sunday of the firebrands brandons on account of the fires which it is customary to kindle on that day on the saturday or the sunday the village lads harness themselves to a cart and drag it about the streets stopping at the doors of the houses where there are girls and begging for a faggot when they have got enough they cart the fuel to a spot at some little distance from the village pile it up and set it on fire all the people of the parish come out to see the bonfire in some villages when the bells have rung the angelus the signal for the observance is given by cries of to the fire to the fire lads lasses and children dance round the blaze and when the flames have died down they vie with each other in leaping over the red embers he or she who does so without singeing his or her garments will be married within the year young folk also carry lighted torches about the streets or the fields and when they pass an orchard they cry out more fruit than leaves down to recent years at laviron in the department of doubs it was the young married couples of the year who had charge of the bonfires in the midst of the bonfire a pole was planted with a wooden figure of a cock fastened to the top then there were races and the winner received the cock as a prize273 bonfires on the first sunday of lent in auvergne the granno invoked at these bonfires may be the old celtic god grannus who was identified with apollo in auvergne fires are everywhere kindled on the evening of the first sunday in lent every village every hamlet even every ward every isolated farm has its bonfire or figo as it is called which blazes up as the shades of night are falling the fires may be seen flaring on the heights and in the plains the people dance and sing round about them and leap through the flames then they proceed to the ceremony of the grannasmias a grannomio274 is a torch of straw fastened to the top of a pole when the pyre is half consumed the bystanders kindle the torches at the expiring flames and carry them into the neighbouring orchards fields and gardens wherever there are fruittrees as they march they sing at the top of their voices granno mo mio granno mon poure granno mo moure that is grannus my friend grannus my father grannus my mother then they pass the burning torches under the branches of every tree singing brando brandounci tsaque brantso in plan panei that is firebrand burn every branch a basketful in some villages the people also run across the sown fields and shake the ashes of the torches on the ground also they put some of the ashes in the fowls nests in order that the hens may lay plenty of eggs throughout the year when all these ceremonies have been performed everybody goes home and feasts the special dishes of the evening are fritters and pancakes275 here the application of the fire to the fruittrees to the sown fields and to the nests of the poultry is clearly a charm intended to ensure fertility and the granno to whom the invocations are addressed and who gives his name to the torches may possibly be as dr pommerol suggests276 no other than the ancient celtic god grannus whom the romans identified with apollo and whose worship is attested by inscriptions found not only in france but in scotland and on the danube277 if the name grannus is derived as the learned tell us from a root meaning to glow burn shine278 the deity who bore the name and was identified with apollo may well have been a sungod and in that case the prayers addressed to him by the peasants of the auvergne while they wave the blazing crackling torches about the fruittrees would be eminently appropriate for who could ripen the fruit so well as the sungod and what better process could be devised to draw the blossoms from the bare boughs than the application to them of that genial warmth which is ultimately derived from the solar beams thus the firefestival of the first sunday in lent as it is observed in auvergne may be interpreted very naturally and simply as a religious or rather perhaps magical ceremony designed to procure a due supply of the suns heat for plants and animals at the same time we should remember that the employment of fire in this and kindred ceremonies may have been designed originally not so much to stimulate growth and reproduction as to burn and destroy all agencies whether in the shape of vermin witches or what not which threatened or were supposed to threaten the growth of the crops and the multiplication of animals it is often difficult to decide between these two different interpretations of the use of fire in agricultural rites in any case the firefestival of auvergne on the first sunday in lent may date from druidical times french custom of carrying lighted torches brandons about the orchards and fields to fertilize them on the first sunday of lent the custom of carrying lighted torches of straw brandons about the orchards and fields to fertilize them on the first sunday of lent seems to have been common in france whether it was accompanied with the practice of kindling bonfires or not thus in the province of picardy on the first sunday of lent people carried torches through the fields exorcising the fieldmice the darnel and the smut they imagined that they did much good to the gardens and caused the onions to grow large children ran about the fields torch in hand to make the land more fertile all that was done habitually in picardy and the ceremony of the torches is not entirely forgotten especially in the villages on both sides the somme as far as saintvalery279 a very agreeable spectacle said the curate of ltoile is to survey from the portal of the church situated almost on the top of the mountain the vast plains of vimeux all illuminated by these wandering fires the same pastime is observed at poix at conty and in all the villages round about280 again in the district of beauce a festival of torches brandons or brandelons used to be held both on the first and on the second sunday in lent the first was called the great torches and the second the little torches the torches were as usual bundles of straw wrapt round poles in the evening the village lads carried the burning brands through the country running about in disorder and singing torches burn at these vines at this wheat torches burn for the maidens that shall wed from time to time the bearers would stand still and smite the earth all together with the blazing straw of the torches while they cried a sheaf of a peck and a half gearbe boissiaux if two torchbearers happened to meet each other on their rounds they performed the same ceremony and uttered the same words when the straw was burnt out the poles were collected and a great bonfire made of them lads and lasses danced round the flames and the lads leaped over them afterwards it was customary to eat a special sort of hastypudding made of wheaten flour these usages were still in vogue at the beginning of the nineteenth century but they have now almost disappeared the peasants believed that by carrying lighted torches through the fields they protected the crops from fieldmice darnel and smut281 at dijon in burgundy it is the custom upon the first sunday in lent to make large fires in the streets whence it is called firebrand sunday this practice originated in the processions formerly made on that day by the peasants with lighted torches of straw to drive away as they called it the bad air from the earth282 in some parts of france while the people scoured the country with burning brands on the first sunday in lent they warned the fruittrees that if they did not take heed and bear fruit they would surely be cut down and cast into the fire283 on the same day peasants in the department of loiret used to run about the sowed fields with burning torches in their hands while they adjured the fieldmice to quit the wheat on pain of having their whiskers burned284 in the department of ain the great fires of straw and faggots which are kindled in the fields at this time are or were supposed to destroy the nests of the caterpillars285 at verges a lonely village surrounded by forests between the jura and the combe dain the torches used at this season were kindled in a peculiar manner the young people climbed to the top of a mountain where they placed three nests of straw in three trees these nests being then set on fire torches made of dry limewood were lighted at them and the merry troop descended the mountain to their flickering light and went to every house in the village demanding roasted peas and obliging all couples who had been married within the year to dance286 in berry a district of central france it appears that bonfires are not lighted on this day but when the sun has set the whole population of the villages armed with blazing torches of straw disperse over the country and scour the fields the vineyards and the orchards seen from afar the multitude of moving lights twinkling in the darkness appear like willothewisps chasing each other across the plains along the hillsides and down the valleys while the men wave their flambeaus about the branches of the fruittrees the women and children tie bands of wheatenstraw round the treetrunks the effect of the ceremony is supposed to be to avert the various plagues from which the fruits of the earth are apt to suffer and the bands of straw fastened round the stems of the trees are believed to render them fruitful287 in the peninsula of la manche the norman peasants used to spend almost the whole night of the first sunday in lent rushing about the country with lighted torches for the purpose as they supposed of driving away the moles and fieldmice fires were also kindled on some of the dolmens288 bonfires on the first sunday in lent in germany and austria burning the witch burning discs thrown into the air burning wheels rolled down hill bonfires on the first sunday in lent in switzerland in germany austria and switzerland at the same season similar customs have prevailed thus in the eifel mountains rhenish prussia on the first sunday in lent young people used to collect straw and brushwood from house to house these they carried to an eminence and piled up round a tall slim beechtree to which a piece of wood was fastened at right angles to form a cross the structure was known as the hut or castle fire was set to it and the young people marched round the blazing castle bareheaded each carrying a lighted torch and praying aloud sometimes a strawman was burned in the hut people observed the direction in which the smoke blew from the fire if it blew towards the cornfields it was a sign that the harvest would be abundant on the same day in some parts of the eifel a great wheel was made of straw and dragged by three horses to the top of a hill thither the village boys marched at nightfall set fire to the wheel and sent it rolling down the slope two lads followed it with levers to set it in motion again in case it should anywhere meet with a check at oberstattfeld the wheel had to be provided by the young man who was last married289 about echternach in luxemburg the same ceremony is called burning the witch while it is going on the older men ascend the heights and observe what wind is blowing for that is the wind which will prevail the whole year290 at voralberg in the tyrol on the first sunday in lent a slender young firtree is surrounded with a pile of straw and firewood to the top of the tree is fastened a human figure called the witch made of old clothes and stuffed with gunpowder at night the whole is set on fire and boys and girls dance round it swinging torches and singing rhymes in which the words corn in the winnowingbasket the plough in the earth may be distinguished291 in swabia on the first sunday in lent a figure called the witch or the old wife or winters grandmother is made up of clothes and fastened to a pole this is stuck in the middle of a pile of wood to which fire is applied while the witch is burning the young people throw blazing discs into the air the discs are thin round pieces of wood a few inches in diameter with notched edges to imitate the rays of the sun or stars they have a hole in the middle by which they are attached to the end of a wand before the disc is thrown it is set on fire the wand is swung to and fro and the impetus thus communicated to the disc is augmented by dashing the rod sharply against a sloping board the burning disc is thus thrown off and mounting high into the air describes a long fiery curve before it reaches the ground a single lad may fling up forty or fifty of these discs one after the other the object is to throw them as high as possible the wand by which they are hurled must at least in some parts of swabia be of hazel sometimes the lads also leap over the fire brandishing lighted torches of pinewood the charred embers of the burned witch and discs are taken home and planted in the flaxfields the same night in the belief that they will keep vermin from the fields292 at wangen near molsheim in baden a like custom is observed on the first sunday in lent the young people kindle a bonfire on the crest of the mountain above the village and the burning discs which they hurl into the air are said to present in the darkness the aspect of a continual shower of falling stars when the supply of discs is exhausted and the bonfire begins to burn low the boys light torches and run with them at full speed down one or other of the three steep and winding paths that descend the mountainside to the village bumps bruises and scratches are often the result of their efforts to outstrip each other in the headlong race293 in the rhn mountains situated on the borders of hesse and bavaria the people used to march to the top of a hill or eminence on the first sunday in lent children and lads carried torches brooms daubed with tar and poles swathed in straw a wheel wrapt in combustibles was kindled and rolled down the hill and the young people rushed about the fields with their burning torches and brooms till at last they flung them in a heap and standing round them struck up a hymn or a popular song the object of running about the fields with the blazing torches was to drive away the wicked sower or it was done in honour of the virgin that she might preserve the fruits of the earth throughout the year and bless them294 in neighbouring villages of hesse between the rhn and the vogel mountains it is thought that wherever the burning wheels roll the fields will be safe from hail and storm295 at konz on the moselle on the thursday before the first sunday in lent the two guilds of the butchers and the weavers used to repair to the marxberg and there set up an oaktree with a wheel fastened to it on the following sunday the people ascended the hill cut down the oak set fire to the wheel and sent both oak and wheel rolling down the hillside while a guard of butchers mounted on horses fired at the flaming wheel in its descent if the wheel rolled down into the moselle the butchers were rewarded with a waggonload of wine by the archbishop of treves296 burning discs thrown into the air in switzerland also it is or used to be customary to kindle bonfires on high places on the evening of the first sunday in lent and the day is therefore popularly known as spark sunday the custom prevailed for example throughout the canton of lucerne boys went about from house to house begging for wood and straw then piled the fuel on a conspicuous mountain or hill round about a pole which bore a straw effigy called the witch at nightfall the pile was set on fire and the young folks danced wildly round it some of them cracking whips or ringing bells and when the fire burned low enough they leaped over it this was called burning the witch in some parts of the canton also they used to wrap old wheels in straw and thorns put a light to them and send them rolling and blazing down hill the same custom of rolling lighted wheels down hill is attested by old authorities for the cantons of aargau and ble the more bonfires could be seen sparkling and flaring in the darkness the more fruitful was the year expected to be and the higher the dancers leaped beside or over the fire the higher it was thought would grow the flax in the district of freiburg and at birseck in the district of ble it was the last married man or woman who must kindle the bonfire while the bonfires blazed up it was customary in some parts of switzerland to propel burning discs of wood through the air by means of the same simple machinery which is used for the purpose in swabia each lad tried to send his disc fizzing and flaring through the darkness as far as possible and in discharging it he mentioned the name of the person to whose honour it was dedicated but in prttigau the words uttered in launching the fiery discs referred to the abundance which was apparently expected to follow the performance of the ceremony among them were grease in the pan corn in the fan and the plough in the earth297 connexion of these bonfires with the custom of carrying out death effigies burnt on shrove tuesday it seems hardly possible to separate from these bonfires kindled on the first sunday in lent the fires in which about the same season the effigy called death is burned as part of the ceremony of carrying out death we have seen that at spachendorf in austrian silesia on the morning of ruperts day shrove tuesday a strawman dressed in a fur coat and a fur cap is laid in a hole outside the village and there burned and that while it is blazing every one seeks to snatch a fragment of it which he fastens to a branch of the highest tree in his garden or buries in his field believing that this will make the crops to grow better the ceremony is known as the burying of death298 even when the strawman is not designated as death the meaning of the observance is probably the same for the name death as i have tried to shew does not express the original intention of the ceremony at cobern in the eifel mountains the lads make up a strawman on shrove tuesday the effigy is formally tried and accused of having perpetrated all the thefts that have been committed in the neighbourhood throughout the year being condemned to death the strawman is led through the village shot and burned upon a pyre they dance round the blazing pile and the last bride must leap over it299 in oldenburg on the evening of shrove tuesday people used to make long bundles of straw which they set on fire and then ran about the fields waving them shrieking and singing wild songs finally they burned a strawman on the field300 in the district of dsseldorf the strawman burned on shrove tuesday was made of an unthreshed sheaf of corn301 on the first monday after the spring equinox the urchins of zurich drag a strawman on a little cart through the streets while at the same time the girls carry about a maytree when vespers ring the strawman is burned302 in the district of aachen on ash wednesday a man used to be encased in peasstraw and taken to an appointed place here he slipped quietly out of his straw casing which was then burned the children thinking that it was the man who was being burned303 in the val di ledro tyrol on the last day of the carnival a figure is made up of straw and brushwood and then burned the figure is called the old woman and the ceremony burning the old woman304 2 the easter fires firefestivals on easter eve custom in catholic countries of kindling a holy new fire at the church on easter saturday marvellous properties ascribed to the embers of the fire the burning of judas another occasion on which these firefestivals are held is easter eve the saturday before easter sunday on that day it has been customary in catholic countries to extinguish all the lights in the churches and then to make a new fire sometimes with flint and steel sometimes with a burningglass at this fire is lit the great paschal or easter candle which is then used to rekindle all the extinguished lights in the church in many parts of germany a bonfire is also kindled by means of the new fire on some open space near the church it is consecrated and the people bring sticks of oak walnut and beech which they char in the fire and then take home with them some of these charred sticks are thereupon burned at home in a newlykindled fire with a prayer that god will preserve the homestead from fire lightning and hail thus every house receives new fire some of the sticks are kept throughout the year and laid on the hearthfire during heavy thunderstorms to prevent the house from being struck by lightning or they are inserted in the roof with the like intention others are placed in the fields gardens and meadows with a prayer that god will keep them from blight and hail such fields and gardens are thought to thrive more than others the corn and the plants that grow in them are not beaten down by hail nor devoured by mice vermin and beetles no witch harms them and the ears of corn stand close and full the charred sticks are also applied to the plough the ashes of the easter bonfire together with the ashes of the consecrated palmbranches are mixed with the seed at sowing a wooden figure called judas is sometimes burned in the consecrated bonfire and even where this custom has been abolished the bonfire itself in some places goes by the name of the burning of judas305 easter fires in bavaria and the abruzzi in the hollertau bavaria the young men used to light their lanterns at the newlykindled easter candle in the church and then race to the bonfire he who reached it first set fire to the pile and next day easter sunday was rewarded at the churchdoor by the housewives who presented him with red eggs great was the jubilation while the effigy of the traitor was being consumed in the flames the ashes were carefully collected and thrown away at sunrise in running water306 in many parts of the abruzzi also pious people kindle their fires on easter saturday with a brand brought from the sacred new fire in the church when the brand has thus served to bless the fire on the domestic hearth it is extinguished and the remainder is preserved partly in a cranny of the outer wall of the house partly on a tree to which it is tied this is done for the purpose of guarding the homestead against injury by storms at campo di giove the people say that if you can get a piece of one of the three holy candles which the priest lights from the new fire you should allow a few drops of the wax to fall into the crown of your hat for after that if it should thunder and lighten you have nothing to do but to clap the hat on your head and no flash of lightning can possibly strike you307 water as well as fire consecrated in the abruzzi on easter saturday water consecrated in calabria on easter saturday water and fire consecrated on easter saturday among the germans of bohemia easter rites of fire and water at hildesheim further it deserves to be noted that in the abruzzi water as well as fire is as it were renewed and consecrated on easter saturday most people fetch holy water on that day from the churches and every member of the family drinks a little of it believing that it has power to protect him or her against witchcraft fever and stomachaches of all sorts and when the church bells ring again after their enforced silence the water is sprinkled about the house and especially under the beds with the help of a palmbranch some of this blessed water is also kept in the house for use in great emergencies when there is no time to fetch a priest thus it may be employed to baptize a newborn infant gasping for life or to sprinkle a sick man in the last agony such a sprinkling is reckoned equal to priestly absolution308 in calabria the customs with regard to the new water as it is called on easter saturday are similar it is poured into a new vessel adorned with ribbons and flowers is blessed by the priest and is tasted by every one of the household beginning with the parents and when the air vibrates with the glad music of the church bells announcing the resurrection the people sprinkle the holy water about the houses bidding in a loud voice all evil things to go forth and all good things to come in at the same time to emphasize the exorcism they knock on doors windowshutters chests and other domestic articles of furniture at cetraro people who suffer from diseases of the skin bathe in the sea at this propitious moment at pietro in guarano they plunge into the river on the night of easter saturday before easter sunday dawns and while they bathe they utter never a word moreover the calabrians keep the new water as a sacred thing they believe that it serves as a protection against witchcraft if it is sprinkled on a fire or a lamp when the wood crackles or the wick sputters for they regard it as a bad omen when the fire talks as they say309 among the germans of western bohemia also water as well as fire is consecrated by the priest in front of the church on easter saturday people bring jugs full of water to the church and set them beside the holy fire afterwards they use the water to sprinkle on the palmbranches which are stuck in the fields charred sticks of the judas fire as it is popularly called are supposed to possess a magical and healing virtue hence the people take them home with them and even scuffle with each other for the still glowing embers in order to carry them still glimmering to their houses and so obtain the light or the holy light310 at hildesheim also and the neighbouring villages of central germany rites both of fire and water are or were till lately observed at easter thus on easter night many people fetch water from the innerste river and keep it carefully believing it to be a remedy for many sorts of ailments both of man and beast in the villages on the leine river servant men and maids used to go silently on easter night between the hours of eleven and twelve and silently draw water in buckets from the river they mixed the water with the fodder and the drink of the cattle to make the animals thrive and they imagined that to wash in it was good for human beings many were also of opinion that at the same mystic hour the water turned to wine as far as the crowing of a cock could be heard and in this belief they laid themselves flat on their stomachs and kept their tongues in the water till the miraculous change occurred when they took a great gulp of the transformed water at hildesheim too and the neighbouring villages fires used to blaze on all the heights on easter eve and embers taken from the bonfires were dipped in the cattle troughs to benefit the beasts and were kept in the houses to avert lightning311 new fire at easter in carinthia consecration of fire and water by the catholic church at easter in the lesachthal carinthia all the fires in the houses used to be extinguished on easter saturday and rekindled with a fresh fire brought from the churchyard where the priest had lit it by the friction of flint and steel and had bestowed his blessing on it312 such customs were probably widespread in a latin poem of the sixteenth century written by a certain thomas kirchmeyer and translated into english by barnabe googe we read on easter eve the fire all is quencht in every place and fresh againe from out the flint is fetcht with solemne grace the priest doth halow this against great daungers many one a brande whereof doth every man with greedie mind take home that when the fearefull storme appeares or tempest black arise by lighting this he safe may be from stroke of hurtful skies a taper great the paschall namde with musicke then they blesse and franckensence herein they pricke for greater holynesse this burneth night and day as signe of christ that conquerde hell as if so be this foolish toye suffiseth this to tell then doth the bishop or the priest the water halow straight that for their baptisme is reservde for now no more of waight is that they usde the yeare before nor can they any more yong children christen with the same as they have done before with wondrous pompe and furniture amid the church they go with candles crosses banners chrisme and oyle appoynted tho nine times about the font they marche and on the saintes doe call then still at length they stande and straight the priest begins withall and thrise the water doth he touche and crosses thereon make here bigge and barbrous wordes he speakes to make the devill quake and holsome waters conjureth and foolishly doth dresse supposing holyar that to make which god before did blesse and after this his candle than he thrusteth in the floode and thrise he breathes thereon with breath that stinkes of former foode and making here an ende his chrisme he poureth thereupon the people staring hereat stande amazed every one beleeving that great powre is given to this water here by gaping of these learned men and such like trifling gere therefore in vessels brought they draw and home they carie some against the grieves that to themselves or to their beastes may come then clappers ceasse and belles are set againe at liberte and herewithall the hungrie times of fasting ended be313 it is said that formerly all the fires in rome were lighted afresh from the holy fire kindled in st peters on easter saturday314 the new fire on easter saturday at florence in florence the ceremony of kindling the new fire on easter eve is peculiar the holy flame is elicited from certain flints which are said to have been brought by a member of the pazzi family from the holy land they are kept in the church of the holy apostles on the piazza del limbo and on the morning of easter saturday the prior strikes fire from them and lights a candle from the new flame the burning candle is then carried in solemn procession by the clergy and members of the municipality to the high altar in the cathedral a vast crowd has meanwhile assembled in the cathedral and the neighbouring square to witness the ceremony amongst the spectators are many peasants drawn from the surrounding country for it is commonly believed that on the success or failure of the ceremony depends the fate of the crops for the year outside the door of the cathedral stands a festal car drawn by two fine white oxen with gilded horns the body of the car is loaded with a pyramid of squibs and crackers and is connected by a wire with a pillar set up in front of the high altar the wire extends down the middle of the nave at a height of about six feet from the ground beneath it a clear passage is left the spectators being ranged on either side and crowding the vast interior from wall to wall when all is ready high mass is celebrated and precisely at noon when the first words of the gloria are being chanted the sacred fire is applied to the pillar which like the car is wreathed with fireworks a moment more and a fiery dove comes flying down the nave with a hissing sound and a sputter of sparks between the two hedges of eager spectators if all goes well the bird pursues its course along the wire and out at the door and in another moment a prolonged series of fizzes pops and bangs announces to the excited crowd in the cathedral that the fireworks on the car are going off great is the joy accordingly especially among the bumpkins who are now sure of an abundant harvest but if as sometimes happens the dove stops short in its career and fizzles out revealing itself as a stuffed bird with a packet of squibs tied to its tail great is the consternation and deep the curses that issue from between the set teeth of the clodhoppers who now give up the harvest for lost formerly the unskilful mechanician who was responsible for the failure would have been clapped into gaol but nowadays he is thought sufficiently punished by the storm of public indignation and the loss of his pay the disaster is announced by placards posted about the streets in the evening and next morning the newspapers are full of gloomy prognostications315 the new fire and burning of judas on easter saturday in mexico some of these customs have been transported by the catholic church to the new world thus in mexico the new fire is struck from a flint early in the morning of easter saturday and a candle which has been lighted at the sacred flame is carried through the church by a deacon shouting lumen christi meantime the whole city we are informed has been converted into a vast place of execution ropes stretch across the streets from house to house and from every house dangles an effigy of judas made of paper pulp scores or hundreds of them may adorn a single street they are of all shapes and sizes grotesque in form and garbed in strange attire stuffed with gunpowder squibs and crackers sometimes too with meat bread soap candy and clothing for which the crowd will scramble and scuffle while the effigies are burning there they hang grim black and sullen in the strong sunshine greeted with a roar of execration by the pious mob a peal of bells from the cathedral tower on the stroke of noon gives the signal for the execution at the sound a frenzy seizes the crowd they throw themselves furiously on the figures of the detested traitor cut them down hurl them with curses into the fire and fight and struggle with each other in their efforts to tear the effigies to tatters and appropriate their contents smoke stink sputter of crackers oaths curses yells are now the order of the day but the traitor does not perish unavenged for the anatomy of his frame has been cunningly contrived so as in burning to discharge volleys of squibs into his assailants and the wounds and burns with which their piety is rewarded form a feature of the mornings entertainment the english jockey club in mexico used to improve on this popular pastime by suspending huge figures of judas stuffed with copper coins from ropes in front of their clubhouse these were ignited at the proper moment and lowered within reach of the expectant rabble and it was the privilege of members of the club seated in the balcony to watch the grimaces and to hear the shrieks of the victims as they stamped and capered about with the hot coppers sticking to their hands divided in their minds between an acute sense of pain and a thirst for filthy lucre316 the burning of judas at easter in south america scenes of the same sort though on a less ambitious scale are witnessed among the catholics of south america on the same day in brazil the mourning for the death of christ ceases at noon on easter saturday and gives place to an extravagant burst of joy at his resurrection shots are fired everywhere and effigies of judas are hung on trees or dragged about the streets to be finally burned or otherwise destroyed317 in the indian villages scattered among the wild valleys of the peruvian andes figures of the traitor made of pasteboard and stuffed with squibs and crackers are hanged on gibbets before the door of the church on easter saturday fire is set to them and while they crackle and explode the indians dance and shout for joy at the destruction of their hated enemy318 similarly at rio hacha in colombia judas is represented during holy week by lifesized effigies and the people fire at them as if they were discharging a sacred duty319 the new fire on easter saturday in the church of the holy sepulchre at jerusalem but usages of this sort are not confined to the latin church they are common to the greek church also every year on the saturday before easter sunday a new fire is miraculously kindled at the holy sepulchre in jerusalem it descends from heaven and ignites the candles which the patriarch holds in his hands while with closed eyes he wrestles in prayer all alone in the chapel of the angel the worshippers meanwhile wait anxiously in the body of the church and great are their transports of joy when at one of the windows of the chapel which had been all dark a minute before there suddenly appears the hand of an angel or of the patriarch holding a lighted taper this is the sacred new fire it is passed out to the expectant believers and the desperate struggle which ensues among them to get a share of its blessed influence is only terminated by the intervention of the turkish soldiery who restore peace and order by hustling the whole multitude impartially out of the church in days gone by many lives were often lost in these holy scrimmages for example in the year 1834 the famous ibrahim pasha witnessed the frantic scene from one of the galleries and being moved with compassion at the sight descended with a few guards into the arena in the chimerical hope of restoring peace and order among the contending christians he contrived to force his way into the midst of the dense crowd but there the heat and pressure were so great that he fainted away a body of soldiers seeing his danger charged straight into the throng and carried him out of it in their arms trampling under foot the dying and dead in their passage nearly two hundred people were killed that day in the church the fortunate survivors on these occasions who succeeded in obtaining a portion of the coveted fire applied it freely to their faces their beards and their garments the theory was that the fire being miraculous could only bless and not burn them but the practical results of the experiment were often disappointing for while the blessings were more or less dubious there could be no doubt whatever about the burns320 the history of the miracle has been carefully investigated by a jesuit father the conclusions at which he arrives are that the miracle was a miracle indeed so long as the catholics had the management of it but that since it fell into the hands of the heretics it has been nothing but a barefaced trick and imposture321 many people will be disposed to agree with the latter conclusion who might hesitate to accept the former the new fire and the burning of judas on easter saturday in greece at athens the new fire is kindled in the cathedral at midnight on holy saturday a dense crowd with unlit candles in their hands fills the square in front of the cathedral the king the archbishop and the highest dignitaries of the church arrayed in their gorgeous robes occupy a platform and at the exact moment of the resurrection the bells ring out and the whole square bursts as by magic into a blaze of light theoretically all the candles are lit from the sacred new fire in the cathedral but practically it may be suspected that the matches which bear the name of lucifer have some share in the sudden illumination322 effigies of judas used to be burned at athens on easter saturday but the custom has been forbidden by the government however firing goes on more or less continuously all over the city both on easter saturday and easter sunday and the cartridges used on this occasion are not always blank the shots are aimed at judas but sometimes they miss him and hit other people outside of athens the practice of burning judas in effigy still survives in some places for example in cos a straw image of the traitor is made on easter day and after being hung up and shot at it is burned323 a similar custom appears to prevail at thebes324 it used to be observed by the macedonian peasantry and it is still kept up at therapia a fashionable summer resort of constantinople325 the new fire at candlemas in armenia in the armenian church the sacred new fire is kindled not at easter but at candlemas that is on the second of february or on the eve of that festival the materials of the bonfire are piled in an open space near a church and they are generally ignited by young couples who have been married within the year however it is the bishop or his vicar who lights the candles with which fire is set to the pile all young married pairs are expected to range themselves about the fire and to dance round it young men leap over the flames but girls and women content themselves with going round them while they pray to be preserved from the itch and other skindiseases when the ceremony is over the people eagerly pick up charred sticks or ashes of the fire and preserve them or scatter them on the four corners of the roof in the cattlestall in the garden and on the pastures for these holy sticks and ashes protect men and cattle against disease and fruittrees against worms and caterpillars omens too are drawn from the direction in which the wind blows the flames and the smoke if it carries them eastward there is hope of a good harvest but if it inclines them westward the people fear that the crops will fail326 the new fire and the burning of judas at easter are probably relics of paganism in spite of the thin cloak of christianity thrown over these customs by representing the new fire as an emblem of christ and the figure burned in it as an effigy of judas we can hardly doubt that both practices are of pagan origin neither of them has the authority of christ or of his disciples but both of them have abundant analogies in popular custom and superstition some instances of the practice of annually extinguishing fires and relighting them from a new and sacred flame have already come before us327 but a few examples may here be cited for the sake of illustrating the wide diffusion of a custom which has found its way into the ritual both of the eastern and of the western church the new fire at the summer solstice among the incas of peru the new fire among the indians of mexico and new mexico the new fire among the esquimaux the incas of peru celebrated a festival called raymi a word which their native historian garcilasso de la vega tells us was equivalent to our easter it was held in honour of the sun at the solstice in june for three days before the festival the people fasted men did not sleep with their wives and no fires were lighted in cuzco the capital the sacred new fire was obtained direct from the sun by concentrating his beams on a highly polished concave plate and reflecting them on a little cotton wool with this holy fire the sheep and lambs offered to the sun were consumed and the flesh of such as were to be eaten at the festival was roasted portions of the new fire were also conveyed to the temple of the sun and to the convent of the sacred virgins where they were kept burning all the year and it was an ill omen if the holy flame went out328 at a festival held in the last month of the old mexican year all the fires both in the temples and in the houses were extinguished and the priest kindled a new fire by rubbing two sticks against each other before the image of the firegod329 the zuni indians of new mexico kindle a new fire by the friction of wood both at the winter and the summer solstice at the winter solstice the chosen firemaker collects a faggot of cedarwood from every house in the village and each person as he hands the wood to the firemaker prays that the crops may be good in the coming year for several days before the new fire is kindled no ashes or sweepings may be removed from the houses and no artificial light may appear outside of them not even a burning cigarette or the flash of firearms the indians believe that no rain will fall on the fields of the man outside whose house a light has been seen at this season the signal for kindling the new fire is given by the rising of the morning star the flame is produced by twirling an upright stick between the hands on a horizontal stick laid on the floor of a sacred chamber the sparks being caught by a tinder of cedardust it is forbidden to blow up the smouldering tinder with the breath for that would offend the gods after the fire has thus been ceremonially kindled the women and girls of all the families in the village clean out their houses they carry the sweepings and ashes in baskets or bowls to the fields and leave them there to the sweepings the woman says i now deposit you as sweepings but in one year you will return to me as corn and to the ashes she says i now deposit you as ashes but in one year you will return to me as meal at the summer solstice the sacred fire which has been procured by the friction of wood is used to kindle the grass and trees that there may be a great cloud of smoke while bullroarers are swung and prayers offered that the rainmakers up aloft will water the earth330 from this account we see how intimately the kindling of a new fire at the two turningpoints of the suns course is associated in the minds of these indians with the fertility of the land particularly with the growth of the corn the rolling smoke is apparently an imitation of rainclouds designed on the principle of homoeopathic magic to draw showers from the blue sky once a year the iroquois priesthood supplied the people with a new fire as a preparation for the annual rite the fires in all the huts were extinguished and the ashes scattered about then the priest wearing the insignia of his office went from hut to hut relighting the fires by means of a flint331 among the esquimaux with whom cf hall resided it was the custom that at a certain time which answered to our new years day two men went about from house to house blowing out every light in the village one of the men was dressed to represent a woman afterwards the lights were rekindled from a fresh fire an esquimau woman being asked what all this meant replied new sunnew light332 among the esquimaux of iglulik when the sun first rises above the horizon after the long night of the arctic winter the children who have watched for his reappearance run into the houses and blow out the lamps then they receive from their mothers presents of pieces of wick333 the new fire in wadai among the swahili and in other parts of africa in the sudanese kingdom of wadai all the fires in the villages are put out and the ashes removed from the houses on the day which precedes the new year festival at the beginning of the new year a new fire is lit by the friction of wood in the great straw hut where the village elders lounge away the sultry hours together and every man takes thence a burning brand with which he rekindles the fire on his domestic hearth334 in the bahrelghazal province of the egyptian sudan the people extinguish their old fires at the arab new year and bring in new fire on the same occasion they beat the walls of their huts the grass thatches and the walls of their enclosures in order to drive away the devil or evil spirits the beating of the walls and roofs is accompanied by the firing of guns the shouting of men and the shriller cries of the women335 thus these people combine an annual expulsion of demons with an annual lighting of a new fire among the swahili of east africa the greatest festival is that of the new year which falls in the second half of august at a given moment all the fires are extinguished with water and afterwards relit by the friction of two dry pieces of wood the ashes of the old fires are carried out and deposited at crossroads all the people get up very early in the morning and bathe in the sea or some other water praying to be kept in good health and to live that they may bathe again next year shamfights form part of the amusements of the day sometimes they pass into grim reality indeed the day was formerly one of general license every man did that which was good in his own eyes no awkward questions were asked about any crimes committed on this occasion so some people improved the shining hour by knocking a few poor devils on the head shooting still goes on during the whole day and at night the proceedings generally wind up with a great dance336 the king of benametapa as the early portuguese traders called him in east africa used to send commissioners annually to every town in his dominions on the arrival of one of these officers the inhabitants of each town had to put out all their fires and to receive a new fire from him failure to comply with this custom was treated as rebellion337 some tribes of british central africa carefully extinguish the fires on the hearths at the beginning of the hoeing season and at harvest the fires are afterwards rekindled by friction and the people indulge in dances of various kinds338 the new fire among the todas of southern india and among the nagas of northeastern india the todas of the neilgheny hills in southern india annually kindle a sacred new fire by the friction of wood in the month which begins with the october moon the ceremony is performed by two holy dairymen at the foot of a high hill when they have lighted the fire by rubbing two dry sticks together and it begins to burn well they stand a little way off and pray saying may the young grass flower may honey flourish may fruit ripen the purpose of the ceremony is to make the grass and honey plentiful in ancient times the todas lived largely on wild fruits and then the rite of the new fire was very important now that they subsist chiefly on the milk of their buffaloes the ceremony has lost much of its old significance339 when the nagas of northeastern india have felled the timber and cut down the scrub in those patches of jungle which they propose to cultivate they put out all the fires in the village and light a new fire by rubbing two dry pieces of wood together then having kindled torches at it they proceed with them to the jungle and ignite the felled timber and brushwood the flesh of a cow or buffalo is also roasted on the new fire and furnishes a sacrificial meal340 near the small town of kahma in burma between prome and thayetmyo certain gases escape from a hollow in the ground and burn with a steady flame during the dry season of the year the people regard the flame as the forge of a spectral smith who here carried on his business after death had removed him from his old smithy in the village once a year all the household fires in kahma are extinguished and then lighted afresh from the ghostly flame341 the new fire in china and japan in china every year about the beginning of april certain officials called szhen used of old to go about the country armed with wooden clappers their business was to summon the people and command them to put out every fire this was the beginning of a season called hanshihtsieh or eating cold food for three days all household fires remained extinct as a preparation for the solemn renewal of the fire which took place on the fifth or sixth day of april being the hundred and fifth day after the winter solstice the ceremony was performed with great pomp by the same officials who procured the new fire from heaven by reflecting the suns rays either from a metal mirror or from a crystal on dry moss fire thus obtained is called by the chinese heavenly fire and its use is enjoined in sacrifices whereas fire elicited by the friction of wood is termed by them earthly fire and its use is prescribed for cooking and other domestic purposes when once the new fire had thus been drawn from the sun all the people were free to rekindle their domestic hearths and as a chinese distich has it at the festival of the cold food there are a thousand white stalks among the flowers on the day tsingming at sunrise you may see the smoke of ten thousand houses according to a chinese philosopher the reason for thus renewing fire periodically is that the vital principle grows weaker and weaker in old fire whereas in new fire it is young and vigorous this annual renewal of fire was a ceremony of very great antiquity in china since it is known to have been observed in the time of the first dynasty about two thousand years before christ under the tcheou dynasty a change in the calendar led to shifting the firefestival from spring to the summer solstice but afterwards it was brought back to its original date although the custom appears to have long fallen into disuse the barbarous inhabitants of hainan an island to the south of china still call a year a fire as if in memory of the time when the years were reckoned by the annually recurring ceremony of rekindling the sacred fire342 a japanese book written two centuries ago informs us that sticks resembling the wands used for offerings at the purification ceremony were part shaven and set up in bundles at the four corners of the gion shrine on the last day of the year the priests after prayers were recited broke up the bundles and set fire to the sticks which the people then carried home to light their household fires with for the new year the object of this ceremony was to avert pestilence343 the new fire in ancient greece and rome in classical antiquity the greek island of lemnos was devoted to the worship of the smithgod hephaestus who was said to have fallen on it when zeus hurled him from heaven344 once a year every fire in the island was extinguished and remained extinct for nine days during which sacrifices were offered to the dead and to the infernal powers new fire was brought in a ship from the sacred isle of delos and with it the fires in the houses and the workshops were relit the people said that with the new fire they made a new beginning of life if the ship that bore the sacred flame arrived too soon it might not put in to shore but had to cruise in the offing till the nine days were expired345 at rome the sacred fire in the temple of vesta was kindled anew every year on the first of march which used to be the beginning of the roman year346 the task of lighting it was entrusted to the vestal virgins and they performed it by drilling a hole in a board of lucky wood till the flame was elicited by friction the new fire thus produced was carried into the temple of vesta by one of the virgins in a bronze sieve347 the new fire at hallow een among the old celts of ireland the new fire on september 1st among the russian peasants among the celts of ireland a new fire was annually kindled on halloween or the eve of samhain as they called it the last day of october from which the irish new year began and all the hearths throughout the country are said to have been relighted from the fresh fire the place where this holy flame was lit bore the name of tlachtga or tlactga it has been identified with a rath or native fort on the hill of ward near athboy in the county of meath it was there says the old irish historian geoffrey keating that the festival of the fire of tlactga was ordered to be held and it was thither that the druids of ireland were wont to repair and to assemble in solemn meeting on the eve of samhain for the purpose of making a sacrifice to all the gods it was in that fire at tlactga that their sacrifice was burnt and it was made obligatory under pain of punishment to extinguish all the fires of ireland on that eve and the men of ireland were allowed to kindle no other fire but that one and for each of the other fires which were all to be lighted from it the king of munster was to receive a tax of a sgreball that is of three pence because the land upon which tlactga was built belongs to the portion of meath which had been taken from munster348 in the villages near moscow at the present time the peasants put out all their fires on the eve of the first of september and next morning at sunrise a wise man or a wise woman rekindles them with the help of muttered incantations and spells349 thus the ceremony of the new fire in the eastern and western church is probably a relic of an old heathen rite instances of such practices might doubtless be multiplied but the foregoing examples may suffice to render it probable that the ecclesiastical ceremony of lighting a sacred new fire on easter saturday had originally nothing to do with christianity but is merely one case of a worldwide custom which the church has seen fit to incorporate in its ritual it might be supposed that in the western church the custom was merely a survival of the old roman usage of renewing the fire on the first of march were it not that the observance by the eastern church of the custom on the same day seems to point back to a still older period when the ceremony of lighting a new fire in spring perhaps at the vernal equinox was common to many peoples of the mediterranean area we may conjecture that wherever such a ceremony has been observed it originally marked the beginning of a new year as it did in ancient rome and ireland and as it still does in the sudanese kingdom of wadai and among the swahili of eastern africa the pagan character of the easter fire appears from the superstitions associated with it such as the belief that the fire fertilizes the fields and protects houses from conflagration and sickness the essentially pagan character of the easter fire festival appears plainly both from the mode in which it is celebrated by the peasants and from the superstitious beliefs which they associate with it all over northern and central germany from altmark and anhalt on the east through brunswick hanover oldenburg the harz district and hesse to westphalia the easter bonfires still blaze simultaneously on the hilltops as many as forty may sometimes be counted within sight at once long before easter the young people have been busy collecting firewood every farmer contributes and tarbarrels petroleum cases and so forth go to swell the pile neighbouring villages vie with each other as to which shall send up the greatest blaze the fires are always kindled year after year on the same hill which accordingly often takes the name of easter mountain it is a fine spectacle to watch from some eminence the bonfires flaring up one after another on the neighbouring heights as far as their light reaches so far in the belief of the peasants the fields will be fruitful and the houses on which they shine will be safe from conflagration or sickness at volkmarsen and other places in hesse the people used to observe which way the wind blew the flames and then they sowed flax seed in that direction confident that it would grow well brands taken from the bonfires preserve houses from being struck by lightning and the ashes increase the fertility of the fields protect them from mice and mixed with the drinkingwater of cattle make the animals thrive and ensure them against plague as the flames die down young and old leap over them and cattle are sometimes driven through the smouldering embers in some places tarbarrels or wheels wrapt in straw used to be set on fire and then sent rolling down the hillside in others the boys light torches and wisps of straw at the bonfires and rush about brandishing them in their hands where the people are divided between protestantism and catholicism as in hildesheim it has been observed that among protestants the easter bonfires are generally left to the boys while in catholic districts they are cared for by grownup persons and here the whole population will gather round the blazing pile and join in singing choral hymns which echo far and wide in the stillness of night350 the easter fires in mnsterland oldenburg the harz mountains and the altmark in mnsterland these easter fires are always kindled upon certain definite hills which are hence known as easter or paschal mountains the whole community assembles about the fire fathers of families form an inner circle round it an outer circle is composed of the young men and maidens who singing easter hymns march round and round the fire in the direction of the sun till the blaze dies down then the girls jump over the fire in a line one after the other each supported by two young men who hold her hands and run beside her when the fire has burned out the whole assembly marches in solemn procession to the church singing hymns they go thrice round the church and then break up in the twilight boys with blazing bundles of straw run over the fields to make them fruitful351 at delmenhorst in oldenburg it used to be the custom to cut down two trees plant them in the ground side by side and pile twelve tarbarrels one above the other against each of the trees brushwood was then heaped about the trees and on the evening of easter saturday the boys after rushing about with blazing beanpoles in their hands set fire to the whole at the end of the ceremony the urchins tried to blacken each other and the clothes of grownup people352 in schaumburg the easter bonfires may be seen blazing on all the mountains around for miles they are made with a tarbarrel fastened to a pinetree which is wrapt in straw the people dance singing round them353 in the harz mountains the fire is commonly made by piling brushwood about a tree and setting it on fire at osterode every one tries to snatch a brand from the bonfire and runs about with it the better it burns the more lucky it is in grund there are torchraces354 in the altmark the easter bonfires are composed of tarbarrels beehives and so forth piled round a pole the young folk dance round the fire and when it has died out the old folk come and collect the ashes which they preserve as a remedy for the ailments of bees it is also believed that as far as the blaze of the bonfire is visible the corn will grow well throughout the year and no conflagration will break out355 at braunrde in the harz mountains it was the custom to burn squirrels in the easter bonfire356 in the altmark bones were burned in it357 the easter fires in bavaria the burning of judas burning the easter man further south the easter fires are or used to be lit in many districts of bavaria thus on easter monday in some parts of middle franken the schoolboys collect all the old wornout besoms they can lay hands on and march with them in a long procession to a neighbouring height when the first chime of the evening bell comes up from the dale they set fire to the brooms and run along the ridges waving them so that seen from below the hills appear to be crested with a twinkling and moving chain of fire358 in some parts of upper bavaria at easter burning arrows or discs of wood were shot from hilltops high into the air as in the swabian and swiss customs already described359 at oberau instead of the discs an old cartwheel was sometimes wrapt in straw ignited and sent rolling and blazing down the mountain the lads who hurled the discs received painted easter eggs from the girls360 near forchheim in upper franken a strawman called the judas used to be burned in the churchyards on easter saturday the whole village contributed wood to the pyre on which he perished and the charred sticks were afterwards kept and planted in the fields on walpurgis day the first of may to preserve the wheat from blight and mildew361 about a hundred years ago or more the custom at althenneberg in upper bavaria used to be as follows on the afternoon of easter saturday the lads collected wood which they piled in a cornfield while in the middle of the pile they set up a tall wooden cross all swathed in straw after the evening service they lighted their lanterns at the consecrated candle in the church and ran with them at full speed to the pyre each striving to get there first the first to arrive set fire to the heap no woman or girl might come near the bonfire but they were allowed to watch it from a distance as the flames rose the men and lads rejoiced and made merry shouting we are burning the judas two of them had to watch the glowing embers the whole night long lest people should come and steal them next morning at sunrise they carefully collected the ashes and threw them into the running water of the rten brook the man who had been the first to reach the pyre and to kindle it was rewarded on easter sunday by the women who gave him coloured eggs at the church door welltodo women gave him two poorer women gave him only one the object of the whole ceremony was to keep off the hail about a century ago the judas fire as it was called was put down by the police362 at giggenhausen and aufkirchen two other villages of upper bavaria a similar custom prevailed yet with some interesting differences here the ceremony which took place between nine and ten at night on easter saturday was called burning the easter man on a height about a mile from the village the young fellows set up a tall cross enveloped in straw so that it looked like a man with his arms stretched out this was the easter man no lad under eighteen years of age might take part in the ceremony one of the young men stationed himself beside the easter man holding in his hand a consecrated taper which he had brought from the church and lighted the rest stood at equal intervals in a great circle round the cross at a given signal they raced thrice round the circle and then at a second signal ran straight at the cross and at the lad with the lighted taper beside it the one who reached the goal first had the right of setting fire to the easter man great was the jubilation while he was burning when he had been consumed in the flames three lads were chosen from among the rest and each of the three drew a circle on the ground with a stick thrice round the ashes then they all left the spot on easter monday the villagers gathered the ashes and strewed them on their fields also they planted in the fields palmbranches which had been consecrated on palm sunday and sticks which had been charred and hallowed on good friday all for the purpose of protecting their fields against showers of hail the custom of burning an easter man made of straw on easter saturday was observed also at abensberg in lower bavaria363 in some parts of swabia the easter fires might not be kindled with iron or steel or flint but only by the friction of wood364 the easter fires in baden thunder poles in baden bonfires are still kindled in the churchyards on easter saturday and ecclesiastical refuse of various sorts such as candleends old surplices and the wool used by the priest in the application of extreme unction is consumed in the flames at zoznegg down to about 1850 the fire was lighted by the priest by means of a flint which had never been used before people bring sticks especially oaken sticks char them in the fire and then carry them home and keep them in the house as a preservative against lightning at zoznegg these oaken sticks were swordshaped each about an ell and a half long and they went by the name of weather or thunder poles wetterpfhle when a thunderstorm threatened to break out one of the sticks was put into a small fire in order that the hallowed smoke ascending to the clouds might ward off the lightning from the house and the hail from the fields and gardens at schllbronn the oaken sticks which are thus charred in the easter bonfire and kept in the house as a protective against thunder and lightning are three in number perhaps with an allusion to the trinity they are brought every easter to be consecrated afresh in the bonfire till they are quite burnt away in the lake district of baden it is also customary to burn one of these holy sticks in the fire when a heavy thunderstorm is raging365 hence it seems that the ancient association of the oak with the thunder366 persists in the minds of german peasants to the present day easter fires in holland and sweden the burning of judas in bohemia thus the custom of the easter fires appears to have prevailed all over central and western germany from north to south we find it also in holland where the fires were kindled on the highest eminences and the people danced round them and leaped through the flames or over the glowing embers here too as so often in germany the materials for the bonfire were collected by the young folk from door to door367 in many parts of sweden firearms are as at athens discharged in all directions on easter eve and huge bonfires are lighted on hills and eminences some people think that the intention is to keep off the troll and other evil spirits who are especially active at this season368 when the afternoon service on good friday is over german children in bohemia drive judas out of the church by running about the sacred edifice and even the streets shaking rattles and clappers next day on easter saturday the remains of the holy oil are burnt before the church door in a fire which must be kindled with flint and steel this fire is called the burning of judas but in spite of its evil name a beneficent virtue is ascribed to it for the people scuffle for the cinders which they put in the roofs of their houses as a safeguard against fire and lightning369 3 the beltane fires the beltane fires on the first of may in the highlands of scotland description of the beltane fires by john ramsay of ochtertyre in the eighteenth century in the central highlands of scotland bonfires known as the beltane fires were formerly kindled with great ceremony on the first of may and the traces of human sacrifices at them were particularly clear and unequivocal the custom of lighting the bonfires lasted in various places far into the eighteenth century and the descriptions of the ceremony by writers of that period present such a curious and interesting picture of ancient heathendom surviving in our own country that i will reproduce them in the words of their authors the fullest of the descriptions so far as i know is the one bequeathed to us by john ramsay laird of ochtertyre near crieff the patron of burns and the friend of sir walter scott from his voluminous manuscripts written in the last quarter of the eighteenth century a selection was published in the latter part of the nineteenth century the following account of beltane is extracted from a chapter dealing with highland superstitions ramsay says but the most considerable of the druidical festivals is that of beltane or mayday which was lately observed in some parts of the highlands with extraordinary ceremonies of later years it is chiefly attended to by young people persons advanced in years considering it as inconsistent with their gravity to give it any countenance yet a number of circumstances relative to it may be collected from tradition or the conversation of very old people who witnessed this feast in their youth when the ancient rites were better observed needfire this festival is called in gaelic bealteneie the fire of bel like the other public worship of the druids the beltane feast seems to have been performed on hills or eminences they thought it degrading to him whose temple is the universe to suppose that he would dwell in any house made with hands their sacrifices were therefore offered in the open air frequently upon the tops of hills where they were presented with the grandest views of nature and were nearest the seat of warmth and order and according to tradition such was the manner of celebrating this festival in the highlands within the last hundred years but since the decline of superstition it has been celebrated by the people of each hamlet on some hill or rising ground around which their cattle were pasturing thither the young folks repaired in the morning and cut a trench on the summit of which a seat of turf was formed for the company and in the middle a pile of wood or other fuel was placed which of old they kindled with teineigin ie forcedfire or needfire although for many years past they have been contented with common fire yet we shall now describe the process because it will hereafter appear that recourse is still had to the teineigin upon extraordinary emergencies needfire kindled by the friction of oak wood the night before all the fires in the country were carefully extinguished and next morning the materials for exciting this sacred fire were prepared the most primitive method seems to be that which was used in the islands of skye mull and tiree a wellseasoned plank of oak was procured in the midst of which a hole was bored a wimble of the same timber was then applied the end of which they fitted to the hole but in some parts of the mainland the machinery was different they used a frame of green wood of a square form in the centre of which was an axletree in some places three times three persons in others three times nine were required for turning round by turns the axletree or wimble if any of them had been guilty of murder adultery theft or other atrocious crime it was imagined either that the fire would not kindle or that it would be devoid of its usual virtue so soon as any sparks were emitted by means of the violent friction they applied a species of agaric which grows on old birchtrees and is very combustible this fire had the appearance of being immediately derived from heaven and manifold were the virtues ascribed to it they esteemed it a preservative against witchcraft and a sovereign remedy against malignant diseases both in the human species and in cattle and by it the strongest poisons were supposed to have their nature changed the beltane cake and the beltane carline cailleach after kindling the bonfire with the teineigin the company prepared their victuals and as soon as they had finished their meal they amused themselves a while in singing and dancing round the fire towards the close of the entertainment the person who officiated as master of the feast produced a large cake baked with eggs and scalloped round the edge called am bonnach bealtineie the beltane cake it was divided into a number of pieces and distributed in great form to the company there was one particular piece which whoever got was called cailleach bealtineie the beltane carline a term of great reproach upon his being known part of the company laid hold of him and made a show of putting him into the fire but the majority interposing he was rescued and in some places they laid him flat on the ground making as if they would quarter him afterwards he was pelted with eggshells and retained the odious appellation during the whole year and while the feast was fresh in peoples memory they affected to speak of the cailleach bealtine as dead this festival was longest observed in the interior highlands for towards the west coast the traces of it are faintest in glenorchy and lorne a large cake is made on that day which they consume in the house and in mull it has a large hole in the middle through which each of the cows in the fold is milked in tiree it is of a triangular form the more elderly people remember when this festival was celebrated withoutdoors with some solemnity in both these islands there are at present no vestiges of it in skye or the long island the inhabitants of which have substituted the connach micheil or st michaels cake it is made at michaelmas with milk and oatmeal and some eggs are sprinkled on its surface part of it is sent to the neighbours it is probable that at the original beltane festival there were two fires kindled near one another when any person is in a critical dilemma pressed on each side by unsurmountable difficulties the highlanders have a proverb the e eada anda theine bealtuinie he is between the two beltane fires there are in several parts small round hills which it is like owe their present names to such solemn uses one of the highest and most central in icolmkil is called cnochnanainnealie the hill of the fires there is another of the same name near the kirk of balquhidder and at killin there is a round green eminence which seems to have been raised by art it is called tomnanainnealie the eminence of the fires around it there are the remains of a circular wall about two feet high on the top a stone stands upon end according to the tradition of the inhabitants it was a place of druidical worship and it was afterwards pitched on as the most venerable spot for holding courts of justice for the country of breadalbane the earth of this eminence is still thought to be possessed of some healing virtue for when cattle are observed to be diseased some of it is sent for which is rubbed on the part affected370 local differences in the beltane cakes evidence of two fires at beltane beltane pies and cakes in the parish of callander in the parish of callander a beautiful district of western perthshire the beltane custom was still in vogue towards the end of the eighteenth century it has been described as follows by the parish minister of the time upon the first day of may which is called beltan or baltein day all the boys in a township or hamlet meet in the moors they cut a table in the green sod of a round figure by casting a trench in the ground of such circumference as to hold the whole company they kindle a fire and dress a repast of eggs and milk in the consistence of a custard they knead a cake of oatmeal which is toasted at the embers against a stone after the custard is eaten up they divide the cake into so many portions as similar as possible to one another in size and shape as there are persons in the company they daub one of these portions all over with charcoal until it be perfectly black they put all the bits of the cake into a bonnet every one blindfold draws out a portion he who holds the bonnet is entitled to the last bit whoever draws the black bit is the devoted person who is to be sacrificed to baal371 whose favour they mean to implore in rendering the year productive of the sustenance of man and beast there is little doubt of these inhuman sacrifices having been once offered in this country as well as in the east although they now pass from the act of sacrificing and only compel the devoted person to leap three times through the flames with which the ceremonies of this festival are closed372 pennants description of the beltane fires and cakes in perthshire thomas pennant who travelled in perthshire in the year 1769 tells us that on the first of may the herdsmen of every village hold their beltien a rural sacrifice they cut a square trench on the ground leaving the turf in the middle on that they make a fire of wood on which they dress a large caudle of eggs butter oatmeal and milk and bring besides the ingredients of the caudle plenty of beer and whisky for each of the company must contribute something the rites begin with spilling some of the caudle on the ground by way of libation on that every one takes a cake of oatmeal upon which are raised nine square knobs each dedicated to some particular being the supposed preserver of their flocks and herds or to some particular animal the real destroyer of them each person then turns his face to the fire breaks off a knob and flinging it over his shoulders says this i give to thee preserve thou my horses this to thee preserve thou my sheep and so on after that they use thesame ceremony to the noxious animals this i give to thee o fox spare thou my lambs this to thee o hooded crow this to thee o eagle when the ceremony is over they dine on the caudle and after the feast is finished what is left is hid by two persons deputed for that purpose but on the next sunday they reassemble and finish the reliques of the first entertainment373 beltane cakes and fires in the parishes of logierait and kirkmichael omens drawn from the cakes another writer of the eighteenth century has described the beltane festival as it was held in the parish of logierait in perthshire he says on the first of may os a festival called beltan is annually held here it is chiefly celebrated by the cowherds who assemble by scores in the fields to dress a dinner for themselves of boiled milk and eggs these dishes they eat with a sort of cakes baked for the occasion and having small lumps in the form of nipples raised all over the surface374 in this last account no mention is made of bonfires but they were probably lighted for a contemporary writer informs us that in the parish of kirkmichael which adjoins the parish of logierait on the east the custom of lighting a fire in the fields and baking a consecrated cake on the first of may was not quite obsolete in his time375 we may conjecture that the cake with knobs was formerly used for the purpose of determining who should be the beltane carline or victim doomed to the flames a trace of this custom survived perhaps in the custom of baking oatmeal cakes of a special kind and rolling them down hill about noon on the first of may for it was thought that the person whose cake broke as it rolled would die or be unfortunate within the year these cakes or bannocks as we call them in scotland were baked in the usual way but they were washed over with a thin batter composed of whipped egg milk or cream and a little oatmeal this custom appears to have prevailed at or near kingussie in invernessshire at achterneed near strathpeffer in rossshire the beltane bannocks were called tcharnican or handcakes because they were kneaded entirely in the hand and not on a board or table like common cakes and after being baked they might not be placed anywhere but in the hands of the children who were to eat them376 beltane fires in the northeast of scotland to burn the witches the beltane cake in the northeast of scotland the beltane fires were still kindled in the latter half of the eighteenth century the herdsmen of several farms used to gather dry wood kindle it and dance three times southways about the burning pile377 but in this region according to a later authority the beltane fires were lit not on the first but on the second of may old style they were called bonefires the people believed that on that evening and night the witches were abroad and busy casting spells on cattle and stealing cows milk to counteract their machinations pieces of rowantree and woodbine but especially of rowantree were placed over the doors of the cowhouses and fires were kindled by every farmer and cottar old thatch straw furze or broom was piled in a heap and set on fire a little after sunset while some of the bystanders kept tossing the blazing mass others hoisted portions of it on pitchforks or poles and ran hither and thither holding them as high as they could meantime the young people danced round the fire or ran through the smoke shouting fire blaze and burn the witches fire fire burn the witches in some districts a large round cake of oat or barley meal was rolled through the ashes when all the fuel was consumed the people scattered the ashes far and wide and till the night grew quite dark they continued to run through them crying fire burn the witches378 beltane cakes and fires in the hebrides in the hebrides the beltane bannock is smaller than that made at st michaels but is made in the same way it is no longer made in uist but father allan remembers seeing his grandmother make one about twentyfive years ago there was also a cheese made generally on the first of may which was kept to the next beltane as a sort of charm against the bewitching of milkproduce the beltane customs seem to have been the same as elsewhere every fire was put out and a large one lit on the top of the hill and the cattle driven round it sunwards dessil to keep off murrain all the year each man would take home fire wherewith to kindle his own379 beltane fires and cakes in wales in wales also the custom of lighting beltane fires at the beginning of may used to be observed but the day on which they were kindled varied from the eve of may day to the third of may the flame was sometimes elicited by the friction of two pieces of oak as appears from the following description the fire was done in this way nine men would turn their pockets inside out and see that every piece of money and all metals were off their persons then the men went into the nearest woods and collected sticks of nine different kinds of trees these were carried to the spot where the fire had to be built there a circle was cut in the sod and the sticks were set crosswise all around the circle the people stood and watched the proceedings one of the men would then take two bits of oak and rub them together until a flame was kindled this was applied to the sticks and soon a large fire was made sometimes two fires were set up side by side these fires whether one or two were called coelcerth or bonfire round cakes of oatmeal and brown meal were split in four and placed in a small flourbag and everybody present had to pick out a portion the last bit in the bag fell to the lot of the bagholder each person who chanced to pick up a piece of brownmeal cake was compelled to leap three times over the flames or to run thrice between the two fires by which means the people thought they were sure of a plentiful harvest shouts and screams of those who had to face the ordeal could be heard ever so far and those who chanced to pick the oatmeal portions sang and danced and clapped their hands in approval as the holders of the brown bits leaped three times over the flames or ran three times between the two fires as a rule no danger attended these curious celebrations but occasionally somebodys clothes caught fire which was quickly put out the greatest fire of the year was the eve of may or may first second or third the midsummer eve fire was more for the harvest very often a fire was built on the eve of november the high ground near the castle ditches at llantwit major in the vale of glamorgan was a familiar spot for the beltane on may third and on midsummer eve sometimes the beltane fire was lighted by the flames produced by stone instead of wood friction charred logs and faggots used in the may beltane were carefully preserved and from them the next fire was lighted may fires were always started with old faggots of the previous year and midsummer from those of the last summer it was unlucky to build a midsummer fire from may faggots people carried the ashes left after these fires to their homes and a charred brand was not only effectual against pestilence but magical in its use a few of the ashes placed in a persons shoes protected the wearer from any great sorrow or woe380 welsh belief that passage over or between the fires ensured good crops from the foregoing account we learn that bonfires were kindled in wales on midsummer eve and halloween the thirtyfirst of october as well as at the beginning of may but that the beltane fires in may were deemed the most important to the midsummer eve and halloween fires we shall return presently the belief of the people that by leaping thrice over the bonfires or running thrice between them they ensured a plentiful harvest is worthy of note the mode in which this result was supposed to be brought about is indicated by another writer on welsh folklore according to whom it used to be held that the bonfires lighted in may or midsummer protected the lands from sorcery so that good crops would follow the ashes were also considered valuable as charms381 hence it appears that the heat of the fires was thought to fertilize the fields not directly by quickening the seeds in the ground but indirectly by counteracting the baleful influence of witchcraft or perhaps by burning up the persons of the witches beltane fires in the isle of man to burn the witches beltane fires in nottinghamshire the druidical anniversary of beil or baal is still celebrated in the isle of man on the first of may 1837 the baal fires were as usual on that day so numerous as to give the island the appearance of a general conflagration382 by may day in manx folklore is meant may day old style or shenn laa boaldyn as it is called in manx the day was one on which the power of elves and witches was particularly dreaded and the people resorted to many precautions in order to protect themselves against these mischievous beings hence at daybreak they set fire to the ling or gorse for the purpose of burning out the witches who are wont to lurk in the form of hares383 on the hemlock stone a natural pillar of sandstone standing on stapleford hill in nottinghamshire a fire used to be solemnly kindled every year on beltane eve the custom seems to have survived down to the beginning of the nineteenth century old people could remember and describe the ceremony long after it had fallen into desuetude384 beltane fires in ireland the beltane fires appear to have been kindled also in ireland for cormac or somebody in his name says that belltaine mayday was so called from the lucky fire or the two fires which the druids of erin used to make on that day with great incantations and cattle he adds used to be brought to those fires or to be driven between them as a safeguard against the diseases of the year385 again a very ancient irish poem enumerating the may day celebrations mentions among them a bonfire on a hill tendal ar cnuc and another old authority says that these fires were kindled in the name of the idolgod bel386 from an old life of st patrick we learn that on a day in spring the heathen of ireland were wont to extinguish all their fires until a new fire was kindled with solemn ceremony in the kings house at tara in the year in which st patrick landed in ireland it chanced that the night of the extinguished fires coincided with the eve of easter and the saint ignorant of this pagan superstition resolved to celebrate his first easter in ireland after the true christian fashion by lighting the holy paschal fire on the hill of slane which rises high above the left bank of the boyne about twelve miles from the mouth of the river so that night looking from his palace at tara across the darkened landscape the king of tara saw the solitary fire flaring on the top of the hill of slane and in consternation he asked his wise men what that light meant they warned him of the danger that it betokened for the ancient faith of erin387 in spite of the difference of date between easter and beltane we may suspect that the new fire annually kindled with solemn ceremony about easter in the king of irelands palace at tara was no other than the beltane fire we have seen that in the highlands of scotland down to modern times it was customary to extinguish all fires in the neighbourhood before proceeding to kindle the sacred flame388 the irish historian geoffrey keating who wrote in the first part of the seventeenth century tells us that the men of ireland held a great fair every year in the month of may at uisnech ushnagh in the county of meath and at it they were wont to exchange their goods and their wares and their jewels at it they were also wont to make a sacrifice to the archgod that they adored whose name was bl bayl it was likewise their usage to light two fires to bl in every district of ireland at this season and to drive a pair of each kind of cattle that the district contained between those two fires as a preservative to guard them against all the diseases of that year it is from that fire thus made in honour of bl that the day the first of may on which the noble feast of the apostles philip and james is held has been called bltaini or baltaine bayltinnie for beltaini is the same as biltein ie tein bhil tinnie vayl or bls fire389 the custom of driving cattle through or between fires on may day or the eve of may day persisted in ireland down to a time within living memory thus sir john rhys was informed by a manxman that an irish cattledealer of his acquaintance used to drive his cattle through fire on may day so as to singe them a little since he believed that it would preserve them from harm when the manxman was asked where the dealer came from he answered from the mountains over there pointing to the mourne mountains then looming faintly in the mists on the western horizon390 fires on the eve of may day in sweden fires on the eve of may day in austria and saxony for the purpose of burning the witches the first of may is a great popular festival in the more midland and southern parts of sweden on the eve of the festival huge bonfires which should be lighted by striking two flints together blaze on all the hills and knolls every large hamlet has its own fire round which the young people dance in a ring the old folk notice whether the flames incline to the north or to the south in the former case the spring will be cold and backward in the latter it will be mild and genial391 similarly in bohemia on the eve of may day young people kindle fires on hills and eminences at crossways and in pastures and dance round them they leap over the glowing embers or even through the flames the ceremony is called burning the witches in some places an effigy representing a witch used to be burnt in the bonfire392 we have to remember that the eve of may day is the notorious walpurgis night when the witches are everywhere speeding unseen through the air on their hellish errands on this witching night children in voigtland also light bonfires on the heights and leap over them moreover they wave burning brooms or toss them into the air so far as the light of the bonfire reaches so far will a blessing rest on the fields the kindling of the fires on walpurgis night is called driving away the witches393 the custom of kindling fires on the eve of may day walpurgis night for the purpose of burning the witches is or used to be widespread in the tyrol moravia saxony and silesia394 4 the midsummer fires the great season for firefestivals in europe is the summer solstice midsummer eve or midsummer day which the church has dedicated to st john the baptist the bonfires the torches and the burning wheels of the festival but the season at which these firefestivals have been mostly generally held all over europe is the summer solstice that is midsummer eve the twentythird of june or midsummer day the twentyfourth of june a faint tinge of christianity has been given to them by naming midsummer day after st john the baptist but we cannot doubt that the celebration dates from a time long before the beginning of our era the summer solstice or midsummer day is the great turningpoint in the suns career when after climbing higher and higher day by day in the sky the luminary stops and thenceforth retraces his steps down the heavenly road such a moment could not but be regarded with anxiety by primitive man so soon as he began to observe and ponder the courses of the great lights across the celestial vault and having still to learn his own powerlessness in face of the vast cyclic changes of nature he may have fancied that he could help the sun in his seeming declinecould prop his failing steps and rekindle the sinking flame of the red lamp in his feeble hand in some such thoughts as these the midsummer festivals of our european peasantry may perhaps have taken their rise whatever their origin they have prevailed all over this quarter of the globe from ireland on the west to russia on the east and from norway and sweden on the north to spain and greece on the south395 according to a medival writer the three great features of the midsummer celebration were the bonfires the procession with torches round the fields and the custom of rolling a wheel he tells us that boys burned bones and filth of various kinds to make a foul smoke and that the smoke drove away certain noxious dragons which at this time excited by the summer heat copulated in the air and poisoned the wells and rivers by dropping their seed into them and he explains the custom of trundling a wheel to mean that the sun having now reached the highest point in the ecliptic begins thenceforward to descend396 t kirchmeyers description of the midsummer festival a good general account of the midsummer customs together with some of the reasons popularly alleged for observing them is given by thomas kirchmeyer a writer of the sixteenth century in his poem the popish kingdome then doth the joyfull feast of john the baptist take his turne when bonfiers great with loftie flame in every towne doe burne and yong men round about with maides doe daunce in every streete with garlands wrought of motherwort or else with vervain sweete and many other flowres faire with violets in their handes whereas they all do fondly thinke that whosoever standes and thorow the flowres beholds the flame his eyes shall feele no paine when thus till night they daunced have they through the fire amaine with striving mindes doe runne and all their hearbes they cast therin and then with wordes devout and prayers they solemnely begin desiring god that all their illes may there consumed bee whereby they thinke through all that yeare from agues to be free some others get a rotten wheele all worne and cast aside which covered round about with strawe and tow they closely hide and caryed to some mountaines top being all with fire light they hurle it downe with violence when darke appeares the night resembling much the sunne that from the heavens downe should fal a straunge and monstrous sight it seemes and fearfull to them all but they suppose their mischiefes all are likewise throwne to hell and that from harmes and daungers now in safetie here they dwell397 from these general descriptions which to some extent still hold good or did so till lately we see that the main features of the midsummer firefestival resemble those which we have found to characterize the vernal festivals of fire the similarity of the two sets of ceremonies will plainly appear from the following examples the midsummer fires in germany the celebration at konz on the moselle the rolling of a burning wheel down hill a writer of the first half of the sixteenth century informs us that in almost every village and town of germany public bonfires were kindled on the eve of st john and young and old of both sexes gathered about them and passed the time in dancing and singing people on this occasion wore chaplets of mugwort and vervain and they looked at the fire through bunches of larkspur which they held in their hands believing that this would preserve their eyes in a healthy state throughout the year as each departed he threw the mugwort and vervain into the fire saying may all my illluck depart and be burnt up with these398 at lower konz a village prettily situated on a hillside overlooking the moselle in the midst of a wood of walnuttrees and fruittrees the midsummer festival used to be celebrated as follows a quantity of straw was collected on the top of the steep stromberg hill every inhabitant or at least every householder had to contribute his share of straw to the pile a recusant was looked at askance and if in the course of the year he happened to break a leg or lose a child there was not a gossip in the village but knew the reason why at nightfall the whole male population men and boys mustered on the top of the hill the women and girls were not allowed to join them but had to take up their position at a certain spring halfway down the slope on the summit stood a huge wheel completely encased in some of the straw which had been jointly contributed by the villagers the rest of the straw was made into torches from each side of the wheel the axletree projected about three feet thus furnishing handles to the lads who were to guide it in its descent the mayor of the neighbouring town of sierck who always received a basket of cherries for his services gave the signal a lighted torch was applied to the wheel and as it burst into flame two young fellows stronglimbed and swift of foot seized the handles and began running with it down the slope a great shout went up every man and boy waved a blazing torch in the air and took care to keep it alight so long as the wheel was trundling down the hill some of them followed the fiery wheel and watched with amusement the shifts to which its guides were put in steering it round the hollows and over the broken ground on the mountainside the great object of the young men who guided the wheel was to plunge it blazing into the water of the moselle but they rarely succeeded in their efforts for the vineyards which cover the greater part of the declivity impeded their progress and the wheel was often burned out before it reached the river as it rolled past the women and girls at the spring they raised cries of joy which were answered by the men on the top of the mountain and the shouts were echoed by the inhabitants of neighbouring villages who watched the spectacle from their hills on the opposite bank of the moselle if the fiery wheel was successfully conveyed to the bank of the river and extinguished in the water the people looked for an abundant vintage that year and the inhabitants of konz had the right to exact a waggonload of white wine from the surrounding vineyards on the other hand they believed that if they neglected to perform the ceremony the cattle would be attacked by giddiness and convulsions and would dance in their stalls399 the midsummer fires in bavaria cattle driven through the fire the new fire omens of the harvest drawn from the fires burning discs thrown into the air down at least to the middle of the nineteenth century the midsummer fires used to blaze all over upper bavaria they were kindled especially on the mountains but also far and wide in the lowlands and we are told that in the darkness and stillness of night the moving groups lit up by the flickering glow of the flames presented an impressive spectacle in some places the people shewed their sense of the sanctity of the fires by using for fuel the trees past which the gay procession had defiled with fluttering banners on corpus christi day in others the children collected the firewood from door to door on the eve of the festival singing their request for fuel at every house in doggerel verse cattle were driven through the fire to cure the sick animals and to guard such as were sound against plague and harm of every kind throughout the year many a householder on that day put out the fire on the domestic hearth and rekindled it by means of a brand taken from the midsummer bonfire the people judged of the height to which the flax would grow in the year by the height to which the flames of the bonfire rose and whoever leaped over the burning pile was sure not to suffer from backache in reaping the corn at harvest but it was especially the practice for lovers to spring over the fire hand in hand and the way in which each couple made the leap was the subject of many a jest and many a superstition in one district the custom of kindling the bonfires was combined with that of lighting wooden discs and hurling them in the air after the manner which prevails at some of the spring festivals400 in many parts of bavaria it was believed that the flax would grow as high as the young people leaped over the fire401 in others the old folk used to plant three charred sticks from the bonfire in the fields believing that this would make the flax grow tall402 elsewhere an extinguished brand was put in the roof of the house to protect it against fire in the towns about wrzburg the bonfires used to be kindled in the marketplaces and the young people who jumped over them wore garlands of flowers especially of mugwort and vervain and carried sprigs of larkspur in their hands they thought that such as looked at the fire holding a bit of larkspur before their face would be troubled by no malady of the eyes throughout the year403 further it was customary at wrzburg in the sixteenth century for the bishops followers to throw burning discs of wood into the air from a mountain which overhangs the town the discs were discharged by means of flexible rods and in their flight through the darkness presented the appearance of fiery dragons404 the midsummer fires in swabia omens drawn from the leaps over the fires burning wheels rolled down hill burning the angelman at rottenburg in the valley of the lech which divides upper bavaria from swabia the midsummer customs and beliefs are or used to be very similar bonfires are kindled on the mountains on midsummer day and besides the bonfire a tall beam thickly wrapt in straw and surmounted by a crosspiece is burned in many places round this cross as it burns the lads dance with loud shouts and when the flames have subsided the young people leap over the fire in pairs a young man and a young woman together if they escape unsmirched the man will not suffer from fever and the girl will not become a mother within the year further it is believed that the flax will grow that year as high as they leap over the fire and that if a charred billet be taken from the fire and stuck in a flaxfield it will promote the growth of the flax405 similarly in swabia lads and lasses hand in hand leap over the midsummer bonfire praying that the hemp may grow three ells high and they set fire to wheels of straw and send them rolling down the hill among the places where burning wheels were thus bowled down hill at midsummer were the hohenstaufen mountains in wurtemberg and the frauenberg near gerhausen406 at deffingen in swabia as the people sprang over the midsummer bonfire they cried out flax flax may the flax this year grow seven ells high407 at rottenburg in swabia down to the year 1807 or 1808 the festival was marked by some special features about midday troops of boys went about the town begging for firewood at the houses in each troop there were three leaders one of whom carried a dagger a second a paper banner and a third a white plate covered with a white cloth these three entered each house and recited verses in which they expressed an intention of roasting martin luther and sending him to the devil and for this meritorious service they expected to be paid the contributions being received in the clothcovered plate in the evening they counted up their money and proceeded to behead the angelman for this ceremony an open space was chosen sometimes in the middle of the town here a stake was thrust into the ground and straw wrapt about it so as to make a rude effigy of human form with arms head and face every boy brought a handful of nosegays and fastened them to the strawman who was thus enveloped in flowers fuel was heaped about the stake and set on fire when the angelman as the straweffigy was called blazed up all the boys of the neighbourhood who had gathered expectantly around fell upon him with their wooden swords and hewed him to pieces as soon as he had vanished in smoke and flame the lads leaped backward and forward over the glowing embers and later in the evening they feasted on the proceeds of their collection408 here the angelman burnt in the fire appears to be identified with martin luther to whom as we have seen allusion was made during the housetohouse visitation the identification was probably modern for we may assume that the custom of burning an effigy in the midsummer bonfire is far older than the time of luther the midsummer fires in baden omens drawn from leaps over the fires burning discs thrown into the air midsummer fires in alsace lorraine the eifel the harz districts and thuringia burning barrel swung round a pole in baden the children used to collect fuel from house to house for the midsummer bonfire on st johns day and lads and lasses leaped over the fire in couples here as elsewhere a close connexion was traced between these bonfires and the harvest in some places it was thought that those who leaped over the fires would not suffer from backache at reaping sometimes as the young folk sprang over the flames they cried grow that the hemp may be three ells high this notion that the hemp or the corn would grow as high as the flames blazed or as the people jumped over them seems to have been widespread in baden it was held that the parents of the young people who bounded highest over the fire would have the most abundant harvest and on the other hand if a man contributed nothing to the bonfire it was imagined that there would be no blessing on his crops and that his hemp in particular would never grow409 in the neighbourhood of bhl and achern the st johns fires were kindled on the tops of hills only the unmarried lads of the village brought the fuel and only the unmarried young men and women sprang through the flames but most of the villagers old and young gathered round the bonfires leaving a clear space for the leapers to take their run one of the bystanders would call out the names of a pair of sweethearts on which the two would step out from the throng take each other by the hand and leap high and lightly through the swirling smoke and flames while the spectators watched them critically and drew omens of their married life from the height to which each of them bounded such an invitation to jump together over the bonfire was regarded as tantamount to a public betrothal410 near offenburg in the black forest on midsummer day the village boys used to collect faggots and straw on some steep and conspicuous height and they spent some time in making circular wooden discs by slicing the trunk of a pinetree across when darkness had fallen they kindled the bonfire and then as it blazed up they lighted the discs at it and after swinging them to and fro at the end of a stout and supple hazelwand they hurled them one after the other whizzing and flaming into the air where they described great arcs of fire to fall at length like shootingstars at the foot of the mountain411 in many parts of alsace and lorraine the midsummer fires still blaze annually or did so not very many years ago412 at speicher in the eifel a district which lies on the middle rhine to the west of coblentz a bonfire used to be kindled in front of the village on st johns day and all the young people had to jump over it those who failed to do so were not allowed to join the rest in begging for eggs from house to house where no eggs were given they drove a wedge into the keyhole of the door on this day children in the eifel used also to gather flowers in the fields weave them into garlands and throw the garlands on the roofs or hang them on the doors of the houses so long as the flowers remained there they were supposed to guard the house from fire and lightning413 in the southern harz district and in thuringia the midsummer or st johns fires used to be commonly lighted down to about the middle of the nineteenth century and the custom has probably not died out at edersleben near sangerhausen a high pole was planted in the ground and a tarbarrel was hung from it by a chain which reached to the ground the barrel was then set on fire and swung round the pole amid shouts of joy414 midsummer fires kindled by the friction of wood in germany and switzerland driving away demons and witches according to one account german tradition required that the midsummer fire should be lighted not from a common hearth but by the friction of two sorts of wood namely oak and fir415 in some old farmhouses of the surenthal and winenthal in switzerland a couple of holes or a whole row of them may be seen facing each other in the doorposts of the barn or stable sometimes the holes are smooth and round sometimes they are deeply burnt and blackened the explanation of them is this about midsummer but especially on midsummer day two such holes are bored opposite each other into which the extremities of a strong pole are fixed the holes are then stuffed with tow steeped in resin and oil a rope is looped round the pole and two young men who must be brothers or must have the same baptismal name and must be of the same age pull the ends of the rope backwards and forwards so as to make the pole revolve rapidly till smoke and sparks issue from the two holes in the doorposts the sparks are caught and blown up with tinder and this is the new and pure fire the appearance of which is greeted with cries of joy heaps of combustible materials are now ignited with the new fire and blazing bundles are placed on boards and sent floating down the brook the boys light torches at the new fire and run to fumigate the pastures this is believed to drive away all the demons and witches that molest the cattle finally the torches are thrown in a heap on the meadow and allowed to burn out on their way back the boys strew the ashes over the fields which is supposed to make them fertile if a farmer has taken possession of a new house or if servants have changed masters the boys fumigate the new abode and are rewarded by the farmer with a supper416 midsummer fires in silesia scaring away the witches in silesia from the southeastern part of the sudeten range and northwestward as far as lausitz the mountains are ablaze with bonfires on midsummer eve and from the valleys and the plains round about leobschtz neustadt zlz oels and other places answering fires twinkle through the deepening gloom while they are smouldering and sending forth volumes of smoke across the fields young men kindle broomstumps soaked in pitch at the bonfires and then brandishing the stumps which emit showers of sparks they chase one another or dance with the girls round the burning pile shots too are fired and shouts raised the fire the smoke the shots and the shouts are all intended to scare away the witches who are let loose on this witching day and who would certainly work harm to the crops and the cattle if they were not deterred by these salutary measures mere contact with the fire brings all sorts of blessings hence when the bonfire is burning low the lads leap over it and the higher they bound the better is the luck in store for them he who surpasses his fellows is the hero of the day and is much admired by the village girls it is also thought to be very good for the eyes to stare steadily at the bonfire without blinking moreover he who does so will not drowse and fall asleep betimes in the long winter evenings on midsummer eve the windows and doors of houses in silesia are crowned with flowers especially with the blue cornflowers and the bright corncockles in some villages long strings of garlands and nosegays are stretched across the streets the people believe that on that night st john comes down from heaven to bless the flowers and to keep all evil things from house and home417 the midsummer fires in denmark and norway keeping off the witches the midsummer fires in sweden in denmark and norway also midsummer fires were kindled on st johns eve on roads open spaces and hills people in norway thought that the fires banished sickness from among the cattle418 even yet the fires are said to be lighted all over norway on the night of june the twentythird midsummer eve old style as many as fifty or sixty bonfires may often be counted burning on the hills round bergen sometimes fuel is piled on rafts ignited and allowed to drift blazing across the fiords in the darkness of night the fires are thought to be kindled in order to keep off the witches who are said to be flying from all parts that night to the blocksberg where the big witch lives419 in sweden the eve of st john st hans is the most joyous night of the whole year throughout some parts of the country especially in the provinces of bohus and scania and in districts bordering on norway it is celebrated by the frequent discharge of firearms and by huge bonfires formerly called balders balefires balders balar which are kindled at dusk on hills and eminences and throw a glare of light over the surrounding landscape the people dance round the fires and leap over or through them in parts of norrland on st johns eve the bonfires are lit at the crossroads the fuel consists of nine different sorts of wood and the spectators cast into the flames a kind of toadstool bran in order to counteract the power of the trolls and other evil spirits who are believed to be abroad that night for at that mystic season the mountains open and from their cavernous depths the uncanny crew pours forth to dance and disport themselves for a time the peasants believe that should any of the trolls be in the vicinity they will shew themselves and if an animal for example a he or she goat happens to be seen near the blazing crackling pile the peasants are firmly persuaded that it is no other than the evil one in person420 further it deserves to be remarked that in sweden st johns eve is a festival of water as well as of fire for certain holy springs are then supposed to be endowed with wonderful medicinal virtues and many sick people resort to them for the healing of their infirmities421 the midsummer fires in switzerland and austria effigies burnt in the fires burning wheels rolled down hill in switzerland on midsummer eve fires are or used to be kindled on high places in the cantons of bern neuchatel valais and geneva422 in austria the midsummer customs and superstitions resemble those of germany thus in some parts of the tyrol bonfires are kindled and burning discs hurled into the air423 in the lower valley of the inn a taterdemalian effigy is carted about the village on midsummer day and then burned he is called the lotter which has been corrupted into luther at ambras one of the villages where martin luther is thus burned in effigy they say that if you go through the village between eleven and twelve on st johns night and wash yourself in three wells you will see all who are to die in the following year424 at gratz on st johns eve the twentythird of june the common people used to make a puppet called the tatermann which they dragged to the bleaching ground and pelted with burning besoms till it took fire425 at reutte in the tyrol people believed that the flax would grow as high as they leaped over the midsummer bonfire and they took pieces of charred wood from the fire and stuck them in their flaxfields the same night leaving them there till the flax harvest had been got in426 in lower austria fires are lit in the fields commonly in front of a cross and the people dance and sing round them and throw flowers into the flames before each handful of flowers is tossed into the fire a set speech is made then the dance is resumed and the dancers sing in chorus the last words of the speech at evening bonfires are kindled on the heights and the boys caper round them brandishing lighted torches drenched in pitch whoever jumps thrice across the fire will not suffer from fever within the year cartwheels are often smeared with pitch ignited and sent rolling and blazing down the hillsides427 midsummer fires in bohemia wreaths thrown across the fire uses made of the singed wreaths burning wheels rolled down hill embers of the fire stuck in fields gardens and houses as a talisman against lightning and conflagration use of mugwort cattle protected against witchcraft all over bohemia bonfires still burn on midsummer eve in the afternoon boys go about with handcarts from house to house collecting fuel such as sticks brushwood old besoms and so forth they make their request at each house in rhyming verses threatening with evil consequences the curmudgeons who refuse them a dole sometimes the young men fell a tall straight fir in the woods and set it up on a height where the girls deck it with nosegays wreaths of leaves and red ribbons then brushwood is piled about it and at nightfall the whole is set on fire while the flames break out the young men climb the tree and fetch down the wreaths which the girls had placed on it after that lads and lasses stand on opposite sides of the fire and look at one another through the wreaths to see whether they will be true to each other and marry within the year also the girls throw the wreaths across the flames to the men and woe to the awkward swain who fails to catch the wreath thrown him by his sweetheart when the blaze has died down each couple takes hands and leaps thrice across the fire he or she who does so will be free from ague throughout the year and the flax will grow as high as the young folks leap a girl who sees nine bonfires on midsummer eve will marry before the year is out the singed wreaths are carried home and carefully preserved throughout the year during thunderstorms a bit of the wreath is burned on the hearth with a prayer some of it is given to kine that are sick or calving and some of it serves to fumigate house and cattlestall that man and beast may keep hale and well sometimes an old cartwheel is smeared with resin ignited and sent rolling down the hill often the boys collect all the wornout besoms they can get hold of dip them in pitch and having set them on fire wave them about or throw them high into the air or they rush down the hillside in troops brandishing the flaming brooms and shouting only however to return to the bonfire on the summit when the brooms have burnt out the stumps of the brooms and embers from the fire are preserved and stuck in cabbage gardens to protect the cabbages from caterpillars and gnats some people insert charred sticks and ashes from the bonfire in their sown fields and meadows in their gardens and the roofs of their houses as a talisman against lightning and foul weather or they fancy that the ashes placed in the roof will prevent any fire from breaking out in the house in some districts they crown or gird themselves with mugwort while the midsummer fire is burning for this is supposed to be a protection against ghosts witches and sickness in particular a wreath of mugwort is a sure preventive of sore eyes sometimes the girls look at the bonfires through garlands of wild flowers praying the fire to strengthen their eyes and eyelids she who does this thrice will have no sore eyes all that year in some parts of bohemia they used to drive the cows through the midsummer fire to guard them against witchcraft428 the midsummer fires in moravia austrian silesia and the district of cracow fire kindled by the friction of wood the germans of moravia in like manner still light bonfires on open grounds and high places on midsummer eve and they kindle besoms in the flames and then stick the charred stumps in the cabbagefields as a powerful protection against caterpillars on the same mystic evening moravian girls gather flowers of nine sorts and lay them under their pillow when they go to sleep then they dream every one of him who is to be her partner for life for in moravia maidens in their beds as well as poets by haunted streams have their midsummer nights dreams429 in austrian silesia the custom also prevails of lighting great bonfires on hilltops on midsummer eve and here too the boys swing blazing besoms or hurl them high in the air while they shout and leap and dance wildly next morning every door is decked with flowers and birchen saplings430 in the district of cracow especially towards the carpathian mountains great fires are kindled by the peasants in the fields or on the heights at nightfall on midsummer eve which among them goes by the name of kupalos night the fire must be kindled by the friction of two sticks the young people dance round or leap over it and a band of sturdy fellows run a race with lighted torches the winner being rewarded with a peacocks feather which he keeps throughout the year as a distinction cattle also are driven round the fire in the belief that this is a charm against pestilence and disease of every sort431 the midsummer fires among the slavs of russia cattle protected against witchcraft the fires lighted by the friction of wood the name of kupalos night applied in this part of galicia to midsummer eve reminds us that we have now passed from german to slavonic ground even in bohemia the midsummer celebration is common to slavs and germans we have already seen that in russia the summer solstice or eve of st john is celebrated by young men and maidens who jump over a bonfire in couples carrying a straw effigy of kupalo in their arms432 in some parts of russia an image of kupalo is burnt or thrown into a stream on st johns night433 again in some districts of russia the young folk wear garlands of flowers and girdles of holy herbs when they spring through the smoke or flames and sometimes they drive the cattle also through the fire in order to protect the animals against wizards and witches who are then ravenous after milk434 in little russia a stake is driven into the ground on st johns night wrapt in straw and set on fire as the flames rise the peasant women throw birchen boughs into them saying may my flax be as tall as this bough435 in ruthenia the bonfires are lighted by a flame procured by the friction of wood while the elders of the party are engaged in thus churning the fire the rest maintain a respectful silence but when the flame bursts from the wood they break forth into joyous songs as soon as the bonfires are kindled the young people take hands and leap in pairs through the smoke if not through the flames and after that the cattle in their turn are driven through the fire436 the midsummer fires in prussia and lithuania thought to protect against witchcraft thunder hail and cattle disease the fire kindled by the friction of wood in many parts of prussia and lithuania great fires are kindled on midsummer eve all the heights are ablaze with them as far as the eye can see the fires are supposed to be a protection against witchcraft thunder hail and cattle disease especially if next morning the cattle are driven over the places where the fires burned above all the bonfires ensure the farmer against the arts of witches who try to steal the milk from his cows by charms and spells that is why next morning you may see the young fellows who lit the bonfire going from house to house and receiving jugfuls of milk and for the same reason they stick burs and mugwort on the gate or the hedge through which the cows go to pasture because that is supposed to be a preservative against witchcraft437 in masuren a district of eastern prussia inhabited by a branch of the polish family it is the custom on the evening of midsummer day to put out all the fires in the village then an oaken stake is driven into the ground and a wheel is fixed on it as on an axle this wheel the villagers working by relays cause to revolve with great rapidity till fire is produced by friction every one takes home a lighted brand from the new fire and with it rekindles the fire on the domestic hearth438 in the sixteenth century martin of urzedow a polish priest denounced the heathen practices of the women who on st johns eve midsummer eve kindled fires by the friction of wood danced and sang songs in honour of the devil439 the midsummer fires among the letts of russia midsummer day in ancient rome among the letts who inhabit the baltic provinces of russia the most joyful festival of the year is held on midsummer day the people drink and dance and sing and adorn themselves and their houses with flowers and branches chopped boughs of fir are strewn about the rooms and leaves are stuck in the roofs in every farmyard a birch tree is set up and every person of the name of john who enters the farm that day must break off a twig from the tree and hang up on its branches in return a small present for the family when the serene twilight of the summer night has veiled the landscape bonfires gleam on all the hills and wild shouts of ligho ligho echo from the woods and fields in riga the day is a festival of flowers from all the neighbourhood the peasants stream into the city laden with flowers and garlands a market of flowers is held in an open square and on the chief bridge over the river here wreaths of immortelles which grow wild in the meadows and woods are sold in great profusion and deck the houses of riga for long afterwards roses too are now at the prime of their beauty and masses of them adorn the flowerstalls till far into the night gay crowds parade the streets to music or float on the river in gondolas decked with flowers440 so long ago in ancient rome barges crowned with flowers and crowded with revellers used to float down the tiber on midsummer day the twentyfourth of june441 and no doubt the strains of music were wafted as sweetly across the water to listeners on the banks as they still are to the throngs of merrymakers at riga the midsummer fires among the south slavs bonfires are commonly kindled by the south slavonian peasantry on midsummer eve and lads and lasses dance and shout round them in the usual way the very names of st johns day ivanje and the st johns fires kries are said to act like electric sparks on the hearts and minds of these swains kindling a thousand wild merry and happy fancies and ideas in their rustic breasts at kamenagora in croatia the herdsmen throw nine threeyear old vines into the bonfire and when these burst into flames the young men who are candidates for matrimony jump through the blaze he who succeeds in leaping over the fire without singeing himself will be married within the year at vidovec in croatia parties of two girls and one lad unite to kindle a midsummer bonfire and to leap through the flames he or she who leaps furthest will soonest wed afterwards lads and lasses dance in separate rings but the ring of lads bumps up against the ring of girls and breaks it and the girl who has to let go her neighbours hand will forsake her true love hereafter442 in servia on midsummer eve herdsmen light torches of birch bark and march round the sheepfolds and cattlestalls then they climb the hills and there allow the torches to burn out443 the midsummer fires among the magyars of hungary among the magyars in hungary the midsummer firefestival is marked by the same features that meet us in so many parts of europe on midsummer eve in many places it is customary to kindle bonfires on heights and to leap over them and from the manner in which the young people leap the bystanders predict whether they will marry soon at nogradludany the young men and women each carrying a truss of straw repair to a meadow where they pile the straw in seven or twelve heaps and set it on fire then they go round the fire singing and hold a bunch of ironwort in the smoke while they say no boil on my body no sprain in my foot this holding of the flowers over the flames is regarded we are told as equally important with the practice of walking through the fire barefoot and stamping it out on this day also many hungarian swineherds make fire by rotating a wheel round a wooden axle wrapt in hemp and through the fire thus made they drive their pigs to preserve them from sickness444 in villages on the danube where the population is a cross between magyar and german the young men and maidens go to the high banks of the river on midsummer eve and while the girls post themselves low down the slope the lads on the height above set fire to little wooden wheels and after swinging them to and fro at the end of a wand send them whirling through the air to fall into the danube as he does so each lad sings out the name of his sweetheart and she listens well pleased down below445 the midsummer fires among the esthonians the midsummer fires in oesel the esthonians of russia who like the magyars belong to the great turanian family of mankind also celebrate the summer solstice in the usual way on the eve of st john all the people of a farm a village or an estate walk solemnly in procession the girls decked with flowers the men with leaves and carrying bundles of straw under their arms the lads carry lighted torches or flaming hoops steeped in tar at the top of long poles thus they go singing to the cattlesheds the granaries and so forth and afterwards march thrice round the dwellinghouse finally preceded by the shrill music of the bagpipes and shawms they repair to a neighbouring hill where the materials of a bonfire have been collected tarbarrels filled with combustibles are hung on poles or the trunk of a felled tree has been set up with a great mass of juniper piled about it in the form of a pyramid when a light has been set to the pile old and young gather about it and pass the time merrily with song and music till break of day every one who comes brings fresh fuel for the fire and they say now we all gather together where st johns fire burns he who comes not to st johns fire will have his barley full of thistles and his oats full of weeds three logs are thrown into the fire with special ceremony in throwing the first they say gold of pleasure a plant with yellow flowers into the fire in throwing the second they say weeds to the unploughed land but in throwing the third they cry flax on my field the fire is said to keep the witches from the cattle446 according to others it ensures that for the whole year the milk shall be as pure as silver and as the stars in the sky and the butter as yellow as the sun and the fire and the gold447 in the esthonian island of oesel while they throw fuel into the midsummer fire they call out weeds to the fire flax to the field or they fling three billets into the flames saying flax grow long and they take charred sticks from the bonfire home with them and keep them to make the cattle thrive in some parts of the island the bonfire is formed by piling brushwood and other combustibles round a tree at the top of which a flag flies whoever succeeds in knocking down the flag with a pole before it begins to burn will have good luck formerly the festivities lasted till daybreak and ended in scenes of debauchery which looked doubly hideous by the growing light of a summer morning448 the midsummer fires among the finns and cheremiss of russia still farther north among a people of the same turanian stock we learn from an eyewitness that midsummer night used to witness a sort of witches sabbath on the top of every hill in finland the bonfire was made by setting up four tall birches in a square and piling the intermediate space with fuel round the roaring flames the people sang and drank and gambolled in the usual way449 farther east in the valley of the volga the cheremiss celebrate about midsummer a festival which haxthausen regarded as identical with the midsummer ceremonies of the rest of europe a sacred tree in the forest generally a tall and solitary oak marks the scene of the solemnity all the males assemble there but no woman may be present a heathen priest lights seven fires in a row from northwest to southeast cattle are sacrificed and their blood poured in the fires each of which is dedicated to a separate deity afterwards the holy tree is illumined by lighted candles placed on its branches the people fall on their knees and with faces bowed to the earth pray that god would be pleased to bless them their children their cattle and their bees grant them success in trade in travel and in the chase enable them to pay the czars taxes and so forth450 the midsummer fires in france bossuet on the midsummer festival when we pass from the east to the west of europe we still find the summer solstice celebrated with rites of the same general character down to about the middle of the nineteenth century the custom of lighting bonfires at midsummer prevailed so commonly in france that there was hardly a town or a village we are told where they were not kindled451 though the pagan origin of the custom may be regarded as certain the catholic church threw a christian cloak over it by boldly declaring that the bonfires were lit in token of the general rejoicing at the birth of the baptist who opportunely came into the world at the solstice of summer just as his greater successor did at the solstice of winter so that the whole year might be said to revolve on the golden hinges of these two great birthdays452 writing in the seventeenth century bishop bossuet expressly affirms this edifying theory of the midsummer bonfires and he tells his catechumens that the church herself participated in the illumination since in several dioceses including his own diocese of meaux a number of parishes kindled what were called ecclesiastical fires for the purpose of banishing the superstitions practised at the purely mundane bonfires these superstitions he goes on to say consisted in dancing round the fire playing feasting singing ribald songs throwing herbs across the fire gathering herbs at noon or while fasting carrying them on the person preserving them throughout the year keeping brands or cinders of the fire and other similar practices453 however excellent the intentions of the ecclesiastical authorities may have been they failed of effecting their purpose for the superstitions as well as the bonfires survived in france far into the nineteenth century if indeed they are extinct even now at the beginning of the twentieth writing in the latter part of the nineteenth century mr ch cuissard tells us that he himself witnessed in touraine and poitou the superstitious practices which he describes as follows the most credulous examine the ways in which the flame burns and draw good or bad omens accordingly others after leaping through the flames crosswise pass their little children through them thrice fully persuaded that the little ones will then be able to walk at once in some places the shepherds make their sheep tread the embers of the extinct fire in order to preserve them from the footrot here you may see about midnight an old woman grubbing among the cinders of the pyre to find the hair of the holy virgin or saint john which she deems an infallible specific against fever there another woman is busy plucking the roots of the herbs which have been burned on the surface of the ground she intends to eat them imagining that they are an infallible preservative against cancer elsewhere a girl wears on her neck a flower which the touch of st johns fire has turned for her into a talisman and she is sure to marry within the year shots are fired at the tree planted in the midst of the fire to drive away the demons who might purpose to send sicknesses about the country seats are set round about the bonfire in order that the souls of dead relations may come and enjoy themselves for a little with the living454 the midsummer fires in brittany uses made of the charred sticks and flowers in brittany apparently the custom of the midsummer bonfires is kept up to this day thus in lower brittany every town and every village still lights its tantad or bonfire on st johns night when the flames have died down the whole assembly kneels round about the bonfire and an old man prays aloud then they all rise and march thrice round the fire at the third turn they stop and every one picks up a pebble and throws it on the burning pile after that they disperse455 in finistre the bonfires of st johns day are kindled by preference in an open space near a chapel of st john but if there is no such chapel they are lighted in the square facing the parish church and in some districts at crossroads everybody brings fuel for the fire it may be a faggot a log a branch or an armful of gorse when the vespers are over the parish priest sets a light to the pile all heads are bared prayers recited and hymns sung then the dancing begins the young folk skip round the blazing pile and leap over it when the flames have died down if anybody makes a false step and falls or rolls in the hot embers he or she is greeted with hoots and retires abashed from the circle of dancers brands are carried home from the bonfire to protect the houses against lightning conflagrations and certain maladies and spells the precious talisman is carefully kept in a cupboard till st johns day of the following year456 at quimper and in the district of lon chairs used to be placed round the midsummer bonfire that the souls of the dead might sit on them and warm themselves at the blaze457 at brest on this day thousands of people used to assemble on the ramparts towards evening and brandish lighted torches which they swung in circles or flung by hundreds into the air the closing of the town gates put an end to the spectacle and the lights might be seen dispersing in all directions like wandering willothewisps458 in upper brittany the materials for the midsummer bonfires which generally consist of bundles of furze and heath are furnished by voluntary contributions and piled on the tops of hills round poles each of which is surmounted by a nosegay or a crown this nosegay or crown is generally provided by a man named john or a woman named jean and it is always a john or a jean who puts a light to the bonfire while the fire is blazing the people dance and sing round it and when the flames have subsided they leap over the glowing embers charred sticks from the bonfire are thrown into wells to improve the water and they are also taken home as a protection against thunder459 to make them thoroughly effective however against thunder and lightning you should keep them near your bed between a bit of a twelfth night cake and a sprig of boxwood which has been blessed on palm sunday460 flowers from the nosegay or crown which overhung the fire are accounted charms against disease and pain both bodily and spiritual hence girls hang them at their breast by a thread of scarlet wool in many parishes of brittany the priest used to go in procession with the crucifix and kindle the bonfire with his own hands and farmers were wont to drive their flocks and herds through the fire in order to preserve them from sickness till midsummer of the following year also it was believed that every girl who danced round nine of the bonfires would marry within the year461 the midsummer fires in normandy the fires as a protection against witchcraft the brotherhood of the green wolf at jumiges pretence of throwing the green wolf into the fire in normandy the midsummer fires have now almost disappeared at least in the district known as the bocage but they used to shine on every hill they were commonly made by piling brushwood broom and ferns about a tall tree which was decorated with a crown of moss and sometimes with flowers while they burned people danced and sang round them and young folk leaped over the flames or the glowing ashes in the valley of the orne the custom was to kindle the bonfire just at the moment when the sun was about to dip below the horizon and the peasants drove their cattle through the fires to protect them against witchcraft especially against the spells of witches and wizards who attempted to steal the milk and butter462 at jumiges in normandy down to the first half of the nineteenth century the midsummer festival was marked by certain singular features which bore the stamp of a very high antiquity every year on the twentythird of june the eve of st john the brotherhood of the green wolf chose a new chief or master who had always to be taken from the hamlet of conihout on being elected the new head of the brotherhood assumed the title of the green wolf and donned a peculiar costume consisting of a long green mantle and a very tall green hat of a conical shape and without a brim thus arrayed he stalked solemnly at the head of the brothers chanting the hymn of st john the crucifix and holy banner leading the way to a place called chouquet here the procession was met by the priest precentors and choir who conducted the brotherhood to the parish church after hearing mass the company adjourned to the house of the green wolf where a simple repast such as is required by the church on fastdays was served up to them then they danced before the door till it was time to light the bonfire night being come the fire was kindled to the sound of handbells by a young man and a young woman both decked with flowers as the flames rose the te deum was sung and a villager thundered out a parody in the norman dialect of the hymn ut queant laxis meantime the green wolf and his brothers with their hoods down on their shoulders and holding each other by the hand ran round the fire after the man who had been chosen to be the green wolf of the following year though only the first and the last man of the chain had a hand free their business was to surround and seize thrice the future green wolf who in his efforts to escape belaboured the brothers with a long wand which he carried when at last they succeeded in catching him they carried him to the burning pile and made as if they would throw him on it this ceremony over they returned to the house of the green wolf where a supper still of the most meagre fare was set before them up till midnight a sort of religious solemnity prevailed no unbecoming word might fall from the lips of any of the company and a censor armed with a handbell was appointed to mark and punish instantly any infraction of the rule but at the stroke of twelve all this was changed constraint gave way to license pious hymns were replaced by bacchanalian ditties and the shrill quavering notes of the village fiddle hardly rose above the roar of voices that went up from the merry brotherhood of the green wolf next day the twentyfourth of june or midsummer day was celebrated by the same personages with the same noisy gaiety one of the ceremonies consisted in parading to the sound of musketry an enormous loaf of consecrated bread which rising in tiers was surmounted by a pyramid of verdure adorned with ribbons after that the holy handbells deposited on the step of the altar were entrusted as insignia of office to the man who was to be the green wolf next year463 the midsummer fires in picardy in the canton of breteuil in picardy department of oise the priest used to kindle the midsummer bonfire and the people marched thrice round it in procession some of them took ashes of the fire home with them to protect the houses against lightning464 the custom is or was down to recent years similar at vorges near laon an enormous pyre some fifty or sixty feet high supported in the middle by a tall pole is constructed every year on the twentythird of june the eve of st john it stands at one end of the village and all the inhabitants contribute fuel to it a cart goes round the village in the morning by order of the mayor collecting combustibles from house to house no one would dream of refusing to comply with the customary obligation in the evening after a service in honour of st john has been performed in the church the clergy the mayor the municipal authorities the rural police and the firebrigade march in procession to the bonfire accompanied by the inhabitants and a crowd of idlers drawn by curiosity from the neighbouring villages after addressing the throng in a sermon to which they pay little heed the parish priest sprinkles the pyre with holy water and taking a lighted torch from the hand of an assistant sets fire to the pile the enormous blaze flaring up against the dark sky of the summer night is seen for many miles around particularly from the hill of laon when it has died down into a huge heap of glowing embers and grey ashes every one carries home a charred stick or some cinders and the firebrigade playing their hose on what remains extinguishes the smouldering fire the people preserve the charred sticks and cinders throughout the year believing that these relics of st johns bonfire have power to guard them from lightning and from contagious diseases465 at chteauthierry a town of the department of aisne between paris and reims the custom of lighting bonfires and dancing round them at the midsummer festival of st john lasted down to about 1850 the fires were kindled especially when june had been rainy and the people thought that the lighting of the bonfires would cause the rain to cease466 the midsummer fires in beauce and perche the fires as a protection against witchcraft in beauce and perche two neighbouring districts of france to the southwest of paris the midsummer bonfires have nearly or wholly disappeared but formerly they were commonly kindled and went by the name of the fires of st john the site of the bonfire was either the village square or beside the cross in the cemetery here a great pile of faggots brushwood and grass was accumulated about a huge branch which bore at the top a crown of fresh flowers the priest blessed the bonfire and the people danced round it when it blazed and crackled the bystanders thrust their heads into the puffs of smoke in the belief that it would preserve them from a multitude of ills and when the fire was burnt out they rushed upon the charred embers and ashes and carried them home imagining that they had a secret virtue to guard their houses from being struck by lightning or consumed by fire some of the perche farmers in the old days not content with the public bonfire used to light little private bonfires in their farmyards and make all their cattle pass through the smoke and flames for the purpose of protecting them against witchcraft or disease467 the midsummer fires in the ardennes the vosges and the jura the midsummer fires in franchecomt the midsummer fires in berry and other parts of central france in the department of the ardennes every one was wont to contribute his faggot to the midsummer bonfire and the clergy marched at the head of the procession to kindle it failure to light the fires would in the popular belief have exposed the fields to the greatest danger at revin the young folk besides dancing round the fire to the strains of the village fiddler threw garlands of flowers across the flames to each other468 in the vosges it is still customary to kindle bonfires upon the hilltops on midsummer eve the people believe that the fires help to preserve the fruits of the earth and ensure good crops469 in the jura mountains the midsummer bonfires went by the name of b or beau they were lit on the most conspicuous points of the landscape470 near st jean in the jura it appears that at this season young people still repair to the crossroads and heights and there wave burning torches so as to present the appearance of fiery wheels in the darkness471 in franchecomt the province of france which lies immediately to the west of the jura mountains the fires of st john still shone on the saints day in several villages down to recent years they were generally lit on high ground and the young folks of both sexes sang and danced round them and sprang over the dying flames472 in bresse bonfires used to be kindled on midsummer eve the twentythird of june and the people danced about them in a circle devout persons particularly old women circumambulated the fires fourteen times telling their beads and mumbling seven paters and seven aves in the hope that thereby they would feel no pains in their backs when they stooped over the sickle in the harvest field473 in berry a district of central france the midsummer fire was lit on the eve of st john and went by the name of the jne joanne or jouanne every family according to its means contributed faggots which were piled round a pole on the highest ground in the neighbourhood in the hamlets the office of kindling the fire devolved on the oldest man but in the towns it was the priest or the mayor who discharged the duty here as in brittany people supposed that a girl who had danced round nine of the midsummer bonfires would marry within the year to leap several times over the fire was regarded as a sort of purification which kept off sickness and brought good luck to the leaper hence the nimble youth bounded through the smoke and flames and when the fire had somewhat abated parents jumped across it with their children in their arms in order that the little ones might also partake of its beneficent influence embers from the extinct bonfire were taken home and after being dipped in holy water were kept as a talisman against all kinds of misfortune but especially against lightning474 the same virtue was ascribed to the ashes and charred sticks of the midsummer bonfire in prigord where everybody contributed his share of fuel to the pile and the whole was crowned with flowers especially with roses and lilies475 on the borders of the departments of creuse and corrze in central france the fires of st john used to be lit on the eve of the saints day the twentythird of june the custom seems to have survived till towards the end of the nineteenth century men women and children assembled round the fires and the young people jumped over them children were brought by their parents or elder brothers into contact with the flames in the belief that this would save them from fever older people girded themselves with stalks of rye taken from a neighbouring field because they fancied that by so doing they would not grow weary in reaping the corn at harvest476 the midsummer fires in poitou bonfires were lit in almost all the hamlets of poitou on the eve of st john people marched round them thrice carrying a branch of walnut in their hand shepherdesses and children passed sprigs of mullein verbascum and nuts across the flames the nuts were supposed to cure toothache and the mullein to protect the cattle from sickness and sorcery when the fire died down people took some of the ashes home with them either to keep them in the house as a preservative against thunder or to scatter them on the fields for the purpose of destroying corncockles and darnel stones were also placed round the fire and it was believed that the first to lift one of these stones next morning would find under it the hair of st john477 in poitou also it used to be customary on the eve of st john to trundle a blazing wheel wrapt in straw over the fields to fertilize them478 this last custom is said to be now extinct479 but it is still usual or was so down to recent years in poitou to kindle fires on this day at crossroads or on the heights the oldest or youngest person present sets a light to the pile which consists of broom gorse and heath a bright and crackling blaze shoots up but soon dies down and over it the young folk leap they also throw stones into it picking the stone according to the size of the turnips that they wish to have that year it is said that the good virgin comes and sits on the prettiest of the stones and next morning they see there her beautiful golden tresses at lussac in poitou the lighting of the midsummer bonfire is still an affair of some ceremony a pyramid of faggots is piled round a tree or tall pole on the ground where the fair is held the priest goes in procession to the spot and kindles the pile when prayers have been said and the clergy have withdrawn the people continue to march round the fire telling their beads but it is not till the flames have begun to die down that the youth jump over them a brand from the midsummer bonfire is supposed to be a preservative against thunder480 the midsummer fires in the departments of vienne and deuxsvres and in the provinces of saintonge and aunis in the department of vienne the bonfire was kindled by the oldest man and before the dance round the flames began it was the custom to pass across them a great bunch of mullein bouillon blanc and a branch of walnut which next morning before sunrise were fastened over the door of the chief cattleshed481 a similar custom prevailed in the neighbouring department of deuxsvres but here it was the priest who kindled the bonfire and old men used to put embers of the fire in their wooden shoes as a preservative against many evils482 in some towns and villages of saintonge and aunis provinces of western france now mostly comprised in the department of charente infrieure the fires of st john are still kindled on midsummer eve but the custom is neither so common nor carried out with so much pomp and ceremony as formerly great quantities of wood used to be piled on an open space round about a huge post or a tree stripped of its leaves and branches every one took care to contribute a faggot to the pile and the whole population marched to the spot in procession with the crucifix at their head and the priest bringing up the rear the squire or other person of high degree put the torch to the pyre and the priest blessed it in the southern and eastern parts of saintonge children and cattle were passed through the smoke of the bonfires to preserve them from contagious diseases and when the fire had gone out the people scuffled for the charred fragments of the great post which they regarded as talismans against thunder next morning on midsummer day every shepherdess in the neighbourhood was up very early for the first to drive her sheep over the blackened cinders and ashes of the great bonfire was sure to have the best flock all that year where the shepherds shrunk from driving their flocks through the smoke and flames of the bonfire they contented themselves with marking the hinderquarters of the animals with a broom which had been blackened in the ashes483 the midsummer fires in southern france midsummer festival of fire and water in provence bathing in the sea at midsummer temporary midsummer kings at aix and marseilles in the mountainous part of comminges a province of southern france now comprised in the department of haute garonne the midsummer fire is made by splitting open the trunk of a tall tree stuffing the crevice with shavings and igniting the whole a garland of flowers is fastened to the top of the tree and at the moment when the fire is lighted the man who was last married has to climb up a ladder and bring the flowers down in the flat parts of the same district the materials of the midsummer bonfires consist of fuel piled in the usual way but they must be put together by men who have been married since the last midsummer festival and each of these benedicts is obliged to lay a wreath of flowers on the top of the pile484 at the entrance of the valley of aran young people set up on the banks of the garonne a tree covered with ribbons and garlands at the end of a year the withered tree and faded flowers furnish excellent fuel so on the eve of st john the villagers assemble and an old man or a child kindles the fire which is to consume tree and garlands together while the blaze lasts the people sing and dance and the burnt tree is then replaced by another which will suffer the same fate after the lapse of a year485 in some districts of the french pyrenees it is deemed necessary to leap nine times over the midsummer fire if you would be assured of prosperity486 a traveller in southern france at the beginning of the nineteenth century tells us that the eve of st john is also a day of joy for the provenals they light great fires and the young folk leap over them at aix they shower squibs and crackers on the passersby which has often had disagreeable consequences at marseilles they drench each other with scented water which is poured from the windows or squirted from little syringes the roughest jest is to souse passersby with clean water which gives rise to loud bursts of laughter487 at draguignan in the department of var fires used to be lit in every street on the eve of st john and the people roasted pods of garlic at them the pods were afterwards distributed to every family another diversion of the evening was to pour cans of water from the houses on the heads of people in the streets488 in provence the midsummer fires are still popular children go from door to door begging for fuel and they are seldom sent empty away formerly the priest the mayor and the aldermen used to walk in procession to the bonfire and even deigned to light it after which the assembly marched thrice round the burning pile while the church bells pealed and rockets fizzed and sputtered in the air dancing began later and the bystanders threw water on each other at ciotat while the fire was blazing the young people plunged into the sea and splashed each other vigorously at vitrolles they bathed in a pond in order that they might not suffer from fever during the year and at saintesmaries they watered the horses to protect them from the itch489 at aix a nominal king chosen from among the youth for his skill in shooting at a popinjay presided over the festival he selected his own officers and escorted by a brilliant train marched to the bonfire kindled it and was the first to dance round it next day he distributed largesse to his followers his reign lasted a year during which he enjoyed certain privileges he was allowed to attend the mass celebrated by the commander of the knights of st john on st johns day the right of hunting was accorded to him and soldiers might not be quartered in his house at marseilles also on this day one of the guilds chose a king of the badache or double axe but it does not appear that he kindled the bonfire which is said to have been lighted with great ceremony by the prfet and other authorities490 the midsummer fires in belgium bonfires on st peters day in brabant the king and queen of the roses effigies burnt in the midsummer fires in belgium the custom of kindling the midsummer bonfires has long disappeared from the great cities but it is still kept up in rural districts and small towns of brabant flanders and limburg people leap across the fires to protect themselves against fever and in eastern flanders women perform similar leaps for the purpose of ensuring an easy delivery at termonde young people go from door to door collecting fuel for the fires and reciting verses in which they beg the inmates to give them wood of st john and to keep some wood for st peters day the twentyninth of june for in belgium the eve of st peters day is celebrated by bonfires and dances exactly like those which commemorate st johns eve the ashes of the st johns fires are deemed by belgian peasants an excellent remedy for consumption if you take a spoonful or two of them moistened with water day by day people also burn vervain in the fires and they say that in the ashes of the plant you may find if you look for it the fools stone491 in many parts of brabant st peters bonfire used to be much larger than that of his rival st john when it had burned out both sexes engaged in a game of ball and the winner became the king of summer or of the ball and had the right to choose his queen sometimes the winner was a woman and it was then her privilege to select her royal mate this pastime was well known at louvain and it continued to be practised at grammont and mespelaer down to the second half of the nineteenth century at mespelaer which is a village near termonde a huge pile of eglantine reeds and straw was collected in a marshy meadow for the bonfire and next evening after vespers the young folk who had lit it assembled at the good life tavern to play the game the winner was crowned with a wreath of roses and the rest danced and sang in a ring about him at grammont while the bonfire was lit and the dances round it took place on st peters eve the festival of the crown of roses was deferred till the following sunday the young folk arranged among themselves beforehand who should be king and queen of the roses the rosy wreaths were hung on cords across the street the dancers danced below them and at a given moment the wreaths fell on the heads of the chosen king and queen who had to entertain their fellows at a feast according to some people the fires of st peter like those of st john were lighted in order to drive away dragons492 in french flanders down to 1789 a straw figure representing a man was always burned in the midsummer bonfire and the figure of a woman was burned on st peters day493 in belgium people jump over the midsummer bonfires as a preventive of colic and they keep the ashes at home to hinder fire from breaking out494 the midsummer fires in england stows description of the midsummer fires in london the midsummer fires at eton the custom of lighting bonfires at midsummer has been observed in many parts of our own country on the vigil of saint john the baptist commonly called midsummer eve it was usual in most country places and also in towns and cities for the inhabitants both old and young and of both sexes to meet together and make merry by the side of a large fire made in the middle of the street or in some open and convenient place over which the young men frequently leaped by way of frolic and also exercised themselves with various sports and pastimes more especially with running wrestling and dancing these diversions they continued till midnight and sometimes till cockcrowing495 in the streets of london the midsummer fires were lighted in the time of queen elizabeth down to the end of the sixteenth century as we learn from stows description which runs thus in the months of june and july on the vigils of festival days and on the same festival days in the evenings after the sun setting there were usually made bonfires in the streets every man bestowing wood or labour towards them the wealthier sort also before their doors near to the said bonfires would set out tables on the vigils furnished with sweet bread and good drink and on the festival days with meats and drinks plentifully whereunto they would invite their neighbours and passengers also to sit and be merry with them in great familiarity praising god for his benefits bestowed on them these were called bonfires as well of good amity amongst neighbours that being before at controversy were there by the labour of others reconciled and made of bitter enemies loving friends and also for the virtue that a great fire hath to purge the infection of the air on the vigil of st john the baptist and on st peter and paul the apostles every mans door being shadowed with green birch long fennel st johns wort orpin white lilies and such like garnished upon with garlands of beautiful flowers had also lamps of glass with oil burning in them all the night some hung out branches of iron curiously wrought containing hundreds of lamps alight at once which made a goodly show namely in new fish street thames street etc496 in the sixteenth century the eton boys used to kindle a bonfire on the east side of the church both on st johns day and on st peters day497 writing in the second half of the seventeenth century the antiquary john aubrey tells us that bonfires were still kindled in many places on st johns night but that the civil wars had thrown many of these old customs out of fashion wars he adds extinguish superstition as well as religion and laws and there is nothing like gunpowder for putting phantoms to flight498 the midsummer fires in the north of england the midsummer fires in northumberland in the north of england these fires used to be lit in the open streets young and old gathered round them and while the young leaped over the fires and engaged in games their elders looked on and probably remembered with regret the days when they used to foot it as nimbly sometimes the fires were kindled on the tops of high hills the people also carried firebrands about the fields499 the custom of kindling bonfires on midsummer eve prevailed all over cumberland down to the second half of the eighteenth century500 in northumberland the custom seems to have lasted into the first quarter of the nineteenth century the fires were lit in the villages and on the tops of high hills and the people sported and danced round them501 moreover the villagers used to run with burning brands round their fields and to snatch ashes from a neighbours fire saying as they did so we have the flower or flour of the wake502 at sandhill bonfires were kindled on the eve of st peter as well as on midsummer eve the custom is attested for the year 1575 when it was described as ancient503 we are told that on midsummers eve reckoned according to the old style it was formerly the custom of the inhabitants young and old not only of whalton but of most of the adjacent villages to collect a large cartload of whins and other combustible materials which was dragged by them with great rejoicing a fiddler being seated on the top of the cart into the village and erected into a pile the people from the surrounding country assembled towards evening when it was set on fire and whilst the young danced around it the elders looked on smoking their pipes and drinking their beer until it was consumed there can be little doubt that this curious old custom dates from a very remote antiquity in a lawsuit which was tried in 1878 the rector of whalton gave evidence of the constant use of the village green for the ceremony since 1843 the bonfire he said was lighted a little to the northeast of the well at whalton and partly on the footpath and people danced round it and jumped through it that was never interrupted the rev gr hall writing in 1879 says that the fire festivals or bonfires of the summer solstice at the old midsummer until recently were commemorated on christenburg crags and elsewhere by leaping through and dancing round the fires as those who have been present have told me504 down to the early part of the nineteenth century bonfires called bealfires used to be lit on midsummer eve all over the wolds in the east riding of yorkshire505 the midsummer fires in herefordshire somersetshire devonshire and cornwall the cornish fires on midsummer eve and st peters eve in herefordshire and somersetshire the peasants used to make fires in the fields on midsummer eve to bless the apples506 in devonshire the custom of leaping over the midsummer fires was also observed507 in cornwall the festival fires called bonfires are kindled on the eves of st john baptist and st peters day and midsummer is thence in the cornish tongue called goluan which signifies both light and rejoicing at these fires the cornish attend with lighted torches tarred and pitched at the end and make their perambulations round their fires going from village to village and carrying their torches before them this is certainly the remains of druid superstition for faces praeferre to carry lighted torches was reckoned a kind of gentilism and as such particularly prohibited by the gallick councils508 at penzance and elsewhere in the county the people danced and sang about the bonfires on midsummer eve on whiteborough a large tumulus near launceston a huge bonfire used to be kindled on midsummer eve a tall summer pole with a large bush at the top was fixed in the centre of the bonfire509 the cornish fires at this season appear to have been commonly lit on high and conspicuous hills such as tregonan godolphin carnwarth and cam brea when it grew dusk on midsummer eve old men would hobble away to some height whence they counted the fires and drew a presage from their number510 it is the immemorial usage in penzance and the neighbouring towns and villages to kindle bonfires and torches on midsummereve and on midsummerday to hold a fair on penzance quay where the country folks assemble from the adjoining parishes in great numbers to make excursions on the water st peters eve the twentyeighth of june is distinguished by a similar display of bonfires and torches although the quayfair on st petersday the twentyninth of june has been discontinued upwards of forty years on these eves a line of tarbarrels relieved occasionally by large bonfires is seen in the centre of each of the principal streets in penzance on either side of this line young men and women pass up and down swinging round their heads heavy torches made of large pieces of folded canvas steeped in tar and nailed to the ends of sticks between three and four feet long the flames of some of these almost equal those of the tarbarrels rows of lighted candles also when the air is calm are fixed outside the windows or along the sides of the streets in st just and other mining parishes the young miners mimicking their fathers employments bore rows of holes in the rocks load them with gunpowder and explode them in rapid succession by trains of the same substance as the holes are not deep enough to split the rocks the same little batteries serve for many years on these nights mounts bay has a most animating appearance although not equal to what was annually witnessed at the beginning of the present century when the whole coast from the lands end to the lizard wherever a town or a village existed was lighted up with these stationary or moving fires in the early part of the evening children may be seen wearing wreaths of flowersa custom in all probability originating from the ancient use of these ornaments when they danced around the fires at the close of the fireworks in penzance a great number of persons of both sexes chiefly from the neighbourhood of the quay used always until within the last few years to join hand in hand forming a long string and run through the streets playing thread the needle heedless of the fireworks showered upon them and oftentimes leaping over the yet glowing embers i have on these occasions seen boys following one another jumping through flames higher than themselves511 the midsummer fires in wales and the isle of man burning wheel rolled down hill in wales the midsummer fires were kindled on st johns eve and on st johns day three or nine different kinds of wood and charred faggots carefully preserved from the last midsummer were deemed necessary to build the bonfire which was generally done on rising ground various herbs were thrown into the blaze and girls with bunches of three or nine different kinds of flowers would take the hands of boys who wore flowers in their buttonholes and hats and together the young couples would leap over the fires on the same two midsummer days roses and wreaths of flowers were hung over the doors and windows describing a midsummer fire an old inhabitant born in 1809 remembered being taken to different hills in the vale of glamorgan to see festivities in which people from all parts of the district participated she was at that time about fourteen and old enough to retain a vivid recollection of the circumstances people conveyed trusses of straw to the top of the hill where men and youths waited for the contributions women and girls were stationed at the bottom of the hill then a large cartwheel was thickly swathed with straw and not an inch of wood was left in sight a pole was inserted through the centre of the wheel so that long ends extended about a yard on each side if any straw remained it was made up into torches at the top of tall sticks at a given signal the wheel was lighted and sent rolling downhill if this firewheel went out before it reached the bottom of the hill a very poor harvest was promised if it kept lighted all the way down and continued blazing for a long time the harvest would be exceptionally abundant loud cheers and shouts accompanied the progress of the wheel512 at darowen in wales small bonfires were kindled on midsummer eve513 on the same day people in the isle of man were wont to light fires to the windward of every field so that the smoke might pass over the corn and they folded their cattle and carried blazing furze or gorse round them several times514 the midsummer fires in ireland passage of people and cattle through the fires cattle driven through the fire ashes used to fertilize the fields the white horse at the midsummer fire a writer of the last quarter of the seventeenth century tells us that in ireland on the eves of st john baptist and st peter they always have in every town a bonfire late in the evenings and carry about bundles of reeds fast tied and fired these being dry will last long and flame better than a torch and be a pleasing divertive prospect to the distant beholder a stranger would go near to imagine the whole country was on fire515 another writer says of the south of ireland on midsummers eve every eminence near which is a habitation blazes with bonfires and round these they carry numerous torches shouting and dancing which affords a beautiful sight516 an author who described ireland in the first quarter of the eighteenth century says on the vigil of st john the baptists nativity they make bonfires and run along the streets and fields with wisps of straw blazing on long poles to purify the air which they think infectious by believing all the devils spirits ghosts and hobgoblins fly abroad this night to hurt mankind517 another writer states that he witnessed the festival in ireland in 1782 at the house where i was entertained it was told me that we should see at midnight the most singular sight in ireland which was the lighting of fires in honour of the sun accordingly exactly at midnight the fires began to appear and taking the advantage of going up to the leads of the house which had a widely extended view i saw on a radius of thirty miles all around the fires burning on every eminence which the country afforded i had a farther satisfaction in learning from undoubted authority that the people danced round the fires and at the close went through these fires and made their sons and daughters together with their cattle pass through the fire and the whole was conducted with religious solemnity518 that the custom prevailed in full force as late as 1867 appears from a notice in a newspaper of that date which runs thus the old pagan fireworship still survives in ireland though nominally in honour of st john on sunday night bonfires were observed throughout nearly every county in the province of leinster in kilkenny fires blazed on every hillside at intervals of about a mile there were very many in the queens county also in kildare and wexford the effect in the rich sunset appeared to travellers very grand the people assemble and dance round the fires the children jump through the flames and in former times live coals were carried into the cornfields to prevent blight519 in county leitrim on st johns eve which is called bonfire day fires are still lighted after dusk on the hills and along the sides of the roads520 all over kerry the same thing continues to be done though not so commonly as of old small fires were made across the road and to drive through them brought luck for the year cattle were also driven through the fires on lettermore island in south connemara some of the ashes from the midsummer bonfire are thrown on the fields to fertilize them521 one writer informs us that in munster and connaught a bone must always be burned in the fire for otherwise the people believe that the fire will bring no luck he adds that in many places sterile beasts and human beings are passed through the fire and that as a boy he himself jumped through the fire for luck522 an eyewitness has described as follows a remarkable ceremony observed in ireland on midsummer eve when the fire burned for some hours and got low an indispensable part of the ceremony commenced every one present of the peasantry passed through it and several children were thrown across the sparkling embers while a wooden frame of some eight feet long with a horses head fixed to one end and a large white sheet thrown over it concealing the wood and the man on whose head it was carried made its appearance this was greeted with loud shouts of the white horse and having been safely carried by the skill of its bearer several times through the fire with a bold leap it pursued the people who ran screaming and laughing in every direction i asked what the horse was meant for and was told that it represented all cattle523 lady wildes account of the midsummer fires in ireland lady wildes account of the midsummer festival in ireland is picturesque and probably correct in substance although she does not cite her authorities as it contains some interesting features which are not noticed by the other writers on ireland whom i have consulted i will quote the greater part of it in full in ancient times she says the sacred fire was lighted with great ceremony on midsummer eve and on that night all the people of the adjacent country kept fixed watch on the western promontory of howth and the moment the first flash was seen from that spot the fact of ignition was announced with wild cries and cheers repeated from village to village when all the local fires began to blaze and ireland was circled by a cordon of flame rising up from every hill then the dance and song began round every fire and the wild hurrahs filled the air with the most frantic revelry many of these ancient customs are still continued and the fires are still lighted on st johns eve on every hill in ireland when the fire has burned down to a red glow the young men strip to the waist and leap over or through the flames this is done backwards and forwards several times and he who braves the greatest blaze is considered the victor over the powers of evil and is greeted with tremendous applause when the fire burns still lower the young girls leap the flame and those who leap clean over three times back and forward will be certain of a speedy marriage and good luck in afterlife with many children the married women then walk through the lines of the burning embers and when the fire is nearly burnt and trampled down the yearling cattle are driven through the hot ashes and their back is singed with a lighted hazel twig these rods are kept safely afterwards being considered of immense power to drive the cattle to and from the watering places as the fire diminishes the shouting grows fainter and the song and the dance commence while professional storytellers narrate tales of fairyland or of the good old times long ago when the kings and princes of ireland dwelt amongst their own people and there was food to eat and wine to drink for all comers to the feast at the kings house when the crowd at length separate every one carries home a brand from the fire and great virtue is attached to the lighted brone which is safely carried to the house without breaking or falling to the ground many contests also arise amongst the young men for whoever enters his house first with the sacred fire brings the good luck of the year with him524 holy water resorted to on midsummer eve in ireland in ireland as elsewhere water was also apparently thought to acquire a certain mystical virtue at midsummer at stoole near downpatrick there is a ceremony commencing at twelve oclock at night on midsummer eve its sacred mount is consecrated to st patrick the plain contains three wells to which the most extraordinary virtues are attributed here and there are heaps of stones around some of which appear great numbers of people running with as much speed as possible around others crowds of worshippers kneel with bare legs and feet as an indispensable part of the penance the men without coats with handkerchiefs on their heads instead of hats having gone seven times round each heap kiss the ground cross themselves and proceed to the hill here they ascend on their bare knees by a path so steep and rugged that it would be difficult to walk up many hold their hands clasped at the back of their necks and several carry large stones on their heads having repeated this ceremony seven times they go to what is called st patricks chair which are two great flat stones fixed upright in the hill here they cross and bless themselves as they step in between these stones and while repeating prayers an old man seated for the purpose turns them round on their feet three times for which he is paid the devotee then goes to conclude his penance at a pile of stones named the altar while this busy scene is continued by the multitude the wells and streams issuing from them are thronged by crowds of halt maimed and blind pressing to wash away their infirmities with water consecrated by their patron saint and so powerful is the impression of its efficacy on their minds that many of those who go to be healed and who are not totally blind or altogether crippled really believe for a time that they are by means of its miraculous virtues perfectly restored525 the midsummer fires in scotland fires on st peters day the twentyninth of june in scotland the traces of midsummer fires are few we are told by a writer of the eighteenth century that the midsummereven fire a relict of druidism was kindled in some parts of the county of perth526 another writer of the same period describing what he calls the druidical festivals of the highlanders says that the least considerable of them is that of midsummer in the highlands of perthshire there are some vestiges of it the cowherd goes three times round the fold according to the course of the sun with a burning torch in his hand they imagined this rite had a tendency to purify their herds and flocks and to prevent diseases at their return the landlady makes an entertainment for the cowherd and his associates527 in the northeast of scotland down to the latter half of the eighteenth century farmers used to go round their lands with burning torches about the middle of june528 on the hill of cairnshee in the parish of durris kincardineshire the herdsmen of the country round about annually kindle a bonfire at sunset on midsummer day the twentyfourth of june the men or lads collect the fuel and push each other through the smoke and flames the custom is kept up through the benefaction of a certain alexander hogg a native of the parish who died about 1790 and left a small sum for the maintenance of a midsummer bonfire on the spot because as a boy he had herded cattle on the hill we may conjecture that in doing so he merely provided for the continuance of an old custom which he himself had observed in the same place in his youth529 at the village of tarbolton in ayrshire a bonfire has been annually kindled from time immemorial on the evening of the first monday after the eleventh of june a noted cattlemarket was formerly held at the fair on the following day the bonfire is still lit at the gloaming by the lads and lasses of the village on a high mound or hillock just outside of the village fuel for it is collected by the lads from door to door the youth dance round the fire and leap over the fringes of it the many cattledrovers who used to assemble for the fair were wont to gather round the blazing pile smoke their pipes and listen to the young folk singing in chorus on the hillock afterwards they wrapped themselves in their plaids and slept round the bonfire which was intended to last all night530 thomas moresin of aberdeen a writer of the sixteenth century says that on st peters day which is the twentyninth of june the scotch ran about at night with lighted torches on mountains and high grounds as ceres did when she roamed the whole earth in search of proserpine531 and towards the end of the eighteenth century the parish minister of loudoun a district of ayrshire whose bonny woods and braes have been sung by burns wrote that the custom still remains amongst the herds and young people to kindle fires in the high grounds in honour of beltan beltan which in gaelic signifies baal or belsfire was antiently the time of this solemnity it is now kept on st peters day532 the midsummer fires in spain and the azores divination on midsummer eve in the azores the midsummer fires in corsica and sardinia all over spain great bonfires called lumes are still lit on midsummer eve they are kept up all night and the children leap over them in a certain rhythmical way which is said to resemble the ancient dances on the coast people at this season plunge into the sea in the inland districts the villagers go and roll naked in the dew of the meadows which is supposed to be a sovereign preservative against diseases of the skin on this evening too girls who would pry into the future put a vessel of water on the sill outside their window and when the clocks strike twelve they break an egg in the water and see or fancy they see in the shapes assumed by the pulp as it blends with the liquid the likeness of future bridegrooms castles coffins and so forth but generally as might perhaps have been anticipated the obliging egg exhibits the features of a bridegroom533 in the azores also bonfires are lit on midsummer eve st johns eve and boys jump over them for luck on that night st john himself is supposed to appear in person and bless all the seas and waters driving out the devils and demons who had been disporting themselves in them ever since the second day of november that is why in the interval between the second of november and the twentythird of june nobody will bathe in the sea or in a hot spring on midsummer eve too you can always see the devil if you will go into a garden at midnight he is invariably found standing near a mustardplant his reason for adopting this posture has not been ascertained perhaps in the chilly air of the upper world he is attracted by the genial warmth of the mustard various forms of divination are practised by people in the azores on midsummer eve thus a newlaid egg is broken into a glass of water and the shapes which it assumes foreshadow the fate of the person concerned again seven saucers are placed in a row filled respectively with water earth ashes keys a thimble money and grass which things signify travel death widowhood housekeeping spinsterhood riches and farming a blindfolded person touches one or other of the saucers with a wand and so discovers his or her fate again three broad beans are taken one is left in its skin one is half peeled and the third is peeled outright the three denote respectively riches competence and poverty they are hidden and searched for and he who finds one of them knows accordingly whether he will be rich moderately welloff or poor again girls take slips of paper and write the names of young men twice over on them these they fold up and crumple and place one set under their pillows and the other set in a saucer full of water in the morning they draw one slip of paper from under their pillow and see whether one in the water has opened out if the names on the two slips are the same it is the name of her future husband young men do the same with girls names once more if a girl rises at sunrise goes out into the street and asks the first passerby his christian name that will be her husbands name534 some of these modes of divination resemble those which are or used to be practised in scotland at halloween535 in corsica on the eve of st john the people set fire to the trunk of a tree or to a whole tree and the young men and maidens dance round the blaze which is called fucaraia536 we have seen that at ozieri in sardinia a great bonfire is kindled on st johns eve and that the young people dance round it537 the midsummer fires in the abruzzi bathing on midsummer eve in the abruzzi the midsummer fires in sicily the witches at midsummer passing to italy we find that the midsummer fires are still lighted on st johns eve in many parts of the abruzzi they are commonest in the territory which was inhabited in antiquity by the vestini they are rarer in the land of the ancient marsi and they disappear entirely in the lower valley of the sangro for the most part the fires are fed with straw and dry grass and are kindled in the fields near the villages or on high ground as they blaze up the people dance round or over them in leaping across the flames the boys cry out st john preserve my thighs and legs formerly it used to be common to light the bonfires also in the towns in front of churches of st john and the remains of the sacred fire were carried home by the people but this custom has mostly fallen into disuse however at celano the practice is still kept up of taking brands and ashes from the bonfires to the houses although the fires are no longer kindled in front of the churches but merely in the streets538 in the abruzzi water also is supposed to acquire certain marvellous and beneficent properties on st johns night hence many people bathe or at least wash their faces and hands in the sea or a river at that season especially at the moment of sunrise such a bath is said to be an excellent cure for diseases of the skin at castiglione a casauria the people after washing in the river or in springs gird their waists and wreath their brows with sprigs of briony in order to keep them from aches and pains539 in various parts of sicily also fires are kindled on midsummer eve st johns eve the twentythird of june on the madonie mountains in the north of the island the herdsmen kindle them at intervals so that the crests of the mountains are seen ablaze in the darkness for many miles about acireale on the east coast of the island the bonfires are lit by boys who jump over them at chiaromonte the witches that night acquire extraordinary powers hence everybody then puts a broom outside of his house because a broom is an excellent protective against witchcraft540 at orvieto the midsummer fires were specially excepted from the prohibition directed against bonfires in general541 the midsummer fires in malta in malta also the people celebrate midsummer eve st johns eve by kindling great fires in the public streets and giving their children dolls to carry in their arms on this day in order to make good the prophecy respecting the baptist multi in nativitate ejus gaudebunt days and even weeks before this festival groups of children are seen going out into the country fields to gather straw twigs and all sorts of other combustibles which they store up for st johns eve on the night of the twentythird of june the day before the festival of the saint great fires are kindled in the streets squares and market places of the towns and villages of the island and as fire after fire blazes out of the darkness of that summer night the effect is singularly striking these fires are sometimes kept up for hours being continually fed by the scores of bystanders who take great delight in throwing amidst the flames some old rickety piece of furniture which they consider as lumber in their houses lots of happy and reckless children and very often men are seen merrily leaping in succession over and through the crackling flames at the time of the order of st john of jerusalem the grand master himself soon after the angelus used to leave his palace accompanied by the grand prior the bishop and two bailiffs to set fire to some pitch barrels which were placed for the occasion in the square facing the sacred hospital great crowds used to assemble here in order to assist at this ceremony the setting ablaze of the five casks and later on of the eight casks by the grand master was a signal for the others to kindle their fires in the different parts of the town542 the midsummer fires in greece the midsummer fires in macedonia and albania in greece the custom of kindling fires on st johns eve and jumping over them is said to be still universal one reason assigned for it is a wish to escape from the fleas543 according to another account the women cry out as they leap over the fire i leave my sins behind me544 in lesbos the fires on st johns eve are usually lighted by threes and the people spring thrice over them each with a stone on his head saying i jump the hares fire my head a stone on the morning of st johns day those who dwell near the coast go to bathe in the sea as they go they gird themselves with osiers and when they are in the water they let the osiers float away saying let my maladies go away then they look for what is called the hairy stone which possesses the remarkable property not only of keeping moths from clothes but even of multiplying the clothes in the chest where it is laid up and the more hairs on the stone the more will the clothes multiply in the chest545 in calymnos the midsummer fire is supposed to ensure abundance in the coming year as well as deliverance from fleas the people dance round the fires singing with stones on their heads and then jump over the blaze or the glowing embers when the fire is burning low they throw the stones into it and when it is nearly out they make crosses on their legs and then go straightway and bathe in the sea546 in cos the lads and lasses dance round the bonfires on st johns eve each of the lads binds a black stone on his head signifying that he wishes to become as strong as the stone also they make the sign of the cross on their feet and legs and jump over the fire547 on midsummer eve the greeks of macedonia light fires after supper in front of their gates the garlands now faded which were hung over the doors on may day are taken down and cast into the flames after which the young folk leap over the blaze fully persuaded that st johns fire will not burn them548 in albania fires of dry herbage are or used to be lit everywhere on st johns eve young and old leap over them for such a leap is thought to be good for the health549 the midsummer fires in america from the old world the midsummer fires have been carried across the atlantic to america in brazil people jump over the fires of st john and at this season they can take hot coals in their mouths without burning themselves550 in bolivia on the eve of st john it is usual to see bonfires lighted on the hills and even in the streets of the capital la paz as the city stands at the bottom of an immense ravine and the indians of the neighbourhood take a pride in kindling bonfires on heights which might seem inaccessible the scene is very striking when the darkness of night is suddenly and simultaneously lit up by hundreds of fires which cast a glare on surrounding objects producing an effect at once weird and picturesque551 the midsummer fires among the mohammedans of morocco and algeria the custom of kindling bonfires on midsummer day or on midsummer eve is widely spread among the mohammedan peoples of north africa particularly in morocco and algeria it is common both to the berbers and to many of the arabs or arabicspeaking tribes in these countries midsummer day the twentyfourth of june old style is called arabic lansara the fires are lit in the courtyards at crossroads in the fields and sometimes on the threshingfloors plants which in burning give out a thick smoke and an aromatic smell are much sought after for fuel on these occasions among the plants used for the purpose are giantfennel thyme rue chervilseed camomile geranium and pennyroyal people expose themselves and especially their children to the smoke and drive it towards the orchards and the crops also they leap across the fires in some places everybody ought to repeat the leap seven times moreover they take burning brands from the fires and carry them through the houses in order to fumigate them they pass things through the fire and bring the sick into contact with it while they utter prayers for their recovery the ashes of the bonfires are also reputed to possess beneficial properties hence in some places people rub their hair or their bodies with them552 for example the andjra mountaineers of morocco kindle large fires in open places of their villages on midsummer day men women and children jump over the flames or the glowing embers believing that by so doing they rid themselves of all misfortune which may be clinging to them they imagine also that such leaps cure the sick and procure offspring for childless couples moreover they burn straw together with some marjoram and alum in the fold where the cattle sheep and goats are penned for the night the smoke in their opinion will make the animals thrive on midsummer day the arabs of the mnasara tribe make fires outside their tents near their animals on their fields and in their gardens large quantities of pennyroyal are burned in these fires and over some of them the people leap thrice to and fro sometimes small fires are also kindled inside the tents they say that the smoke confers blessings on everything with which it comes into contact at salee on the atlantic coast of morocco persons who suffer from diseased eyes rub them with the ashes of the midsummer fire and in casablanca and azemmur the people hold their faces over the fire because the smoke is thought to be good for the eyes the arab tribe ulad bu aziz in the dukkala province of morocco kindle midsummer bonfires not for themselves and their cattle but only for crops and fruit nobody likes to reap his crops before midsummer day because if he did they would lose the benefit of the blessed influence which flows from the smoke of the bonfires again the beni mgild a berber tribe of morocco light fires of straw on midsummer eve and leap thrice over them to and fro they let some of the smoke pass underneath their clothes and married women hold their breasts over the fire in order that their children may be strong moreover they paint their eyes and lips with some black powder in which ashes of the bonfire are mixed and in order that their horses may also benefit by the fires they dip the right forelegs of the animals in the smoke and flames or in the hot embers and they rub ashes on the foreheads and between the nostrils of the horses berbers of the rif province in northern morocco similarly make great use of fires at midsummer for the good of themselves their cattle and their fruittrees they jump over the bonfires in the belief that this will preserve them in good health and they light fires under fruittrees to keep the fruit from falling untimely and they imagine that by rubbing a paste of the ashes on their hair they prevent the hair from falling off their heads553 beneficial effect ascribed to the smoke of the fires ill luck supposed to be burnt in the midsummer fires the midsummer festival in north africa comprises rites concerned with water as well as with fire the midsummer festival in north africa is probably older than mohammedanism in all these moroccan customs we are told the beneficial effect is attributed wholly to the smoke which is supposed to be endued with a magical quality that removes misfortune from men animals fruittrees and crops but in some parts of morocco people at midsummer kindle fires of a different sort not for the sake of fumigation but in order to burn up misfortune in the flames thus on midsummer eve the berber tribe of the beni mgild burn three sheaves of unthreshed wheat or barley one for the children one for the crops and one for the animals on the same occasion they burn the tent of a widow who has never given birth to a child by so doing they think to rid the village of ill luck it is said that at midsummer the zemmur burn a tent which belongs to somebody who was killed in war during a feast or if there is no such person in the village the schoolmasters tent is burned instead among the arabicspeaking beni ahsen it is customary for those who live near the river sbu to make a little hut of straw at midsummer set it on fire and let it float down the river similarly the inhabitants of salee burn a straw hut on the river which flows past their town554 further it deserves to be noticed that in northern africa as in southern europe the midsummer festival comprises rites concerned with water as well as with fire for example among the benisnous the women light a fire in an oven throw perfumes into it and circumambulate a tank which they also incense after a fashion in many places on the coast as in the province of oran and particularly in the north of morocco everybody goes and bathes in the sea at midsummer and in many towns of the interior such as fez mequinez and especially merrakech people throw water over each other on this day and where water is scarce earth is used instead according to the mohammedan principle which permits ablutions to be performed with earth or sand when water cannot be spared for the purpose555 people of the andjra district in morocco not only bathe themselves in the sea or in rivers at midsummer they also bathe their animals their horses mules donkeys cattle sheep and goats for they think that on that day water possesses a blessed virtue baraka which removes sickness and misfortune in aglu again men women and children bathe in the sea or springs or rivers at midsummer alleging that by so doing they protect themselves against disease for the whole year among the berbers of the rif district the custom of bathing on this day is commonly observed and animals share the ablutions556 some mohammedans of north africa kindle fires and observe water ceremonies at their movable new year water ceremonies at new year in morocco the rites of fire and water at midsummer and new year in morocco seem to be identical in character the duplication of the festival is probably due to a conflict between the solar calendar of the romans and the lunar calendar of the arabs the celebration of a midsummer festival by mohammedan peoples is particularly remarkable because the mohammedan calendar being purely lunar and uncorrected by intercalation necessarily takes no note of festivals which occupy fixed points in the solar year all strictly mohammedan feasts being pinned to the moon slide gradually with that luminary through the whole period of the earths revolution about the sun this fact of itself seems to prove that among the mohammedan peoples of northern africa as among the christian peoples of europe the midsummer festival is quite independent of the religion which the people publicly profess and is a relic of a far older paganism there are indeed independent grounds for thinking that the arabs enjoyed the advantage of a comparatively wellregulated solar year before the prophet of god saddled them with the absurdity and inconvenience of a purely lunar calendar557 be that as it may it is notable that some mohammedan people of north africa kindle fires and bathe in water at the movable new year of their lunar calendar instead of at the fixed midsummer of the solar year while others again practise these observances at both seasons new years day on which the rites are celebrated is called ashur it is the tenth day of moharram the first month of the mohammedan calendar on that day bonfires are kindled in tunis and also at merrakech and among some tribes of the neighbourhood558 at demnat in the great atlas mountains people kindle a large bonfire on new years eve and leap to and fro over the flames uttering words which imply that by these leaps they think to purify themselves from all kinds of evil at aglu in the province of sus the fire is lighted at three different points by an unmarried girl and when it has died down the young men leap over the glowing embers saying we shook on you o lady ashur fleas and lice and the illnesses of the heart as also those of the bones we shall pass through you again next year and the following years with safety and health both at aglu and glawi in the great atlas smaller fires are also kindled over which the animals are driven at demnat girls who wish to marry wash themselves in water which has been boiled over the new year fire and in dukkala people use the ashes of that fire to rub sore eyes with new year fires appear to be commonly kindled among the berbers who inhabit the western portion of the great atlas and also among the arabicspeaking tribes of the plains but dr westermarck found no traces of such fires among the arabicspeaking mountaineers of northern morocco and the berbers of the rif province further it should be observed that water ceremonies like those which are practised at midsummer are very commonly observed in morocco at the new year that is on the tenth day of the first month on the morning of that day ashur all water or according to some people only spring water is endowed with a magical virtue baraka especially before sunrise hence at that time the people bathe and pour water over each other in some places they also sprinkle their animals tents or rooms in dukkala some of the new year water is preserved at home till new years day ashur of next year some of it is kept to be used as medicine some of it is poured on the place where the corn is threshed and some is used to water the money which is to be buried in the ground for the people think that the earthspirits will not be able to steal the buried treasures which have thus been sanctified with the holy water559 the midsummer festival in morocco seems to be of berber origin thus the rites of fire and water which are observed in morocco at midsummer and new year appear to be identical in character and intention and it seems certain that the duplication of the rites is due to a conflict between two calendars namely the old julian calendar of the romans which was based on the sun and the newer mohammedan calendar of the arabs which is based on the moon for not only was the julian calendar in use throughout the whole of northern africa under the roman empire to this day it is everywhere employed among mohammedans for the regulation of agriculture and all the affairs of daily life its practical convenience has made it indispensable and the lunar calendar of orthodox mohammedanism is scarcely used except for purposes of chronology even the old latin names of the months are known and employed in slightly disguised forms throughout the whole moslem world and little calendars of the julian year circulate in manuscript among mohammedans permitting them to combine the practical advantages of pagan science with a nominal adherence to orthodox absurdity560 thus the heathen origin of the midsummer festival is too palpable to escape the attention of good mohammedans who accordingly frown upon the midsummer bonfires as pagan superstitions precisely as similar observances in europe have often been denounced by orthodox christianity indeed many religious people in morocco entirely disapprove of the whole of the midsummer ceremonies maintaining that they are all bad and a conscientious schoolmaster will even refuse his pupils a holiday at midsummer though the boys sometimes offer him a bribe if he will sacrifice his scruples to his avarice561 as the midsummer customs appear to flourish among all the berbers of morocco but to be unknown among the pure arabs who have not been affected by berber influence it seems reasonable to infer with dr westermarck that the midsummer festival has belonged from time immemorial to the berber race and that so far as it is now observed by the arabs of morocco it has been learned by them from the berbers the old indigenous inhabitants of the country dr westermarck may also be right in holding that in spite of the close similarity which obtains between the midsummer festival of europe and the midsummer festival of north africa the latter is not a copy of the former but that both have been handed down independently from a time beyond the purview of history when such ceremonies were common to the mediterranean race562 5 the autumn fires festivals of fire in august russian feast of florus and laurus on august 18th living fire made by the friction of wood in the months which elapse between midsummer and the setting in of winter the european festivals of fire appear to be few and unimportant on the evening of the first day of august which is the festival of the cross bonfires are commonly lit in macedonia and boys jump over them shouting dig up bury but whom or what they wish to dig up or bury they do not know563 the russians hold the feast of two martyrs florus and laurus on the eighteenth day of august old style on this day the russians lead their horses round the church of their village beside which on the foregoing evening they dig a hole with two mouths each horse has a bridle made of the bark of the lindentree the horses go through this hole one after the other opposite to one of the mouths of which the priest stands with a sprinkler in his hand with which he sprinkles them as soon as the horses have passed by their bridles are taken off and they are made to go between two fires that they kindle called by the russians givoy agon that is to say living fires of which i shall give an account i shall before remark that the russian peasantry throw the bridles of their horses into one of these fires to be consumed this is the manner of their lighting these givoy agon or living fires some men hold the ends of a stick made of the planetree very dry and about a fathom long this stick they hold firmly over one of birch perfectly dry and rub with violence and quickly against the former the birch which is somewhat softer than the plane in a short time inflames and serves them to light both the fires i have described564 feast of the nativity of the virgin on the eighth of september at capri and naples the feast of the nativity of the virgin on the eighth day of september is celebrated at naples and capri with fireworks bonfires and assassinations on this subject my friend professor a e housman who witnessed the celebration in different years at both places has kindly furnished me with the following particulars in 1906 i was in the island of capri on september the eighth the feast of the nativity of the virgin the anniversary was duly solemnised by fireworks at nine or ten in the evening which i suppose were municipal but just after sundown the boys outside the villages were making small fires of brushwood on waste bits of ground by the wayside very pretty it looked with the flames blowing about in the twilight but what took my attention was the listlessness of the boys and their lack of interest in the proceeding a single lad the youngest would be raking the fire together and keeping it alight but the rest stood lounging about and looking in every other direction with the air of discharging mechanically a traditional office from which all zest had evaporated the pious orgy at naples on september the eighth went through the following phases when i witnessed it in 1897 it began at eight in the evening with an illumination of the faade of santa maria piedigrotta and with the whole population walking about blowing penny trumpets after four hours of this i went to bed at midnight and was lulled to sleep by barrelorgans which supersede the trumpets about that hour at four in the morning i was waked by detonations as if the british fleet were bombarding the city caused i was afterwards told by dynamite rockets the only step possible beyond this is assassination which accordingly takes place about peep of day i forget now the number of the slain but i think the average is eight or ten and i know that in honour of my presence they murdered a few more than usual the feast of the nativity of the virgin may have replaced a pagan festival the coincidence of the midsummer festival with the summer solstice implies that the founders of the festival regulated their calendar by observation of the sun it is no doubt possible that these illuminations and fireworks like the assassinations are merely the natural and spontaneous expressions of that overflowing joy with which the thought of the birth of the virgin must fill every pious heart but when we remember how often the church has skilfully decanted the new wine of christianity into the old bottles of heathendom we may be allowed to conjecture that the ecclesiastical authorities adroitly timed the nativity of the virgin so as to coincide with an old pagan festival of that day in which fire noise and uproar if not broken heads and bloodshed were conspicuous features the penny trumpets blown on this occasion recall the like melodious instruments which figure so largely in the celebration of befana the eve of epiphany at rome565 6 the halloween fires on the other hand the celts divided their year not by the solstices but by the beginning of summer the first of may and the beginning of winter the first of november from the foregoing survey we may infer that among the heathen forefathers of the european peoples the most popular and widespread firefestival of the year was the great celebration of midsummer eve or midsummer day the coincidence of the festival with the summer solstice can hardly be accidental rather we must suppose that our pagan ancestors purposely timed the ceremony of fire on earth to coincide with the arrival of the sun at the highest point of his course in the sky if that was so it follows that the old founders of the midsummer rites had observed the solstices or turningpoints of the suns apparent path in the sky and that they accordingly regulated their festal calendar to some extent by astronomical considerations the division seems to have been neither astronomical nor agricultural but pastoral being determined by the times when cattle are driven to and from their summer pasture but while this may be regarded as fairly certain for what we may call the aborigines throughout a large part of the continent it appears not to have been true of the celtic peoples who inhabited the lands end of europe the islands and promontories that stretch out into the atlantic ocean on the northwest the principal firefestivals of the celts which have survived though in a restricted area and with diminished pomp to modern times and even to our own day were seemingly timed without any reference to the position of the sun in the heaven they were two in number and fell at an interval of six months one being celebrated on the eve of may day and the other on allhallow even or halloween as it is now commonly called that is on the thirtyfirst of october the day preceding all saints or allhallows day these dates coincide with none of the four great hinges on which the solar year revolves to wit the solstices and the equinoxes nor do they agree with the principal seasons of the agricultural year the sowing in spring and the reaping in autumn for when may day comes the seed has long been committed to the earth and when november opens the harvest has long been reaped and garnered the fields lie bare the fruittrees are stripped and even the yellow leaves are fast fluttering to the ground yet the first of may and the first of november mark turningpoints of the year in europe the one ushers in the genial heat and the rich vegetation of summer the other heralds if it does not share the cold and barrenness of winter now these particular points of the year as has been well pointed out by a learned and ingenious writer566 while they are of comparatively little moment to the european husbandman do deeply concern the european herdsman for it is on the approach of summer that he drives his cattle out into the open to crop the fresh grass and it is on the approach of winter that he leads them back to the safety and shelter of the stall accordingly it seems not improbable that the celtic bisection of the year into two halves at the beginning of may and the beginning of november dates from a time when the celts were mainly a pastoral people dependent for their subsistence on their herds and when accordingly the great epochs of the year for them were the days on which the cattle went forth from the homestead in early summer and returned to it again in early winter567 even in central europe remote from the region now occupied by the celts a similar bisection of the year may be clearly traced in the great popularity on the one hand of may day and its eve walpurgis night and on the other hand of the feast of all souls at the beginning of november which under a thin christian cloak conceals an ancient pagan festival of the dead568 hence we may conjecture that everywhere throughout europe the celestial division of the year according to the solstices was preceded by what we may call a terrestrial division of the year according to the beginning of summer and the beginning of winter the two great celtic festivals beltane and halloween be that as it may the two great celtic festivals of may day and the first of november or to be more accurate the eves of these two days closely resemble each other in the manner of their celebration and in the superstitions associated with them and alike by the antique character impressed upon both betray a remote and purely pagan origin the festival of may day or beltane as the celts called it which ushered in summer has already been described569 it remains to give some account of the corresponding festival of halloween which announced the arrival of winter halloween the evening of october 31st seems to have marked the beginning of the celtic year the many forms of divination resorted to at halloween are appropriate to the beginning of a new year halloween also a festival of the dead of the two feasts halloween was perhaps of old the more important since the celts would seem to have dated the beginning of the year from it rather than from beltane in the isle of man one of the fortresses in which the celtic language and lore longest held out against the siege of the saxon invaders the first of november old style has been regarded as new years day down to recent times thus manx mummers used to go round on halloween old style singing in the manx language a sort of hogmanay song which began tonight is new years night hogunnaa570 one of sir john rhyss manx informants an old man of sixtyseven had been a farm servant from the age of sixteen till he was twentysix to the same man near regaby in the parish of andreas and he remembers his master and a near neighbour of his discussing the term new years day as applied to the first of november and explaining to the younger men that it had always been so in old times in fact it seemed to him natural enough as all tenure of land ends at that time and as all servant men begin their service then571 in ancient ireland as we saw a new fire used to be kindled every year on halloween or the eve of samhain and from this sacred flame all the fires in ireland were rekindled572 such a custom points strongly to samhain or all saints day the first of november as new years day since the annual kindling of a new fire takes place most naturally at the beginning of the year in order that the blessed influence of the fresh fire may last throughout the whole period of twelve months another confirmation of the view that the celts dated their year from the first of november is furnished by the manifold modes of divination which as we shall see presently were commonly resorted to by celtic peoples on halloween for the purpose of ascertaining their destiny especially their fortune in the coming year for when could these devices for prying into the future be more reasonably put in practice than at the beginning of the year as a season of omens and auguries halloween seems to have far surpassed beltane in the imagination of the celts from which we may with some probability infer that they reckoned their year from halloween rather than beltane another circumstance of great moment which points to the same conclusion is the association of the dead with halloween not only among the celts but throughout europe halloween the night which marks the transition from autumn to winter seems to have been of old the time of year when the souls of the departed were supposed to revisit their old homes in order to warm themselves by the fire and to comfort themselves with the good cheer provided for them in the kitchen or the parlour by their affectionate kinsfolk573 it was perhaps a natural thought that the approach of winter should drive the poor shivering hungry ghosts from the bare fields and the leafless woodlands to the shelter of the cottage with its familiar fireside574 did not the lowing kine then troop back from the summer pastures in the forests and on the hills to be fed and cared for in the stalls while the bleak winds whistled among the swaying boughs and the snow drifts deepened in the hollows and could the goodman and the goodwife deny to the spirits of their dead the welcome which they gave to the cows fairies and hobgoblins let loose at halloween but it is not only the souls of the departed who are supposed to be hovering unseen on the day when autumn to winter resigns the pale year witches then speed on their errands of mischief some sweeping through the air on besoms others galloping along the roads on tabbycats which for that evening are turned into coalblack steeds575 the fairies too are all let loose and hobgoblins of every sort roam freely about in south uist and eriskay there is a saying halloween will come will come witchcraft or divination will be set agoing fairies will be at full speed running in every pass avoid the road children children576 dancing with the fairies at halloween in cardiganshire on november eve a bogie sits on every stile577 on that night in ireland all the fairy hills are thrown wide open and the fairies swarm forth any man who is bold enough may then peep into the open green hills and see the treasures hidden in them worse than that the cave of cruachan in connaught known as the hellgate of ireland is unbarred on samhain eve or halloween and a host of horrible fiends and goblins used to rush forth particularly a flock of copperred birds which blighted crops and killed animals by their poisonous breath578 the scotch highlanders have a special name samhanach derived from samhain allhallows for the dreadful bogies that go about that night stealing babies and committing other atrocities579 and though the fairies are a kindlier folk it is dangerous to see even them at their revels on halloween a melancholy case of this sort is reported from the ferintosh district of the highlands though others say that it happened at the slope of big stones in harris two young men were coming home after nightfall on halloween each with a jar of whisky on his back when they saw as they thought a house all lit up by the roadside from which proceeded the sounds of music and dancing in reality it was not a house at all but a fairy knoll and it was the fairies who were jigging it about there so merrily but one of the young men was deceived and stepping into the house joined in the dance without even stopping to put down the jar of whisky his companion was wiser he had a shrewd suspicion that the place was not what it seemed and on entering he took the precaution of sticking a needle in the door that disarmed the power of the fairies and he got away safely well that day twelve months he came back to the spot and what should he see but his poor friend still dancing away with the jar of whisky on his back a weary man was he as you may well believe but he begged to be allowed to finish the reel which he was in the act of executing and when they took him out into the open air there was nothing of him left but skin and bones580 again the wicked fairies are apt to carry off mens wives with them to fairyland but the lost spouses can be recovered within a year and a day when the procession of the fairies is defiling past on halloween always provided that the mortals did not partake of elfin food while they were in elfinland581 guleesh and the revels of the fairies at halloween sometimes valuable information may be obtained from the fairies on halloween there was a young man named guleesh in the county of mayo near his house was a rath or old fort with a fine grass bank running round it one halloween when the darkness was falling guleesh went to the rath and stood on a gray old flag the night was calm and still there was not a breath of wind stirring nor a sound to be heard except the hum of the insects flitting past or the whistle of the plovers or the hoarse scream of the wild geese as they winged their way far overhead above the white fog the moon rose like a knob of fire in the east and a thousand thousand stars were twinkling in the sky there was a little frost in the air the grass was white and crisp and crackled under foot guleesh expected to see the fairies but they did not come hour after hour wore away and he was just bethinking him of going home to bed when his ear caught a sound far off coming towards him and he knew what it was in a moment the sound grew louder and louder at first it was like the beating of waves on a stony shore then it was like the roar of a waterfall at last it was like a mighty rushing wind in the tops of the trees then the storm burst upon the rath and sure enough the fairies were in it the rout went by so suddenly that guleesh lost his breath but he came to himself and listened the fairies were now gathered within the grassy bank of the rath and a fine uproar they made but guleesh listened with all his ears and he heard one fairy saying to another that a magic herb grew by guleeshs own door and that guleesh had nothing to do but pluck it and boil it and give it to his sweetheart the daughter of the king of france and she would be well for just then she was lying very ill guleesh took the hint and everything went as the fairy had said and he married the daughter of the king of france and they had never a cark nor a care a sickness nor a sorrow a mishap nor a misfortune to the day of their death582 divination resorted to in celtic countries at halloween in all celtic countries halloween seems to have been the great season of the year for prying into the future all kinds of divination were put in practice that night we read that dathi a king of ireland in the fifth century happening to be at the druids hill cnocnandruad in the county of sligo one halloween ordered his druid to forecast for him the future from that day till the next halloween should come round the druid passed the night on the top of the hill and next morning made a prediction to the king which came true583 in wales halloween was the weirdest of all the teir nos ysbrydion or three spirit nights when the wind blowing over the feet of the corpses bore sighs to the houses of those who were to die within the year people thought that if on that night they went out to a crossroad and listened to the wind they would learn all the most important things that would befall them during the next twelve months584 in wales too not so long ago women used to congregate in the parish churches on the night of halloween and read their fate from the flame of the candle which each of them held in her hand also they heard the names or saw the coffins of the parishioners who would die within the year and many were the sad scenes to which these gloomy visions gave rise585 and in the highlands of scotland anybody who pleased could hear proclaimed aloud the names of parishioners doomed to perish within the next twelve months if he would only take a threelegged stool and go and sit on it at three crossroads while the church clock was striking twelve at midnight on halloween it was even in his power to save the destined victims from their doom by taking with him articles of wearing apparel and throwing them away one by one as each name was called out by the mysterious voice586 halloween bonfires in the highlands of scotland john ramsays account of the halloween bonfires divination from stones at the fire halloween fires in the parishes of callander and logierait but while a glamour of mystery and awe has always clung to halloween in the minds of the celtic peasantry the popular celebration of the festival has been at least in modern times by no means of a prevailingly gloomy cast on the contrary it has been attended by picturesque features and merry pastimes which rendered it the gayest night of all the year amongst the things which in the highlands of scotland contributed to invest the festival with a romantic beauty were the bonfires which used to blaze at frequent intervals on the heights on the last day of autumn children gathered ferns tarbarrels the long thin stalks called ginisg and everything suitable for a bonfire these were placed in a heap on some eminence near the house and in the evening set fire to the fires were called samhnagan there was one for each house and it was an object of ambition who should have the biggest whole districts were brilliant with bonfires and their glare across a highland loch and from many eminences formed an exceedingly picturesque scene587 like the beltane fires on the first of may the halloween bonfires seem to have been kindled most commonly in the perthshire highlands travelling in the parish of moulin near pitlochrie in the year 1772 the englishman thomas pennant writes that hallow eve is also kept sacred as soon as it is dark a person sets fire to a bush of broom fastened round a pole and attended with a crowd runs about the village he then flings it down heaps great quantity of combustible matters on it and makes a great bonfire a whole tract is thus illuminated at the same time and makes a fine appearance588 the custom has been described more fully by a scotchman of the eighteenth century john ramsay of ochtertyre on the evening of halloween the young people of every hamlet assembled upon some eminence near the houses there they made a bonfire of ferns or other fuel cut the same day which from the feast was called samhnag or savnag a fire of rest and pleasure around it was placed a circle of stones one for each person of the families to whom they belonged and when it grew dark the bonfire was kindled at which a loud shout was set up then each person taking a torch of ferns or sticks in his hand ran round the fire exulting and sometimes they went into the adjacent fields where if there was another company they visited the bonfire taunting the others if inferior in any respect to themselves after the fire was burned out they returned home where a feast was prepared and the remainder of the evening was spent in mirth and diversions of various kinds next morning they repaired betimes to the bonfire where the situation of the stones was examined with much attention if any of them were misplaced or if the print of a foot could be discerned near any particular stone it was imagined that the person for whom it was set would not live out the year of late years this is less attended to but about the beginning of the present century it was regarded as a sure prediction the halloween fire is still kept up in some parts of the low country but on the western coast and in the isles it is never kindled though the night is spent in merriment and entertainments589 in the perthshire parish of callander which includes the now famous pass of the trossachs opening out on the winding and wooded shores of the lovely loch katrine the halloween bonfires were still kindled down to near the end of the eighteenth century when the fire had died down the ashes were carefully collected in the form of a circle and a stone was put in near the circumference for every person of the several families interested in the bonfire next morning if any of these stones was found to be displaced or injured the people made sure that the person represented by it was fey or devoted and that he could not live twelve months from that day590 in the parish of logierait which covers the beautiful valley of the tummel one of the fairest regions of all scotland the halloween fire was somewhat different faggots of heath broom and the dressings of flax were kindled and carried on poles by men who ran with them round the villages attended by a crowd as soon as one faggot was burnt out a fresh one was lighted and fastened to the pole numbers of these blazing faggots were often carried about together and when the night happened to be dark they formed a splendid illumination591 halloween fires on loch tay halloween fires at balquhidder nor did the halloween fires die out in perthshire with the end of the eighteenth century journeying from dunkeld to aberfeldy on halloween in the first half of the nineteenth century sheriff barclay counted thirty fires blazing on the hill tops and saw the figures of the people dancing like phantoms round the flames592 again in 1860 i was residing near the head of loch tay during the season of the halloween feast for several days before halloween boys and youths collected wood and conveyed it to the most prominent places on the hill sides in their neighbourhood some of the heaps were as large as a cornstack or hayrick after dark on halloween these heaps were kindled and for several hours both sides of loch tay were illuminated as far as the eye could see i was told by old men that at the beginning of this century men as well as boys took part in getting up the bonfires and that when the fire was ablaze all joined hands and danced round the fire and made a great noise but that as these gatherings generally ended in drunkenness and rough and dangerous fun the ministers set their faces against the observance and were seconded in their efforts by the more intelligent and wellbehaved in the community and so the practice was discontinued by adults and relegated to school boys593 at balquhidder down to the latter part of the nineteenth century each household kindled its bonfire at halloween but the custom was chiefly observed by children the fires were lighted on any high knoll near the house there was no dancing round them594 halloween fires in buchan to burn the witches processions with torches at halloween in the braemar highlands halloween fires were also lighted in some districts of the northeast of scotland such as buchan villagers and farmers alike must have their fire in the villages the boys went from house to house and begged a peat from each householder usually with the words ges a peat t burn the witches in some villages the lads collected the peats in a cart some of them drawing it along and the others receiving the peats and loading them on the cart along with the peats they accumulated straw furze potato haulm everything that would burn quickly and when they had got enough they piled it all in a heap and set it on fire then each of the youths one after another laid himself down on the ground as near to the fire as he could without being scorched and thus lying allowed the smoke to roll over him the others ran through the smoke and jumped over their prostrate comrade when the heap was burned down they scattered the ashes each one took a share in this part of the ceremony giving a kick first with the right foot and then with the left and each vied with the other who should scatter the most after that some of them still continued to run through the scattered ashes and to pelt each other with the halfburned peats at each farm a spot as high as possible not too near the steading was chosen for the fire and the proceedings were much the same as at the village bonfire the lads of one farm when their own fire was burned down and the ashes scattered sometimes went to a neighbouring fire and helped to kick the ashes about595 referring to this part of scotland a writer at the end of the eighteenth century observes that the halloweven fire another relict of druidism was kindled in buchan various magic ceremonies were then celebrated to counteract the influence of witches and demons and to prognosticate to the young their success or disappointment in the matrimonial lottery these being devoutly finished the hallow fire was kindled and guarded by the male part of the family societies were formed either by pique or humour to scatter certain fires and the attack and defence were often conducted with art and with fury596 down to about the middle of the nineteenth century the braemar highlanders made the circuit of their fields with lighted torches at halloween to ensure their fertility in the coming year at that date the custom was as follows every member of the family in those days households were larger than they are now was provided with a bundle of fir canles with which to go the round the father and mother stood at the hearth and lit the splints in the peat fire which they passed to the children and servants who trooped out one after the other and proceeded to tread the bounds of their little property going slowly round at equal distances apart and invariably with the sun to go withershins seems to have been reserved for cursing and excommunication when the fields had thus been circumambulated the remaining spills were thrown together in a heap and allowed to burn out597 divination at halloween in the highlands and lowlands of scotland the stolen kail sowing hemp seed the winnowing basket the wet shirt the thrown shoe in the highlands of scotland as the evening of halloween wore on young people gathered in one of the houses and resorted to an almost endless variety of games or rather forms of divination for the purpose of ascertaining the future fate of each member of the company were they to marry or remain single was the marriage to take place that year or never who was to be married first what sort of husband or wife she or he was to get the name the trade the colour of the hair the amount of property of the future spousethese were questions that were eagerly canvassed and the answers to them furnished neverfailing entertainment598 nor were these modes of divination at halloween confined to the highlands where the bonfires were kindled they were practised with equal faith and in practically the same forms in the lowlands as we learn for example from burnss poem halloween which describes the auguries drawn from a variety of omens by the ayrshire peasantry these lowlanders of saxon descent may well have inherited the rites from the celts who preceded them in the possession of the south country a common practice at halloween was to go out stealthily to a neighbours kailyard and there with shut eyes to pull up the first kail stock that came to hand it was necessary that the plants should be stolen without the knowledge or consent of their owner otherwise they were quite useless for the purpose of divination strictly speaking too the neighbour upon whose garden the raid was made should be unmarried whether a bachelor or a spinster the stolen kail was taken home and examined and according to its height shape and features would be the height shape and features of the future husband or wife the taste of the custock that is the heart of the stem was an infallible indication of his or her temper and a clod of earth adhering to the root signified in proportion to its size the amount of property which he or she would bring to the common stock then the kailstock or runt as it was called in ayrshire was placed over the lintel of the door and the baptismal name of the young man or woman who first entered the door after the kail was in position would be the baptismal name of the husband or wife599 again young women sowed hemp seed over nine ridges of ploughed land saying i sow hemp seed and he who is to be my husband let him come and harrow it on looking back over her left shoulder the girl would see the figure of her future mate behind her in the darkness in the northeast of scotland lint seed was used instead of hemp seed and answered the purpose quite as well600 again a mode of ascertaining your future husband or wife was this take a clue of blue yarn and go to a limekiln throw the clue into the kiln but keep one end of the thread in your hand and wind it on to another clue as you come near the end somebody or something will hold the other end tight in the kiln then you call out who holds giving the thread at the same time a gentle pull some one or something will thereupon pull the other end of the thread and a voice will mention the name of your future husband or wife601 another way is this go to the barn alone and secretly be sure to open both doors and if possible take them off their hinges for if the being who is about to appear should catch you in the barn and clap the doors to on you he or she might do you a mischief having done this take the sieve or winnowingbasket which in lowland scotch is called a wecht or waicht and go through the action of winnowing corn repeat it thrice and at the third time the apparition of your future husband or wife will pass through the barn entering at the windy door and passing out at the other602 or this go to a southward running stream where the lands of three lairds meet or to a ford where the dead and living have crossed dip the left sleeve of your shirt in the water then go home take off the shirt hang it up before a fire to dry and go to bed taking care that the bed stands so that you can see your shirt hanging before the fire keep awake and at midnight you will see the form of your future spouse come into the room and turn the other side of the sleeve to the fire to dry it603 a highland form of divination at halloween is to take a shoe by the tip and throw it over the house then observe the direction in which the toe points as it lies on the ground on the other side for in that direction you are destined to go before long if the shoe should fall sole uppermost it is very unlucky for you604 the white of eggs in water the names on the chimney piece the nuts in the fire the milk and meal the apples in the water the three plates these ways of prying into the future are practised outside of the house others are observed in the kitchen or the parlour before the cheerful blaze of the fire thus the white of eggs dropped in a glass of pure water indicates by certain marks how many children a person will have the impatience and clamour of the children eager to ascertain the exact number of their future progeny often induced the housewife to perform this ceremony for them by daylight and the kindly mother standing with her face to the window dropping the white of an egg into a crystal glass of clean water and surrounded by a group of children intently watching her proceedings made up a pretty picture605 when the fun of the evening had fairly commenced the names of eligible or likely matches were written on the chimneypiece and the young man who wished to try his fortune was led up blindfolded to the list whatever name he put his finger on would prove that of his future wife606 again two nuts representing a lad and a lass whose names were announced to the company were put side by side in the fire if they burned quietly together the pair would be man and wife and from the length of time they burned and the brightness of the flame the length and happiness of the married life of the two were augured but if instead of burning together one of the nuts leaped away from the other then there would be no marriage and the blame would rest with the person whose nut had thus started away by itself607 again a dish of milk and meal in gaelic fuarag in lowland scotch crowdie or of beat potatoes was made and a ring was hidden in it spoons were served out to the company who supped the contents of the dish hastily with them and the one who got the ring would be the first to be married608 again apples and a silver sixpence were put in a tub of water the apples naturally floated on the top and the sixpence sank to the bottom whoever could lift an apple or the sixpence from the water with his mouth without using his teeth was counted very lucky and got the prize to himself609 again three plates or basins were placed on the hearth one was filled with clean water another with dirty water and the third was empty the enquirer was blindfolded knelt in front of the hearth and groped about till he put his finger in one of them if he lighted on the plate with the clean water he would wed a maid if on the plate with the dirty water he would marry a widow and if on the empty plate he would remain a bachelor for a girl the answer of the oracle was analogous she would marry a bachelor a widower or nobody according to the plate into which she chanced to dip her finger but to make sure the operation had to be repeated thrice the position of the plates being changed each time if the enquirer put his or her finger into the same plate thrice or even twice it was quite conclusive610 the sliced apple the white of egg in water the salt cake or salt herring these forms of divination in the house were practised by the company in a body but the following had to be performed by the person alone you took an apple and stood with it in your hand in front of a lookingglass then you sliced the apple stuck each slice on the point of the knife and held it over your left shoulder while you looked into the glass and combed your hair the spectre of your future husband would then appear in the mirror stretching forth his hand to take the slices of the apple over your shoulder some say that the number of slices should be nine that you should eat the first eight yourself and only throw the ninth over your left shoulder for your husband also that at each slice you should say in the name of the father and the son611 again take an egg prick it with a pin and let the white drop into a wineglass nearly full of water take some of this in your mouth and go out for a walk the first name you hear called out aloud will be that of your future husband or wife an old woman told a lady that she had tried this mode of divination in her youth that the name of archibald came up as it were from the very ground and that archibald sure enough was the name of her husband612 in south uist and eriskay two of the outer hebrides a salt cake called bonnach salainn is eaten at halloween to induce dreams that will reveal the future it is baked of common meal with a great deal of salt after eating it you may not drink water nor utter a word not even to say your prayers a salt herring eaten bones and all in three bites is equally efficacious always provided that you drink no water and hold your tongue613 halloween fires in wales omens drawn from stones thrown into the fire divination by stones in the ashes in the northern part of wales it used to be customary for every family to make a great bonfire called coel coeth on halloween the fire was kindled on the most conspicuous spot near the house and when it had nearly gone out everyone threw into the ashes a white stone which he had first marked then having said their prayers round the fire they went to bed next morning as soon as they were up they came to search out the stones and if any one of them was found to be missing they had a notion that the person who threw it would die before he saw another halloween614 a writer on wales at the beginning of the nineteenth century says that the autumnal fire is still kindled in north wales being on the eve of the first day of november and is attended by many ceremonies such as running through the fire and smoke each casting a stone into the fire and all running off at the conclusion to escape from the black shorttailed sow then supping upon parsnips nuts and apples catching up an apple suspended by a string with the mouth alone and the same by an apple in a tub of water each throwing a nut into the fire and those that burn bright betoken prosperity to the owners through the following year but those that burn black and crackle denote misfortune on the following morning the stones are searched for in the fire and if any be missing they betide ill to those who threw them in615 according to sir john rhys the habit of celebrating halloween by lighting bonfires on the hills is perhaps not yet extinct in wales and men still living can remember how the people who assisted at the bonfires would wait till the last spark was out and then would suddenly take to their heels shouting at the top of their voices the cropped black sow seize the hindmost the saying as sir john rhys justly remarks implies that originally one of the company became a victim in dead earnest down to the present time the saying is current in carnarvonshire where allusions to the cutty black sow are still occasionally made to frighten children616 we can now understand why in lower brittany every person throws a pebble into the midsummer bonfire617 doubtless there as in wales and the highlands of scotland618 omens of life and death have at one time or other been drawn from the position and state of the pebbles on the morning of all saints day the custom thus found among three separate branches of the celtic stock probably dates from a period before their dispersion or at least from a time when alien races had not yet driven home the wedges of separation between them divination as to love and marriage at halloween in wales in wales as in scotland halloween was also the great season for forecasting the future in respect of love and marriage and some of the forms of divination employed for this purpose resembled those which were in use among the scotch peasantry two girls for example would make a little ladder of yarn without breaking it from the ball and having done so they would throw it out of the window then one of the girls holding the ball in her hand would wind the yarn back repeating a rhyme in welsh this she did thrice and as she wound the yarn she would see her future husband climbing up the little ladder again three bowls or basins were placed on a table one of them contained clean water one dirty water and one was empty the girls of the household and sometimes the boys too then eagerly tried their fortunes they were blindfolded led up to the table and dipped their hands into a bowl if they happened to dip into the clean water they would marry maidens or bachelors if into the dirty water they would be widowers or widows if into the empty bowl they would live unmarried again if a girl walking backwards would place a knife among the leeks on halloween she would see her future husband come and pick up the knife and throw it into the middle of the garden619 divination at halloween in ireland in ireland the halloween bonfires would seem to have died out but the halloween divination has survived writing towards the end of the eighteenth century general vallancey tells us that on halloween or the vigil of saman as he calls it the peasants in ireland assemble with sticks and clubs the emblems of laceration going from house to house collecting money breadcake butter cheese eggs etc etc for the feast repeating verses in honour of the solemnity demanding preparations for the festival in the name of st columb kill desiring them to lay aside the fatted calf and to bring forth the black sheep the good women are employed in making the griddle cake and candles these last are sent from house to house in the vicinity and are lighted up on the saman next day before which they pray or are supposed to pray for the departed souls of the donor every house abounds in the best viands they can afford apples and nuts are devoured in abundance the nutshells are burnt and from the ashes many strange things are foretold cabbages are torn up by the root hemp seed is sown by the maidens and they believe that if they look back they will see the apparition of the man intended for their future spouse they hang a smock before the fire on the close of the feast and sit up all night concealed in a corner of the room convinced that his apparition will come down the chimney and turn the smock they throw a ball of yarn out of the window and wind it on the reel within convinced that if they repeat the pater noster backwards and look at the ball of yarn without they will then also see his sith or apparition they dip for apples in a tub of water and endeavour to bring one up in the mouth they suspend a cord with a crossstick with apples at one point and candles lighted at the other and endeavour to catch the apple while it is in a circular motion in the mouth these and many other superstitious ceremonies the remains of druidism are observed on this holiday which will never be eradicated while the name of saman is permitted to remain620 divination at halloween in queens county divination at halloween in county leitrim divination at halloween in county roscommon in queens county ireland down to the latter part of the nineteenth century children practised various of these rites of divination on halloween girls went out into the garden blindfold and pulled up cabbages if the cabbage was well grown the girl would have a handsome husband but if it had a crooked stalk the future spouse would be a stingy old man nuts again were placed in pairs on the bar of the fire and from their behaviour omens were drawn of the fate in love and marriage of the couple whom they represented lead also was melted and allowed to drop into a tub of cold water and from the shapes which it assumed in the water predictions were made to the children of their future destiny again apples were bobbed for in a tub of water and brought up with the teeth or a stick was hung from a hook with an apple at one end and a candle at the other and the stick being made to revolve you made a bite at the apple and sometimes got a mouthful of candle instead621 in county leitrim also down to near the end of the nineteenth century various forms of divination were practised at halloween girls ascertained the character of their future husbands by the help of cabbages just as in queens county again if a girl found a branch of a briarthorn which had bent over and grown into the ground so as to form a loop she would creep through the loop thrice late in the evening in the devils name then cut the briar and put it under her pillow all without speaking a word then she would lay her head on the pillow and dream of the man she was to marry boys also would dream in like manner of love and marriage at halloween if only they would gather ten leaves of ivy without speaking throw away one and put the other nine under their pillow again divination was practised by means of a cake called barmbreac in which a nut and a ring were baked whoever got the ring would be married first whoever got the nut would marry a widow or a widower but if the nut were an empty shell he or she would remain unwed again a girl would take a clue of worsted go to a lime kiln in the gloaming and throw the clew into the kiln in the devils name while she held fast the other end of the thread then she would rewind the thread and ask who holds my clue and the name of her future husband would come up from the depth of the kiln another way was to take a rake go to a rick and walk round it nine times saying i rake this rick in the devils name at the ninth time the wraith of your destined partner for life would come and take the rake out of your hand once more before the company separated for the night they would rake the ashes smooth on the hearth and search them next morning for tracks from which they judged whether anybody should come to the house or leave it or die in it before another year was out622 in county roscommon which borders on county leitrim a cake is made in nearly every house on halloween and a ring a coin a sloe and a chip of wood are put into it whoever gets the coin will be rich whoever gets the ring will be married first whoever gets the chip of wood which stands for a coffin will die first and whoever gets the sloe will live longest because the fairies blight the sloes in the hedges on halloween so that the sloe in the cake will be the last of the year again on the same mystic evening girls take nine grains of oats in their mouths and going out without speaking walk about till they hear a mans name pronounced it will be the name of their future husband in county roscommon too on halloween there is the usual dipping in water for apples or sixpences and the usual bites at a revolving apple and tallow candle623 halloween fires in the isle of man divination at halloween in the isle of man in the isle of man also another celtic country halloween was celebrated down to modern times by the kindling of fires accompanied with all the usual ceremonies designed to prevent the baneful influence of fairies and witches bands of young men perambulated the island by night and at the door of every dwellinghouse they struck up a manx rhyme beginning noght oie howney hopdynaw that is to say this is hollantide eve for hollantide is the manx way of expressing the old english all hallowen tide that is all saints day the first of november but as the people reckon this festival according to the old style hollantide in the isle of man is our twelfth of november the native manx name for the day is sauin or laa houney potatoes parsnips and fish pounded up together and mixed with butter formed the proper evening meal mrastyr on halloween in the isle of man624 here too as in scotland forms of divination are practised by some people on this important evening for example the housewife fills a thimble full of salt for each member of the family and each guest the contents of the thimblefuls are emptied out in as many neat little piles on a plate and left there over night next morning the piles are examined and if any of them has fallen down he or she whom it represents will die within the year again the women carefully sweep out the ashes from under the fireplace and flatten them down neatly on the open hearth if they find next morning a footprint turned towards the door it signifies a death in the family within the year but if the footprint is turned in the opposite direction it bodes a marriage again divination by eavesdropping is practised in the isle of man in much the same way as in scotland you go out with your mouth full of water and your hands full of salt and listen at a neighbours door and the first name you hear will be the name of your husband again manx maids bandage their eyes and grope about the room till they dip their hands in vessels full of clean or dirty water and so on and from the thing they touch they draw corresponding omens but some people in the isle of man observe these auguries not on halloween or hollantide eve as they call it which was the old manx new years eve but on the modern new years eve that is on the thirtyfirst of december the change no doubt marks a transition from the ancient to the modern mode of dating the beginning of the year625 halloween fires and divination in lancashire candles lighted to keep off the witches divination at halloween in northumberland halloween fires in france in lancashire also some traces of the old celtic celebration of halloween have been reported in modern times it is said that fires are still lighted in lancashire on halloween under the name of beltains or teanlas and even such cakes as the jews are said to have made in honour of the queen of heaven are yet to be found at this season amongst the inhabitants of the banks of the ribble both the fires and the cakes however are now connected with superstitious notions respecting purgatory etc626 on halloween too the lancashire maiden strews the ashes which are to take the form of one or more letters of her lovers name she throws hempseed over her shoulder and timidly glances to see who follows her627 again witches in lancashire used to gather on halloween at the malkin tower a ruined and desolate farmhouse in the forest of pendle they assembled for no good purpose but you could keep the infernal rout at bay by carrying a lighted candle about the fells from eleven to twelve oclock at night the witches tried to blow out the candle and if they succeeded so much the worse for you but if the flame burned steadily till the clocks had struck midnight you were safe some people performed the ceremony by deputy and parties went about from house to house in the evening collecting candles one for each inmate and offering their services to late or leet the witches as the phrase ran this custom was practised at longridge fell in the early part of the nineteenth century628 in northumberland on halloween omens of marriage were drawn from nuts thrown into the fire and the sports of ducking for apples and biting at a revolving apple and lighted candle were also practised on that evening629 the equivalent of the halloween bonfires is reported also from france we are told that in the department of deuxsvres which forms part of the old province of poitou young people used to assemble in the fields on all saints day the first of november and kindle great fires of ferns thorns leaves and stubble at which they roasted chestnuts they also danced round the fires and indulged in noisy pastimes630 7 the midwinter fires a midwinter festival of fire christmas the continuation of an old heathen festival of the sun if the heathen of ancient europe celebrated as we have good reason to believe the season of midsummer with a great festival of fire of which the traces have survived in many places down to our own time it is natural to suppose that they should have observed with similar rites the corresponding season of midwinter for midsummer and midwinter or in more technical language the summer solstice and the winter solstice are the two great turningpoints in the suns apparent course through the sky and from the standpoint of primitive man nothing might seem more appropriate than to kindle fires on earth at the two moments when the fire and heat of the great luminary in heaven begin to wane or to wax in this way the savage philosopher to whose meditations on the nature of things we owe many ancient customs and ceremonies might easily imagine that he helped the labouring sun to relight his dying lamp or at all events to blow up the flame into a brighter blaze certain it is that the winter solstice which the ancients erroneously assigned to the twentyfifth of december was celebrated in antiquity as the birthday of the sun and that festal lights or fires were kindled on this joyful occasion our christmas festival is nothing but a continuation under a christian name of this old solar festivity for the ecclesiastical authorities saw fit about the end of the third or the beginning of the fourth century arbitrarily to transfer the nativity of christ from the sixth of january to the twentyfifth of december for the purpose of diverting to their lord the worship which the heathen had hitherto paid on that day to the sun631 the yule log is the midwinter counterpart of the midsummer bonfire in modern christendom the ancient firefestival of the winter solstice appears to survive or to have survived down to recent years in the old custom of the yule log clog or block as it was variously called in england632 the custom was widespread in europe but seems to have flourished especially in england france and among the south slavs at least the fullest accounts of the custom come from these quarters that the yule log was only the winter counterpart of the midsummer bonfire kindled within doors instead of in the open air on account of the cold and inclement weather of the season was pointed out long ago by our english antiquary john brand633 and the view is supported by the many quaint superstitions attaching to the yule log superstitions which have no apparent connexion with christianity but carry their heathen origin plainly stamped upon them but while the two solstitial celebrations were both festivals of fire the necessity or desirability of holding the winter celebration within doors lent it the character of a private or domestic festivity which contrasts strongly with the publicity of the summer celebration at which the people gathered on some open space or conspicuous height kindled a huge bonfire in common and danced and made merry round it together the yule log in germany the yule log in switzerland among the germans the custom of the yule log is known to have been observed in the eleventh century for in the year 1184 the parish priest of ahlen in mnsterland spoke of bringing a tree to kindle the festal fire at the lords nativity634 down to about the middle of the nineteenth century the old rite was kept up in some parts of central germany as we learn from an account of it given by a contemporary writer after mentioning the custom of feeding the cattle and shaking the fruittrees on christmas night to make them bear fruit he goes on as follows other customs pointing back to the faroff times of heathendom may still be met with among the oldfashioned peasants of the mountain regions such is in the valleys of the sieg and lahn the practice of laying a new log as a foundation of the hearth a heavy block of oakwood generally a stump grubbed up from the ground is fitted either into the floor of the hearth or into a niche made for the purpose in the wall under the hook on which the kettle hangs when the fire on the hearth glows this block of wood glows too but it is so placed that it is hardly reduced to ashes within a year when the new foundation is laid the remains of the old block are carefully taken out ground to powder and strewed over the fields during the twelve nights this so people fancied promotes the fruitfulness of the years crops635 in some parts of the eifel mountains to the west of coblentz a log of wood called the christbrand used to be placed on the hearth on christmas eve and the charred remains of it on twelfth night were put in the cornbin to keep the mice from devouring the corn636 at weidenhausen and girkshausen in westphalia the practice was to withdraw the yule log christbrand from the fire so soon as it was slightly charred it was then kept carefully to be replaced on the fire whenever a thunderstorm broke because the people believed that lightning would not strike a house in which the yule log was smouldering637 in some villages near berleburg in westphalia the old custom was to tie up the yule log in the last sheaf cut at harvest638 on christmas eve the peasantry of the oberland in meiningen a province of central germany used to put a great block of wood called the christklots on the fire before they went to bed it should burn all night and the charred remains were believed to guard the house for the whole year against the risk of fire burglary and other misfortunes639 the yule log seems to be known only in the frenchspeaking parts of switzerland where it goes by the usual french name of bche de nol in the jura mountains of the canton of bern while the log is burning on the hearth the people sing a blessing over it as follows may the log burn may all good come in may the women have children and the sheep lambs white bread for every one and the vat full of wine the embers of the yule log were kept carefully for they were believed to be a protection against lightning640 the yule log in belgium the christmas fires which were formerly lit everywhere in the low countries have fallen into disuse but in flanders a great log of wood called the kersavondblok and usually cut from the roots of a fir or a beech is still put on the fire all the lights in the house are extinguished and the whole family gathers round the log to spend part of the night in singing in telling stories especially about ghosts werewolves and so on and also in drinking gin at grammont and in the neighbourhood of that town where the yule log is called kersmismot it is customary to set fire to the remainder of the gin at the moment when the log is reduced to ashes elsewhere a piece of the log is kept and put under the bed to protect the house against thunder and lightning the charcoal of the log which burned during christmas night if pounded up and mixed with water is a cure for consumption in the country of limburg the log burns several nights and the pounded charcoal is kept as a preventive so they say of toothache641 the yule log in france in several provinces of france and particularly in provence the custom of the yule log or trfoir as it was called in many places was long observed a french writer of the seventeenth century tells us that on christmas eve the log was prepared and when the whole family had assembled in the kitchen or parlour of the house they went and brought it in walking in procession and singing provenal verses to the following effect let the log rejoice tomorrow is the day of bread let all good enter here let the women bear children let the shegoats bring forth kids let the ewes drop lambs let there be much wheat and flour and the vat full of wine then the log was blessed by the smallest and youngest child of the house who poured a glass of wine over it saying in nomine patris etc after which the log was set on the fire the charcoal of the burnt wood was kept the whole year and used as an ingredient in several remedies642 french superstitions as to the yule log amongst the superstitions denounced by the same writer is the belief that a log called the trefoir or christmas brand which you put on the fire for the first time on christmas eve and continue to put on the fire for a little while every day till twelfth night can if kept under the bed protect the house for a whole year from fire and thunder that it can prevent the inmates from having chilblains on their heels in winter that it can cure the cattle of many maladies that if a piece of it be steeped in the water which cows drink it helps them to calve and lastly that if the ashes of the log be strewn on the fields it can save the wheat from mildew643 the yule log at marseilles and in perigord virtues ascribed to the charcoal and ashes of the burnt log the yule log in berry in marseilles the yule log used to be a great block of oak which went by the name of calendeau or calignau it was sprinkled with wine and oil and the head of the house kindled it himself644 the yule log plays a great part at the festival of the winter solstice in perigord the countryman thinks that it is best made of plumtree cherry or oak and that the larger it is the better if it burns well it is a good omen the blessing of heaven rests upon it the charcoal and ashes which are collected very carefully are excellent for healing swollen glands the part of the trunk which has not been burnt in the fire is used by ploughmen to make the wedge tcoin ou cale for their plough because they allege that it causes the seeds to thrive better and the women keep pieces of it till twelfth night for the sake of their chickens nevertheless if you sit down on the log you become subject to boils and to cure yourself of them you must pass nine times under a bramble branch which happens to be rooted in the ground at both ends the charcoal heals sheep of a disease called the goumon and the ashes carefully wrapt up in white linen preserve the whole household from accidents some people think that they will have as many chickens as there are sparks that fly out of the brands of the log when they shake them and others place the extinct brands under the bed to drive away vermin in vienne on christmas eve when supper is over the master of the house has a great logthe christmas brandbrought in and then surrounded by all the spectators gathered in profound silence he sprinkles salt and water on the log it is then put on the fire to burn during the three festivals but they carefully preserve a piece to be kindled every time that it thunders645 in berry a district of central france the yule log was called the cosse de nau the last word being an abbreviation of the usual french word for christmas nol it consisted of an enormous treetrunk so heavy that the united strength of several men was needed to carry it in and place it on the hearth where it served to feed the fire during the three days of the christmas festivity strictly speaking it should be the trunk of an old oaktree which had never been lopped and had been felled at midnight it was placed on the hearth at the moment when the tinkle of the bell announced the elevation of the host at the midnight mass and the head of the family after sprinkling it with holy water set it on fire the remains of the log were preserved till the same day next year they were kept under the bed of the master of the house and whenever thunder was heard one of the family would take a piece of the log and throw it on the fire which was believed to guard the family against lightning in the middle ages we are told several fiefs were granted on condition that the vassal should bring in person a yule log every year for the hearth of his liege lord646 the yule log in normandy and brittany similar customs and beliefs survived till recent years in some of the remote country villages of the picturesque district known as the bocage of normandy there it was the grandfather or other oldest man of the family who chose the yule log in good time and had it ready for christmas eve then he placed it on the hearth at the moment when the church bell began to ring for the evening service kneeling reverently at the hearth with the members of his family in a like attitude of devotion the old man recited three pater nosters and three aves and invoked the blessing of heaven on the log and on the cottage then at the sound of the bell which proclaimed the sacrament of the mass or if the church was too far off to allow the tinkle of the bell to be heard at the moment when they judged that the priest was elevating the host before the high altar the patriarch sprinkled the burning log with holy water blessed it in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost and drew it out of the fire the charred log was then carefully kept till the following christmas as a precious relic which would guard the house against the levin bolt evil spirits sorcerers and every misfortune that might befall in the course of the year647 in the department of orne the yulelog is called trefouet holy water is poured on it it should last the three days of the festival and the remains of it are kept to be put on the fire when it thunders this brand is a protection both against thunder and against sorcerers648 in upper brittany also the yule log is thought to be a safeguard against thunder and lightning it is sprinkled with holy water on christmas morning and allowed to burn till evening if a piece of it is thrown into the well it will ensure a supply of good water649 the yule log in the ardennes in almost all the families of the ardennes we are told at the present day they never fail to put the yule log on the fireplace but formerly it was the object of a superstitious worship which is now obsolete the charred remains of it placed under the pillow or under the house preserved the house from storms and before it was burned the virgin used to come and sit on it invisible swaddling the infant jesus at nouzon twenty years ago the traditional log was brought into the kitchen on christmas eve and the grandmother with a sprig of box in her hand sprinkled the log with holy water as soon as the clock struck the first stroke of midnight as she did so she chanted when christmas comes every one should rejoice for it is a new covenant following the grandmother and joining in the song the children and the rest of the family marched thrice round the log which was as fine a log as could be got650 we can now perhaps understand why in perigord people who sat on the yule log suffered from boils651 and why in lorraine young folks used to be warned that if they sat on it they would have the scab652 the reason probably was that the virgin and child were supposed to be seated invisible upon the log and to resent the indignity of contact with mortal children the yule log in the vosges the yule log in franchecomt and burgundy on christmas eve the mountaineers of rupt in the vosges also never fail to put on the hearth the largest log which the hearth can hold they call it la galeuche de no that is the yule log next morning they rake the ashes for any charred fragments and keep them as valuable talismans to guard them against the stroke of lightning at vagney and other places near it in the vosges it used to be customary on the same evening to grease the hinges and the latches of the doors that no harsh grating sound should break the slumbers of the infant christ in the vosges mountains too as indeed in many other places cattle acquired the gift of speech on christmas eve and conversed with each other in the language of christians their conversation was indeed most instructive for the future it seems had no secret worth mentioning for them yet few people cared to be caught eavesdropping at the byre wise folk contented themselves with setting a good store of fodder in the manger then shut the door and left the animals to their ruminations a farmer of vecoux once hid in a corner of the byre to overhear the edifying talk of the beasts but it did him little good for one ox said to another ox what shall we do tomorrow and the other replied we shall carry our master to the churchyard sure enough the farmer died that very night and was buried next morning653 in franchecomt the province of france to the west of the jura mountains if the yule log is really to protect a house against thunder and lightning it is essential that it should burn during the midnight mass and that the flame should not go out before the divine service is concluded otherwise the log is quite useless for the purpose654 in burgundy the log which is placed on the fire on christmas eve is called the suche while it is burning the father of the family assisted by his wife and children sings christmas carols and when he has finished he tells the smallest children to go into a corner of the room and pray god that the log may give them sweeties the prayer is invariably answered655 the yule log and the yule candle in england in england the customs and beliefs concerning the yule log clog or block as it was variously called used to be similar on the night of christmas eve says the antiquary john brand our ancestors were wont to light up candles of an uncommon size called christmas candles and lay a log of wood upon the fire called a yuleclog or christmasblock to illuminate the house and as it were to turn night into day this custom is in some measure still kept up in the north of england in the buttery of st johns college oxford an ancient candlesocket of stone still remains ornamented with the figure of the holy lamb it was formerly used to burn the christmas candle in on the high table at supper during the twelve nights of that festival656 a tall mould candle called a yule candle is lighted and set on the table these candles are presented by the chandlers and grocers to their customers the yulelog is bought of the carpenters lads it would be unlucky to light either of them before the time or to stir the fire or candle during the supper the candle must not be snuffed neither must any one stir from the table till supper is ended in these suppers it is considered unlucky to have an odd number at table a fragment of the log is occasionally saved and put under a bed to remain till next christmas it secures the house from fire a small piece of it thrown into a fire occurring at the house of a neighbour will quell the raging flame a piece of the candle should likewise be kept to ensure good luck657 in the seventeenth century as we learn from some verses of herrick the english custom was to light the yule log with a fragment of its predecessor which had been kept throughout the year for the purpose where it was so kept the fiend could do no mischief658 indeed the practice of preserving a piece of the yulelog of one year to light that of the next was observed by at least one family at cheadle in staffordshire down to the latter part of the nineteenth century659 the yulelog in yorkshire the yule log in lincolnshire the yule log in warwickshire shropshire and herefordshire the yule log in wales in the north of england farmservants used to lay by a large knotty block of wood for the christmas fire and so long as the block lasted they were entitled by custom to ale at their meals the log was as large as the hearth could hold660 at belford in northumberland the lord of the manor sends round to every house on the afternoon of christmas eve the yule logsfour or five large logsto be burnt on christmas eve and day this old custom has always i am told been kept up here661 the custom of burning the yule log at christmas used to be observed in wensleydale and other parts of yorkshire and prudent housewives carefully preserved pieces of the log throughout the year at whitby the portions so kept were stowed away under the bed till next christmas when they were burnt with the new log in the interval they were believed to protect the house from conflagration and if one of them were thrown into the fire it would quell a raging storm662 the practice and the belief were similar at filey on the coast of yorkshire where besides the yule log a tall yule candle was lit on the same evening663 in the west riding while the log blazed cheerfully the people quaffed their ale and sang yule yule a pack of new cards and a christmas stool664 at clee in lincolnshire when christmas eve has come the yule cake is duly cut and the yule log lit and i know of some even middleclass houses where the new log must always rest upon and be lighted by the old one a small portion of which has been carefully stored away to preserve a continuity of light and heat665 at the village of wootton wawen in warwickshire down to 1759 at least the yuleblock as it was called was drawn into the house by a horse on christmas eve as a foundation for the fire on christmas day and according to the superstition of those times for the twelve days following as the said block was not to be entirely reduced to ashes till that time had passed by666 as late as 1830 or thereabout the scene of lighting the hearthfire on christmas eve to continue burning throughout the christmas season might have been witnessed in the secluded and beautiful hillcountry of west shropshire from chirbury and worthen to pulverbatch and pontesbury the christmas brand or brund as they called it was a great trunk of seasoned oak holly yew or crabtree drawn by horses to the farmhouse door and thence rolled by means of rollers and levers to the back of the wide open hearth where the fire was made up in front of it the embers were raked up to it every night and it was carefully tended that it might not go out during the whole christmas season all those days no light might be struck given or borrowed such was the custom at worthen in the early part of the nineteenth century667 in herefordshire the christmas feast lasted for twelve days and no work was done all houses were and are now decorated with sprigs of holly and ivy which must not be brought in until christmas eve a yule log as large as the open hearth could accommodate was brought into the kitchen of each farmhouse and smaller ones were used in the cottages w p said he had seen a tree drawn into the kitchen at kingstone grange years ago by two cart horses when it had been consumed a small portion was carefully kept to be used for lighting next years log mother always kept it very carefully she said it was lucky and kept the house from fire and from lightning it seems to have been the general practice to light it on christmas eve668 in many parts of wales it is still customary to keep part of the yulelog until the following christmas eve for luck it is then put into the fireplace and burnt but before it is consumed the new log is put on and thus the old fire and the new burn together in some families this is done from force of habit and they cannot now tell why they do it but in the past the observance of this custom was to keep witches away and doubtless was a survival of fireworship669 the yule log in servia the cutting of the oak tree to form the yule log but nowhere apparently in europe is the old heathen ritual of the yule log preserved to the present day more perfectly than in servia at early dawn on christmas eve badnyi dan every peasant house sends two of its strongest young men to the nearest forest to cut down a young oak tree and bring it home there after offering up a short prayer or crossing themselves thrice they throw a handful of wheat on the chosen oak and greet it with the words happy badnyi day to you then they cut it down taking care that it shall fall towards the east at the moment when the suns orb appears over the rim of the eastern horizon should the tree fall towards the west it would be the worst possible omen for the house and its inmates in the ensuing year and it is also an evil omen if the tree should be caught and stopped in its fall by another tree it is important to keep and carry home the first chip from the fallen oak the trunk is sawn into two or three logs one of them rather longer than the others a flat unleavened cake of the purest wheaten flour is brought out of the house and broken on the larger of the logs by a woman the logs are left for the present to stand outside leaning on one of the walls of the house each of them is called a yule log badnyak prayers to colleda meanwhile the children and young people go from house to house singing special songs called colleda because of an old pagan divinity colleda who is invoked in every line in one of them she is spoken of as a beautiful little maid in another she is implored to make the cows yield milk abundantly the day is spent in busy preparations the women bake little cakes of a special sort in the shape of lambs pigs and chickens the men make ready a pig for roasting for in every servian house roast pig is the principal dish at christmas a bundle of straw tied with a rope is brought into the courtyard and left to stand there near the yule logs the bringing in of the yule log at the moment when the sun is setting all the members of the family assemble in the central hall the great family kitchen of the principal house the mother of the family or the wife of the chief of the zadrooga670 gives a pair of woollen gloves to one of the young men who goes out and presently returns carrying in his gloved hands the largest of the logs the mother receives him at the threshold throwing at him a handful of wheat in which the first chip of the oak tree cut in the early morning for the yule log has been kept all day entering the central hall with the yule log the young man greets all present with the words good evening and may you have a happy christmas and they all answer in chorus may god and the happy and holy christmas help thee in some parts of servia the chief of the family holding a glass of red wine in his hand greets the yule log as if it were a living person and drinks to its health after that another glass of red wine is poured on the log then the oldest male member of the family assisted by the young man who brought in the log places it on the burning fire so that the thicker end of the log protrudes for about a foot from the hearth in some places this end is smeared with honey the ceremony with the straw the yule candle next the mother of the family brings in the bundle of straw which was left standing outside all the young children arrange themselves behind her in a row she then walks slowly round the hall and the adjoining rooms throwing handfuls of straw on the floor and imitating the cackling of a hen while all the children follow her peeping with their lips as if they were chickens cheeping and waddling after the mother bird when the floor is well strewn with straw the father or the eldest member of the family throws a few walnuts in every corner of the hall pronouncing the words in the name of god the father and the son and the holy ghost amen a large pot or a small wooden box filled with wheat is placed high in the east corner of the hall and a tall candle of yellow wax is stuck in the middle of the wheat then the father of the family reverently lights the candle and prays god to bless the family with health and happiness the fields with a good harvest the beehives with plenty of honey the cattle and sheep with young and the cows with abundant milk and rich cream after that they all sit down to supper squatting on the floor for the use of chairs and tables is forbidden on this occasion the roast pig the drawing of the water by four oclock next morning christmas day the whole village is astir indeed most people do not sleep at all that night it is deemed most important to keep the yule log burning brightly all night long very early too the pig is laid on the fire to roast and at the same moment one of the family goes out into the yard and fires a pistol or gun and when the roast pig is removed from the fire the shot is repeated hence for several hours in the early morning of christmas day such a popping and banging of firearms goes on that a stranger might think a stubborn skirmish was in progress just before the sun rises a girl goes and draws water at the village spring or at the brook before she fills her vessels she wishes the water a happy christmas and throws a handful of wheat into it the first cupfuls of water she brings home are used to bake a special christmas cake chesnitsa of which all the members partake at dinner and portions are kept for absent relatives a small silver coin is baked in the cake and he or she who gets it will be lucky during the year the christmas visiter polaznik all the family gathered round the blazing yule log now anxiously expect the arrival of the special christmas visiter who bears the title of polaznik he is usually a young boy of a friendly family no other person not even the priest or the mayor of the village would be allowed to set foot in the house before the arrival of this important personage therefore he ought to come and generally does come very early in the morning he carries a woollen glove full of wheat and when the door is opened at his knock he throws handfuls of wheat on the family gathered round the hearth greeting them with the words christ is born they all answer he is born indeed and the hostess flings a handful of wheat over the christmas visiter who moreover casts some of his wheat into the corners of the hall as well as upon the people then he walks straight to the hearth takes a shovel and strikes the burning log so that a cloud of sparks flies up the chimney while he says may you have this year so many oxen so many horses so many sheep so many pigs so many beehives full of honey so much good luck prosperity progress and happiness having uttered these good wishes he embraces and kisses his host then he turns again to the hearth and after crossing himself falls on his knees and kisses the projecting part of the yule log on rising to his feet he places a coin on the log as his gift meanwhile a low wooden chair has been brought in by a woman and the visiter is led to it to take his seat but just as he is about to do so the chair is jerked away from under him by a male member of the family and he measures his length on the floor by this fall he is supposed to fix into the ground all the good wishes which he has uttered that morning the hostess thereupon wraps him in a thick blanket and he sits quietly muffled in it for a few minutes the thick blanket in which he is swathed is believed on the principles of homoeopathic magic to ensure that the cows will give thick cream next year while he sits thus enriching the milk of the dairy the lads who are to herd the sheep in the coming year go to the hearth and kneeling down before it kiss each other across the projecting end of the yule log by this demonstration of affection they are thought to seal the love of the ewes for their lambs671 the yule log among the servians of slavonia the christmas visiter polazenik the ritual of the yule log is observed in a similar form by the servians who inhabit the southern provinces of austria thus in syrmia a district of slavonia which borders on servia the head of the house sends out one or two young men on christmas eve to cut the yule log in the nearest forest on being brought in the log is not mixed with the ordinary fuel but placed by itself generally leaning against a fruittree till the evening shadows begin to fall when a man carries it into the kitchen and lays it on the fire the master of the house throws corn over him and the two greet each other solemnly the one saying christ is born and the other answering he is born indeed later in the evening the master of the house pours a glass of wine on the charred end of the log whereupon one of the younger men takes the burnt piece of wood carries it to the orchard and sets it up against one of the fruittrees for this service he is rewarded by the master of the house with a piece of money on christmas day when the family is assembled at table they expect the arrival of the special christmas visiter called polazenik the only person who is allowed to enter the house that day when he comes he goes to the hearth stirs the fire with the poker and says christ is born may the family enjoy all good luck and happiness in this year may the cattle increase in number like the sparks i have struck as he says these words the mistress of the house pours corn over him and leads him to the parlour where he takes the place of honour beside the master of the house he is treated with marked attention and respect the family are at pains to entertain him they sing their best songs for his amusement and after midnight a numerous band of men and maidens escorts him by torchlight with songs and jubilation to his own house672 the yule log among the servians of dalmatia herzegovina and montenegro the yule log in albania among the servians of dalmatia herzegovina and montenegro it is customary on christmas eve badnyi dan to fetch a great yule log badnyak which serves as a symbol of family luck it is generally cut from an evergreen oak but sometimes from an olivetree or a beech at nightfall the master of the house himself brings in the log and lays it on the fire then he and all present bare their heads sprinkle the log with wine and make a cross on it after that the master of the house says welcome o log may god keep you from mishap so saying he strews peas maize raisins and wheat on the log praying for gods blessing on all members of the family living and dead for heavens blessing on their undertakings and for domestic prosperity in montenegro they meet the log with a loaf of bread and a jug of wine drink to it and pour wine on it whereupon the whole family drinks out of the same beaker in dalmatia and other places for example in rizano the yule logs are decked by young women with red silk flowers laurel leaves ribbons and even gold wire and the lights near the doorposts are kindled when the log is brought into the house among the morlaks as soon as the master of the house crosses the threshold with the yule log one of the family must sprinkle corn on him and say god bless you to which he answers the same to you a piece of the log is kept till new years day to kindle a light with or it is carried out to the fields to protect them from hail it is customary to invite before hand a christmas visitor polazaynik and to admit no one else into the house on that day he comes early carrying in his sleeves a quantity of corn which he throws into the house saying christ is born one of the household replies he is born indeed and throws corn on the visiter then the newcomer goes up to the hearth pokes the fire and strikes the burning log with the poker so hard that sparks fly off in all directions at each blow he says i wish the family as many cows calves sucking pigs goats and sheep and as many strokes of good luck as the sparks that now fly from the log with these words he throws some small coins into the ashes673 in albania down to recent years it was a common custom to burn a yule log at christmas and with it corn maize and beans moreover wine and rakia were poured on the flames and the ashes of the fire were scattered on the fields to make them fertile674 the huzuls a slavonic people of the carpathians kindle fire by the friction of wood on christmas eve old style the fifth of january and keep it burning till twelfth night675 belief that the yule log protects against fire and lightning it is remarkable how common the belief appears to have been that the remains of the yulelog if kept throughout the year had power to protect the house against fire and especially against lightning676 as the yule log was frequently of oak677 it seems possible that this belief may be a relic of the old aryan creed which associated the oaktree with the god of thunder678 whether the curative and fertilizing virtues ascribed to the ashes of the yule log which are supposed to heal cattle as well as men to enable cows to calve and to promote the fruitfulness of the earth679 may not be derived from the same ancient source is a question which deserves to be considered public celebrations of the firefestival at midwinter the bonfire on christmas eve at schweina in thuringia thus far we have regarded only the private or domestic celebration of the firefestival at midwinter the public celebration of such rites at that season of the year appears to have been rare and exceptional in central and northern europe however some instances are on record thus at schweina in thuringia down to the second half of the nineteenth century the young people used to kindle a great bonfire on the antonius mountain every year on christmas eve neither the civil nor the ecclesiastical authorities were able to suppress the celebration nor could the cold rain and snow of the season damp or chill the enthusiasm of the celebrants for some time before christmas the young men and boys were busy building a foundation for the bonfire on the top of the mountain where the oldest church of the village used to stand the foundation consisted of a pyramidal structure composed of stones turf and moss when christmas eve came round a strong pole with bundles of brushwood tied to it was erected on the pyramid the young folk also provided themselves with poles to which old brooms or faggots of shavings were attached these were to serve as torches when the evening grew dark and the church bells rang to service the troop of lads ascended the mountain and soon from the top the glare of the bonfire lit up the darkness and the sound of a hymn broke the stillness of night in a circle round the great fire lesser fires were kindled and last of all the lads ran about swinging their lighted torches till these twinkling points of fire moving down the mountainside went out one by one in the darkness at midnight the bells rang out from the church tower mingled with the blast of horns and the sound of singing feasting and revelry were kept up throughout the night and in the morning young and old went to early mass to be edified by hearing of the light eternal680 bonfires on christmas eve in normandy in the bocage of normandy the peasants used to repair often from a distance of miles to the churches to hear the midnight mass on christmas eve they marched in procession by torchlight chanting christmas carols and the fitful illumination of the woods the hedges and the fields as they moved through the darkness presented a succession of picturesque scenes mention is also made of bonfires kindled on the heights the custom is said to have been observed at athis near cond down to recent years681 bonfires on st thomass day in the isle of man the burning of the clavie at burghead on the last day of december the old rampart at burghead in the isle of man on the twentyfirst of december a day dedicated to saint thomas the people went to the mountains to catch deer and sheep for christmas and in the evenings always kindled a large fire on the top of every fingan or cliff hence at the time of casting peats every one laid aside a large one saying faaid mooar moayney son oiel fingan that is a large turf for fingan eve682 at burghead an ancient village on the southern shore of the moray firth about nine miles from the town of elgin a festival of fire called the burning of the clavie has been celebrated from time immemorial on hogmanay the last day of december a tarbarrel is sawn in two one half of it is set on the top of a stout pole and filled with tar and other combustibles the halfbarrel is fastened to the pole by means of a long nail which is made for the purpose and furnished gratuitously by the village blacksmith the nail must be knocked in with a stone the use of a hammer is forbidden when the shades of evening have begun to fall the clavie as it is called is set on fire by means of a burning peat which is always fetched from the same house it may not be kindled with a match as soon as it is in a blaze it is shouldered by a man who proceeds to carry it at a run flaring and dripping melted tar round the old boundaries of the village the modern part of the town is not included in the circuit close at his heels follows a motley crowd cheering and shouting one bearer relieves another as each wearies of his burden the first to shoulder the clavie which is esteemed an honour is usually a man who has been lately married should the bearer stumble or fall it is deemed a very ill omen for him and for the village in bygone times it was thought necessary that one man should carry it all round the village hence the strongest man was chosen for the purpose moreover it was customary to carry the burning clavie round every fishingboat and vessel in the harbour but this part of the ceremony was afterwards discontinued finally the blazing tarbarrel is borne to a small hill called the doorie which rises near the northern end of the promontory here the pole is fixed into a socket in a pillar of freestone and fresh fuel is heaped upon the flames which flare up higher and brighter than ever formerly the clavie was allowed to burn here the whole night but now after blazing for about half an hour it is lifted from the socket and thrown down the western slope of the hill then the crowd rushes upon it demolishes it and scrambles for the burning smoking embers which they carry home and carefully preserve as charms to protect them against witchcraft and misfortune683 the great antiquity of burghead where this curious and no doubt ancient festival is still annually observed appears from the remains of a very remarkable rampart which formerly encircled the place it consists of a mound of earth faced on both sides with a solid wall of stone and strengthened internally by oak beams and planks the whole being laid on a foundation of boulders the style of the rampart agrees in general with caesars description of the mode in which the gauls constructed their walls of earth stone and logs684 and it resembles the ruins of gallic fortifications which have been discovered in france though it is said to surpass them in the strength and solidity of its structure no similar walls appear to be known in britain a great part of this interesting prehistoric fortress was barbarously destroyed in the early part of the nineteenth century much of it being tumbled into the sea and many of the stones used to build the harbour piers685 procession with burning tarbarrels on christmas eve old style at lerwick in lerwick the capital of the shetland islands on christmas eve the fourth of januaryfor the old style is still observedthe children go a guizing that is to say they disguising themselves in the most fantastic and gaudy costumes parade the streets and infest the houses and shops begging for the wherewithal to carry on their christmas amusements one oclock on yule morning having struck the young men turn out in large numbers dressed in the coarsest of garments and at the doublequick march drag huge tar barrels through the town shouting and cheering as they go or blowing loud blasts with their louder horns the tar barrel simply consists of severalsay from four to eighttubs filled with tar and chips placed on a platform of wood it is dragged by means of a chain to which scores of jubilant youths readily yoke themselves they have recently been described by the worthy burgh officer of lerwick as fiery chariots the effect of which is truly grand and terrific in a christmas morning the dark streets of lerwick are generally lighted up by the bright glare and its atmosphere blackened by the dense smoke of six or eight tar barrels in succession on the appearance of daybreak at six am the morning revellers put off their coarse garmentswell begrimed by this timeand in their turn become guizards they assume every imaginable form of costumethose of soldiers sailors highlanders spanish chevaliers etc thus disguised they either go in pairs as man and wife or in larger groups and proceed to call on their friends to wish them the compliments of the season formerly these adolescent guizards used to seat themselves in crates and accompanied by fiddlers were dragged through the town686 persian festival of fire at the winter solstice the persians used to celebrate a festival of fire called sada or saza at the winter solstice on the longest night of the year they kindled bonfires everywhere and kings and princes tied dry grass to the feet of birds and animals set fire to the grass and then let the birds and beasts fly or run blazing through the air or over the fields and mountains so that the whole air and earth appeared to be on fire687 8 the needfire european festivals of fire in seasons of distress and calamity the needfire the firefestivals hitherto described are all celebrated periodically at certain stated times of the year but besides these regularly recurring celebrations the peasants in many parts of europe have been wont from time immemorial to resort to a ritual of fire at irregular intervals in seasons of distress and calamity above all when their cattle were attacked by epidemic disease no account of the popular european firefestivals would be complete without some notice of these remarkable rites which have all the greater claim on our attention because they may perhaps be regarded as the source and origin of all the other firefestivals certainly they must date from a very remote antiquity the general name by which they are known among the teutonic peoples is needfire688 the needfire in the middle ages the needfire at neustadt in 1598 the history of the needfire can be traced back to early middle ages for in the reign of pippin king of franks the practice of kindling needfires was denounced as a heathen superstition by a synod of prelates and nobles held under the presidency of boniface archbishop of mainz689 not long afterwards the custom was again forbidden along with many more relics of expiring paganism in an index of superstitions and heathenish observances which has been usually referred to the year 743 ad though some scholars assign it a later date under the reign of charlemagne690 in germany the needfires would seem to have been popular down to the second half of the nineteenth century thus in the year 1598 when a fatal cattleplague was raging at neustadt near marburg a wise man of the name of joh khler induced the authorities of the town to adopt the following remedy a new waggonwheel was taken and twirled round an axle which had never been used before until the friction elicited fire with this fire a bonfire was next kindled between the gates of the town and all the cattle were driven through the smoke and flames moreover every householder had to rekindle the fire on his hearth by means of a light taken from the bonfire strange to say this salutary measure had no effect whatever in staying the cattleplague and seven years later the sapient joh khler himself was burnt as a witch the farmers whose pigs and cows had derived no benefit from the needfire perhaps assisted as spectators at the burning and while they shook their heads agreed among themselves that it served joh khler perfectly right691 according to a writer who published his book about nine years afterwards some of the germans especially in the wassgaw mountains confidently believed that a cattleplague could be stayed by driving the animals through a needfire which had been kindled by the violent friction of a pole on a quantity of dry oak wood but it was a necessary condition of success that all fires in the village should previously be extinguished with water and any householder who failed to put out his fire was heavily fined692 method kindling the need fire the method of kindling the needfire is described as follows by a writer towards the end of the seventeenth century when an evil plague has broken out among the cattle large and small and the herds have thereby suffered great ravages the peasants resolve to light a needfire on a day appointed there must be no single flame in any house nor on any hearth from every house a quantity of straw and water and underwood must be brought forth then a strong oaken pole is fixed firmly in the earth a hole is bored in it and a wooden winch well smeared with pitch and tar is inserted in the hole and turned round forcibly till great heat and then fire is generated the fire so produced is caught in fuel and fed with straw heath and underwood till it bursts out into a regular needfire which must then be somewhat spread out between walls or fences and the cattle and horses driven through it twice or thrice with sticks and whips others set up two posts each with a hole in it and insert a winch along with old greasy rags in the holes others use a thick rope collect nine kinds of wood and keep them in violent motion till fire leaps forth perhaps there may be other ways of generating or kindling this fire but they are all directed simply at the cure of the cattle after passing twice or thrice through the fire the cattle are driven to their stalls or to pasture and the heap of wood that had been collected is destroyed but in some places every householder must take with him a brand extinguish it in a washingtub or trough and put it in the manger where the cattle are fed where it must lie for some time the poles that were used to make the needfire together with the wood that was employed as a winch are sometimes burned with the rest of the fuel sometimes carefully preserved after the cattle have been thrice driven through the flames693 the mode of kindling the needfire about hildesheim sometimes the needfire was known as the wild fire to distinguish it no doubt from the tame fire produced by more ordinary methods the following is grimms account of the mode of kindling it which prevailed in some parts of central germany particularly about hildesheim down apparently to the first half of the nineteenth century in many places of lower saxony especially among the mountains the custom prevails of preparing the socalled wild fire for the purpose of preventing cattleplague and through it first the pigs then the cows and last of all the geese are driven the proceedings on the occasion are as follows the principal farmers and parishioners assemble and notice is served to every inhabitant to extinguish entirely all fire in his house so that not even a spark remains alight in the whole village then young and old repair to a road in a hollow usually towards evening the women carrying linen and the men wood and tow two oaken poles are driven into the ground about a foot and a half from each other each pole has in the side facing the other a socket into which a crosspiece as thick as a mans arm is fitted the sockets are stuffed with linen and the crosspiece is rammed in as tight as possible while the poles are bound together at the top by ropes a rope is wound about the round smooth crosspiece and the free ends of the rope at both sides are gripped by several persons who pull the crosspiece to and fro with the utmost rapidity till through the friction the linen in the sockets takes fire the sparks of the linen are immediately caught in tow or oakum and waved about in a circle until they burst into a bright glow when straw is applied to it and the flaming straw used to kindle the brushwood which has been stacked in piles in the hollow way when this wood has blazed up and the fire has nearly died out again the people hasten to the herds which have been waiting in the background and drive them forcibly one after the other through the glow as soon as all the beasts are through the young folk rush wildly at the ashes and cinders sprinkling and blackening each other with them those who have been most sprinkled and blackened march in triumph behind the cattle into the village and do not wash themselves for a long time if after long rubbing the linen should not catch fire they guess that there is still fire somewhere in the village then a strict search is made from house to house any fire that may be found is put out and the householder is punished or upbraided the wild fire must be made by prolonged friction it may not be struck with flint and steel some villages do not prepare it yearly as a preventive of cattleplague but only kindle it when the disease has actually broken out694 in the halberstadt district the ends of the rope which was used to make the crosspiece revolve in the sockets had to be pulled by two chaste young men695 the mode of kindling the needfire in the mark in the mark down to the first half of the nineteenth century the practice was similar we read that in many parts of the mark there still prevails on certain occasions the custom of kindling a needfire it happens particularly when a farmer has sick pigs two posts of dry wood are planted in the earth amid solemn silence before the sun rises and round these posts hempen ropes are pulled to and fro till the wood kindles whereupon the fire is fed with dry leaves and twigs and the sick beasts are driven through it in some places the fire is produced by the friction of an old cartwheel696 the mode of kindling the needfire in mecklenburg in mecklenburg the needfire used to be lighted by the friction of a rope wound about an oaken pole or by rubbing two boards against each other having been thus elicited the flame was fed with wood of seven kinds the practice was forbidden by gustavus adolphus duke of mecklenburg in 1682 but the prohibition apparently had little effect for down to the end of the eighteenth century the custom was so common that the inhabitants even of large towns made no scruple of resorting to it for example in the month of july 1792 sickness broke out among the cattle belonging to the town of sternberg some of the beasts died suddenly and so the people resolved to drive all the survivors through a needfire on the tenth day of july the magistrates issued a proclamation announcing that next morning before sunrise a needfire would be kindled for the behoof of all the cattle of the town and warning all the inhabitants against lighting fires in their kitchens that evening so next morning very early about two oclock nearly the whole population was astir and having assembled outside one of the gates of the town they helped to drive the timid cattle not without much ado through three separate needfires after which they dispersed to their homes in the unalterable conviction that they had rescued the cattle from destruction but to make assurance doubly sure they deemed it advisable to administer the rest of the ashes as a bolus to the animals however some people in mecklenburg used to strew the ashes of the needfire on fields for the purpose of protecting the crops against vermin as late as june 1868 a traveller in mecklenburg saw a couple of peasants sweating away at a rope which they were pulling backwards and forwards so as to make a tarry roller revolve with great speed in the socket of an upright post asked what they were about they vouchsafed no reply but an old woman who appeared on the scene from a neighbouring cottage was more communicative in the fulness of her heart she confided to the stranger that her pigs were sick that the two taciturn bumpkins were her sons who were busy extracting a needfire from the roller and that when they succeeded the flame would be used to ignite a heap of rags and brushwood through which the ailing swine would be driven she further explained that the persons who kindle a needfire should always be two brothers or at least bear the same christian name697 the mode of kindling the needfire in hanover in the summer of 1828 there was much sickness among the pigs and the cows of eddesse a village near meinersen in the south of hanover when all ordinary measures to arrest the malady failed the farmers met in solemn conclave on the village green and determined that next morning there should be a needfire thereupon the head man of the village sent word from house to house that on the following day nobody should kindle a fire before sunrise and that everybody should stand by ready to drive out the cattle the same afternoon all the necessary preparations were made for giving effect to the decision of the collective wisdom a narrow street was enclosed with planks and the village carpenter set to work at the machinery for kindling the fire he took two posts of oak wood bored a hole about three inches deep and broad in each and set the two poles up facing each other at a distance of about two feet then he fitted a roller of oak wood into the two holes of the posts so that it formed a crosspiece between them about two oclock next morning every householder brought a bundle of straw and brushwood and laid it down across the street in a prescribed order the sturdiest swains who could be found were chosen to make the needfire for this purpose a long hempen rope was wound twice round the oaken roller in the oaken posts the pivots were well smeared with pitch and tar a bundle of tow and other tinder was laid close at hand and all was ready the stalwart clodhoppers now seized the two ends of the rope and went to work with a will puffs of smoke soon issued from the sockets but to the consternation of the bystanders not a spark of fire could be elicited some people openly declared their suspicion that some rascal had not put out the fire in his house when suddenly the tinder burst into flame the cloud passed away from all faces the fire was applied to the heaps of fuel and when the flames had somewhat died down the herds were forcibly driven through the fire first the pigs next the cows and last of all the horses the herdsmen then drove the beasts to pasture and persons whose faith in the efficacy of the needfire was particularly robust carried home brands698 the mode of kindling the needfire in the harz mountains again at a village near quedlinburg in the harz mountains it was resolved to put a herd of sick swine through the needfire hearing of this intention the superintendent of quedlinburg hurried to the spot and has described for us what he saw the beadles went from house to house to see that there was no fire in any house for it is well known that should there be common fire burning in a house the needfire will not kindle the men made their rounds very early in the morning to make quite sure that all lights were out at two oclock a nightlight was still burning in the parsonage and this was of course a hindrance to the needfire the peasants knocked at the window and earnestly entreated that the nightlight might be extinguished but the parsons wife refused to put the light out it still glimmered at the window and in the darkness outside the angry rustics vowed that the parsons pigs should get no benefit of the needfire however as good luck would have it just as the morning broke the nightlight went out of itself and the hopes of the people revived from every house bundles of straw tow faggots and so forth were now carried to feed the bonfire the noise and the cheerful bustle were such that you might have thought they were all hurrying to witness a public execution outside the village between two garden walls an oaken post had been driven into the ground and a hole bored through it in the hole a wooden winch smeared with tar was inserted and made to revolve with such force and rapidity that fire and smoke in time issued from the socket the collected fuel was then thrown upon the fire and soon a great blaze shot up the pigs were now driven into the upper end of the street as soon as they saw the fire they turned tail but the peasants drove them through with shrieks and shouts and lashes of whips at the other end of the street there was another crowd waiting who chased the swine back through the fire a second time then the other crowd repeated the manoeuvre and the herd of swine was driven for the third time through the smoke and flames that was the end of the performance many pigs were scorched so severely that they gave up the ghost the bonfire was broken up and every householder took home with him a brand which he washed in the waterbarrel and laid for some time as a treasure of great price in the manger from which the cattle were fed but the parsons wife had reason bitterly to repent her folly in refusing to put out that nightlight for not one of her pigs was driven through the needfire so they died699 the mode of kindling the needfire in brunswick in brunswick also the needfire is known to have been repeatedly kindled during the nineteenth century after driving the pigs through the fire which was kindled by the friction of wood some people took brands home dipped them in water and then gave the water to the pigs to drink no doubt for the purpose of inoculating them still more effectually with the precious virtue of the needfire in the villages of the drmling district everybody who bore a hand in kindling the wild fire must have the same christian name otherwise they laboured in vain the fire was produced by the friction of a rope round the beams of a door and bread corn and old boots contributed their mites to swell the blaze through which the pigs as usual were driven in one place apparently not far from wolfenbttel the needfire is said to have been kindled contrary to custom by the smith striking a spark from the cold anvil700 at gandersheim down to about the beginning of the nineteenth century the needfire was lit in the common way by causing a crossbar to revolve rapidly on its axis between two upright posts the rope which produced the revolution of the bar had to be new but it was if possible woven from threads taken from a gallowsrope with which people had been hanged while the needfire was being kindled in this fashion every other fire in the town had to be put out search was made through the houses and any fire discovered to be burning was extinguished if in spite of every precaution no flame could be elicited by the friction of the rope the failure was set down to witchcraft but if the efforts were successful a bonfire was lit with the new fire and when the flames had died down the sick swine were driven thrice through the glowing embers701 on the lower rhine the needfire is said to have been kindled by the friction of oakwood on firwood all fires in the village having been previously extinguished the bonfires so kindled were composed of wood of nine different sorts there were three such bonfires and the cattle were driven round them with great gravity and devotion702 the mode of kindling the needfire in silesia and bohemia in silesia also needfires were often employed for the purpose of curing a murrain or preventing its spread while all other lights within the boundaries were extinguished the new fire was produced by the friction of nine kinds of wood and the flame so obtained was used to kindle heaps of brushwood or straw to which every inhabitant had contributed through these fires the cattle both sick and sound were driven in the confident expectation that thereby the sick would be healed and the sound saved from sickness703 when plague breaks out among the herds at dobischwald in austrian silesia a splinter of wood is chipped from the threshold of every house the cattle are driven to a crossroad and there a tree growing at the boundary is felled by a pair of twin brothers the wood of the tree and the splinters from the thresholds furnish the fuel of a bonfire which is kindled by the rubbing of two pieces of wood together when the bonfire is ablaze the horns of the cattle are pared and the parings thrown into the flames after which the animals are driven through the fire this is believed to guard the herd against the plague704 the germans of western bohemia resort to similar measures for staying a murrain you set up a post bore a hole in it and insert in the hole a stick which you have first of all smeared with pitch and wrapt in inflammable stuffs then you wind a rope round the stick and give the two ends of the rope to two persons who must either be brothers or have the same baptismal name they haul the rope backwards and forwards so as to make the tarred stick revolve rapidly till the rope first smokes and then emits sparks the sparks are used to kindle a bonfire through which the cattle are driven in the usual way and as usual no other fire may burn in the village while the needfire is being kindled for otherwise the rope could not possibly be ignited705 in upper austria sick pigs are reported to have been driven through a needfire about the beginning of the nineteenth century706 the use the needfire in switzerland the needfire is still in use in some parts of switzerland but it seems to have degenerated into a childrens game and to be employed rather for the dispersal of a mist than for the prevention or cure of cattleplague in some cantons it goes by the name of misthealing while in others it is called butterchurning on a misty or rainy day a number of children will shut themselves up in a stable or byre and proceed to make fire for the purpose of improving the weather the way in which they make it is this a boy places a board against his breast takes a peg pointed at both ends and setting one end of the peg against the board on his breast presses the other end firmly against a second board the surface of which has been flaked into a nap a string is tied round the peg and two other boys pull it to and fro till through the rapid motion of the point of the peg a hole is burnt in the flaked board to which tow or dry moss is then applied as a tinder in this way fire and smoke are elicited and with their appearance the children fancy that the mist will vanish707 we may conjecture that this method of dispersing a mist which is now left to children was formerly practised in all seriousness by grown men in switzerland it is thus that religious or magical rites dwindle away into the sports of children in the canton of the grisons there is still in common use an imprecation mist go away or ill heal you which points to an old custom of burning up the fog with fire a longer form of the curse lingers in the valle des bagnes of the canton valais it runs thus mist mist fly fly or st martin will come with a sheaf of straw to burn your guts a great log of wood to smash your brow and an iron chain to drag you to hell708 the mode of kindling the needfire in sweden and norway the needfire as a protection against witchcraft in sweden the needfire is called from the mode of its production either vrideld turned fire or gnideld rubbed fire down to near the end of the eighteenth century the needfire was kindled as in germany by the violent rubbing of two pieces of wood against each other sometimes nine different kinds of wood were used for the purpose the smoke of the fire was deemed salutary fruittrees and nets were fumigated with it in order that the trees might bear fruit and the nets catch fish cattle were also driven through the smoke709 in sundal a narrow norwegian valley shut in on both sides by precipitous mountains there lived down to the second half of the nineteenth century an old man who was very superstitious he set salmontraps in the river driva which traverses the valley and he caught many fish both in spring and autumn when his fishing went wrong he kindled naueld needfire or gnideild rubbed fire friction fire to counteract the witchcraft which he believed to be the cause of his bad luck he set up two planks near each other bored a hole in each inserted a pointed rod in the holes and twisted a long cord round the rod then he pulled the cord so as to make the rod revolve rapidly thus by reason of the friction he at last drew fire from the wood that contented him for he believed that the witchery was thus rendered powerless and that good luck in his fishing was now ensured710 the needfire among the slavonic peoples slavonic peoples hold the needfire in high esteem they call it living fire and attribute to it a healing virtue the ascription of medicinal power to fire kindled by the friction of wood is said to be especially characteristic of the slavs who inhabit the carpathian mountains and the balkan peninsula the mode in which they produce the needfire differs somewhat in different places thus in the schar mountains of servia the task is entrusted to a boy and girl between eleven and fourteen years of age they are led into a perfectly dark room and having stripped themselves naked kindle the fire by rubbing two rollers of lime wood against each other till the friction produces sparks which are caught in tinder the serbs of western macedonia drive two oaken posts into the ground bore a round hole in the upper end of each insert a roller of lime wood in the holes and set it revolving rapidly by means of a cord which is looped round the roller and worked by a bow elsewhere the roller is put in motion by two men who hold each one end of the cord and pull it backwards and forwards forcibly between them bulgarian shepherds sometimes kindle the needfire by drawing a prismshaped piece of lime wood to and fro across the flat surface of a treestump in the forest711 but in the neighbourhood of kstendil in bulgaria the needfire is kindled by the friction of two pieces of oak wood and the cattle are driven through it712 the needfire in russia and poland the needfire in slavonia in many districts of russia also living fire is made by the friction of wood on st johns day and the herds are driven through it and the people leap over it in the conviction that their health is thereby assured when a cattleplague is raging the fire is produced by rubbing two pieces of oak wood against each other and it is used to kindle the lamps before the holy pictures and the censers in the churches713 thus it appears that in russia the needfire is kindled for the sake of the cattle periodically as well as on special emergencies similarly in poland the peasants are said to kindle fires in the village streets on st rochuss day and to drive the cattle thrice through them in order to protect the animals against the murrain the fire is produced by rubbing a pole of poplar wood on a plank of poplar or fir wood and catching the sparks in tow the embers are carried home to be used as remedies in sickness714 as practised in slavonia the custom of the needfire used to present some interesting features which are best described in the words of an eyewitnessin the year 1833 i came for the first time as a young merchant to slavonia it was to gaj that i went in the pozega district the time was autumn and it chanced that a cattleplague was raging in the neighbourhood which inflicted much loss on the people the peasants believed that the plague was a woman an evil spirit kutga who was destroying the cattle so they sought to banish her i had then occasion to observe the proceedings in the villages of gaj kukunjevac brezina and brekinjska towards evening the whole population of the village was busy laying a ring of brushwood round the boundaries of the village all fires were extinguished throughout the village then pairs of men in several places took pieces of wood which had been specially prepared for the purpose and rubbed them together till they emitted sparks the sparks were allowed to fall on tinder and fanned into a flame with which the dry brushwood was kindled thus the fire burned all round the village the peasants persuaded themselves that thereupon kuga must take her departure715 the needfire in servia this last account leaves no doubt as to the significance of the needfire in the minds of slavonian peasantry they regard it simply as a barrier interposed between their cattle and the evil spirit which prowls like a hungry wolf round the fold and can like a wolf be kept at bay by fire the same interpretation of the needfire comes out hardly less clearly in the account which another writer gives of a ceremony witnessed by him at the village of setonje at the foot of the homolje mountains in the great forest of servia an epidemic was raging among the children and the needfire was resorted to as a means of staying the plague it was produced by an old man and an old woman in the first of the ways described above that is they made it in the dark by rubbing two sticks of lime wood against each other before the healing virtue of the fire was applied to the inhabitants of the village two old women performed the following ceremony both bore the name of stana from the verb stati to remain standing for the ceremony could not be successfully performed by persons of any other name one of them carried a copper kettle full of water the other an old houselock with the key thus equipped they repaired to a spot outside of the village and there the old dame with the kettle asked the old dame with the lock whither away and the other answered her i came to shut the village against illluck with that she locked the lock and threw it with the key into the kettle of water then they marched thrice round the village repeating the ceremony of the lock and key at each round meantime all the villagers arrayed in their best clothes were assembled in an open place all the fires in the houses had been previously extinguished two sturdy yokels now dug a tunnel through a mound beside an oak tree the tunnel was just high enough to let a man creep through it on all fours two fires lit by the needfire were now laid one at each end of the tunnel and the old woman with the kettle took her stand at the entrance of the tunnel while the one with the lock posted herself at the exit facing the latter stood another woman with a great pot of milk before her and on the other side was set a pot full of melted swines fat all was now ready the villagers thereupon crawled through the tunnel on hands and knees one behind the other each as he emerged from the tunnel received a spoonful of milk from the woman and looked at his face reflected in the pot of melted swines fat then another woman made a cross with a piece of charcoal on his back when all the inhabitants had thus crept through the tunnel and been doctored at the other end each took some glowing embers home with him in a pot wherewith to rekindle the fire on the domestic hearth lastly they put some of the charcoal in a vessel of water and drank the mixture in order to be thereby magically protected against the epidemic716 it would be superfluous to point out in detail how admirably these measures are calculated to arrest the ravages of disease but for the sake of those if there are any to whom the medicinal effect of crawling through a hole on hands and knees is not at once apparent i shall merely say that the procedure in question is one of the most powerful specifics which the wit of man has devised for maladies of all sorts ample evidence of its application will be adduced in a later part of this work717 the needfire in bulgaria in bulgaria the herds suffer much from the raids of certain bloodsucking vampyres called ustrels an ustrel is the spirit of a christian child who was born on a saturday and died unfortunately before he could be baptized on the ninth day after burial he grubs his way out of the grave and attacks the cattle at once sucking their blood all night and returning at peep of dawn to the grave to rest from his labours in ten days or so the copious draughts of blood which he has swallowed have so fortified his constitution that he can undertake longer journeys so when he falls in with great herds of cattle or flocks of sheep he returns no more to the grave for rest and refreshment at night but takes up his quarters during the day either between the horns of a sturdy calf or ram or between the hind legs of a milchcow beasts whose blood he has sucked die the same night in any herd that he may fasten on he begins with the fattest animal and works his way down steadily through the leaner kine till not one single beast is left alive the carcases of the victims swell up and when the hide is stripped off you can always perceive the livid patch of flesh where the monster sucked the blood of the poor creature in a single night he may by working hard kill five cows but he seldom exceeds that number he can change his shape and weight very easily for example when he is sitting by day between the horns of a ram the animal scarcely feels his weight but at night he will sometimes throw himself on an ox or a cow so heavily that the animal cannot stir and lows so pitifully that it would make your heart bleed to hear people who were born on a saturday can see these monsters and they have described them accurately so that there can be no doubt whatever about their existence it is therefore a matter of great importance to the peasant to protect his flocks and herds against the ravages of such dangerous vampyres the way in which he does so is this on a saturday morning before sunrise the village drummer gives the signal to put out every fire in the village even smoking is forbidden next all the domestic animals with the exception of fowls geese and ducks are driven out into the open in front of the flocks and herds march two men whose names during the ceremony may not be mentioned in the village they go into the wood pick two dry branches and having stript themselves of their clothes they rub the two branches together very hard till they catch fire then with the fire so obtained they kindle two bonfires one on each side of a crossroad which is known to be frequented by wolves after that the herd is driven between the two fires coals from the bonfires are then taken back to the village and used to rekindle the fires on the domestic hearths for several days no one may go near the charred and blackened remains of the bonfires at the crossroad the reason is that the vampyre is lying there having dropped from his seat between the cows horns when the animals were driven between the two fires so if any one were to pass by the spot during these days the monster would be sure to call him by name and to follow him to the village whereas if he is left alone a wolf will come at midnight and strangle him and in a few days the herdsmen can see the ground soaked with his slimy blood so that is the end of the vampyre718 in this bulgarian custom as in the slavonian custom described above the conception of the needfire as a barrier set up between the cattle and a dangerous spirit is clearly worked out the spirit rides the cow till he comes to the narrow pass between the two fires but the heat there is too much for him he drops in a faint from the saddle or rather from the horns and the now riderless animal escapes safe and sound beyond the smoke and flame leaving her persecutor prostrate on the ground on the further side of the blessed barrier the needfire in bosnia and herzegovina in bosnia and herzegovina there are some local differences in the mode of kindling the needfire or living fire as it is called thus at jablanica both the uprights and the roller or crosspiece which by its revolution kindles the fire are made of corneltree wood whereas at dolac near sarajevo the uprights and the crosspiece or roller are all made of lime wood in gacko contrary to the usual custom the fire is made by striking a piece of iron on an anvil till sparks are given out which are caught in tinder the living fire thus produced is employed for purposes of healing in particular if any one suffers from wounds or sores ashes of the needfire are sprinkled on the ailing part in gacko it is also believed that if a pregnant woman witnesses a conflagration her child will either be born with a red eruption on its skin or will contract the malady sooner or later afterwards the only remedy consists in ashes of the needfire which are mixed with water and given to the child to drink719 the needfire in england the needfire in yorkshire in england the earliest notice of the needfire seems to be contained in the chronicle of lanercost for the year 1268 the annalist tells with pious horror how when an epidemic was raging in that year among the cattle certain beastly men monks in garb but not in mind taught the idiots of their country to make fire by the friction of wood and to set up an image of priapus whereby they thought to succour the animals720 the use of the needfire is particularly attested for the counties of yorkshire and northumberland thus in yorkshire down to the middle of the eighteenth century the favourite remedy of the country people not only in the way of cure but of prevention was an odd one it was to smoke the cattle almost to suffocation by kindling straw litter and other combustible matter about them the effects of this mode of cure are not stated but the most singular part of it was that by which it was reported to have been discovered an angel says the legend descended into yorkshire and there set a large tree on fire the strange appearance of which or else the savour of the smoke incited the cattle around some of which were infected to draw near the miracle when they all either received an immediate cure or an absolute prevention of the disorder it is not affirmed that the angel staid to speak to anybody but only that he left a written direction for the neighbouring people to catch this supernatural fire and to communicate it from one to another with all possible speed throughout the country and in case it should be extinguished and utterly lost that then new fire of equal virtue might be obtained not by any common method but by rubbing two pieces of wood together till they ignited upon what foundation this story stood is not exactly known but it put the farmers actually into a hurry of communicating flame and smoke from one house to another with wonderful speed making it run like wildfire over the country721 again we read that the father of the writer who died in 1843 in his seventyninth year had a perfect remembrance of a great number of persons belonging to the upper and middle classes of his native parish of bowes assembling on the banks of the river greta to work for needfire a disease among cattle called the murrain then prevailed to a very great extent through that district of yorkshire the cattle were made to pass through the smoke raised by this miraculous fire and their cure was looked upon as certain and to neglect doing so was looked upon as wicked this fire was produced by the violent and continued friction of two dry pieces of wood until such time as it was thereby obtained to work as though one was working for needfire is a common proverb in the north of england722 at ingleton a small town nestling picturesquely at the foot of the high hill of ingleborough in western yorkshire within the last thirty years or so it was a common practice to kindle the socalled needfire by rubbing two pieces of wood briskly together and setting ablaze a large heap of sticks and brushwood which were dispersed and cattle then driven through the smoking brands this was thought to act as a charm against the spread or developement of the various ailments to which cattle are liable and the farmers seem to have had great faith in it723 writing about the middle of the nineteenth century kemble tells us that the willfire or needfire had been used in devonshire for the purpose of staying a murrain within the memory of man724 the needfire in northumberland so in northumberland down to the first half of the nineteenth century when a contagious disease enters among cattle the fires are extinguished in the adjacent villages two pieces of dried wood are then rubbed together until fire be produced with this a quantity of straw is kindled juniper is thrown into the flame and the cattle are repeatedly driven through the smoke part of the forced fire is sent to the neighbours who again forward it to others and as great expedition is used the fires may be seen blazing over a great extent of country in a very short space of time725 it is strange says the antiquary william henderson writing about 1866 to find the custom of lighting needfires on the occasion of epidemics among cattle still lingering among us but so it is the vicar of stamfordham writes thus respecting it when the murrain broke out among the cattle about eighteen years ago this fire was produced by rubbing two pieces of dry wood together and was carried from place to place all through this district as a charm against cattle taking the disease bonfires were kindled with it and the cattle driven into the smoke where they were left for some time many farmers hereabouts i am informed had the needfire726 martins account of the needfire in the highlands of scotland in the earliest systematic account of the western islands of scotland we read that the inhabitants here did also make use of a fire called tinegin ie a forced fire or fire of necessity which they used as an antidote against the plague or murrain in cattle and it was performed thus all the fires in the parish were extinguished and then eightyone married men being thought the necessary number for effecting this design took two great planks of wood and nine of them were employed by turns who by their repeated efforts rubbed one of the planks against the other until the heat thereof produced fire and from this forced fire each family is supplied with new fire which is no sooner kindled than a pot full of water is quickly set on it and afterwards sprinkled upon the people infected with the plague or upon the cattle that have the murrain and this they all say they find successful by experience it was practised in the main land opposite to the south of skie within these thirty years727 the needfire in the island of mull sacrifice of a heifer in the island of mull one of the largest of the hebrides the needfire was kindled as late as 1767 in consequence of a disease among the black cattle the people agreed to perform an incantation though they esteemed it a wicked thing they carried to the top of carnmoor a wheel and nine spindles of oakwood they extinguished every fire in every house within sight of the hill the wheel was then turned from east to west over the nine spindles long enough to produce fire by friction if the fire were not produced before noon the incantation lost its effect they failed for several days running they attributed this failure to the obstinacy of one householder who would not let his fires be put out for what he considered so wrong a purpose however by bribing his servants they contrived to have them extinguished and on that morning raised their fire they then sacrificed a heifer cutting in pieces and burning while yet alive the diseased part they then lighted their own hearths from the pile and ended by feasting on the remains words of incantation were repeated by an old man from morven who came over as master of the ceremonies and who continued speaking all the time the fire was being raised this man was living a beggar at bellochroy asked to repeat the spell he said the sin of repeating it once had brought him to beggary and that he dared not say those words again the whole country believed him accursed728 from this account we see that in mull the kindling of the needfire as a remedy for cattle disease was accompanied by the sacrifice of one of the diseased animals and though the two customs are for the most part mentioned separately by our authorities we may surmise that they were often perhaps usually practised together for the purpose of checking the ravages of sickness in the herds729 the needfire in caithness in the county of caithness forming the extreme northeast corner of the mainland of scotland the practice of the needfire survived down at least to about 1788 we read that in those days when the stock of any considerable farmer was seized with the murrain he would send for one of the charmdoctors to superintend the raising of a needfire it was done by friction thus upon any small island where the stream of a river or burn ran on each side a circular booth was erected of stone and turf as it could be had in which a semicircular or highland couple of birch or other hard wood was set and in short a roof closed on it a straight pole was set up in the centre of this building the upper end fixed by a wooden pin to the top of the couple and the lower end in an oblong trink in the earth or floor and lastly another pole was set across horizontally having both ends tapered one end of which was supported in a hole in the side of the perpendicular pole and the other in a similar hole in the couple leg the horizontal stick was called the auger having four short arms or levers fixed in its centre to work it by the building having been thus finished as many men as could be collected in the vicinity being divested of all kinds of metal in their clothes etc would set to work with the said auger two after two constantly turning it round by the arms or levers and others occasionally driving wedges of wood or stone behind the lower end of the upright pole so as to press it the more on the end of the auger by this constant friction and pressure the ends of the auger would take fire from which a fire would be instantly kindled and thus the needfire would be accomplished the fire in the farmers house etc was immediately quenched with water a fire kindled from this needfire both in the farmhouses and offices and the cattle brought to feel the smoke of this new and sacred fire which preserved them from the murrain730 the needfire in caithness the last recorded case of the needfire in caithness happened in 1809 or 1810 at houstry dunbeath a crofter named david gunn had made for himself a kailyard and in doing so had wilfully encroached on one of those prehistoric ruins called brochs which the people of the neighbourhood believed to be a fairy habitation soon afterwards a murrain broke out among the cattle of the district and carried off many beasts so the wise men put their heads together and resolved to light a teineeigin or needfire as the best way of stopping the plague they cut a branch from a tree in a neighbouring wood stripped it of bark and carried it to a small island in the houstry burn every fire in the district having been quenched new fire was made by the friction of wood in the island and from this sacred flame all the hearths of the houses were lit afresh one of the sticks used in making the fire was preserved down to about the end of the nineteenth century apparently the mode of operation was the one known as the firedrill a pointed stick was twirled in a hole made in another stick till fire was elicited by the friction731 another account of the needfire in the highlands another account of the use of needfire in the highlands of scotland runs as follows when by the neglect of the prescribed safeguards against witchcraft the seeds of iniquity have taken root and a persons means are decaying in consequence the only alternative in this case is to resort to that grand remedy the tein econuch or forlorn fire which seldom fails of being productive of the best effects the cure for witchcraft called tein econuch is wrought in the following mannera consultation being held by the unhappy sufferer and his friends as to the most advisable measures of effecting a cure if this process is adopted notice is privately communicated to all those householders who reside within the nearest of two running streams to extinguish their lights and fires on some appointed morning on its being ascertained that this notice has been duly observed a spinningwheel or some other convenient instrument calculated to produce fire by friction is set to work with the most furious earnestness by the unfortunate sufferer and all who wish well to his cause relieving each other by turns they drive on with such persevering diligence that at length the spindle of the wheel ignited by excessive friction emits forlorn fire in abundance which by the application of tow or some other combustible material is widely extended over the whole neighbourhood communicating the fire to the tow the tow communicates it to a candle the candle to a firtorch the torch to a cartful of peats which the master of the ceremonies with pious ejaculations for the success of the experiment distributes to messengers who will proceed with portions of it to the different houses within the said two running streams to kindle the different fires by the influence of this operation the machinations and spells of witchcraft are rendered null and void732 alexander carmichaels account of the needfire in the highlands of scotland during the nineteenth century in various parts of the highlands of scotland the needfire was still kindled during the first half of the nineteenth century as we learn from the following account teineigin neidfire needfire forced fire fire produced by the friction of wood or iron against wood the fire of purification was kindled from the neidfire while the domestic fire on the hearth was rekindled from the purification fire on the knoll among other names the purification fire was called teine bheuil fire of beul and teine mor bheuil great fire of beul the fire of beul was divided into two fires between which people and cattle rushed australly for purposes of purification the ordeal was trying as may be inferred from phrases still current is teodha so na teine teodha bheuil hotter is this than the hot fire of beul replying to his grandchild an old man in lewis said mary sonnie it were worse for me to do that for thee than to go between the two great fires of beul the neidfire was resorted to in imminent or actual calamity upon the first day of the quarter and to ensure success in great or important events the needfire in arran the writer conversed with several persons who saw the neidfire made and who joined in the ceremony as mentioned elsewhere a woman in arran said that her father and the other men of the townland made the neidfire on the knoll on la buidhe bealltainyellow day of beltane they fed the fire from cuaile mor conaidh caoingreat bundles of sacred faggots brought to the knoll on beltane eve when the sacred fire became kindled the people rushed home and brought their herds and drove them through and round the fire of purification to sain them from the bana bhuitseach mhor nic creafain mac creafainthe great arch witch mac crauford now crawford that was in the second decade of this century the needfire in north uist john macphail middlequarter north uist said that the last occasion on which the neidfire was made in north uist was bliadhna an tsneachda bhuidhethe year of the yellow snow1829 the snow lay so deep and remained so long on the ground that it became yellow some suggest that the snow was originally yellow as snow is occasionally red this extraordinary continuance of snow caused much want and suffering throughout the isles the people of north uist extinguished their own fires and generated a purification fire at sail dharaich sollas the fire was produced from an oak log by rapidly boring with an auger this was accomplished by the exertions of naoi naoinear ciad ginealach macthe nine nines of firstbegotten sons from the neidfire produced on the knoll the people of the parish obtained fire for their dwellings many cults and ceremonies were observed on the occasion cults and ceremonies in which pagan and christian beliefs intermingled sail dharaich oak log obtained its name from the log of oak for the neidfire being there a fragment of this log riddled with auger holes marks a grave in cladh sgealoir the buryingground of sgealoir in the neighbourhood the needfire in reay sutherland mr alexander mackay edinburgh a native of reay sutherland saysmy father was the skipper of a fishing crew before beginning operations for the season the crew of the boat met at night in our house to settle accounts for the past and to plan operations for the new season my mother and the rest of us were sent to bed i lay in the kitchen and was listening and watching though they thought i was asleep after the men had settled their past affairs and future plans they put out the fire on the hearth not a spark being allowed to live they then rubbed two pieces of wood one against another so rapidly as to produce fire the men joining in one after the other and working with the utmost energy and never allowing the friction to relax from this frictionfire they rekindled the fire on the hearth from which all the men present carried away a kindling to their own homes whether their success was due to their skill their industry their perseverance or to the neidfire i do not know but i know that they were much the most successful crew in the place they met on saturday and went to church on sunday like the good men and the good christians they werea little of their pagan faith mingling with their christian belief i have reason to believe that other crews in the place as well as my fathers crew practised the neidfire a man at helmsdale sutherland saw the teineigin made in his boyhood the neidfire was made in north uist about the year 1829 in arran about 1820 in helmsdale about 1818 in reay about 1830733 the beltane fire a precaution against witchcraft from the foregoing account we learn that in arran the annual beltane fire was regularly made by the friction of wood and that it was used to protect men and cattle against a great witch when we remember that beltane eve or the eve of may day walpurgis night is the great witching time of the year throughout europe we may surmise that wherever bonfires have been ceremonially kindled on that day it has been done simply as a precaution against witchcraft indeed this motive is expressly alleged not only in scotland but in wales the isle of man and many parts of central europe734 it deserves further to be noticed that in north uist the wood used to kindle the needfire was oak and that the nine times nine men by whose exertions the flame was elicited were all firstborn sons apparently the firstborn son of a family was thought to be endowed with more magical virtue than his younger brothers similarly in the punjaub the supernatural power ascribed to the first born is not due to his being unlucky but the idea underlying the belief seems to be that being the first product of the parents he inherits the spiritual powers or magnetism in a high degree the success of such persons in stopping rain and hail and in stupefying snakes is proverbial it is believed that a first child born with feet forward can cure backache by kicking the patient in the back on a crossing735 the needfire in aberdeenshire in the northeast of aberdeenshire and the neighbourhood when the cattledisease known as the quarterill broke out the muckle wheel was set in motion and turned till fire was produced from this virgin flame fires were kindled in the byres at the same time if neighbours requested the favour live coals were given them to kindle fires for the purification of their homesteads and turning off the disease fumigating the byres with juniper was a method adopted to ward off disease such a fire was called needfyre the kindling of it came under the censure of the presbytery at times736 the needfire in perthshire in perthshire the needfire was kindled as a remedy for cattledisease as late as 1826 a wealthy old farmer having lost several of his cattle by some disease very prevalent at present and being able to account for it in no way so rationally as by witchcraft had recourse to the following remedy recommended to him by a weird sister in his neighbourhood as an effectual protection from the attacks of the foul fiend a few stones were piled together in the barnyard and woodcoals having been laid thereon the fuel was ignited by willfire that is fire obtained by friction the neighbours having been called in to witness the solemnity the cattle were made to pass through the flames in the order of their dignity and age commencing with the horses and ending with the swine the ceremony having been duly and decorously gone through a neighbouring farmer observed to the enlightened owner of the herd that he along with his family ought to have followed the example of the cattle and the sacrifice to baal would have been complete737 the needfire in ireland in county leitrim ireland in order to prevent fever from spreading all the fires on the townland and the two adjoining one on each side would be put out then the men of the three townlands would come to one house and get two large blocks of wood one would be set in the ground and the other one fitted with two handles placed on the top of it the men would then draw the upper block backwards and forwards over the lower until fire was produced by friction and from this the fires would be lighted again this would prevent the fever from spreading738 the use of the needfire a relic of a time when all fires were kindled by the friction of wood thus it appears that in many parts of europe it has been customary to kindle fire by the friction of wood for the purpose of curing or preventing the spread of disease particularly among cattle the mode of striking a light by rubbing two dry sticks against each other is the one to which all over the world savages have most commonly resorted for the sake of providing themselves with fire739 and we can scarcely doubt that the practice of kindling the needfire in this primitive fashion is merely a survival from the time when our savage forefathers lit all their fires in that way nothing is so conservative of old customs as religious or magical ritual which invests these relics of the past with an atmosphere of mysterious virtue and sanctity to the educated mind it seems obvious that a fire which a man kindles with the sweat of his brow by laboriously rubbing one stick against each other can possess neither more nor less virtue than one which he has struck in a moment by the friction of a lucifer match but to the ignorant and superstitious this truth is far from apparent and accordingly they take infinite pains to do in a roundabout way what they might have done directly with the greatest ease and what even when it is done is of no use whatever for the purpose in hand a vast proportion of the labour which mankind has expended throughout the ages has been no better spent it has been like the stone of sisyphus eternally rolled up hill only to revolve eternally down again or like the water poured for ever by the danaids into broken pitchers which it could never fill the belief that the needfire cannot kindle if any other fire remains alight in the neighbourhood the curious notion that the needfire cannot kindle if any other fire remains alight in the neighbourhood seems to imply that fire is conceived as a unity which is broken up into fractions and consequently weakened in exact proportion to the number of places where it burns hence in order to obtain it at full strength you must light it only at a single point for then the flame will burst out with a concentrated energy derived from the tributary fires which burned on all the extinguished hearths of the country so in a modern city if all the gas were turned off simultaneously at all the burners but one the flame would no doubt blaze at that one burner with a fierceness such as no single burner could shew when all are burning at the same time the analogy may help us to understand the process of reasoning which leads the peasantry to insist on the extinction of all common fires when the needfire is about to be kindled perhaps too it may partly explain that ceremonial extinction of all old fires on other occasions which is often required by custom as a preliminary to the lighting of a new and sacred fire740 we have seen that in the highlands of scotland all common fires were extinguished on the eve of mayday as a preparation for kindling the beltane bonfire by friction next morning741 and no doubt the reason for the extinction was the same as in the case of the needfire indeed we may assume with a fair degree of probability that the needfire was the parent of the periodic firefestivals at first invoked only at irregular intervals to cure certain evils as they occurred the powerful virtue of fire was afterwards employed at regular intervals to prevent the occurrence of the same evils as well as to remedy such as had actually arisen the needfire among the iroquois of north america the needfire of europe has its parallel in a ceremony which used to be observed by the iroquois indians of north america formerly when an epidemic prevailed among the iroquois despite the efforts to stay it it was customary for the principal shaman to order the fires in every cabin to be extinguished and the ashes and cinders to be carefully removed for it was believed that the pestilence was sent as a punishment for neglecting to rekindle new fire or because of the manner in which the fire then in use had been kindled so after all the fires were out two suitable logs of slippery elm ulmus fulva were provided for the new fire one of the logs was from six to eight inches in diameter and from eight to ten feet long the other was from ten to twelve inches in diameter and about ten feet long about midway across the larger log a cuneiform notch or cut about six inches deep was made and in the wedgeshaped notch punk was placed the other log was drawn rapidly to and fro in the cut by four strong men chosen for the purpose until the punk was ignited by the friction thus produced before and during the progress of the work of igniting the fire the shaman votively sprinkled tcarhuewe real tobacco three several times into the cuneiform notch and offered earnest prayers to the firegod beseeching him to aid to bless and to redeem the people from their calamities the ignited punk was used to light a large bonfire and then the head of every family was required to take home new fire to rekindle a fire in his or her fireplace742 9 the sacrifice of an animal to stay a cattleplague the burnt sacrifice of a calf in england and wales burnt sacrifice a pig in scotland sometimes apparently in england as well as in scotland the kindling of a needfire was accompanied by the sacrifice of a calf thus in northamptonshire at some time during the first half of the nineteenth century miss c and her cousin walking saw a fire in a field and a crowd round it they said what is the matter killing a calf what for to stop the murrain they went away as quickly as possible on speaking to the clergyman he made enquiries the people did not like to talk of the affair but it appeared that when there is a disease among the cows or the calves are born sickly they sacrifice ie kill and burn one for good luck743 it is not here said that the fire was a needfire of which indeed the two horrified ladies had probably never heard but the analogy of the parallel custom in mull744 renders it probable that in northamptonshire also the fire was kindled by the friction of wood and that the calf or some part of it was burnt in the fire certainly the practice of burning a single animal alive in order to save all the others would seem to have been not uncommon in england down to the nineteenth century thus a farmer in cornwall about the year 1800 having lost many cattle by disease and tried many remedies in vain consulted with some of his neighbours and laying their heads together they recalled to their recollections a tale which tradition had handed down from remote antiquity that the calamity would not cease until he had actually burned alive the finest calf which he had upon his farm but that when this sacrifice was made the murrain would afflict his cattle no more accordingly on a day appointed they met lighted a large fire placed the best calf in it and standing round the blazing pile drove the animal with pitchforks back into the flames whenever it attempted to escape thus the victim was burned alive to save the rest of the cattle745 there can be no doubt but that a belief prevailed until a very recent period amongst the small farmers in the districts remote from towns in cornwall that a living sacrifice appeased the wrath of god this sacrifice must be by fire and i have heard it argued that the bible gave them warranty for this belief while correcting these sheets i am informed of two recent instances of this superstition one of them was the sacrifice of a calf by a farmer near portreath for the purpose of removing a disease which had long followed his horses and his cows the other was the burning of a living lamb to save as the farmer said his flocks from spells which had been cast on em746 in a recent account of the firefestivals of wales we read that i have also heard my grandfather and father say that in times gone by the people would throw a calf in the fire when there was any disease among the herds the same would be done with a sheep if there was anything the matter with a flock i can remember myself seeing cattle being driven between two fires to stop the disease spreading when in later times it was not considered humane to drive the cattle between the fires the herdsmen were accustomed to force the animals over the wood ashes to protect them against various ailments747 writing about 1866 the antiquary w henderson says that a live ox was burned near haltwhistle in northumberland only twenty years ago to stop a murrain748 about the year 1850 disease broke out among the cattle of a small farm in the parish of resoliss black isle rossshire the farmer prevailed on his wife to undertake a journey to a wise woman of renown in banffshire to ask a charm against the effects of the ill eye the long journey of upwards of fifty miles was performed by the good wife and the charm was got one chief thing ordered was to burn to death a pig and sprinkle the ashes over the byre and other farm buildings this order was carried out except that the pig was killed before it was burned a more terrible sacrifice was made at times one of the diseased animals was rubbed over with tar driven forth set on fire and allowed to run till it fell down and died749 living animals have been burnt alive in sacrifice within memory to avert the loss of other stock the burial of three puppies brandisewise in a field is supposed to rid it of weeds throughout the rural districts of devon witchcraft is an article of current faith and the toad is thrown into the flames as an emissary of the evil one750 the calf is burnt in order to break a spell which has been cast on the herd but why we may ask should the burning alive of a calf or a sheep be supposed to save the rest of the herd or the flock from the murrain according to one writer as we have seen the burnt sacrifice was thought to appease the wrath of god751 the idea of appeasing the wrath of a ferocious deity by burning an animal alive is probably no more than a theological gloss put on an old heathen rite it would hardly occur to the simple mind of an english bumpkin who though he may be stupid is not naturally cruel and does not conceive of a divinity who takes delight in the contemplation of suffering to his thinking god has little or nothing to do with the murrain but witches illwishers and fairies have a great deal to do with it the english farmer who burned one of his lambs alive said that he did it to save his flocks from spells which had been cast on them and the scotch farmer who was bidden to burn a pig alive for a similar purpose but who had the humanity to kill the animal first believed that this was a remedy for the evil eye which had been cast upon his beasts again we read that a farmer who possessed broad acres and who was in many respects a sensible man was greatly annoyed to find that his cattle became diseased in the spring nothing could satisfy him but that they were bewitched and he was resolved to find out the person who had cast the evil eye on his oxen according to an ancientlyprescribed rule the farmer took one of his bullocks and bled it to death catching all the blood on bundles of straw the bloody straw was then piled into a heap and set on fire burning with a vast quantity of smoke the farmer expected to see the witch either in reality or in shadow amidst the smoke752 such reasons express the real beliefs of the peasants cattle like human beings were exposed to the influences of the evil eye of forespeaking and of the casting of evil witches and warlocks did the work of evil among their neighbours cattle if their anger had been aroused in any way the fairies often wrought injury amongst cattle every animal that died suddenly was killed by the dart of the fairies or in the language of the people was shotadead flint arrows and spearheads went by the name of faery dairts when an animal died suddenly the canny woman of the district was sent for to search for the faery dairt and in due course she found one to the great satisfaction of the owner of the dead animal753 mode in which the burning of a bewitched animal is supposed to break the spell but how we must still ask can burning an animal alive break the spell that has been cast upon its fellows by a witch or a warlock some light is thrown on the question by the following account of measures which rustic wiseacres in suffolk are said to have adopted as a remedy for witchcraft a woman i knew fortythree years had been employed by my predecessor to take care of his poultry at the time i came to make her acquaintance she was a bedridden toothless crone with chin and nose all but meeting she did not discourage in her neighbours the idea that she knew more than people ought to know and had more power than others had many years before i knew her it happened one spring that the ducks which were a part of her charge failed to lay eggs she at once took it for granted that the ducks had been bewitched this misbelief involved very shocking consequences for it necessitated the idea that so diabolical an act could only be combated by diabolical cruelty and the most diabolical act of cruelty she could imagine was that of baking alive in a hot oven one of the ducks and that was what she did the sequence of thought in her mind was that the spell that had been laid on the ducks was that of preternaturally wicked wilfulness that this spell could only be broken through intensity of suffering in this case death by burning that the intensity of suffering would break the spell in the one roasted to death and that the spell broken in one would be altogether broken that is in all the ducks shocking however as was this method of exorcising the ducks there was nothing in it original just about a hundred years before everyone in the town and neighbourhood of ipswich had heard and many had believed that a witch had been burnt to death in her own house at ipswich by the process of burning alive one of the sheep she had bewitched it was curious but it was as convincing as curious that the hands and feet of this witch were the only parts of her that had not been incinerated this however was satisfactorily explained by the fact that the four feet of the sheep by which it had been suspended over the fire had not been destroyed in the flames that had consumed its body754 according to a slightly different account of the same tragic incident the last of the ipswitch witches one grace pett laid her hand heavily on a farmers sheep who in order to punish her fastened one of the sheep in the ground and burnt it except the feet which were under the earth the next morning grace pett was found burnt to a cinder except her feet her fate is recorded in the philosophical transactions as a case of spontaneous combustion755 in burning the bewitched animal you burn the witch herself this last anecdote is instructive if perhaps not strictly authentic it shows that in burning alive one of a bewitched flock or herd what you really do is to burn the witch who is either actually incarnate in the animal or perhaps more probably stands in a relation of sympathy with it so close as almost to amount to identity hence if you burn the creature to ashes you utterly destroy the witch and thereby save the whole of the rest of the flock or herd from her abominable machinations whereas if you only partially burn the animal allowing some parts of it to escape the flames the witch is only halfbaked and her power for mischief may be hardly if at all impaired by the grilling we can now see that in such matters halfmeasures are useless to kill the animal first and burn it afterwards is a weak compromise dictated no doubt by a wellmeant but utterly mistaken kindness it is like shutting the stabledoor when the steed is stolen for obviously by leaving the animals and therefore the witchs body nearly intact at the moment of death it allows her soul to escape and return safe and sound to her own human body which all the time is probably lying quietly at home in bed and the same train of reasoning that justifies the burning alive of bewitched animals justifies and indeed requires the burning alive of the witches themselves it is really the only way of destroying them body and soul and therefore of thoroughly extirpating the whole infernal crew practice of burning cattle and sheep as sacrifices in the isle of man in the isle of man the practice of burning cattle alive in order to stop a murrain seems to have persisted down to a time within living memory on this subject i will quote the evidence collected by sir john rhys a respectable farmer from andreas told me that he was driving with his wife to the neighbouring parish of jurby some years ago and that on the way they beheld the carcase of a cow or an ox burning in a field with a woman engaged in stirring the fire on reaching the village to which they were going they found that the burning beast belonged to a farmer whom they knew they were further told it was no wonder that the said farmer had one of his cattle burnt as several of them had recently died whether this was a case of sacrifice or not i cannot say but let me give you another instance a man whom i have already mentioned saw at a farm nearer the centre of the island a live calf being burnt the owner bears an english name but his family has long been settled in man the farmers explanation to my informant was that the calf was burnt to secure luck for the rest of the herd some of which were threatening to die my informant thought there was absolutely nothing the matter with them except that they had too little to eat be that as it may the one calf was sacrificed as a burntoffering to secure luck for the rest of the cattle let me here also quote mr moores note in his manx surnames p 184 on the place name cabbal yn oural losht or the chapel of the burnt sacrifice this name he says records a circumstance which took place in the nineteenth century but which it is to be hoped was never customary in the isle of man a farmer who had lost a number of his sheep and cattle by murrain burned a calf as a propitiatory offering to the deity on this spot where a chapel was afterwards built hence the name particulars i may say of time place and person could be easily added to mr moores statement excepting perhaps as to the deity in question on that point i have never been informed but mr moore is probably right in the use of the capital d as the sacrificer is according to all accounts a highly devout christian one more instance an octogenarian woman born in the parish of bride and now living at kirk andreas saw when she was a lump of a girl of ten or fifteen years of age a live sheep being burnt in a field in the parish of andreas on mayday whereby she meant the first of may reckoned according to the old style she asserts very decidedly that it was son oural as a sacrifice as she put it and for an object to the public those were her words when she expressed herself in english further she made the statement that it was a custom to burn a sheep on old mayday for a sacrifice i was fully alive to the interest of this evidence and crossexamined her so far as her age allows of it and i find that she adheres to her statement with all firmness756 by burning a bewitched animal you compel the witch to appear but manxmen burn beasts when they are dead as well as when they are alive and their reasons for burning the dead animals may help us to understand their reasons for burning the living animals on this subject i will again quote sir john rhys when a beast dies on a farm of course it dies according to the oldfashioned view of things as i understand it from the influence of the evil eye or the interposition of a witch so if you want to know to whom you are indebted for the loss of the beast you have simply to burn its carcase in the open air and watch who comes first to the spot or who first passes by that is the criminal to be charged with the death of the animal and he cannot help coming theresuch is the effect of the fire a michael woman who is now about thirty related to me how she watched while the carcase of a bewitched colt was burning how she saw the witch coming and how she remembers her shrivelled face with nose and chin in close proximity according to another native of michael a wellinformed middleaged man the animal in question was oftenest a calf and it was wont to be burnt whole skin and all the object according to him is invariably to bring the bewitcher on the spot and he always comes but i am not clear what happens to him when he appears my informant added however that it was believed that unless the bewitcher got possession of the heart of the burning beast he lost all his power of bewitching757 magic sympathy between the witch and the bewitched animal these statements shew that in the isle of man the sympathetic relation between the witch and his or her animal victim is believed to be so close that by burning the animal you compel the witch to appear the original idea may have been that by virtue of a magic sympathy which binds the two together whatever harm you do to the animal is felt by the witch as if it were done to herself that notion would fully explain why manx people used also to burn bewitched animals alive in doing so they probably imagined that they were simultaneously burning the witch who had cast the spell on their cattle parallel belief in magic sympathy between the animal shape of a werewolf and his or her ordinary human shape by wounding the wolf you simultaneously wound the man or woman this explanation of the reason for burning a bewitched animal dead or alive is confirmed by the parallel belief concerning werewolves it is commonly supposed that certain men and women can transform themselves by magic art into wolves or other animals but that any wound inflicted on such a transformed beast a werewolf or other wereanimal is simultaneously inflicted on the human body of the witch or warlock who had transformed herself or himself into the creature this belief is widely diffused it meets us in europe asia and africa for example olaus magnus tells us that in livonia not many years before he wrote a noble lady had a dispute with her slave on the subject of werewolves she doubting whether there were any such things and he maintaining that there were to convince her he retired to a room from which he soon appeared in the form of a wolf being chased by the dogs into the forest and brought to bay the wolf defended himself fiercely but lost an eye in the struggle next day the slave returned to his mistress in human form but with only one eye758 again it happened in the year 1588 that a gentleman in a village among the mountains of auvergne looking out of the window one evening saw a friend of his going out to hunt he begged him to bring him back some of his bag and his friend said that he would well he had not gone very far before he met a huge wolf he fired and missed it and the animal attacked him furiously but he stood on his guard and with an adroit stroke of his hunting knife he cut off the right forepaw of the brute which thereupon fled away and he saw it no more he returned to his friend and drawing from his pouch the severed paw of the wolf he found to his horror that it was turned into a womans hand with a golden ring on one of the fingers his friend recognized the ring as that of his own wife and went to find her she was sitting by the fire with her right arm under her apron as she refused to draw it out her husband confronted her with the hand and the ring on it she at once confessed the truth that it was she in the form of a werewolf whom the hunter had wounded her confession was confirmed by applying the severed hand to the stump of her arm for the two fitted exactly the angry husband delivered up his wicked wife to justice she was tried and burnt as a witch759 it is said that a werewolf scouring the streets of padua was caught and when they cut off his four paws he at once turned into a man but with both his hands and feet amputated760 again in a farm of the french district of beauce there was once a herdsman who never slept at home these nocturnal absences naturally attracted attention and set people talking at the same time by a curious coincidence a wolf used to prowl round the farm every night and to excite the dogs in the farmyard to fury by thrusting his snout derisively through the cats hole in the great gate the farmer had his suspicions and he determined to watch one night when the herdsman went out as usual his master followed him quietly till he came to a hut where with his own eyes he saw the man put on a broad belt and at once turn into a wolf which scoured away over the fields the farmer smiled a sickly sort of smile and went back to the farm there he took a stout stick and sat down at the cats hole to wait he had not long to wait the dogs barked like mad a wolfs snout shewed through the hole down came the stick out gushed the blood and a voice was heard to say without the gate a good job too i had still three years to run next day the herdsman appeared as usual but he had a scar on his brow and he never went out again at night761 werewolves in china in china also the faith in similar transformation is reflected in the following tale a certain man in sungyang went into the mountains to gather fuel night fell and he was pursued by two tigers but scrambled up a tree out of their reach then said the one tiger to the other tiger if we can find chutushi we are sure to catch this man up the tree so off went one of them to find chutushi while the other kept watch at the foot of the tree soon after that another tiger leaner and longer than the other two appeared on the scene and made a grab at the mans coat but fortunately the moon was shining the man saw the paw and with a stroke of his axe cut off one of its claws the tigers roared and fled one after the other so the man climbed down the tree and went home when he told his tale in the village suspicion naturally fell on the said chutushi next day some men went to see him in his house they were told that they could not see him for he had been out the night before and had hurt his hand and he was now ill in bed so they put two and two together and reported him to the police the police arrived surrounded the house and set fire to it but chutushi rose from his bed turned into a tiger charged right through the police and escaped and to this day nobody ever knew where he went to762 werewolves among the toradjas of central celebes the toradjas of central celebes stand in very great fear of werewolves that is of men and women who have the power of transforming their spirits into animals such as cats crocodiles wild pigs apes deer and buffaloes which roam about battening on human flesh and especially on human livers while the men and women in their own proper human form are sleeping quietly in their beds at home among them a man is either born a werewolf or becomes one by infection for mere contact with a werewolf or even with anything that has been touched by his spittle is quite enough to turn the most innocent person into a werewolf nay even to lean your head against anything against which a werewolf has leaned his head suffices to do it the penalty for being a werewolf is death but the sentence is never passed until the accused has had a fair trial and his guilt has been clearly demonstrated by an ordeal which consists in dipping the middle finger into boiling resin if the finger is not burnt the man is no werewolf but if it is burnt a werewolf he most assuredly is so they take him away to a quiet spot and hack him to bits in cutting him up the executioners are naturally very careful not to be bespattered with his blood for if that were to happen they would of course be turned into werewolves themselves further they place his severed head beside his hinderquarters to prevent his soul from coming to life again and pursuing his depredations so great is the horror of werewolves among the toradjas and so great is their fear of contracting the deadly taint by infection that many persons have assured a missionary that they would not spare their own child if they knew him to be a werewolf763 now these people whose faith in werewolves is not a mere dying or dead superstition but a living dreadful conviction tell stories of werewolves which conform to the type which we are examining they say that once upon a time a werewolf came in human shape under the house of a neighbour while his real body lay asleep as usual at home and calling out softly to the mans wife made an assignation with her to meet him in the tobaccofield next day but the husband was lying awake and he heard it all but he said nothing to anybody next day chanced to be a busy one in the village for a roof had to be put on a new house and all the men were lending a hand with the work and among them to be sure was the werewolf himself i mean to say his own human self there he was up on the roof working away as hard as anybody but the woman went out to the tobaccofield and behind went unseen her husband slinking through the underwood when they were come to the field he saw the werewolf make up to his wife so out he rushed and struck at him with a stick quick as thought the werewolf turned himself into a leaf but the man was as nimble for he caught up the leaf thrust it into the joint of bamboo in which he kept his tobacco and bunged it up tight then he walked back with his wife to the village carrying the bamboo with the werewolf in it when they came to the village the human body of the werewolf was still on the roof working away with the rest the man put the bamboo in a fire at that the human werewolf looked down from the roof and said dont do that the man drew the bamboo from the fire but a moment afterwards he put it in the fire again and again the human werewolf on the roof looked down and cried dont do that but this time the man kept the bamboo in the fire and when it blazed up down fell the human werewolf from the roof as dead as a stone764 again the following story went round among the toradjas not so very many years ago the thing happened at soemara on the gulf of tomori it was evening and some men sat chatting with a certain hadji mohammad when it had grown dark one of the men went out of the house for something or other a little while afterwards one of the company thought he saw a stags antlers standing out sharp and clear against the bright evening sky so hadji mohammad raised his gun and fired a minute or two afterwards back comes the man who had gone out and says he to hadji mohammad you shot at me and hit me you must pay me a fine they searched him but found no wound on him anywhere then they knew that he was a werewolf who had turned himself into a stag and had healed the bulletwound by licking it however the bullet had found its billet for two days afterwards he was a dead man765 werewolves in the egyptian sudan in sennar a province of the egyptian sudan the hammeg and fungi enjoy the reputation of being powerful magicians who can turn themselves into hyaenas and in that guise scour the country at night howling and gorging themselves but by day they are men again it is very dangerous to shoot at such human hyaenas by night on the jebel bela mountain a soldier once shot at a hyaena and hit it but it dragged itself off bleeding in the darkness and escaped next morning he followed up the trail of blood and it led him straight to the hut of a man who was everywhere known for a wizard nothing of the hyaena was to be seen but the man himself was laid up in the house with a fresh wound and died soon afterwards and the soldier did not long survive him766 the werewolf story in petronius but the classical example of these stories is an old roman tale told by petronius it is put in the mouth of one niceros late at night he left the town to visit a friend of his a widow who lived at a farm five miles down the road he was accompanied by a soldier who lodged in the same house a man of herculean build when they set out it was near dawn but the moon shone as bright as day passing through the outskirts of the town they came amongst the tombs which lined the highroad for some distance there the soldier made an excuse for retiring behind a monument and niceros sat down to wait for him humming a tune and counting the tombstones to pass the time in a little he looked round for his companion and saw a sight which froze him with horror the soldier had stripped off his clothes to the last rag and laid them at the side of the highway then he performed a certain ceremony over them and immediately was changed into a wolf and ran howling into the forest when niceros had recovered himself a little he went to pick up the clothes but found that they were turned to stone more dead than alive he drew his sword and striking at every shadow cast by the tombstones on the moonlit road he tottered to his friends house he entered it like a ghost to the surprise of the widow who wondered to see him abroad so late if you had only been here a little ago said she you might have been of some use for a wolf came tearing into the yard scaring the cattle and bleeding them like a butcher but he did not get off so easily for the servant speared him in the neck after hearing these words niceros felt that he could not close an eye so he hurried away home again it was now broad daylight but when he came to the place where the clothes had been turned to stone he found only a pool of blood he reached home and there lay the soldier in bed like an ox in the shambles and the doctor was bandaging his neck then i knew said niceros that the man was a werewolf and never again could i break bread with him no not if you had killed me for it767 witches like werewolves can temporarily transform themselves into animals these stories may help us to understand the custom of burning a bewitched animal which has been observed in our own country down to recent times if indeed it is even now extinct for a close parallel may be traced in some respects between witches and werewolves like werewolves witches are commonly supposed to be able to transform themselves temporarily into animals for the purpose of playing their mischievous pranks768 and like werewolves they can in their animal disguise be compelled to unmask themselves to any one who succeeds in drawing their blood in either case the animalskin is conceived as a cloak thrown round the wicked enchanter and if you can only pierce the skin whether by the stab of a knife or the shot of a gun you so rend the disguise that the man or woman inside of it stands revealed in his or her true colours strictly speaking the stab should be given on the brow or between the eyes in the case both of a witch and of a werewolf769 and it is vain to shoot at a werewolf unless you have had the bullet blessed in a chapel of st hubert or happen to be carrying about you without knowing it a fourleaved clover otherwise the bullet will merely rebound from the werewolf like water from a ducks back770 however in armenia they say that the werewolf who in that country is usually a woman can be killed neither by shot nor by steel the only way of delivering the unhappy woman from her bondage is to get hold of her wolfs skin and burn it for that naturally prevents her from turning into a wolf again but it is not easy to find the skin for she is cunning enough to hide it by day771 so with witches it is not only useless but even dangerous to shoot at one of them when she has turned herself into a hare if you do the gun may burst in your hand or the shot come back and kill you the only way to make quite sure of hitting a witchanimal is to put a silver sixpence or a silver button in your gun772 for example it happened one evening that a native of the island of tiree was going home with a new gun when he saw a black sheep running towards him across the plain of reef something about the creature excited his suspicion so he put a silver sixpence in his gun and fired at it instantly the black sheep became a woman with a drugget coat wrapt round her head the man knew her quite well for she was a witch who had often persecuted him before in the shape of a cat773 wounds inflicted on an animal into which a witch has transformed herself are inflicted on the witch herself again the wounds inflicted on a witchhare or a witchcat are to be seen on the witch herself just as the wounds inflicted on a werewolf are to be seen on the man himself when he has doffed the wolfs skin to take a few instances out of a multitude a young man in the island of lismore was out shooting when he was near balnagown loch he started a hare and fired at it the animal gave an unearthly scream and then for the first time it occurred to him that there were no real hares in lismore he threw away his gun in terror and fled home and next day he heard that a notorious witch was laid up with a broken leg a man need be no conjuror to guess how she came by that broken leg774 again at thurso certain witches used to turn themselves into cats and in that shape to torment an honest man one night he lost patience whipped out his broadsword and put them to flight as they were scurrying away he struck at them and cut off a leg of one of the cats to his astonishment it was a womans leg and next morning he found one of the witches short of the corresponding limb775 glanvil tells a story of an old woman in cambridgeshire whose astral spirit coming into a mans house as he was sitting alone at the fire in the shape of an huge cat and setting her self before the fire not far from him he stole a stroke at the back of it with a firefork and seemed to break the back of it but it scambled from him and vanisht he knew not how but such an old woman a reputed witch was found dead in her bed that very night with her back broken as i have heard some years ago credibly reported776 in yorkshire during the latter half of the nineteenth century a parish clergyman was told a circumstantial story of an old witch named nanny who was hunted in the form of a hare for several miles over the westerdale moors and kept well away from the dogs till a black one joined the pack and succeeded in taking a bit out of one of the hares legs that was the end of the chase and immediately afterwards the sportsmen found old nanny laid up in bed with a sore leg on examining the wounded limb they discovered that the hurt was precisely in that part of it which in the hare had been bitten by the black dog and what was still more significant the wound had all the appearance of having been inflicted by a dogs teeth so they put two and two together777 the same sort of thing is often reported in lincolnshire one night said a servant from kirton lindsey my father and brother saw a cat in front of them father knew it was a witch and took a stone and hammered it next day the witch had her face all tied up and shortly afterwards died again a bardney bumpkin told how a witch in his neighbourhood could take all sorts of shapes one night a man shot a hare and when he went to the witchs house he found her plastering a wound just where he had shot the hare778 so in county leitrim in ireland they say that a hare pursued by dogs fled to a house near at hand but just as it was bolting in at the door one of the dogs came up with it and nipped a piece out of its leg the hunters entered the house and found no hare there but only an old woman and her side was bleeding so they knew what to think of her779 wounded witches in the vosges again in the vosges mountains a great big hare used to come out every evening to take the air at the foot of the mont des fourches all the sportsmen of the neighbourhood tried their hands on that hare for a month but not one of them could hit it at last one marksman more knowing than the rest loaded his gun with some pellets of a consecrated wafer in addition to the usual pellets of lead that did the trick if puss was not killed outright she was badly hurt and limped away uttering shrieks and curses in a human voice later it transpired that she was no other than the witch of a neighbouring village who had the power of putting on the shape of any animal she pleased780 again a hunter of travexin in the vosges fired at a hare and almost shot away one of its hind legs nevertheless the creature contrived to escape into a cottage through the open door immediately a childs cries were heard to proceed from the cottage and the hunter could distinguish these words daddy daddy come quick poor mammy has her leg broken781 wounded witches in swabia in swabia the witches are liable to accidents of the same sort when they go about their business in the form of animals for example there was a soldier who was betrothed to a young woman and used to visit her every evening when he was off duty but one evening the girl told him that he must not come to the house on friday nights because it was never convenient to her to see him then this roused his suspicion and the very next friday night he set out to go to his sweethearts house on the way a white cat ran up to him in the street and dogged his steps and when the animal would not make off he drew his sword and slashed off one of its paws on that the cat bolted the soldier walked on but when he came to his sweethearts house he found her in bed and when he asked her what was the matter she gave a very confused reply noticing stains of blood on the bed he drew down the coverlet and saw that the girl was weltering in her gore for one of her feet was lopped off so thats whats the matter with you you witch said he and turned on his heel and left her and within three days she was dead782 again a farmer in the neighbourhood of wiesensteig frequently found in his stable a horse over and above the four horses he actually owned he did not know what to make of it and mentioned the matter to the smith the smith said quietly the next time you see a fifth horse in the stable just you send for me well it was not long before the strange horse was there again and the farmer at once sent for the smith he came bringing four horseshoes with him and said im sure the nag has no shoes ill shoe her for you no sooner said than done however the smith overreached himself for next day when his friend the farmer paid him a visit he found the smiths own wife prancing about with horseshoes nailed on her hands and feet but it was the last time she ever appeared in the shape of a horse783 the millers wife and the two grey cats once more in silesia they tell of a millers apprentice a sturdy and industrious young fellow who set out on his travels one day he came to a mill and the miller told him that he wanted an apprentice but did not care to engage one because hitherto all his apprentices had run away in the night and when he came down in the morning the mill was at a stand however he liked the looks of the young chap and took him into his pay but what the new apprentice heard about the mill and his predecessors was not encouraging so the first night when it was his duty to watch in the mill he took care to provide himself with an axe and a prayerbook and while he kept one eye on the whirring humming wheels he kept the other on the good book which he read by the flickering light of a candle set on a table so the hours at first passed quietly with nothing to disturb him but the monotonous drone and click of the machinery but on the stroke of twelve as he was still reading with the axe lying on the table within reach the door opened and in came two grey cats mewing an old one and a young one they sat down opposite him but it was easy to see that they did not like his wakefulness and the prayerbook and the axe suddenly the old cat reached out a paw and made a grab at the axe but the young chap was too quick for her and held it fast then the young cat tried to do the same for the prayerbook but the apprentice gripped it tight thus balked the two cats set up such a squalling that the young fellow could hardly say his prayers just before one oclock the younger cat sprang on the table and fetched a blow with her right paw at the candle to put it out but the apprentice struck at her with his axe and sliced the paw off whereupon the two cats vanished with a frightful screech the apprentice wrapped the paw up in paper to shew it to his master very glad the miller was next morning when he came down and found the mill going and the young chap at his post the apprentice told him what had happened in the night and gave him the parcel containing the cats paw but when the miller opened it what was the astonishment of the two to find in it no cats paw but a womans hand at breakfast the millers young wife did not as usual take her place at the table she was ill in bed and the doctor had to be called in to bind up her right arm because in hewing wood so they said she had made a slip and cut off her own right hand but the apprentice packed up his traps and turned his back on that mill before the sun had set784 the analogy of werewolves confirms the view that the reason for burning bewitched animals is either to burn the witch or to compel her to appear it would no doubt be easy to multiply instances all equally well attested and authentic of the transformation of witches into animals and of the damage which the women themselves have sustained through injuries inflicted on the animals785 but the foregoing evidence may suffice to establish the complete parallelism between witches and werewolves in these respects the analogy appears to confirm the view that the reason for burning a bewitched animal alive is a belief that the witch herself is in the animal and that by burning it you either destroy the witch completely or at least unmask her and compel her to reassume her proper human shape in which she is naturally far less potent for mischief than when she is careering about the country in the likeness of a cat a hare a horse or what not this principle is still indeed clearly recognized by people in oldenburg though as might be expected they do not now carry out the principle to its logical conclusion by burning the bewitched animal or person alive instead they resort to a feeble and it must be added perfectly futile subterfuge dictated by a mistaken humanity or a fear of the police when anything living is bewitched in a house for example children or animals they burn or boil the nobler inwards of animals especially the hearts but also the lungs or the liver if animals have died they take the inwards of one of them or of an animal of the same kind slaughtered for the purpose but if that is not possible they take the inwards of a cock by preference a black one the heart lung or liver is stuck all over with needles or marked with a cross cut or placed on the fire in a tightly closed vessel strict silence being observed and doors and windows well shut when the heart boils or is reduced to ashes the witch must appear for during the boiling she feels the burning pain she either begs to be released or seeks to borrow something for example salt or a coal of fire or she takes the lid off the pot or tries to induce the person whose spell is on her to speak they say too that a woman comes with a spinningwheel if it is a sheep that has died you proceed in the same way with a tripe from its stomach and prick it with needles while it is on the boil instead of boiling it some people nail the heart to the highest rafter of the house or lay it on the edge of the hearth in order that it may dry up no doubt because the same thing happens to the witch we may conjecture that other sympathetic means of destruction are employed against witchcraft the following is expressly reported the heart of a calf that has died is stuck all over with needles enclosed in a bag and thrown into flowing water before sunset786 there is the same reason for burning bewitched things similarly by burning alive a person whose form a witch has assumed you compel the witch to disclose herself and the same thing holds good also of inanimate objects on which a witch has cast her spell in wales they say that if a thing is bewitched burn it and immediately afterwards the witch will come to borrow something of you if you give what she asks she will go free if you refuse it she will burn and a mark will be on her body the next day787 so too in oldenburg the burning of things that are bewitched or that have been received from witches is another way of breaking the spell it is often said that the burning should take place at a crossroad and in several places crossroads are shewn where the burning used to be performed as a rule while the things are burning the guilty witches appear though not always in their own shape at the burning of bewitched butter they often appear as cockchafers and can be killed with impunity victuals received from witches may be safely consumed if only you first burn a portion of them788 for example a young man in oldenburg was wooing a girl and she gave him two fine apples as a gift not feeling any appetite at the time he put the apples in his pocket and when he came home he laid them by in a chest two or three days afterwards he remembered the apples and went to the chest to fetch them but when he would have put his hand on them what was his horror to find in their stead two fat ugly toads in the chest he hastened to a wise man and asked him what he should do with the toads the man told him to boil the toads alive but while he was doing so he must be sure on no account to lend anything out of the house well just as he had the toads in a pot on the fire and the water began to grow nicely warm who should come to the door but the girl who had given him the apples and she wished to borrow something but he refused to give her anything rated her as a witch and drove her out of the house a little afterwards in came the girls mother and begged with tears in her eyes for something or other but he turned her out also the last word she said to him was that he should at least spare her daughters life but he paid no heed to her and let the toads boil till they fell to bits next day word came that the girl was dead789 can any reasonable man doubt that the witch herself was boiled alive in the person of the toads the burning alive of a supposed witch in ireland in 1895 moreover just as a witch can assume the form of an animal so she can assume the form of some other human being and the likeness is sometimes so good that it is difficult to detect the fraud however by burning alive the person whose shape the witch has put on you force the witch to disclose herself just as by burning alive the bewitched animal you in like manner oblige the witch to appear this principle may perhaps be unknown to science falsely so called but it is well understood in ireland and has been acted on within recent years in march 1895 a peasant named michael cleary residing at ballyvadlea a remote and lonely district in the county of tipperary burned his wife bridget cleary alive over a slow fire on the kitchen hearth in the presence of and with the active assistance of some neighbours including the womans own father and several of her cousins they thought that she was not bridget cleary at all but a witch and that when they held her down on the fire she would vanish up the chimney so they cried while she was burning away she goes away she goes even when she lay quite dead on the kitchen floor for contrary to the general expectation she did not disappear up the chimney her husband still believed that the woman lying there was a witch and that his own dear wife had gone with the fairies to the old rath or fort on the hill of kylenagranagh where he would see her at night riding a grey horse and roped to the saddle and that he would cut the ropes and that she would stay with him ever afterwards so he went with some friends to the fort night after night taking a big tableknife with him to cut the ropes but he never saw his wife again he and the men who had held the woman on the fire were arrested and tried at clonmel for wilful murder in july 1895 they were all found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to various terms of penal servitude and imprisonment the sentence passed on michael cleary was twenty years penal servitude790 sometimes bewitched animals are buried alive instead of being burned however our british peasants it must be confessed have not always acted up to the strict logical theory which seems to call for death by fire as the proper treatment both of bewitched animals and of witches sometimes perhaps in moments of weakness they have merely buried the bewitched animals alive instead of burning them for example in the year 1643 many cattle having died john brughe and neane nikclerith also one of the initiated conjoined their mutual skill for the safety of the herd the surviving animals were drove past a tub of water containing two enchanted stones and each was sprinkled from the liquid contents in its course one however being unable to walk was by force drawin out at the byre dure and the said johnne with nikclerith smelling the nois thereof said it wald not leive caused are hoill to be maid in maw greane quhilk was put quick in the hole and maid all the rest of the cattell theireftir to go over that place and in that devillische maner be charmeing they were cured791 again during the prevalence of a murrain about the year 1629 certain persons proposed to stay the plague with the help of a celebrated cureing stane of which the laird of lee was the fortunate owner but from this they were dissuaded by one who had sene bestiall curet be taking are quik seik ox and making are deip pitt and bureing him therin and be calling the oxin and bestiall over that place indeed issobell young the mother of these persons had herself endeavoured to check the progress of the distemper by taking ane quik ox with ane catt and ane grit quantitie of salt and proceeding to burie the ox and catt quik with the salt in ane deip hoill in the grund as ane sacrifice to the devill that the rest of the guidis might be fred of the seiknes or diseases792 writing towards the end of the eighteenth century john ramsay of ochtertyre tells us that the violent death even of a brute is in some cases held to be of great avail there is a disease called the black spauld which sometimes rages like a pestilence among black cattle the symptoms of which are a mortification in the legs and a corruption of the mass of blood among the other engines of superstition that are directed against this fatal malady the first cow seized with it is commonly buried alive and the other cattle are forced to pass backwards and forwards over the pit at other times the heart is taken out of the beast alive and then the carcass is buried it is remarkable that the leg affected is cut off and hung up in some part of the house or byre where it remains suspended notwithstanding the seeming danger of infection there is hardly a house in mull where these may not be seen this practice seems to have taken its rise antecedent to christianity as it reminds us of the pagan custom of hanging up offerings in their temples in breadalbane when a cow is observed to have symptoms of madness there is recourse had to a peculiar process they tie the legs of the mad creature and throw her into a pit dug at the door of the fold after covering the hole with earth a large fire is kindled upon it and the rest of the cattle are driven out and forced to pass through the fire one by one793 in this latter custom we may suspect that the fire kindled on the grave of the buried cow was originally made by the friction of wood in other words that it was a needfire again writing in the year 1862 sir arthur mitchell tells us that for the cure of the murrain in cattle one of the herd is still sacrificed for the good of the whole this is done by burying it alive i am assured that within the last ten years such a barbarism occurred in the county of moray794 calves killed and buried to save the rest of the herd sometimes however the animal has not even been buried alive it has been merely killed and then buried in this emasculated form the sacrifice we may say with confidence is absolutely useless for the purpose of stopping a murrain nevertheless it has been tried thus in lincolnshire when the cattle plague was so prevalent in 1866 there was i believe not a single cowshed in marshland but had its wicken cross over the door and other charms more powerful than this were in some cases resorted to i never heard of the use of the needfire in the marsh though it was i believe used on the wolds not many miles off but i knew of at least one case in which a calf was killed and solemnly buried feet pointing upwards at the threshold of the cowshed when our garthman told me of this i pointed out to him that the charm had failed for the disease had not spared that shed but he promptly replied yis but owd edwards

the productions of the earth that the caledonians paid a superstitious respect to the sun as was the practice among many other nations is evident not only by the sacrifice at baltein but upon many other occasions when a highlander goes to bathe or to drink waters out of a consecrated fountain he must always approach by going round the place from east to west on the south side in imitation of the apparent diurnal motion of the sun when the dead are laid in the earth the grave is approached by going round in the same manner the bride is conducted to her future spouse in the presence of the minister and the glass goes round a company in the course of the sun this is called in gaelic going round the right or the lucky way the opposite course is the wrong or the unlucky way and if a

contains no allusion to the sun compare m martin description of the western islands of scotland in j pinkertons voyages and travels iii 612 sq there was an ancient custom in the island of lewis to make a fiery circle about the houses corn cattle etc belonging to each particular family a man carried fire in his right hand and went round and it was called dessil from the right hand which in the ancient language is called dess there is another way of the dessil or carrying fire round about women before they are churched after childbearing and it is used likewise about children until they are christened both which are performed in the morning and at night this is only practised now by some of the ancient midwives i enquired their reason for this custom which i told them was altogether unlawful this disobliged them mightily insomuch that they would give me no satisfaction but others that were of a more agreeable temper told me that fireround was an effectual means to preserve both the mother and the infant from the power of evil spirits who are ready at such times to do mischief and sometimes carry away the infant and when they get them once in their possession return them poor meagre skeletons and these infants are said to have voracious appetites constantly craving for meat in this case it was usual with those who believed that their children were thus taken away to dig a grave in the fields upon quarterday and there to lay the fairy skeleton till next morning at which time the parents went to the place where they doubted not to find their own child instead of this skeleton some of the poorer sort of people in these islands retain the custom of performing these rounds sunways about the persons of their benefactors three times when they bless them and wish good success to all their enterprizes some are very careful when they set out to sea that the boat be first rowed about sunways and if this be neglected they are afraid their voyage may prove unfortunate probably the superstition was based entirely on the supposed luckiness of the right hand which accordingly in making a circuit round an object is kept towards the centre as to a supposed worship of

now the second instead of the first of november but we can hardly doubt that the saints who have taken possession of the first of november wrested it from the souls of the dead the original proprietors after all the saints are only one particular class of the souls of the dead so that the change which the church effected no doubt for the purpose of disguising the heathen character of the

used as sleeping places for the sons nephews and grandsons and their wives men and women of three generations could be often seen living in that way together and working together the land which was

interpretation of the firefestivals 1 on the firefestivals in general general resemblance of the european firefestivals to each other the foregoing survey of the popular firefestivals of europe suggests some general observations in the first place we can hardly help being struck by the resemblance which the ceremonies bear to each other at whatever time of the year and in whatever part of europe they are celebrated the custom of kindling great bonfires leaping over them and driving cattle through or round them would seem to have been practically universal throughout europe and the same may be said of the processions or races with blazing torches round fields orchards pastures or cattlestalls less widespread are the customs of hurling lighted discs into the air796 and trundling a burning wheel down hill797 for to judge by the evidence which i have collected these modes of distributing the beneficial influence of the fire have been confined in the main to central europe the ceremonial of the yule log is distinguished from that of the other firefestivals by the privacy and domesticity which characterize it but as we have already seen this distinction may well be due simply to the rough weather of midwinter which is apt not only to render a public assembly in the open air disagreeable but also at any moment to defeat the object of the assembly by extinguishing the allimportant fire under a downpour of rain or a fall of snow apart from these local or seasonal differences the general resemblance between the firefestivals at all times of the year and in all places is tolerably close and as the ceremonies themselves resemble each other so do the benefits which the people expect to reap from them whether applied in the form of bonfires blazing at fixed points or of torches carried about from place to place or of embers and ashes taken from the smouldering heap of fuel the fire is believed to promote the growth of the crops and the welfare of man and beast either positively by stimulating them or negatively by averting the dangers and calamities which threaten them from such causes as thunder and lightning conflagration blight mildew vermin sterility disease and not least of all witchcraft two explanations suggested of the firefestivals according to w mannhardt they are charms to secure a supply of sunshine according to dr e westermarck they are purificatory being intended to burn and destroy all harmful influences but we naturally ask how did it come about that benefits so great and manifold were supposed to be attained by means so simple in what way did people imagine that they could procure so many goods or avoid so many ills by the application of fire and smoke of embers and ashes in short what theory underlay and prompted the practice of these customs for that the institution of the festivals was the outcome of a definite train of reasoning may be taken for granted the view that primitive man acted first and invented his reasons to suit his actions afterwards is not borne out by what we know of his nearest living representatives the savage and the peasant two different explanations of the firefestivals have been given by modern enquirers on the one hand it has been held that they are suncharms or magical ceremonies intended on the principle of imitative magic to ensure a needful supply of sunshine for men animals and plants by kindling fires which mimic on earth the great source of light and heat in the sky this was the view of wilhelm mannhardt798 it may be called the solar theory on the other hand it has been maintained that the ceremonial fires have no necessary reference to the sun but are simply purificatory in intention being designed to burn up and destroy all harmful influences whether these are conceived in a personal form as witches demons and monsters or in an impersonal form as a sort of pervading taint or corruption of the air this is the view of dr edward westermarck799 and apparently of professor eugen mogk800 it may be called the purificatory theory obviously the two theories postulate two very different conceptions of the fire which plays the principal part in the rites on the one view the fire like sunshine in our latitude is a genial creative power which fosters the growth of plants and the development of all that makes for health and happiness on the other view the fire is a fierce destructive power which blasts and consumes all the noxious elements whether spiritual or material that menace the life of men of animals and of plants according to the one theory the fire is a stimulant according to the other it is a disinfectant on the one view its virtue is positive on the other it is negative the two explanations are perhaps not mutually exclusive yet the two explanations different as they are in the character which they attribute to the fire are perhaps not wholly irreconcilable if we assume that the fires kindled at these festivals were primarily intended to imitate the suns light and heat may we not regard the purificatory and disinfecting qualities which popular opinion certainly appears to have ascribed to them as attributes derived directly from the purificatory and disinfecting qualities of sunshine in this way we might conclude that while the imitation of sunshine in these ceremonies was primary and original the purification attributed to them was secondary and derivative such a conclusion occupying an intermediate position between the two opposing theories and recognizing an element of truth in both of them was adopted by me in earlier editions of this work801 but in the meantime dr westermarck has argued powerfully in favour of the purificatory theory alone and i am bound to say that his arguments carry great weight and that on a fuller review of the facts the balance of evidence seems to me to incline decidedly in his favour however the case is not so clear as to justify us in dismissing the solar theory without discussion and accordingly i propose to adduce the considerations which tell for it before proceeding to notice those which tell against it a theory which had the support of so learned and sagacious an investigator as w mannhardt is entitled to a respectful hearing 2 the solar theory of the firefestivals theory that the firefestivals are charms to ensure a supply of sunshine in an earlier part of this work we saw that savages resort to charms for making sunshine802 and it would be no wonder if primitive man in europe did the same indeed when we consider the cold and cloudy climate of europe during a great part of the year we shall find it natural that suncharms should have played a much more prominent part among the superstitious practices of european peoples than among those of savages who live nearer the equator and who consequently are apt to get in the course of nature more sunshine than they want this view of the festivals may be supported by various arguments drawn partly from their dates partly from the nature of the rites and partly from the influence which they are believed to exert upon the weather and on vegetation coincidence of two of the festivals with the solstices first in regard to the dates of the festivals it can be no mere accident that two of the most important and widely spread of the festivals are timed to coincide more or less exactly with the summer and winter solstices that is with the two turningpoints in the suns apparent course in the sky when he reaches respectively his highest and his lowest elevation at noon indeed with respect to the midwinter celebration of christmas we are not left to conjecture we know from the express testimony of the ancients that it was instituted by the church to supersede an old heathen festival of the birth of the sun803 which was apparently conceived to be born again on the shortest day of the year after which his light and heat were seen to grow till they attained their full maturity at midsummer therefore it is no very far fetched conjecture to suppose that the yule log which figures so prominently in the popular celebration of christmas was originally designed to help the labouring sun of midwinter to rekindle his seemingly expiring light attempt of the bushmen to warm up the fire of sirius in midwinter by kindling sticks the idea that by lighting a log on earth you can rekindle a fire in heaven or fan it into a brighter blaze naturally seems to us absurd but to the savage mind it wears a different aspect and the institution of the great firefestivals which we are considering probably dates from a time when europe was still sunk in savagery or at most in barbarism now it can be shewn that in order to increase the celestial source of heat at midwinter savages resort to a practice analogous to that of our yule log if the kindling of the yule log was originally a magical rite intended to rekindle the sun in the southern hemisphere where the order of the seasons is the reverse of ours the rising of sirius or the dog star in july marks the season of the greatest cold instead of as with us the greatest heat and just as the civilized ancients ascribed the torrid heat of midsummer to that brilliant star804 so the modern savage of south africa attributes to it the piercing cold of midwinter and seeks to mitigate its rigour by warming up the chilly star with the genial heat of the sun how he does so may be best described in his own words as follows805 the bushmen perceive canopus they say to a child give me yonder piece of wood that i may put the end of it in the fire that i may point it burning towards grandmother for grandmother carries bushman rice grandmother shall make a little warmth for us for she coldly comes out the sun806 shall warm grandmothers eye for us sirius comes out the people call out to one another sirius comes yonder they say to one another ye must burn a stick for us towards sirius they say to one another who was it who saw sirius one man says to the other our brother saw sirius the other man says to him i saw sirius the other man says to him i wish thee to burn a stick for us towards sirius that the sun may shining come out for us that sirius may not coldly come out the other man the one who saw sirius says to his son bring me the small piece of wood yonder that i may put the end of it in the fire that i may burn it towards grandmother that grandmother may ascend the sky like the other one canopus the child brings him the piece of wood he the father holds the end of it in the fire he points it burning towards sirius he says that sirius shall twinkle like canopus he sings he sings about canopus he sings about sirius he points to them with fire807 that they may twinkle like each other he throws fire at them he covers himself up entirely including his head in his kaross and lies down he arises he sits down while he does not again lie down because he feels that he has worked putting sirius into the suns warmth so that sirius may warmly come out the women go out early to seek for bushman rice they walk sunning their shoulder blades808 what the bushmen thus do to temper the cold of midwinter in the southern hemisphere by blowing up the celestial fires may have been done by our rude forefathers at the corresponding season in the northern hemisphere the burning wheels and discs of the firefestivals may be direct imitations of the sun not only the date of some of the festivals but the manner of their celebration suggests a conscious imitation of the sun the custom of rolling a burning wheel down a hill which is often observed at these ceremonies might well pass for an imitation of the suns course in the sky and the imitation would be especially appropriate on midsummer day when the suns annual declension begins indeed the custom has been thus interpreted by some of those who have recorded it809 not less graphic it may be said is the mimicry of his apparent revolution by swinging a burning tarbarrel round a pole810 again the common practice of throwing fiery discs sometimes expressly said to be shaped like suns into the air at the festivals may well be a piece of imitative magic in these as in so many cases the magic force may be supposed to take effect through mimicry or sympathy by imitating the desired result you actually produce it by counterfeiting the suns progress through the heavens you really help the luminary to pursue his celestial journey with punctuality and despatch the name fire of heaven by which the midsummer fire is sometimes popularly known811 clearly implies a consciousness of a connexion between the earthly and the heavenly flame the wheel sometimes used to kindle the fire by friction may also be an imitation of the sun again the manner in which the fire appears to have been originally kindled on these occasions has been alleged in support of the view that it was intended to be a mocksun as some scholars have perceived it is highly probable that at the periodic festivals in former times fire was universally obtained by the friction of two pieces of wood812 we have seen that it is still so procured in some places both at the easter and the midsummer festivals and that it is expressly said to have been formerly so procured at the beltane celebration both in scotland and wales813 but what makes it nearly certain that this was once the invariable mode of kindling the fire at these periodic festivals is the analogy of the needfire which has almost always been produced by the friction of wood and sometimes by the revolution of a wheel it is a plausible conjecture that the wheel employed for this purpose represents the sun814 and if the fires at the regularly recurring celebrations were formerly produced in the same way it might be regarded as a confirmation of the view that they were originally suncharms in point of fact there is as kuhn has indicated815 some evidence to shew that the midsummer fire was originally thus produced we have seen that many hungarian swineherds make fire on midsummer eve by rotating a wheel round a wooden axle wrapt in hemp and that they drive their pigs through the fire thus made816 at obermedlingen in swabia the fire of heaven as it was called was made on st vituss day the fifteenth of june by igniting a cartwheel which smeared with pitch and plaited with straw was fastened on a pole twelve feet high the top of the pole being inserted in the nave of the wheel this fire was made on the summit of a mountain and as the flame ascended the people uttered a set form of words with eyes and arms directed heavenward817 here the fixing of a wheel on a pole and igniting it suggests that originally the fire was produced as in the case of the needfire by the revolution of a wheel the day on which the ceremony takes place the fifteenth of june is near midsummer and we have seen that in masuren fire is or used to be actually made on midsummer day by turning a wheel rapidly about an oaken pole818 though it is not said that the new fire so obtained is used to light a bonfire however we must bear in mind that in all such cases the use of a wheel may be merely a mechanical device to facilitate the operation of firemaking by increasing the friction it need not have any symbolical significance the influence which the fires are supposed to exert on the weather and vegetation may be thought to be due to an increase of solar heat produced by the fires further the influence which these fires whether periodic or occasional are supposed to exert on the weather and vegetation may be cited in support of the view that they are suncharms since the effects ascribed to them resemble those of sunshine thus the french belief that in a rainy june the lighting of the midsummer bonfires will cause the rain to cease819 appears to assume that they can disperse the dark clouds and make the sun to break out in radiant glory drying the wet earth and dripping trees similarly the use of the needfire by swiss children on foggy days for the purpose of clearing away the mist820 may very naturally be interpreted as a suncharm again we have seen that in the vosges mountains the people believe that the midsummer fires help to preserve the fruits of the earth and ensure good crops821 in sweden the warmth or cold of the coming season is inferred from the direction in which the flames of the may day bonfire are blown if they blow to the south it will be warm if to the north cold822 no doubt at present the direction of the flames is regarded merely as an augury of the weather not as a mode of influencing it but we may be pretty sure that this is one of the cases in which magic has dwindled into divination so in the eifel mountains when the smoke blows towards the cornfields this is an omen that the harvest will be abundant823 but the older view may have been not merely that the smoke and flames prognosticated but that they actually produced an abundant harvest the heat of the flames acting like sunshine on the corn perhaps it was with this view that people in the isle of man lit fires to windward of their fields in order that the smoke might blow over them824 so in south africa about the month of april the matabeles light huge fires to the windward of their gardens their idea being that the smoke by passing over the crops will assist the ripening of them825 among the zulus also medicine is burned on a fire placed to windward of the garden the fumigation which the plants in consequence receive being held to improve the crop826 again the idea of our european peasants that the corn will grow well as far as the blaze of the bonfire is visible827 may be interpreted as a remnant of the belief in the quickening and fertilizing power of the bonfires the same belief it may be argued reappears in the notion that embers taken from the bonfires and inserted in the fields will promote the growth of the crops828 and it may be thought to underlie the customs of sowing flaxseed in the direction in which the flames blow829 of mixing the ashes of the bonfire with the seedcorn at sowing830 of scattering the ashes by themselves over the field to fertilize it831 and of incorporating a piece of the yule log in the plough to make the seeds thrive832 the opinion that the flax or hemp will grow as high as the flames rise or the people leap over them833 belongs clearly to the same class of ideas again at konz on the banks of the moselle if the blazing wheel which was trundled down the hillside reached the river without being extinguished this was hailed as a proof that the vintage would be abundant so firmly was this belief held that the successful performance of the ceremony entitled the villagers to levy a tax upon the owners of the neighbouring vineyards834 here the unextinguished wheel might be taken to represent an unclouded sun which in turn would portend an abundant vintage so the waggonload of white wine which the villagers received from the vineyards round about might pass for a payment for the sunshine which they had procured for the grapes similarly we saw that in the vale of glamorgan a blazing wheel used to be trundled down hill on midsummer day and that if the fire were extinguished before the wheel reached the foot of the hill the people expected a bad harvest whereas if the wheel kept alight all the way down and continued to blaze for a long time the farmers looked forward to heavy crops that summer835 here again it is natural to suppose that the rustic mind traced a direct connexion between the fire of the wheel and the fire of the sun on which the crops are dependent the effect which the bonfires are supposed to have in fertilizing cattle and women may also be attributed to an increase of solar heat produced by the fires but in popular belief the quickening and fertilizing influence of the bonfires is not limited to the vegetable world it extends also to animals this plainly appears from the irish custom of driving barren cattle through the midsummer fires836 from the french belief that the yulelog steeped in water helps cows to calve837 from the french and servian notion that there will be as many chickens calves lambs and kids as there are sparks struck out of the yule log838 from the french custom of putting the ashes of the bonfires in the fowls nests to make the hens lay eggs839 and from the german practice of mixing the ashes of the bonfires with the drink of cattle in order to make the animals thrive840 further there are clear indications that even human fecundity is supposed to be promoted by the genial heat of the fires in morocco the people think that childless couples can obtain offspring by leaping over the midsummer bonfire841 it is an irish belief that a girl who jumps thrice over the midsummer bonfire will soon marry and become the mother of many children842 in flanders women leap over the midsummer fires to ensure an easy delivery843 and in various parts of france they think that if a girl dances round nine fires she will be sure to marry within the year844 on the other hand in lechrain people say that if a young man and woman leaping over the midsummer fire together escape unsmirched the young woman will not become a mother within twelve months845 the flames have not touched and fertilized her in parts of switzerland and france the lighting of the yule log is accompanied by a prayer that the women may bear children the shegoats bring forth kids and the ewes drop lambs846 the rule observed in some places that the bonfires should be kindled by the person who was last married847 seems to belong to the same class of ideas whether it be that such a person is supposed to receive from or to impart to the fire a generative and fertilizing influence the common practice of lovers leaping over the fires hand in hand may very well have originated in a notion that thereby their marriage would be blessed with offspring and the like motive would explain the custom which obliges couples married within the year to dance to the light of torches848 and the scenes of profligacy which appear to have marked the midsummer celebration among the esthonians849 as they once marked the celebration of may day among ourselves may have sprung not from the mere license of holidaymakers but from a crude notion that such orgies were justified if not required by some mysterious bond which linked the life of man to the courses of the heavens at this turningpoint of the year the custom of carrying lighted torches about the country at the festival may be explained as an attempt to diffuse the suns heat at the festivals which we are considering the custom of kindling bonfires is commonly associated with a custom of carrying lighted torches about the fields the orchards the pastures the flocks and the herds and we can hardly doubt that the two customs are only two different ways of attaining the same object namely the benefits which are believed to flow from the fire whether it be stationary or portable accordingly if we accept the solar theory of the bonfires we seem bound to apply it also to the torches we must suppose that the practice of marching or running with blazing torches about the country is simply a means of diffusing far and wide the genial influence of the sunshine of which these flickering flames are a feeble imitation in favour of this view it may be said that sometimes the torches are carried about the fields for the express purpose of fertilizing them850 and for the same purpose live coals from the bonfires are sometimes placed in the fields to prevent blight851 on the eve of twelfth day in normandy men women and children run wildly through the fields and orchards with lighted torches which they wave about the branches and dash against the trunks of the fruittrees for the sake of burning the moss and driving away the moles and field mice they believe that the ceremony fulfils the double object of exorcizing the vermin whose multiplication would be a real calamity and of imparting fecundity to the trees the fields and even the cattle and they imagine that the more the ceremony is prolonged the greater will be the crop of fruit next autumn852 in bohemia they say that the corn will grow as high as they fling the blazing besoms into the air853 nor are such notions confined to europe in corea a few days before the new year festival the eunuchs of the palace swing burning torches chanting invocations the while and this is supposed to ensure bountiful crops for the next season854 the custom of trundling a burning wheel over the fields which used to be observed in poitou for the express purpose of fertilizing them855 may be thought to embody the same idea in a still more graphic form since in this way the mocksun itself not merely its light and heat represented by torches is made actually to pass over the ground which is to receive its quickening and kindly influence once more the custom of carrying lighted brands round cattle856 is plainly equivalent to driving the animals through the bonfire and if the bonfire is a suncharm the torches must be so also 3 the purificatory theory of the firefestivals theory that the fires at the festivals are purificatory being intended to burn up all harmful things thus far we have considered what may be said for the theory that at the european firefestivals the fire is kindled as a charm to ensure an abundant supply of sunshine for man and beast for corn and fruits it remains to consider what may be said against this theory and in favour of the view that in these rites fire is employed not as a creative but as a cleansing agent which purifies men animals and plants by burning up and consuming the noxious elements whether material or spiritual which menace all living things with disease and death the purificatory or destructive effect of the fires is often alleged by the people who light them the great evil against which the fire at the festivals is directed appears to be witchcraft first then it is to be observed that the people who practise the firecustoms appear never to allege the solar theory in explanation of them while on the contrary they do frequently and emphatically put forward the purificatory theory this is a strong argument in favour of the purificatory and against the solar theory for the popular explanation of a popular custom is never to be rejected except for grave cause and in the present case there seems to be no adequate reason for rejecting it the conception of fire as a destructive agent which can be turned to account for the consumption of evil things is so simple and obvious that it could hardly escape the minds even of the rude peasantry with whom these festivals originated on the other hand the conception of fire as an emanation of the sun or at all events as linked to it by a bond of physical sympathy is far less simple and obvious and though the use of fire as a charm to produce sunshine appears to be undeniable857 nevertheless in attempting to explain popular customs we should never have recourse to a more recondite idea when a simpler one lies to hand and is supported by the explicit testimony of the people themselves now in the case of the firefestivals the destructive aspect of fire is one upon which the people dwell again and again and it is highly significant that the great evil against which the fire is directed appears to be witchcraft again and again we are told that the fires are intended to burn or repel the witches858 and the intention is sometimes graphically expressed by burning an effigy of a witch in the fire859 hence when we remember the great hold which the dread of witchcraft has had on the popular european mind in all ages we may suspect that the primary intention of all these firefestivals was simply to destroy or at all events get rid of the witches who were regarded as the causes of nearly all the misfortunes and calamities that befall men their cattle and their crops860 amongst the evils for which the firefestivals are deemed remedies the foremost is cattledisease and cattledisease is often supposed to be an effect of witchcraft this suspicion is confirmed when we examine the evils for which the bonfires and torches were supposed to provide a remedy foremost perhaps among these evils we may reckon the diseases of cattle and of all the ills that witches are believed to work there is probably none which is so constantly insisted on as the harm they do to the herds particularly by stealing the milk from the cows861 now it is significant that the needfire which may perhaps be regarded as the parent of the periodic firefestivals is kindled above all as a remedy for a murrain or other disease of cattle and the circumstance suggests what on general grounds seems probable that the custom of kindling the needfire goes back to a time when the ancestors of the european peoples subsisted chiefly on the products of their herds and when agriculture as yet played a subordinate part in their lives witches and wolves are the two great foes still dreaded by the herdsman in many parts of europe862 and we need not wonder that he should resort to fire as a powerful means of banning them both among slavonic peoples it appears that the foes whom the needfire is designed to combat are not so much living witches as vampyres and other evil spirits863 and the ceremony as we saw aims rather at repelling these baleful beings than at actually consuming them in the flames but for our present purpose these distinctions are immaterial the important thing to observe is that among the slavs the needfire which is probably the original of all the ceremonial fires now under consideration is not a suncharm but clearly and unmistakably nothing but a means of protecting man and beast against the attacks of maleficent creatures whom the peasant thinks to burn or scare by the heat of the fire just as he might burn or scare wild animals again the bonfires are thought to avert hail thunder lightning and other maladies all of which are attributed to the maleficent arts of witches again the bonfires are often supposed to protect the fields against hail864 and the homestead against thunder and lightning865 but both hail and thunderstorms are frequently thought to be caused by witches866 hence the fire which bans the witches necessarily serves at the same time as a talisman against hail thunder and lightning further brands taken from the bonfires are commonly kept in the houses to guard them against conflagration867 and though this may perhaps be done on the principle of homoeopathic magic one fire being thought to act as a preventive of another it is also possible that the intention may be to keep witchincendiaries at bay again people leap over the bonfires as a preventive of colic868 and look at the flames steadily in order to preserve their eyes in good health869 and both colic and sore eyes are in germany and probably elsewhere set down to the machinations of witches870 once more to leap over the midsummer fires or to circumambulate them is thought to prevent a person from feeling pains in his back at reaping871 and in germany such pains are called witchshots and ascribed to witchcraft872 the burning wheels rolled down hills and the burning discs and brooms thrown into the air may be intended to burn the invisible witches but if the bonfires and torches of the firefestivals are to be regarded primarily as weapons directed against witches and wizards it becomes probable that the same explanation applies not only to the flaming discs which are hurled into the air but also to the burning wheels which are rolled down hill on these occasions discs and wheels we may suppose are alike intended to burn the witches who hover invisible in the air or haunt unseen the fields the orchards and the vineyards on the hillside873 certainly witches are constantly thought to ride through the air on broomsticks or other equally convenient vehicles and if they do so how can you get at them so effectually as by hurling lighted missiles whether discs torches or besoms after them as they flit past overhead in the gloom the south slavonian peasant believes that witches ride in the dark hailclouds so he shoots at the clouds to bring down the hags while he curses them saying curse curse herodias thy mother is a heathen damned of god and fettered through the redeemers blood also he brings out a pot of glowing charcoal on which he has thrown holy oil laurel leaves and wormwood to make a smoke the fumes are supposed to ascend to the clouds and stupefy the witches so that they tumble down to earth and in order that they may not fall soft but may hurt themselves very much the yokel hastily brings out a chair and tilts it bottom up so that the witch in falling may break her legs on the legs of the chair worse than that he cruelly lays scythes billhooks and other formidable weapons edge upwards so as to cut and mangle the poor wretches when they drop plump upon them from the clouds874 on this view the fertility supposed to follow the use of fire results indirectly from breaking the spells of witches on this view the fertility supposed to follow the application of fire in the form of bonfires torches discs rolling wheels and so forth is not conceived as resulting directly from an increase of solar heat which the fire has magically generated it is merely an indirect result obtained by freeing the reproductive powers of plants and animals from the fatal obstruction of witchcraft and what is true of the reproduction of plants and animals may hold good also of the fertility of the human sexes we have seen that the bonfires are supposed to promote marriage and to procure offspring for childless couples this happy effect need not flow directly from any quickening or fertilizing energy in the fire it may follow indirectly from the power of the fire to remove those obstacles which the spells of witches and wizards notoriously present to the union of man and wife875 on the whole the theory of the purificatory or destructive intention of the firefestivals seems the more probable on the whole then the theory of the purificatory virtue of the ceremonial fires appears more probable and more in accordance with the evidence than the opposing theory of their connexion with the sun but europe is not the only part of the world where ceremonies of this sort have been performed elsewhere the passage through the flames or smoke or over the glowing embers of a bonfire which is the central feature of most of the rites has been employed as a cure or a preventive of various ills we have seen that the midsummer ritual of fire in morocco is practically identical with that of our european peasantry and customs more or less similar have been observed by many races in various parts of the world a consideration of some of them may help us to decide between the conflicting claims of the two rival theories which explain the ceremonies as suncharms or purifications respectively notes 796 above pp 116 sq 119 143 165 166 168 sq 172 797 above pp 116 117 sq 119 141 143 161 162 sq 163 sq 173 191 201 798 w mannhardt der

powerful of all purificatory agents and again id iii 314 it is quite possible that in these customs the idea of the quickening power of fire may be combined with the conception of it as a purgative agent for the expulsion or destruction of evil beings such as witches and the vermin that destroy the fruits of the earth certainly the fires are often interpreted in the latter way by the persons who light them and this purgative use of the element comes out very prominently as we have seen in the general expulsion of demons from towns and villages but in the present class of cases this aspect of
