ligature is shown as oe preface it is hoped that the account given in the following pages of the lives of five great naturalists may not be found devoid of interest the work of each one of them marked a definite advance in the science of biology there is often among students of anatomy and physiology a tendency to imagine that the facts with which they are now being made familiar have all been established by recent observation and experiment but even the slight knowledge of the history of biology which may be obtained from a perusal of this little book will show that so far from such being the case this branch of science is of venerable antiquity and further if in the place of this misconception a desire is aroused in the reader for a fuller acquaintance with the writings of the early anatomists the chief aim of the author will have been fulfilled contents page hippocrates 1 aristotle 19 galen 45 vesalius 63 harvey 83 hippocrates hippocrates owing to the lapse of centuries very little is known with certainty of the life of hippocrates who was called with affectionate veneration by his successors the divine old man and who has been justly known to posterity as the father of medicine he was probably born about 470 bc and according to all accounts appears to have reached the advanced age of ninety years or more he must therefore have lived during a period of greek history which was characterized by great intellectual activity for he had as his contemporaries pericles the famous statesman the poets schylus sophocles euripides aristophanes and pindar the philosopher socrates with his disciples xenophon and plato the historians herodotus and thucydides and phidias the unrivalled sculptor in the island of cos where he was born stood one of the most celebrated of the temples of sculapius and in this templebecause he was descended from the asclepiadhippocrates inherited from his forefathers an important position among the asclepiads the habit of physical observation and even manual training in dissection were imparted traditionally from father to son from the earliest years thus serving as a preparation for medical practice when there were no written treatises to study1 although hippocrates at first studied medicine under his father he had afterwards for his teachers gorgias and democritus both of classic fame and herodicus who is known as the first person who applied gymnastic exercises to the cure of diseases the asclepions or temples of health were erected in various parts of greece as receptacles for invalids who were in the habit of resorting to them to seek the assistance of the god these temples were mostly situated in the neighbourhood of medicinal springs and each devotee at his entrance was made to undergo a regular course of bathing and purification probably his diet was also carefully attended to and at the same time his imagination was worked upon by music and religious ceremonies on his departure the restored patient usually showed his gratitude by presenting to the temple votive tablets setting forth the circumstances of his peculiar case the value of these to men about to enter on medical studies can be readily understood and it was to such treasures of recorded observationscollected during several generationsthat hippocrates had access from the commencement of his career owing to the peculiar constitution of the asclepions medical and priestly pursuits had before the time of hippocrates become combined and consequently although rational means were to a certain extent applied to the cure of diseases the more common practice was to resort chiefly to superstitious modes of working upon the imagination it is not surprising therefore to find that every sickness especially epidemics and plagues were attributed to the anger of some offended god and that penance and supplications often took the place of personal and domestic cleanliness fresh air and light it was hippocrates who emancipated medicine from the thraldom of superstition and in this way wrested the practice of his art from the monopoly of the priests in his treatise on the sacred disease possibly epilepsy he discusses the controverted question whether or not this disease was an infliction from the gods and he decidedly maintains that there is no such a thing as a sacred disease for all diseases arise from natural causes and no one can be ascribed to the gods more than another he points out that it is simply because this disease is unlike other diseases that men have come to regard its cause as divine and yet it is not really more wonderful than the paroxysms of fevers and many other diseases not thought sacred he exposes the cunning of the impostors who pretend to cure men by purifications and spells who give themselves out as being excessively religious and as knowing more than other people and he argues that whoever is able by purifications and conjurings to drive away such an affection will be able by other practices to excite it and according to this view its divine nature is entirely done away with neither truly he continues do i count it a worthy opinion to hold that the body of a man is polluted by the divinity the most impure by the most holy for were it defiled or did it suffer from any other thing it would be like to be purified and sanctified rather than polluted by the divinity as an additional argument against the cause being divine he adduces the fact that this disease is hereditary like other diseases and that it attacks persons of a peculiar temperament namely the phlegmatic but not the bilious and yet if it were really more divine than the others he justly adds it ought to befall all alike again speaking of a disease common among the scythians hippocrates remarks that the people attributed it to a god but that to me it appears that such affections are just as much divine as all others are and that no one disease is either more divine or more human than another but that all are alike divine for that each has its own nature and that no one arises without a natural cause from this it will be seen that hippocrates regarded all phenomena as at once divine and scientifically determinable in this respect it is interesting to compare him with one of his most illustrious contemporaries namely with socrates who distributed phenomena into two classes one wherein the connection of antecedent and consequent was invariable and ascertainable by human study and wherein therefore future results were accessible to a wellinstructed foresight the other which the gods had reserved for themselves and their unconditional agency wherein there was no invariable or ascertainable sequence and where the result could only be foreknown by some omen or prophecy or other special inspired communication from themselves each of these classes was essentially distinct and required to be looked at and dealt with in a manner radically incompatible with the other physics and astronomy in the opinion of socrates belonged to the divine class of phenomena in which human research was insane fruitless and impious2 hippocrates divided the causes of diseases into two classes the one comprehending the influence of seasons climates water situation and the like the other consisting of such causes as the amount and kind of food and exercise in which each individual indulges he considered that while heat and cold moisture and dryness succeeded one another throughout the year the human body underwent certain analogous changes which influenced the diseases of the period with regard to the second class of causes producing diseases he attributed many disorders to a vicious system of diet for excessive and defective diet he considered to be equally injurious in his medical doctrines hippocrates starts with the axiom that the body is composed of the four elementsair earth fire and water from these the four fluids or humours namely blood phlegm yellow bile and black bile are formed health is the result of a right condition and proper proportion of these humours disease being due to changes in their quality or distribution thus inflammation is regarded as the passing of blood into parts not previously containing it in the course of a disorder proceeding favourably these humours undergo spontaneous changes in quality this process is spoken of as coction and is the sign of returning health as preparing the way for the expulsion of the morbid mattersa state described as the crisis these crises have a tendency to occur at certain periods which are hence called critical days as the critical days answer to the periods of the process of coction they are to be watched with anxiety and the actual condition of the patient at these times is to be compared with the state which it was expected he ought to show from these observations the physician may predict the course which the remainder of the disease will probably take and derive suggestions as to the practice to be followed in order to assist nature in her operations hippocrates thus appears to have studied the natural history of diseases as stated above his practice was to watch the manner in which the humours were undergoing their fermenting coction the phenomena displayed in the critical days and the aspect and nature of the critical dischargesnot to attempt to check the process going on but simply to assist the natural operation his principles and practice were based on the theory of the existence of a restoring essence or physis penetrating through all creation the agent which is constantly striving to preserve all things in their natural state and to restore them when they are preternaturally deranged in the management of this vis medicatrix natur the art of the physician consisted attention therefore to regimen and diet was the principal remedy hippocrates employed nevertheless he did not hesitate when he considered that occasion required to administer such a powerful drug as hellebore in large doses the writings which are extant under the name of hippocrates cannot all be ascribed to him many were doubtless written by his family his descendants or his pupils others are productions of the alexandrian school some of these being considered by critics as wilful forgeries the high prices paid by the ptolemies for books of reputation probably having acted as inducements to such fraud the following works have generally been admitted as genuine 1 on airs waters and places 2 on ancient medicine 3 on the prognostics 4 on the treatment in acute diseases 5 on epidemics books i and iii 6 on wounds of the head 7 on the articulations 8 on fractures 9 on the instruments of reduction 10 the aphorisms seven books 11 the oath the works on fractures on the articulations on injuries to the head and on the instruments of reduction deal with anatomical or surgical matters and exhibit a remarkable knowledge of osteology and anatomy generally it has sometimes been doubted if hippocrates could ever have had opportunities of gaining this knowledge from dissections of the human body for it has been thought that the feeling of the age was diametrically opposed to such a practice and that hippocrates would not have dared to violate this feeling the language used however in some passages in the work on the articulations seems to put the matter beyond doubt thus he says in one place but if one will strip the point of the shoulder of the fleshy parts and where the muscle extends and also lay bare the tendon that goes from the armpit and clavicle to the breast etc and again further on in the same treatise it is evident then that such a case could not be reduced either by succussion or by any other method unless one were to cut open the patient and then having introduced the hand into one of the great cavities were to push outwards from within which one might do in the dead body but not at all in the living his descriptions of the vertebr with all their processes and ligaments as well as his account of the general characters of the internal viscera would not have been as free from error as they are if he had derived all his knowledge from the dissection of the inferior animals moreover it is indisputable that within less than a hundred years from the death of hippocrates the human body was openly dissected in the schools of alexandrianay further that even the vivisection of condemned criminals was not uncommon it would be unreasonable to suppose that such a practice as the former sprang up suddenly under the ptolemies and it seems therefore highly probable that it was known and tolerated in the time of hippocrates it is not surprising when we remember the rude appliances and methods which then obtained that in his knowledge of minute anatomy hippocrates should compare unfavourably with anatomists of the present day of histology and such other subjects as could not be brought within his direct personal observation the knowledge of hippocrates was necessarily defective thus he wrote of the tissues without distinguishing them confusing arteries veins and nerves and speaking of muscles vaguely as flesh but with matters within the reach of the ancient physicians own careful observation the case is very different this is well shown in his wonderful chapter on the clubfoot in which he not only states correctly the true nature of the malformation but gives some very sensible directions for rectifying the deformity in early life when human strength was not sufficient to restore a displaced limb he skilfully availed himself of all the mechanical powers which were then known he does not appear to have been acquainted with the use of pulleys for the purpose but the axles which he describes as being attached to the bench which bears his name scamnum hippocratis must have been quite capable of exercising the force required the work called the aphorisms which was probably written in the old age of hippocrates consists of more than four hundred short pithy sentences setting forth the principles of medicine physiology and natural philosophy a large number of these sentences are evidently taken from the authors other works especially those on air etc on prognostics and on the articulations they embody the result of a vast amount of observation and reflection and the majority of them have been confirmed by the experience of two thousand years a proof of the high esteem in which they have always been held is furnished by the fact that they have been translated into all the languages of the civilized world among others into hebrew arabic latin english dutch italian german and french the following are a few examples of these aphorisms spontaneous lassitude indicates disease old people on the whole have fewer complaints than the young but those chronic diseases which do befall them generally never leave them persons who have sudden and violent attacks of fainting without any obvious cause die suddenly of the constitutions of the year the dry upon the whole are more healthy than the rainy and attended with less mortality phthisis most commonly occurs between the ages of eighteen and thirtyfive years if one give to a person in fever the same food which is given to a person in good health what is strength to the one is disease to the other such food as is most grateful though not so wholesome is to be preferred to that which is better but distasteful life is short and the art long the opportunity fleeting experience fallacious and judgment difficult the physician must not only do his duty himself but must also make the patient the attendants and the externals cooperate hippocrates appears to have travelled a great deal and to have practised his art in many places far distant from his native island a few traditions of what he did during his long life remain but differences of opinion exist as to the truth of these stories thus one story says that when perdiccas the king of macedonia was supposed to be dying of consumption hippocrates discovered the disorder to be lovesickness and speedily effected a cure the details of this story scarcely seem to be worthy of credence more especially as similar legends have been told of entirely different persons belonging to widely different times there are however some reasons for believing that hippocrates visited the macedonian court in the exercise of his professional duties for he mentions in the course of his writings among places which he had visited several which were situated in macedonia and further his son thessalus appears to have afterwards been court physician to archelaus king of macedonia another story connects the name of hippocrates with the great plague which occurred at athens in the time of the peloponnesian war it is said that hippocrates advised the lighting of great fires with wood of some aromatic kind probably some species of pine these being kindled all about the city stayed the progress of the pestilence others besides hippocrates are however famous for having successfully adopted this practice a third legend states that the king of persia pursuing the plan which in the two celebrated instances of themistocles and pausanias had proved successful of attracting to his side the most distinguished persons in greece wrote to hippocrates asking him to pay a visit to his court and that hippocrates refused to go although the story is discarded by many scholars it is worthy of note that ctesias a kinsman and contemporary of hippocrates is mentioned by xenophon in the anabasis as being in the service of the king of persia and with regard to the refusal of the venerable physician to comply with the kings request one cannot lose sight of the fact that such refusal was the only course consistent with the opinions he professed of a monarchical form of government after his various travels hippocrates as seems to be pretty generally admitted spent the latter portion of his life in thessaly and died at larissa at a very advanced age it is difficult to speak of the skill and painstaking perseverance of hippocrates in terms which shall not appear exaggerated and extravagant his method of cultivating medicine was in the true spirit of the inductive philosophy his descriptions were all derived from careful observation of its phenomena and as a result the greater number of his deductions have stood unscathed the test of twenty centuries still more difficult is it to speak with moderation of the candour which impelled hippocrates to confess errors into which in his earlier practice he had fallen or of that freedom from superstition which entitled him to be spoken of as a man who knew not how to deceive or be deceived qui tam fallere quam falli nescit or lastly of that purity of character and true nobility of soul which are brought so distinctly to light in the words of the oath translated below i swear by apollo the physician and sculapius and i call hygeia and panacea and all the gods and goddesses to witness that to the best of my power and judgment i will keep

aristotle vol i p 3 2 grotes history of greece vol i p 358 aristotle aristotle about the time that hippocrates died aristotle who may be regarded as the founder of the science of natural history was born bc 384 in stagira an unimportant hellenic colony in thrace near the macedonian frontier his father was a distinguished physician and like hippocrates boasted descent from the asclepiad the importance attached by the asclepiads to the habit of physical observation which has been already referred to in the life of hippocrates secured for aristotle from his earliest years that familiarity with biological studies which is so clearly evident in many of his works both parents of aristotle died when their son was still a youth and in consequence of this he went to reside with proxenus a native of atarneus who had settled at stagira subsequently he went to athens and joined the school of plato here he remained for about twenty years and applied himself to study with such energy that he became preeminent even in that distinguished band of philosophers he is said to have been spoken of by plato as the intellect of the school and to have been compared by him to a spirited colt that required the application of the rein to restrain its ardour aristotle probably wrote at this time some philosophical works the fame of which reached the ears of philip king of macedonia and added to the reputation which the young philosopher had already made with that monarch for philip is said to have written to him on the occasion of alexanders birth bc 356 king philip of macedonia to aristotle greeting know that a son has been born to me i thank the gods not so much that they have given him to me as that they have permitted him to be born in the time of aristotle i hope that thou wilt form him to be a king worthy to succeed me and to rule the macedonians after the death of plato which occurred in 347 bc aristotle quitted athens and went to atarneus where he stayed with hermias who was then despot of that town hermias was a remarkable man who from being a slave had contrived to raise himself to the supreme power he had been at athens and had heard platos lectures and had there formed a friendship for aristotle with this man the philosopher remained for three years and was then compelled suddenly to seek refuge in mitylene owing to the perfidious murder of hermias the latter was decoyed out of the town by the persian general seized and sent prisoner to artaxerxes by whom he was hanged as a rebel on leaving atarneus aristotle took with him a niece of hermias named pythias whom he afterwards married she died young leaving an infant daughter two or three years after this aristotle became tutor to alexander who was then about thirteen years old the philosopher seems to have been a favourite with both the king and the prince and in gratitude for his services philip rebuilt stagira and restored it to its former inhabitants who had either been dispersed or carried into slavery the king is said also to have established there a school for aristotle the high respect in which alexander held his teacher is expressed in his saying that he honoured him no less than his own father for while to one he owed life to the other he owed all that made life valuable in 336 bc alexander who was then only about twenty years of age became king and aristotle soon afterwards quitted macedonia and took up his residence in athens once more after an absence of about twelve years here he opened a school in the lycum a gymnasium on the eastern side of the city and continued his work there for about twelve years during which time alexander was making his brilliant conquests the lectures were given for the most part while walking in the garden and in consequence perhaps of this the sect received the name of the peripatetics the discourses were of two kindsthe esoteric or abstruse and the exoteric or familiar the former being delivered to the more advanced pupils only during the greater part of this time aristotle kept up correspondence with alexander who is said3 to have placed at his disposal thousands of men who were busily employed in collecting objects and in making observations for the completion of the philosophers zoological researches alexander is moreover said to have given the philosopher eight hundred talents for the same purpose in spite of these marks of friendship and respect alexander who was fast becoming intoxicated with success and corrupted by asiatic influences gradually cooled in his attachment towards aristotle this may have been hastened by several causes and among others by the freedom of speech and republican opinions of callisthenes a kinsman and disciple of aristotle who had been by the latters influence appointed to attend on alexander callisthenes proved so unpopular that the king seems to have availed himself readily of the first plausible pretext for putting him to death and to have threatened his former friend and teacher with a similar punishment the latter for his part probably had a deep feeling of resentment towards the destroyer of his kinsman meanwhile the athenians knew nothing of these altered relations between aristotle and alexander but continued to regard the philosopher as thoroughly imbued with kingly notions in spite of his writings being quite to the contrary so that he was an object of suspicion and dislike to the athenian patriots nevertheless as long as alexander was alive aristotle was safe from molestation as soon however as alexanders death became known the antimacedonian feeling of the athenians burst forth and found a victim in the philosopher a charge of impiety was brought against him it was alleged that he had paid divine honours to his wife pythias and to his friend hermias now for the latter a eunuch who from the rank of a slave had raised himself to the position of despot over a free grecian community so far from coupling his name as aristotle had done in his hymn with the greatest personages of hellenic mythology the athenian public felt that no contempt was too bitter to escape the storm the philosopher retired to chalcis in euboea then under garrison by antipater the governor of macedonia remarking in a letter written afterwards that he did so in order that the athenians might not have the opportunity of sinning a second time against philosophy the allusion being of course to the fate of socrates he probably intended to return to athens again so soon as the political troubles had abated but in september 322 bc he died at chalcis an overwrought mind coupled with indigestion and weakness of the stomach from which he had long suffered was most probably the cause of death some of his detractors however have asserted that he took poison and others that he drowned himself in the euboean euripus it is not easy to arrive at a just estimate of the character of aristotle by some of his successors he has been reproached with ingratitude to his teacher plato with servility to macedonian power and with love of costly display how far these two last charges are due to personal slander it is impossible to say the only ground for the first charge is that he criticised adversely some of platos doctrines the manuscripts of aristotles works passed through many vicissitudes at the death of the philosopher they were bequeathed to theophrastus who continued chief of the peripatetic school for thirtyfive years theophrastus left them with his own works to a philosophical friend and pupil neleus who conveyed them from athens to his residence at scepsis in asia minor about thirty or forty years after the death of theophrastus the kings of pergamus to whom the city of scepsis belonged began collecting books to form a library on the alexandrian plan this led the heirs of neleus to conceal their literary treasures in a cellar and there the manuscripts remained for nearly a century and a half exposed to injury from damp and worms at length they were sold to apellicon a resident at athens who was attached to the peripatetic sect many of the manuscripts were imperfect having become wormeaten or illegible these defects apellicon attempted to remedy but being a lover of books rather than a philosopher he performed the work somewhat unskilfully when athens was taken by sylla 86 bc the library of apellicon was transported to rome there various literary greeks obtained access to it and among others tyrannion a grammarian and friend of cicero did good service in the work of correction andronicus of rhodes afterwards arranged the whole into sections and published the manuscripts with a tabulated list the three principal works on biology which are extant are the history of animals on the parts of animals on the generation of animals the other biological works are on the motion of animals on respiration parva naturaliaa series of essays which are planned to form an entire work on sense and the sensible the history of animals is the largest and most important of aristotles works on biology it contains a vast amount of information not very methodically arranged and spoiled by the occurrence here and there of very gross errors it consists of nine books the first book opens with a division of the body into similar and dissimilar parts besides thus differing in their parts animals also differ in their mode of life their actions and dispositions thus some are aquatic others terrestrial of the former some breathe water others air and some neither of aquatic animals some inhabit the sea and others rivers lakes or marshes again some animals are locomotive and others are stationary some follow a leader others act independently various differences are in this way pointed out and there is no lack of illustration and detail but a suspicion is excited that the generalizations are sometimes based upon insufficient facts the book closes with a description of the different parts of the human body both internal and external in speaking of the ear aristotle seems to have been aware of what we now call the eustachian tube for he says there is no passage from the ear into the brain but there is to the roof of the mouth4 in the second book he passes on to describe the organs of animals the animals are dealt with in groupsviviparous and oviparous quadrupeds fish serpents birds etc the ape elephant chameleon and some others are especially noticed the third book continues the description of the internal organs references which are made to a diagram by letters a b c d show that the work was originally illustrated at the close of this book aristotle has some remarks on milk and mentions the occasional appearance of milk in male animals he speaks of a male goat at lemnos which yielded so much that cakes of cheese were made from it similar instances of this phenomenon have been recorded by humboldt burdach geoffroy st hilaire and others in the first four chapters of the fourth book the anatomy of the invertebrata is dealt with and the accounts given of certain mollusca and crustacea are very careful and minute the rest of the book is devoted to a description of the organs of sense and voice of sleep and the distinctions of sex the accurate knowledge which aristotle exhibits of the anatomy and habits of marine animals such as the cephalopoda and the larger crustacea leaves no doubt that he derived it from actual observation professor owen says respecting the living habits of the cephalopoda aristotle is more rich in detail than any other zoological author what is now spoken of as the hectocotylization of one or more of the arms of the male cephalopod did not escape aristotles eye and while he speaks of the teeth and that which serves these animals for a tongue it is plain from the context that he means in the one case the two halves of the parrotlike beak and in the other the anterior end of the odontophore books five to seven deal with the subject of generation the eighth book contains a variety of details respecting animals their food migrations hibernation and diseases with the influence of climate and locality upon them the ninth book describes the habits and instincts of animals the details are interesting but there is as usual very little attempt at classification disjointed statements and sudden digressions occur the subjects being treated in the order in which they presented themselves to the author such curious statements as the following are met with the raven is an enemy to the bull and the ass for it flies round them and strikes their eyes if a person takes a goat by the beard all the rest of the herd stand by as if infatuated and look at it female stags are captured by the sound of the pipe and by singing when two persons go out to capture them one shows himself and either plays upon a pipe or sings and the other strikes behind when the first gives him the signal swans have the power of song especially when near the end of their life for they then fly out to sea and some persons sailing near the coast of libya have met many of them in the sea singing a mournful song and have afterwards seen some of them die of all wild animals the elephant is the most tame and gentle for many of them are capable of instruction and intelligence and they have been taught to worship the king in the work on the parts of animals the author considers not only the phenomena of life exhibited by each species but also the cause or causes to which these phenomena are attributable after a general introduction he proceeds to enumerate the three degrees of composition viz 1 composition out of what some call the elements such as air earth water and fire or out of the elementary forces hot and cold solid and fluid which form the material of all compound substances 2 composition out of these primary substances of the homogeneous parts of animals eg blood fat marrow brain flesh and bone 3 composition into the heterogeneous parts or organs these parts he describes in detail considering those belonging to sanguineous animals first and most fully these divisions correspond roughly to the threefold study of structure which we nowadays recognize as chemical histological and anatomical as examples of aristotles method of treatment his descriptions of blood the brain the heart and the lung may be considered of the blood he says what are called fibres are found in the blood of some animals but not of all there are none for instance in the blood of deer and of roes and for this reason the blood of such animals as these never coagulates too great an excess of water makes animals timorous such animals on the other hand as have thick and abundant fibres in their blood are of a more choleric temperament and liable to bursts of passion bulls and boars are choleric for their blood is exceedingly rich in fibres and the bulls at any rate coagulates more rapidly than that of any other animal if these fibres are taken out of the blood the fluid that remains will no longer coagulate from these quotations it will be noted that aristotle attributed the coagulum to the presence of fibres and in this he anticipated malpighis discovery made in the seventeenth century his remarks on the proportion of coagulum and serum in different animals which is enlarged upon in the history of animals5 harmonize with modern observations in another of his works6 he remarks that the blood in certain diseased conditions will not coagulate this is known to be the case in cholera certain fevers asphyxia etc and the fact was probably obtained from hippocrates although aristotle speaks here of entire absence of coagulation in the blood of the deer and the roe in the history of animals he admits an imperfect coagulation for he says so that their blood does not coagulate like that of other animals the animals named are commonly hunted and it was probably after they had been hunted to death that he examined them now it is generally admitted that coagulation under such circumstances is imperfect and even uncommon the statement as to the richness in fibres of the blood of bulls and boars has been confirmed by some modern investigations which have shown that the clot bears a proportion to the strength and ferocity of the animal the remarks however as to the relative rapidity of coagulation would appear to be contradicted by later observations for thackrah came to the conclusion that coagulation commenced sooner in small and weak animals than in strong of the brain aristotle makes the following among other assertions of all parts of the body there is none so cold as the brain of all the fluids of the body it is the one that has the least blood for in fact it has no blood at all in its proper substance that it has no continuity with the organs of sense is plain from simple inspection and still more closely shown by the fact that when it is touched no sensation is produced the brain tempers the heat and seething of the heart in order that it may not itself be absolutely without heat bloodvessels from the aorta end in the membrane which surrounds the brain of all animals man has the largest brain in proportion to his size and it is larger in men than in women this is because the region of the heart and of the lung is hotter and richer in blood in man than in any other animal and in men than in women this again explains why man alone of animals stands erect for the heat overcoming any opposite inclination makes growth take its own line of direction which is from the centre of the body upwards man again has more sutures in his skull than any other animal and the male more than the female the explanation is to be found in the greater size of the brain which demands free ventilation proportionate to its bulk there is no brain in the hinder part of the head the brain in all animals that have one is placed in the front part of the head because the heart from which sensation proceeds is in the front part of the body although it would perhaps be difficult to find anywhere as many errors in as few words yet it should be observed that aristotle here shows himself to have been aware of the existence of the membranes of the brainthe pia mater and the dura mater and elsewhere7 he says more explicitly two membranes enclose the brain that about the skull is the stronger the inner membrane is slighter than the outer one and further it should be noted that he describes the latter membrane as a vascular one the fact of the brain substance being insensible to mechanical irritation was known to aristotle and may have been learnt from the practice of hippocrates lastly it should be remembered thatthough this may have been but a lucky guess on aristotles partthe relative weight of brain to the entire body has been shown with few exceptions to be greater in man than in any other animal in describing the heart aristotle says the heart lies about the centre of the body but rather in its upper than in its lower half and also more in front than behind in man it inclines a little towards the left so that it may counterbalance the chilliness of that side it is hollow to serve for the reception of the blood while its wall is thick that it may serve to protect the source of heat for here and here alone in all the viscera and in fact in all the body there is blood without bloodvessels the blood elsewhere being always contained within vessels the heart is the first of all the parts of the body to be formed and no sooner is it formed than it contains blood for no sooner is the embryo formed than its heart is seen in motion like a living creature and this before any of the other parts the heart is abundantly supplied with sinews in no animal does the heart contain a bone certainly in none of those that we ourselves have inspected with the exception of the horse and a certain kind of ox in animals of great size the heart has three cavities in smaller animals it has two and in all it has at least one it will be observed that here aristotle so correctly describes the position of the human heart as to render it probable that he is speaking from actual inspection although man is not the only animal in which the heart is turned towards the left in contrasting the heart with the other viscera he appears to have overlooked the existence of the coronary vessels and to have imagined that the nutrition of the heart was effected directly by the blood in its cavities although the heart is not really the first part to appear the observation of its very early appearance in the embryo which he treats more fully elsewhere8 is alone enough to establish his reputation as an original observer it is remarkable that aristotle should have overlooked the presence of the valves of the heart the structure and functions of which were fully investigated within thirty years of his death by the anatomists of the alexandrian school this is the more remarkable as he calls attention here and in the history of animals to the sinews or tendons neura with which he says the heart is supplied and by which he probably meant chiefly the chord tendine the bone in the heart of which he speaks was probably the cruciform ossification which is normally found in the ox and the stag below the origin of the aorta it is found in the horse only in advanced age or under abnormal conditions the statement that the heart contains no more than three chambers has always been considered as a very gross blunder on the part of aristotle even cuvier who generally lavishes upon the philosopher the most extravagant praise sneers at this professor huxley9 however has shown by a comparison of several passages from the history of animals that what we now call the right auricle was regarded by the author as a venous sinus as being a part not of the heart but of the great vein ie the superior and the inferior ven cav aristotle speaks of the lung as a single organ subdivided but having a common outletthe trachea elsewhere10 he says canals from the heart pass to the lung and divide in the same fashion as the windpipe does closely accompanying those from the windpipe through the whole lung his theory of respiration as explained in his treatise on the subject is that it tempers the excessive heat produced in the heart the lung is compared to a pair of bellows when the lung is expanded air rushes in when it is contracted the air is expelled the heat from the heart causes the lung to expandcold air rushes in the heat is reduced the lung collapses and the air is expelled the cold air drawn into the lung reaches the bronchial tubes and as the vessels containing hot blood run alongside these tubes the air cools it and carries off its superfluous heat some of the air which enters the lung gets from the bronchial tubes into the bloodvessels by transudation for there is no direct communication between them and this air penetrating the body rapidly cools the blood throughout the vessels but aristotle did not consider the pneuma which thus reached the interior of the bloodvessels to be exactly the same thing as airit was a subtilized and condensed air11 and this we now know to be oxygen the treatise on the generation of animals is an extraordinary production no ancient and few modern works equal it in comprehensiveness of detail and profound speculative insight we here find some of the obscurest problems of biology treated with a mastery which when we consider the condition of science at that day is truly astounding that there are many errors many deficiencies and not a little carelessness in the admission of facts may be readily imagined nevertheless at times the work is frequently on a level with and occasionally even rises above the speculations of many advanced embryologists12 it commences with the statement that the present work is a sequel to that on the parts of animals and first the masculine and feminine principles are defined the masculine principle is the origin of all motion and generation the feminine principle is the origin of the material generated aristotles philosophy of nature was teleological and the imperfect character of his anatomical knowledge often gives him occasion to explain particular phenomena by final causes thus animals producing softshelled eggs eg cartilaginous fish and vipers are said to do so because they have so little warmth that the external surface of the egg cannot be dried among insects some eg grasshopper cricket ant etc produce young in the ordinary way by the union of the sexes in other cases eg flies and fleas this union of the sexes results in the production of a skolex while others have no parents nor do they have congresssuch are the ephemera tipula and the like aristotle discusses and rejects the theory that the male reproductive element is derived from every part of the body he concludes that instead of saying that it comes from all parts of the body we should say that it goes to them it is not the nutrient fluid but that which is left over which is secreted hence the larger animals have fewer young than the smaller for by them the consumption of nutrient material will be larger and the secretion less another point to be noticed is that the nutrient fluid is universally distributed through the body but each secretion has its separate organ it is thus intelligible why children resemble their parents since that which makes all the parts of the body resembles that which is left over as secretion thus the hand or the face or the whole animal preexists in the sperm though in an undifferentiated state adiorists and what each of these is in actuality energeia such is the sperm in potentiality dynamei in later times the two great rival theories put forward to account for the development of the embryo have been a the theory of evolution which makes the embryo preexistent in the germ and only rendered visible by the unfolding and expansion of its organs b the theory of epigenesis which makes the embryo arise by a series of successive differentiations from a simple homogeneous mass into a complex heterogeneous organism the above quotation will show how closely aristotle held to the theory of epigenesis and in another place he says not at once is the animal a man or a horse for the end is last attained and the specific form is the end of each development spontaneous generation is nowadays rejected by science but aristotle went so far as to believe that insects molluscs and even eels were spontaneously generated it is however noteworthy in view of modern investigations that he looked upon putrefying matter as the source of such development a chapter of this work is devoted to the consideration of the hereditary transmission of peculiarities from parent to offspring the fifth and last book contains inquiries into the cause of variation in the colour of the eyes and hair the abundance of hair the sleep of the embryo sight and hearing voice and the teeth widely different opinions have been held from time to time of the value of aristotles biological labours this philosophers reputation has perhaps suffered most from those who have praised him most the praise has often been of such an exaggerated character as to have become unmeaning and to have carried with it the impression of insincerity on the part of the writer such are the laudations of cuvier to say as he does alone in fact without predecessors without having borrowed anything from the centuries which had gone before since they had produced nothing enduring the disciple of plato discovered and demonstrated more truths and executed more scientific labours in a life of sixtytwo years than twenty centuries after him were able to do is of course to talk nonsense for the method which aristotle applied was that which hippocrates had used so well before him and it is evident to any one that both his predecessors and contemporaries are frequently laid under contribution by aristotle although the authority is rarely if ever stated by him unless he is about to refute the view put forward exaggerated praise of any author has a tendency to excite depreciation correspondingly unjust and untrue it has been so in the case of this great man in the endeavour to depose him from the impossible position to which his panegyrists had exalted him his detractors have gone to any length the principal charges brought against his biological work have been inaccuracy and hasty generalization in support of the charge of inaccuracy some of the extraordinary statements which are met with in his works are adduced these professor huxley says are not so much to be called errors as stupidities some however of the inaccuracies alleged against aristotle are fancied rather than real thus he is charged with having represented that the arteries contained nothing but air that the aorta arose from the right ventricle that the heart did not beat in any other animal but man that reptiles had no blood etc although in reality he made no one of these assertions there remain nevertheless the gross misstatements referred to above and which really do occur such for instance as that there is but a single bone in the neck of the lion that there are more teeth in male than in female animals that the mouth of the dolphin is placed on the under surface of the body that the back of the skull is empty etc although these absurdities undoubtedly occur in aristotles works it by no means follows that he is responsible for them bearing in mind the curious history of the manuscripts of his treatises we shall find it far more reasonable to conclude that such errors crept in during the process of correction and restoration by men apparently ignorant of biology than that to take only one case an observer who had distinguished the cetacea from fishes and had detected their hidden mamm discovered their lungs and recognized the distinct character of their bones should have been so blind as to fancy that the mouth of these animals was on the under surface of the body that aristotle made hasty generalizations is true but it was unavoidable biology was in so early a stage that a theory had often of necessity to be founded on a very slight basis of facts yet notwithstanding this drawback so great was the sagacity of this philosopher that many of his generalizations which he himself probably looked upon as temporary have held their ground for twenty centuries or having been lost sight of have been discovered and put forward as original by modern biologists thus the advantage of physiological division of labour was first set forth says milneedwards by myself in 1827 and yet aristotle had said13 that whenever nature is able to provide two separate instruments for two separate uses without the one hampering the other she does so instead of acting like a coppersmith who for cheapness makes a spitandacandlestick in one14 it is only when this is impossible that she uses one organ for several functions in conclusion we may say that the great stagirite expounded the true principles of science and that when he failed his failure was caused by lack of materials his desire for completeness perhaps tempted him at times to fill in gaps with such makeshifts as came to his hand but no one knew better than he did that theories must be abandoned unless their teachings tally with the indisputable results of observation15 footnotes 3 pliny natural history viii c 16 4 history of animals i

biological studies at alexandria scientific knowledge was carried a step or two beyond the limit reached by aristotle thus erasistratus and herophilus thoroughly investigated the structure and functions of the valves of the heart and were the first to recognize the nerves as organs of sensation but unfortunately no complete record of the interesting work carried on by these men has come down to our times the first writer after aristotle whose works arrest attention is caius plinius secundus whose socalled natural history in thirtyseven volumes remains to the present day as a monument of industrious compilation but as a biologist properly so called pliny is absolutely without rank for he lacked that practical acquaintance with the subject which alone could enable him to speak with authority of information he had an almost inexhaustible store of actual knowledge the result of observation and experience so far as biological studies were concerned he had but little this was largely due to the encyclopdic character of the work he undertook his mental powers were weighed down by an enormous mass of unarranged and illdigested materials but it was due also to the peculiar bent of plinys mind he was not like aristotle an original thinker he was essentially a student of books an immensely industrious but not always judicious compiler often his selections from other works prove that he failed to appreciate the relative importance of the different subjects to which he made reference his knowledge of the greek language appears too to have been defective for he gives at times the wrong latin names to objects described by his greek authorities to these defects must be added his marvellous readiness to believe any statement provided only that it was uncommon while on the other hand he showed an indefensible scepticism in regard to what was really deserving of attention the chief value of his work consists in the historical and chronological notes of the progress of some of the subjects of which he treatsfragments of writings which would otherwise be lost to us pliny was killed in the destruction of pompeii ad 79 claudius galenus was born at pergamus in asia minor in the hundred and thirtyfirst year of the christian era few writers ever exercised for so long a time such an undisputed sway over the opinions of mankind as did this wonderful man his authority was estimated at a much higher rate than that of all the biological writers combined who flourished during a period of more than twelve centuries and it was often considered a sufficient argument against a hypothesis or even an alleged matter of fact that it was contrary to galen endowed by nature with a penetrating genius and a mind of restless energy he was eminently qualified to profit by a comprehensive and liberal education and such he received his father nicon an architect was a man of learning and abilitya distinguished mathematician and an astronomerand seems to have devoted much time and care to the education of his son the youth appears to have studied philosophy successively in the schools of the stoics academics peripatetics and epicureans without attaching himself exclusively to any one of these and to have taken from each what he thought to be the most essential parts of their system rejecting however altogether the tenets of the epicureans at the age of twentyone on the death of his father he went to smyrna to continue the study of medicine to which he had now devoted himself after leaving this place and having travelled extensively he took up his residence at alexandria which was then the most favourable spot for the pursuit of medical studies here he is said to have remained until he was twentyeight years of age when his reputation secured his appointment in his native city of pergamus to the office of physician in charge of the athletes in the gymnasia situated within the precincts of the temple of sculapius for five or six years he lived in pergamus and then a revolt compelled him to leave his native town the advantages offered by rome led him to remove thither and take up his residence in the capital of the world here his skill sagacity and knowledge soon brought him into notice and excited the jealousy of the roman doctors which was still further increased by some wonderful cures the young greek physician succeeded in effecting possibly it was owing to the ill feeling shown to galen that on the outbreak of an epidemic a year afterwards he left the imperial city and proceeded to brindisi and embarked for greece it was his intention to devote his time to the study of natural history and for this purpose he visited cyprus palestine and lemnos while at the lastnamed place however he was suddenly summoned to aquileia to meet the emperors marcus aurelius and lucius verus he travelled through thrace and macedonia on foot met the imperial personages and prepared for them a medicine for which he seems to have been famous and which is spoken of as the theriac it was probably some combination of opium with various aromatics and stimulants for antidotes of many different kinds were habitually taken by the romans to preserve them from the ill effects of poison and of the bites of venomous animals16 with the emperor m aurelius he returned to rome and became afterwards doctor to the young emperor commodus he did not however remain for a long period at rome and probably passed the greater part of the rest of his life in his native country although the date of his death is not positively known yet it appears from a passage17 in his writings that he was living in the reign of septimius severus and suidas seems to have reason for asserting that he reached his seventieth year galens writings represent the common depository of the anatomical knowledge of the day what he had learnt from many teachers rather than the results of his own personal research roughly speaking they deal with the following subjects anatomy and physiology dietetics and hygiene pathology diagnosis and semeiology pharmacy and materia medica therapeutics the only works of this voluminous writer at which we can here glance are those dealing with anatomy and physiology these exhibit numerous illustrations of galens familiarity with practical anatomy although it was most likely comparative rather than human anatomy at which he especially worked indeed he seems to have had but few opportunities of carrying on human dissections for he thinks himself happy in having been able to examine at alexandria two human skeletons and he recommends the dissection of monkeys because of their exact resemblance to man to this disadvantage may perhaps be attributed the readiness which sometimes appears to assume identity of organization between man and the brutes thus because in certain animals he found a double biliary duct he concluded the same to be the case in man and in one instance he proceeded to deduce the cause of disease from this erroneous assumption he supposed that there were three modes of existence in man namely a the nutritive which was common to all animals and plants of which the liver was the source b the vital of which the heart was the source c the rational of which the brain was the source again he considered that the animal economy possessed four natural powers 1 the attractive 2 the alterative or assimilative 3 the retentive or digestive 4 the expulsive like his predecessors he asserted that there were four humours namely blood yellow bile black bile and aqueous serum he held that it was the office of the liver to complete the process of sanguification commenced in the stomach and that during this process the yellow bile was attracted by the branches of the hepatic duct and gallbladder the black bile being attracted by the spleen and the aqueous humour by the two kidneys while the liver itself retained the pure blood which was afterwards attracted by the heart through the vena cava by whose ramifications it was distributed to the various parts of the body following aristotle especially he regarded hair nails arteries veins cartilage bone ligament membranes glands fat and muscle as the simplest constituents of the body formed immediately from the blood and perfectly homogeneous in character the organic members eg lungs liver etc he looked upon as formed of several of the foregoing simple parts the osteology contained in galens works is nearly as perfect as that of the present day he correctly names and describes the bones and sutures of the cranium notices the quadrilateral shape of the parietals the peculiar situation and shape of the sphenoid and the form and character of the ethmoid malar maxillary and nasal bones he divides the vertebral columns into cervical dorsal and lumbar portions with regard to the nervous system he taught that the nerves of the senses are distinct from those which impart the power of motion to musclesthat the former are derived from the anterior parts of the brain while the latter arise from the posterior portion or from the spinal cord he maintained that the nerves of the finer senses are formed of matter too soft to be the vehicles of muscular motion whereas on the other hand the nerves of motion are too hard to be susceptible of fine sensibility his description of the method of demonstrating the different parts of the brain by dissection is very interesting and like his references to various instruments and contrivances proves him to have been a practical and experienced anatomist in his description of the organs and process of nutrition absorption by the veins of the stomach is correctly noticed and the union of the mesenteric veins into one common vena port is pointed out the communications between the ramifications of the vena port and of the proper veins of the liver are supposed by galen to be effected by means of anastomosing pores or channels although it is evident that galen was ignorant of the true absorbent system yet he appears to have been aware of the lacteals for he says that in addition to those mesenteric veins which by their union form the vena port there are visible in every part of the mesentery other veins proceeding also from the intestines which terminate in glands and he supposes that these veins are intended for the nourishment of the intestines themselves some of galens contemporaries asserted that upon exposing the mesentery of a sucking animal several small vessels were seen filled first with air and afterwards with milk they had doubtless mistaken colourless lymph for air but galen ridicules both assertions and thereby shows that he had not examined the contents of the lacteals this is somewhat remarkable because as a rule he omitted no opportunity of determining with certainty by vivisection and experiments on living animals the uses of the various parts of the body as an illustration of this we have his correct statement established by experiment that the pylorus acts as a valve only during the process of digestion and that it is relaxed when digestion is completed he recognizes that the flesh of the heart is somewhat different to that of the muscles of voluntary motion its fibres are described as being arranged in longitudinal and transverse bundles the former by their contractions shortening the organ the latter compressing and narrowing it such statements show that he regarded the heart as essentially muscular he thought however that it was entirely destitute of nerves although he admitted that possibly it had one small branch derived from the nervus vagus sent to it yet he entirely overlooked the great nervous plexus surrounding the roots of the bloodvessels from which branches proceed in company with the branches of the coronary arteries and veins and penetrate the muscular substance of the ventricles he endeavoured to prove by experiment observation and reasoning that the arteries as well as the veins contained blood and in this connection he tells an amusing story a certain teacher of anatomy who had declared that the aorta contained no blood was earnestly desired by his pupils who were ardent disciples of galen to exhibit the requisite demonstration they themselves offering animals for the experiment he however after various subterfuges declined until they promised to give him a suitable remuneration which they raised by subscription among themselves to the amount of a thousand drachm perhaps 30 the professor being thus compelled to commence the experiment totally failed in his attempt to cut down upon the aorta to the no small amusement of his pupils who thereupon taking up the experiment themselves made an opening into the thorax in the way in which they had been instructed by galen passed one ligature round the aorta at the part where it attaches itself to the spine and another at its origin and then by opening the intervening portion of the artery showed that blood was contained in it the arteries galen thought possessed a pulsative and attractive power of their own independently of the heart the moment of their dilatation being the moment of their activity they in fact drew their charge from the heart as the heart by its diastole drew its charge from the vena cava and the pulmonary vein the pulse of the arteries he also thought was propagated by their coats not by the wave of blood thrown into them by the heart he taught that at every systole of the arteries a certain portion of their contents was discharged at their extremities namely by the exhalents and secretory vessels though he demonstrated the anastomosis of arteries and veins he nowhere hints his belief that the contents of the former pass into the latter to be conveyed back to the heart and from it to be again diffused over the body he made a near approach to the harveian theory of the circulation as harvey himself admits in his de motu cordis18 but the grand point of difference between galen and harvey is the question whether or not at every systole of the left ventricle more blood is thrown out than is expended on exhalation secretion and nutrition upon this point galen held the negative and harvey as we all know the affirmative the famous asclepiads held that respiration was for the generation of the soul itself breath and life being thus considered to be identical hippocrates thought it was for the nutrition and refrigeration of the innate heat aristotle for its ventilation erasistratus for the filling of the arteries with spirits all these opinions are discussed and commented upon by galen who determines the purposes of respiration to be 1 to preserve the animal heat 2 to evacuate from the blood the products of combustion he conjectured that there was in atmospheric air not only a quality friendly to the vital spirit but also a quality inimical to it which conjecture he drew from observation of the various phenomena accompanying the support and the extinction of flame and he says that if we could find out why flame is extinguished by absence of the air we might then know the nature of that substance which imparts warmth to the blood during the process of respiration on another occasion he says that it is evidently the quality and not the quantity of the air which is necessary to life he further shows that he recognized the analogy between respiration and combustion by comparing the lungs to a lamp the heart to its wick the blood to the oil and the animal heat to the flame from certain observations in various parts of his works it appears that although ignorant of the doctrine of atmospheric pressure he was acquainted with some of its practical effects thus he says if you put one end of an open tube under water and suck out the air with the other end you will draw up water into the mouth and that it is in this way that infants extract the milk from the mothers breast again erasistratus supposed that the vapour of charcoal and of certain pits and wells was fatal to life because lighter than common air but galen maintained it to be heavier he describes two kinds of respiration one by the mouths of the arteries of the lungs and one by the mouths of the arteries of the skin in each case he says the surrounding air is drawn into the vessels during their diastole for the purpose of cooling the blood and during their systole the fuliginous particles derived from the blood and other fluids of the body are forced out he considers the diaphragm to be the principal muscle of respiration but he makes a clear distinction between ordinary respiration which he calls a natural and involuntary effort and that deliberate and forced respiration which is obedient to the will and he says that there are different muscles for the two purposes elsewhere he particularly points out the two sets of intercostal muscles and their mode of action of which before his time he asserts that anatomists were ignorant he describes various effects produced on respiration and on the voice by the division of those nerves which are connected with the thorax and shows particularly the effect of dividing the recurrent branch of his sixth pair of cerebral nerves the pneumogastric of modern anatomy he explains how it happens that after division of the spinal cord provided that division be beneath the lower termination of the neck the diaphragm will still continue to actin consequence namely of the origin of the phrenic nerve being above the lower termination of the neck before the time of galen the medical profession was divided into several sects eg dogmatici empirici eclectici pneumatici and episynthetici who were always disputing with one another after his time all sects seem to have merged in his followers the subsequent greek and roman biological writers were mere compilers from his works and as soon as his writings were translated into arabic they were at once adopted throughout the east to the exclusion of all others he remained paramount throughout the civilized world until within the last three hundred years in the records of the college of physicians of england we read that dr geynes was cited before the college in 1559 for impugning the infallibility of galen and was only admitted again into the privileges of his fellowship on acknowledgment of his error and humble recantation signed with his own hand kurt sprengel has well said that if the physicians who remained so faithfully attached to galens system had inherited his penetrating mind his observing glance and his depth the art of healing would have approached the limit of perfection before all the other sciences but it was written in the book of destiny that mind and reason were to bend under the yoke of superstition and barbarism and were only to emerge after centuries of lethargic sleep footnotes 16 hence the name thriakai 17 de antidotis i

postea in arterias transmittide motu cordis cap vii vesalius vesalius the authority of galen at once a despotism and a religion was scarcely ever called in question until the sixteenth century no attempt worth recording was made during thirteen hundred years to extend the boundary of scientific knowledge in anatomy and physiology it is true that the scholastic philosopher albertus magnus who was for a short time 12601262 bishop of ratisbon in the middle of the thirteenth century wrote a history of animals which was a remarkable production for the age in which he lived although sir thomas browne in his famous enquiries into common errors speaks of these tractates as requiring to be received with caution adding as regards albertus that he was a man who much advanced these opinions by the authoritie of his name and delivered most conceits with strickt enquirie into few as regards human anatomy it was considered during the middle ages to be impiety to touch with a scalpel the dead image of god as mans body was called mundinus the professor of medicine at bologna from 1315 to 1318 was the first to attempt any such thing he exhibited the public dissection of three bodies but by this created so great a scandal that he gave up the practice and contented himself with publishing a work de anatome which formed a sort of commentary on galen this work with additions continued to be the textbook of the schools until the time of vesalius who founded the study of anatomy as nowadays pursued andreas vesalius was born at brussels on the last day of the year 1514 of a family which for several generations had been eminent for medical attainments he was sent as a boy to louvain where he spent the greater part of his leisure in researches into the mechanism of the lower animals he was a born dissector who after careful examination in his early days of rats moles dogs cats monkeys and the like came in afterlife to be dissatisfied with any less knowledge of the anatomy of man he acquired great proficiency in the scholarship of the day indeed the latin in which he afterwards wrote his great work is so singularly pure that one of his detractors pretended that vesalius must have got some good scholar to write the latin for him latin was not the only language in which he was proficient he added greek and arabic to his other accomplishments and this for the purpose of reading the great biological works in the languages in which they were originally written from louvain the youth went to paris where he studied anatomy under a most distinguished physician sylvius it was the practice of that illustrious professor to read to his class galen on the use of parts omitting nearly all the sections where exact knowledge of anatomical detail was necessary sometimes an attempt was made to illustrate the lecture by the dissection of a dog but such illustration more often exposed the professors ignorance than it added to the students knowledge indirectly however it did good for whenever sylvius after having tried in vain to demonstrate some muscle or nerve or vein left the room his pupil vesalius slipped down to the table dissected out the part with great neatness and triumphantly called the professors attention to it on his return besides studying under sylvius vesalius had for his teacher at paris the famous winter of andernach who was physician to francis i this learned man in a work published three years after this period speaks of vesalius as a youth of great promise at the age of nineteen vesalius returned to louvain and here for the first time he openly demonstrated from the human subject in this connection a somewhat ghastly story is told which serves to show the intensity of the enthusiasm with which our anatomist was inspired on a certain evening it chanced that vesalius in company with a friend had rambled out of the gates of louvain to a spot where the bodies of executed criminals were wont to be exposed a noted robber had been executed his body had been chained to a stake and slowly roasted and the birds had so entirely stripped the bones of every vestige of flesh that a perfect skeleton complete and clean was suspended before the eyes of the anatomist who had been striving hitherto to piece together such a thing out of the bones of many people gathered as occasion offered mounting upon the shoulder of his friend vesalius ascended the charred stake and forcibly tore away the limbs leaving only the trunk which was securely bound by iron chains with these stolen bones under their clothes the two youths returned to louvain in the night however and alone the sturdy vesalius found his way again to the placewhich to most men at any rate in those times would have been associated with unspeakable horrorsand there by sheer force wrenched away the trunk and buried it then leisurely and carefully day after day he smuggled through the city gates bone after bone afterwards when he had set up the perfect skeleton in his own house he did not hesitate to demonstrate from it but such an act of daring plunder could not escape detection and he was banished from louvain for the offence this story is here quoted only to show the extraordinary physical and moral courage which the anatomist possessed which upheld him through toils dangers and disgusts and by which he was strengthened to carry on even in a cruel and superstitious age and placed as he was on the very threshold of the inquisition a work at all times repulsive to flesh and blood after serving for a short time as a surgeon in the army of the emperor charles v vesalius went to italy where he at once attracted the attention of the most learned men and became at the age of twentytwo professor of anatomy at the university of padua this was the first purely anatomical professorship that had been established out of the funds of any university for seven years he held the office and he was at the same time professor at bologna and at pisa during these years his lectures were always well attended for they were a striking innovation on the tameness of conventional routine in each university the services of the professor were confined to a short course of demonstrations so that his duties were complete when he had spent during the winter a few weeks at each of the three towns in succession he then returned to venice which he appears to have made his headquarters at this city as well as at pisa special facilities were offered to the professor for obtaining bodies either of condemned criminals or others at padua and bologna the enthusiasm of the students who became resurrectionists on their teachers behalf kept the lecturetable supplied with specimens they were in the habit of watching all the symptoms in men dying of a fatal malady and noting where after death such men were buried the seclusion of the graveyard was then invaded and the corpse secretly conveyed by andreas to his chamber and concealed sometimes in his own bed a diligent search was at once made to determine accurately the cause of death this pitiless zeal for correct details in anatomy associated as it was with indefatigable practice in physic appeared to vesalius as it does to his successors of today to be the only satisfactory method of acquiring that knowledge which is essential to a doctor thus it was that he who at the age of twentytwo was able to name with his eyes blindfolded any human bone put into his hand who was deeply versed in comparative anatomy and had more accurate knowledge of the human frame than any graybeard of the time enjoyed afterwards a reputation as a physician which was unbounded one illustration of his sagacity in diagnosis will suffice a patient of two famous court physicians at madrid had a big and wonderful tumour on the loins it would have been easily recognized in these days as an aneurismal tumour but it greatly puzzled the two doctors vesalius was therefore consulted and said there is a bloodvessel dilated that tumour is full of blood they were surprised at such a strange opinion but the man died the tumour was opened blood was actually found in it and we are told in admirationem rapti fure omnes it was not until after vesalius had been three years professor that he began to distrust the infallibility of galens anatomical teaching constant practical experience in dissection both human and comparative slowly convinced him thatgreat anatomist as the divus homo had undoubtedly beenhis statements were not only incomplete but often wrong further that galen very rarely wrote from actual inspection of the human subject but based his teaching on a belief that the structure of a monkey was exactly similar to that of a man with this conviction established vesalius proceeded to note with great care all the discrepancies between the text of galen and the actual parts which it endeavoured to describe and in this way a volume of considerable thickness was soon formed consisting entirely of annotations upon galen the generally received authorities being thus found to be unreliable it became necessary in the next place to collect and arrange the fundamental facts of anatomy upon a new and sounder basis to this task vesalius at the age of twentyfive devoted himself and began his famous work on the fabric of the human body owing possibly to the good fortune of his family and to the income which he derived from his professorships andreas was able to secure for his work the aid of some of the best artists of the day to jean calcar one of the ablest of the pupils of titian are due the splendid anatomical plates which illustrate the corporis humani fabrica and which are incomparably better than those of any work which preceded it to him most likely is due also the woodcut which adorns the first page and which represents the young vesalius wearing professors robes standing at a lecturetable and pointing out from a robust subject that lies before him the inner secrets of the human body while the tiers of benches that surround the professor are completely crowded with grave doctors struggling to see even climbing upon the railings to do so but throughout the work the plates are used simply to illustrate and elucidate the text and the information furnished in the latter is minute and accurate and stated in wellpolished latin as the author proceeds he finds it necessary to disagree with galen and the reasons for this disagreement are given the inevitable result follows that vesalius is placed at issue not only with the divine man but also with all those who for thirteen centuries had unquestioningly followed him such a result vesalius must have foreseen it was not therefore a great surprise to him perhaps to receive soon after the publication of his work a violent onslaught from his old master sylvius he simply replied to it by a letter full of respect and friendly feeling inquiring wherein he had been guilty of error the answer he got was that he must show proper respect for galen if he wished to be regarded as a friend of sylvius in 1546 three years after the publication of his great work andreas was summoned to ratisbon to exercise his skill upon the emperor and from that date he was ranked among the court physicians in the same year 1546 in a long letter entitled de usu radicis chin he not only treats of the medicine by which the emperors health had been restored but he vindicates his teaching against his assailants and again gives cumulative proof of the fact that galen had dissected only brutes it was the practice of vesalius while he was professor in italy to issue a public notice the day before each demonstration stating the time at which it would take place and inviting all who decried his errors to attend and make their own dissections from his subject and confound him openly it does not appear that any one was rash enough ever to accept the challenge yet although the majority of the young men were on the side of vesalius the older teachers continued to regard him as a heretic and in 1551 sylvius published a bitterly personal attack it was nothing to him that the results of actual dissection were against himhe even went so far as to assert that the men of his time were constructed somewhat differently to those of the time of galen thus to the proof that vesalius gave that the carpal bones were not absolutely without marrow as galen had asserted sylvius replied that the bones were harder and more solid among the ancients and were in consequence destitute of medullary substance again when vesalius showed that galen was wrong in describing the human femur and humerus as greatly curved sylvius explained the discrepancy by saying that the wearing of narrow garments by the moderns had straightened the limbs through these attacks however the writings of vesalius fell into somewhat bad odour in the court for in that very superstitious age there was a kind of vague dread felt of reading the works of a man against whom such serious charges of arrogance and impiety were brought and so it came about that when he received the summons to take up his residence permanently at madrid and the orthodoxy of the day seemed for the moment to triumph in a fit of proud indignation he burned all his manuscripts destroying a huge volume of annotations upon galen a whole book of medical formul many original notes on drugs the copy of galen from which he lectured and which was covered with marginal notes of new observations that had occurred to him while demonstrating and the paraphrases of the books of rhases in which the knowledge of the arabian was collated with that of the greeks and others the produce of the labour of many years was thus reduced to ashes in a short fit of passion and from this time vesalius lived no more for controversy or study he gave himself up to pleasure and the pursuit of wealth resting on his reputation and degenerating into a mere courtier as a practitioner he was held in high esteem when the life of don carlos philips son was despaired of it was vesalius who was called in and who seeing that the surgeons had bound up the wound in the head so tightly that an abscess had formed promptly brought relief to the patient by cutting into the pericranium the cure of the prince however was attributed by the court to the intercession of st diego and it is possible that on the subject of this alleged miraculous recovery vesalius may have expressed his opinion rather more strongly than it was safe for a netherlander to do at any rate the priests always looked upon him with dislike and suspicion and at length they and the other enemies of the great anatomist had their revenge a young spanish nobleman had died and vesalius who had attended him obtained permission to ascertain if possible by a postmortem examination the cause of death on opening the body the heart was saidby the bystandersto beat and a charge not merely of murder but of impiety also was brought against vesalius it was hoped by his persecutors that the latter charge would be brought before the inquisition and result in more rigorous punishment than any that would be inflicted by the judges of the common law the king of spain however interfered and saved him on condition that he should make a pilgrimage to the holy land accordingly he set out from madrid for venice and thence to cyprus from which place he went on to jerusalem and was returning not to madrid but to padua where the professorship of physic had been offered him when he suffered shipwreck on the island of zante and there perished miserably of hunger and grief on october 15 1564 before he had reached the age of fifty his body was found by a travelling goldsmith who recognized notwithstanding their starved outlines the features of the renowned anatomist and respectfully buried his remains and raised a statue to his memory two of the works of this great man have been already referred to namely de corporis humani fabrica de usu radicis chin besides these the following have appeared examen observationum gabrielis fallopii gabrielis cunei examen apologi francisci putei pro galeno in anatome a great work on surgery in seven books with respect to the last of these it may be sufficient to remark that there is every reason to believe that the name of the famous anatomist was stolen after his death to give value to the production which was compiled and published by a venetian named bogarucci and that vesalius is not responsible for the contents the other works are undoubtedly genuine in 1562 andreas seems to have been roused for a short time from the lethargy into which he had sunk by an attack from franciscus puteus for to this attack a reply appearedfrom a writer calling himself gabriel cuneuswhich has always been attributed by the most competent authorities to vesalius himself in this rather long work covering as it does more than fifty pages in the folio edition the views of vesalius which are at variance with galen are gone through seriatim and defended in 1561 fallopius who had studied under vesalius published his anatomical observations containing several points in which he had extended the knowledge of anatomy beyond the limits reached by his master he had taught publicly for thirteen years at ferrara and had presided for eight years over an anatomical school so that he was no novice in the field of biology yet so completely had vesalius lost the philosophic temperament that he regarded this publication as an infringement of his rights and in this spirit wrote an examen observationum fallopii in which he decried the friend who had made improvements on himself as he had been decried for his improvements on galen the manuscript of this work finished at the end of december 1561 was committed by the author to the care of paulus teupulus of venice orator to the king of spain who was to give it to fallopius the orator however did not reach padua until after the death of fallopius and he consequently retained the document until vesalius on his way to jerusalem took possession of it and caused it to be published without delay it appeared at venice in 156419 the letter on the china roota plant we know nowadays as sarsaparillaby the use of which the emperors recovery was effected has been already referred to it was addressed to the anatomists friend joachim roelants very little space however is taken up with a description of the medicine which gives title to the letter something certainly is said of the history and nature of the plant the preparation of the decoction and its effects but the writer soon introduces the subject which was at that time of very vital importance to him namely his position with regard to the statements of galen and his followers he collects together various assertions of the greek anatomist on the bones the muscles and ligaments the relations of veins and arteries the nerves the character of the peritoneum the organs of the thorax the skull and its contents etc and shows from each and all of these that reference had not been made to the human subject and that therefore the statements were unreliable to the work on the fabric of the human body we have already alluded as well as to the causes which led to its being written more than half of this great treatise is occupied with a minute description of the build of the human bodyits bones cartilages ligaments and muscles it may have been owing to the thorough acquaintance which vesalius showed with these parts that his detractors pretended afterwards that he only understood superficial injuries but other branches of anatomy are fully dealt with the veins and arteries are described in the third book and the nerves in the fourth the organs of nutrition and reproduction are treated of in the next while the remaining two books are devoted to descriptions of the heart and brain vesalius gives a good account of the sphenoid bone with its large and small wings and its pterygoid processes and he accurately describes the vestibule in the interior of the temporal bone he shows the sternum to consist in the adult of three parts and the sacrum of five or six he discovered the valve which guards the foramen ovale in the foetus and he not only verified the observation of etienne as to the valvelike fold guarding the entrance of each hepatic vein into the inferior vena cava but he also fully described the vena azygos he observed too the canal which passes in the foetus between the umbilical vein and vena cava and which has since been known as the ductus venosus he was the first to study and describe the mediastinum correcting the error of the ancients who believed that this duplicature of the pleura contained a portion of the lungs he described the omentum and its connections with the stomach the spleen and the colon and he enunciated the first correct views of the structure of the pylorus noticing at the same time the small size of the ccal appendix in man his account of the anatomy of the brain is fuller than that of any of his predecessors but he does not appear to have well understood the inferior recesses and his description of the nerves is confused by regarding the optic as the first pair the third as the fifth and the fifth as the seventh the ancients believed the optic nerve to be hollow for the conveyance of the visual spirit but vesalius showed that no such tube existed he observed the elevation and depression of the brain during respiration but being ignorant of the circulation of the blood he wrongly explained the phenomenon exclusively an anatomist he makes but brief references in his great work to the functions of the organs which he describes where he differs from galen on these matters he does so apologetically he follows him in regarding the heart as the seat of the emotions and passionsthe hottest of all the viscera and source of heat of the whole body although he does not as aristotle did look upon the heart as giving rise to the nerves he considers the heart to be in ceaseless motion alternately dilating and contracting but the diastole is in his opinion the influential act of the organ he knows that eminences or projections are present in the veins and indeed speaks of them as being analogous to the valves of the heart but he denies to them the office of valves to him the motion of the blood was of a toandfro kind and valves in the veins acting as such would have interfered with anything of the sort he expresses clearly the idea that was entertained in the old physiology of the attractions exerted by the various parts of the body for the blood and especially that of the veins and heart for the blood itself the right sinus of the heart he says attracts blood from the vena cava and the left attracts air from the lungs through the arteria venalis pulmonary vein the blood itself being attracted by the veins in general the vital spirit by the arteries again he speaks of the blood filtering through the septum between the ventricles as if through a sieve although he knows perfectly well from his dissection that the septum is quite impervious it will thus be seen that the physiological teaching of galen was left undisturbed by vesalius footnotes 19 see professor morleys article on anatomy in long clothes in frasers magazine 1853 from which most of the facts in this sketch have been taken harvey harvey the importance of harveys discovery of the circulation of the blood can only be properly estimated by bearing in mind what was done by his predecessors in the same field of inquiry aristotle had taught that in man and in the higher brutes the blood was elaborated from the food in the liver conveyed to the heart and thence distributed by it through the veins to the whole body erasistratus and herophilus held that while the veins carried blood from the heart to the members the arteries carried a subtle kind of air or spirit galen discovered that the arteries were not merely airpipes but that they contained blood as well as vital air or spirit sylvius the teacher of vesalius was aware of the presence of valves in the veins and fabricius harveys teacher at padua described them much more accurately than sylvius had done but neither of these men had a true idea of the significance of the structures of which they wrote servetus the friend and contemporary of vesalius writing in 1533 correctly described the course of the lesser circulation in the following words this communication ie between the right and left sides of the heart does not take place through the partition of the heart as is generally believed but by another admirable contrivance whereby from the right ventricle the subtle blood is agitated in a lengthened course through the lungs wherein prepared it becomes of a crimson colour and from the vena arterialis pulmonary artery is transferred into the arteria venalis pulmonary vein mingled with the inspired air in the arteria venalis freed by respiration from fuliginous matter and become a suitable home of the vital spirit it is attracted at length into the left ventricle of the heart by the diastole of the organ but when servetus comes to speak of the systemic circulation what he has to say is as old as galen the opinions therefore on the subject of the blood and its distribution which were prevalent at the end of the sixteenth century prove 1 that although the blood was not regarded as stagnant yet its circulation such as is nowadays recognized was unknown 2 that one kind of blood was thought to flow from the liver to the right ventricle and thence to the lungs and general system by the veins while another kind flowed from the left ventricle to the lungs and general system by the arteries 3 that the septum of the heart was regarded as admitting of the passage of blood directly from the right to the left side 4 that there was no conception of the functions of the heart as the motor power of the movement of the blood for biologists of that day doubted whether the substance of the heart were really muscular they supposed the pulsations to be due to expansion of the spirits it contained they believed the only dynamic effect which it had on the blood to be that of sucking it in during its active diastole and they supposed the chief use of its constant movements to be the due mixture of blood and spirits this was the state of knowledge before harveys time by his great work he established 1 that the blood flows continuously in a circuit through the whole body the force propelling it in this unwearied round being the rhythmical contractions of the muscular walls of the heart 2 that a portion only of the blood is expended in nutrition each time that it circulates 3 that the blood conveyed in the systemic arteries communicates heat as well as nourishment throughout the body instead of exerting a cooling influence as was vulgarly supposed and 4 that the pulse is not produced by the arteries enlarging and so filling but by the arteries being filled with blood and so enlarging we can now consider the method by which harvey arrived at these results the work de motu cordis et sanguinis after giving an account of the views of preceding physiologists ancient and modern commences with a description of the heart as seen in a living animal when the chest has been laid open and the pericardium removed three circumstances are noted a the heart becomes erect strikes the chest and gives a beat b it is constricted in every direction c grasped by the hand it is felt to become harder during the contraction from these circumstances it is inferred 1 that the action of the heart is essentially of the same nature as that of voluntary muscles which become hard and condensed when they act 2 that as the effect of this the capacity of the cavities is diminished and the blood is expelled 3 that the intrinsic motion of the heart is the systole and not the diastole as previously imagined the motions of the arteries are next shown to be dependent upon the action of the heart because the arteries are distended by the wave of blood that is thrown into them being filled like sacs or bladders and not expanding like bellows these conclusions are confirmed by the jerking way in which blood flows from a cut artery in the heart itself two distinct motions are observedfirst of the auricles and then of the ventricles these alternate contractions and dilatations can have but one result namely to force the blood from the auricle to the ventricle and from the ventricle on the right side by the pulmonary artery to the lungs and on the left side by the aorta to the system these considerations suggest to the mind of harvey the idea of the circulation i began to think he says whether there might not be a motion as it were in a circle this is next established by proving the three following propositions 1 the blood is incessantly transmitted by the action of the heart from the vena cava to the arteries in such quantity that it cannot be supplied from the ingesta and in such wise that the whole mass must very quickly pass through the organ 2 the blood under the influence of the arterial pulse enters and is impelled in a continuous equable and incessant stream through every part and member of the body in much larger quantity than were sufficient for nutrition or than the whole mass of fluids could supply 3 the veins in like manner return this blood incessantly to the heart from all parts and members of the body as to the first proposition harvey says did the heart eject but two drachms of blood on each contraction and the beats in half an hour were a thousand the quantity expelled in that time would amount to twenty pounds and ten ounces and were the quantity an ounce it would be as much as eighty pounds and four ounces such quantities it is certain could not be supplied by any possible amount of meat and drink consumed within the time specified it is the same blood consequently that is now flowing out by the arteries now returning by the veins and it is simply matter of necessity that the blood should perform a circuit or return to the place from whence it went forth demonstration of the second propositionthat the blood enters a limb by the arteries and returns from it by the veinsis afforded by the effects of a ligature for if the upper part of the arm be tightly bound the arteries below will not pulsate while those above will throb violently the hand under such circumstances will retain its natural colour and appearance although if the bandage be kept on for a minute or two it will begin to look livid and to fall in temperature but if the bandage be now slackened a little the hand and the arm will immediately become suffused and the superficial veins show themselves tumid and knotted the pulse at the wrist in the same instant beginning to beat as it did before the application of the bandage the tight bandage not only compresses the veins but the arteries also so that blood cannot flow through either the slacker ligature obstructs the veins only for the arteries lie deeper and have firmer coats seeing then says harvey that the moderately tight ligature renders the veins turgid and the whole hand full of blood i ask whence is this does the blood accumulate below the ligature coming through the veins or through the arteries or passing by certain secret pores through the veins it cannot come still less can it come by any system of invisible pores it must needs then arrive by the arteries the third position to be proved is that the veins return the blood to the heart from all parts of the body that such is the case might be inferred from the presence and disposition of the valves in the veins for the office of the valves is by no means explained by the theory that they are to hinder the blood from flowing into inferior parts by gravitation since the valves do not always look upwards but always towards the trunks of the veins invariably towards the seat of the heart the action of the valves is then demonstrated experimentally on the arm bound as for bloodletting the point of a finger being kept on a vein the blood from the space above may be streaked upwards till it passes the valve when that portion of the vein between the valve and the point of pressure will not only be emptied of its contents but will remain empty as long as the pressure is continued if the pressure be now removed the empty part of the vein will fill instantly and look as turgid as before other confirmatory evidence is then added eg the absorption of animal poisons and of medicines applied externally the muscular structure of the heart and the necessary working of its valves william harvey the illustrious physiologist anatomist and physician to whom this discovery is due was the eldest son of a kentish yeoman and was born in april 1578 at the age of ten he entered the canterbury grammar school where he appears to have remained for some years at sixteen he passed to caiusgonvil college cambridge and three years afterwards took his ba degree and quitted the university like most students of medicine of that day he found it necessary to seek the principal part of his professional education abroad he travelled to italy selected padua as his place of study and there continued to reside for four years having as one of his teachers the famous fabricius of aquapendente on his return to england in 1602 he took his doctors degree at cambridge and entered on the practice of his profession in 1604 he joined the college of physicians and three years later was elected a fellow of that learned body two years afterwards he applied for the post of physician to st bartholomews hospital and his application being supported by letters of recommendation to the governor from the king and from the president of the college of physicians he was duly elected to the office in the same year as soon as a vacancy occurred in 1615 when thirtyseven years of age harvey was chosen to deliver the lectures on surgery and anatomy to the college of physicians and it is possible that at this time he gave an exposition of his views on the circulation he continued to lecture on the same subject for many years afterwards although he did not publish his views until 1628 when they appeared in the work de motu cordis some few years after his appointment as lecturer to the college he was chosen one of the physicians extraordinary to king james i and about five or six years after the accession of charles i he became physician in ordinary to that unfortunate monarch the physiologists investigations seem to have interested king charles for he had several exhibitions made of the punctum saliens in the embryo chick and also witnessed dissections from time to time when in 1630 the young duke of lennox made a journey on the continent harvey was chosen to travel with him and probably remained abroad about two years during this time harvey most likely visited venice of this tour the doctor speaks in the following terms in a letter written at the time i can only complayne that by the waye we could scarce see a dogg crow kite raven or any bird or any thing to anatomise only sum few miserable poeple the reliques of the war and the plauge where famine had made anatomies before i came six years after this in april 1636 he accompanied the earl of arundel in his embassy to the emperor having to visit the principal cities of germany he was thus afforded an opportunity of meeting the leading biologists of the time and at nuremberg he probably met caspar hoffmann and made that public demonstration of the circulation of the blood which he had promised in his letter dated from that city and which convinced every one present except hoffmann himself hollar the artist informs us that harveys enthusiasm in his search for specimens often led him into danger and caused grave anxiety to the earl of arundel for he would still be making of excursions into the woods making observations of strange trees plants earths etc and sometimes like to be lost so that my lord ambassador would be really angry with him for there was not only danger of wild beasts but of thieves soon after his return to england as court physician his movements became seriously restricted by the fortunes of the king aubrey says when king charles i by reason of the tumults left london harvey attended him and was at the fight of edgehill with him and during the fight the prince and the duke of york were committed to his care he told me that he withdrew with them under a hedge and tooke out of his pockett a booke and read but he had not read very long before a bullet of a great gun grazed on the ground neare him which made him remove his station i first sawe him at oxford 1642 after edgehill fight but was then too young to be acquainted with so great a doctor i remember he came severall times to our coll trin to george bathurst bd who had a hen to hatch egges in his chamber which they dayly opened to see the progress and way of generation in 1645 charles after the execution of archbishop laud took upon himself the functions of visitor of merton college and having removed sir nathaniel brent from the office of warden for having joined the rebells now in armes against him he directed the fellows to take the necessary steps for the election of a successor this course consisted in giving in three names to the visitor in order that one of the three the one named first probably should be appointed harvey was so named by five out of the seven fellows voting and was accordingly duly elected a couple of days after his admission he summoned the fellows into the hall and made a speech to them in which he pointed out that it was likely enough that some of his predecessors had sought the office in order to enrich themselves but that his intentions were quite of another kind wishing as he did to increase the wealth and prosperity of the college and he finished by exhorting them to cherish mutual concord and amity after the surrender of oxford july 1646 harvey retired from the court he was in his sixtyninth year and doubtless found the hardships and inconveniences which the miserable war entailed far from conducive to health the rest and seclusion to be had at the residence of one or other of his brothers offered him the muchneeded opportunity of renewing his inquiries into the subject of generation and it is of this time that dr ent speaks in the preface to the published work on that subject which appeared in 1651 harassed with anxious and in the end not much availing cares about christmas last i sought to rid my spirit of the cloud that oppressed it by a visit to that great man the chief honour and ornament of our college dr william harvey then dwelling not far from the city i found him democrituslike busy with the study of natural things his countenance cheerful his mind serene embracing all within its sphere i forthwith saluted him and asked if all were well with him how can it said he whilst the commonwealth is full of distractions and i myself am still in the open sea and truly he continued did i not find solace in my studies and a balm for my spirit in the memory of my observations of former years i should feel little desire for longer life but so it has been that this life of obscurity this vacation from public business which causes tedium and disgust to so many has proved a sovereign remedy to me harvey died in june 1657 aubrey his contemporary says on the morning of his death about ten oclock he went to speake and found he had the dead palsey in his tongue then he sawe what was to become of him he knew there was then no hopes of his recovery so presently sends for his young nephews to come up to him to whom he gives one his watch to another another remembrance etc made sign to sambroke his apothecary to lett him blood in the tongue which did little or no good and so he ended his dayes the palsey did give him an easie passeport he lies buried in a vault at hempsted in essex which his brother eliab harvey built he is lapt in lead and on his brest in great letters dr william harvey i was at his funerall and helpt to carry him into the vault the publication of harveys views on the movement of the blood excited great surprise and opposition the theory of a complete circulation was at any rate novel but novelty was far from being a recommendation in those days according to aubrey the author was thought to be crackbrained and lost much of his practice in consequence he himself complains that contumelious epithets were levelled at the doctrine and its author it was not until after many years had elapsed and the facts had become familiar that men were struck with the simplicity of the theory and tried to prove that the idea was not new after all and that it was to be found in hippocrates or in galen or in servetus or in csalpinusanywhere in fact except where alone it existed namely in the work de motu cordis et sanguinis no one seems to have denied while harvey lived that he was the discoverer of the circulation of the blood indeed hobbes of malmesbury his contemporary said of him he is the only man perhaps that ever lived to see his own doctrine established in his lifetime in one important respect harveys account of the circulation was incomplete he knew nothing of the vessels which we now speak of as capillaries writing to paul marquard slegel of hamburg in 1651 he says when i perceived that the blood is transferred from the veins into the arteries through the medium of the heart by a grand mechanism and exquisite apparatus of valves i judged that in like manner wherever transudation does not take place through the pores of the flesh the blood is returned from the arteries to the veins not without some other admirable artifice non sine artificio quodam admirabili it was this artificium admirabile of which harvey was unable to give a description on account of the minuteness of their structure the capillaries were beyond his sight aided as it was by a magnifying glass merely he indeed demonstrated physiologically the existence of some such passages but it remained for a later observer with improved appliances to verify the fact this was done by malpighi in 1661 who saw in the lung of a frog which was so mounted in a frame as to be viewed by transmitted light the network of capillaries which connect the last ramifications of the arteries with the radicles of the veins harvey rightly denied that the arteries possessed any pulsific power of their own and maintained that their pulse is owing solely to the sudden distension of their walls by the blood thrown into them at each contraction of the ventricles but the remission which succeeds the pulse was regarded by him as caused simply by collapse of the walls of the arteries due to elastic reaction knowing nothing of the muscular coat of the arteries he was unaware of the fact that the elastic reaction of the arteries after their distension is aided by the tonic contractility of their walls the two forces physical and vital acting in concert with each otherthe former converting the intermittent flow from the heart into an even stream in the capillaries and veins the latter through the vasomotor system regulating the flow of blood to particular parts in order to meet changing requirements it is somewhat surprising to find that such an accurate observer as harvey should have failed to recognize the significance and importance of the system of lacteal vessels but such was the case eustachius in the sixteenth century had discovered the thoracic duct in the horse although he seems to have thought that it was peculiar to that animal aselli while dissecting the body of a dog in 1622 accidentally discovered the lacteals and thought at first that they were nerves but upon puncturing one of them and seeing the milky fluid which escaped found them to be vessels he however failed to trace them to the thoracic duct and believed them to terminate in the liver pecquet of dieppe followed them from the intestines to the mesenteric glands and from these into a common sac or reservoir which he designated receptaculum chyli and thence to their entry by a single slender conduit into the venous system at the junction of the jugular and subclavian veins the existence of the lacteals had not entirely escaped harvey however he had himself noticed them in the course of his dissections before asellis book was published but for various reasons could not bring himself to believe that they contained chyle the smallness of the thoracic duct seemed to him a difficulty and as it was a demonstrated fact that the gastric veins were largely absorptive the lacteals appeared to him superfluous he is not obstinately wedded to his own opinion and does not doubt but that many things now hidden in the well of democritus will byandby be drawn up into day by the ceaseless industry of a coming age late in the authors life as we have seen the work on the generation of animals appeared but neither physiological nor microscopical science was sufficiently advanced to admit of the production of an enduring work on a subject necessarily so abstruse as that of generation it was impossible however for so shrewd and able an investigator as harvey to work at a subject even as difficult as this without leaving the impress of his original genius he first announced the general truth omne animal ex ovo and clearly proved that the essential part of the egg that in which the reproductive processes begin was not the chalaz but the cicatricula this fabricius had looked upon as a blemish a scar left by a broken peduncle harvey described this little cicatricula as expanding under the influence of incubation into a wider structure which he called the eye of the egg and at the same time separating into a clear and transparent part in which later on according to him there appeared as the first rudiment of the embryo the heart or punctum saliens together with the bloodvessels he was clearly of opinion that the embryo arose by successive formation of parts out of the homogeneous and nearly liquid mass this was the doctrine of epigenesis which notwithstanding its temporary overthrow by the erroneous theory of evolution20 is with modifications the doctrine now held of harveys scholarship and culture we are not left in ignorance bishop pearson writing about seven years after the doctors death and aubrey21 have told us of his appreciation of the works of aristotle and in his own writings he refers more frequently to the stagirite than to any other individual sir william temple22 has also put it on record that the famous dr harvey was a great admirer of virgil whose works were frequently in his hands his store of individual knowledge must have been great and he seems never to have flagged in his anxiety to learn more he made himself master of oughtreds clavis mathematica in his old age according to aubrey who found him perusing it and working problems not long before he dyed nor should it be forgotten that this illustrious physiologist and scholar was also the first english comparative anatomist of his knowledge of the lower animals he makes frequent use and he says in his work on the heart had anatomists only been as conversant with the dissection of the lower animals as they are with that of the human body many matters that have hitherto kept them in a perplexity of doubt would in my opinion have met them freed from every kind of difficulty aubrey says that harvey often told him that of all the losses he sustained no grief was so crucifying to him as the loss of his papers containing notes of his dissections of the frog toad and other animals which together with his goods in his lodgings at whitehall were plundered at the beginning of the rebellion footnotes 20 according to the theory of evolution the egg contained from the first an excessively minute but complete animal and the changes which took place during incubation consisted not in a formation of parts but in a growth ie in an expansion of the already existing embryo see p 40 21 see p lxxxii of life by dr willis 22 miscellanies part ii on poetry p 314 index albertus magnus 65 alexander the great 23 24 andronicus of rhodes
