paris evolution in modern thought i darwins predecessors by j arthur thomson professor of natural history in the university of aberdeen in seeking to discover darwins relation to his predecessors it is useful to distinguish the various services which he rendered to the theory of organic evolution i as everyone knows the general idea of the doctrine of descent is that the plants and animals of the present day are the lineal descendants of ancestors on the whole somewhat simpler that these again are descended from yet simpler forms and so on backwards towards the literal protozoa and protophyta about which we unfortunately know nothing now no one supposes that darwin originated this idea which in rudiment at least is as old as aristotle what darwin did was to make it current intellectual coin he gave it a form that commended itself to the scientific and public intelligence of the day and he won widespread conviction by showing with consummate skill that it was an effective formula to work with a key which no lock refused in a scholarly critical and preeminently fairminded way admitting difficulties and removing them foreseeing objections and forestalling them he showed that the doctrine of descent supplied a modal interpretation of how our presentday fauna and flora have come to be ii in the second place darwin applied the evolutionidea to particular problems such as the descent of man and showed what a powerful organon it is introducing order into masses of uncorrelated facts interpreting enigmas both of structure and function both bodily and mental and best of all stimulating and guiding further investigation but here again it cannot be claimed that darwin was original the problem of the descent or ascent of man and other particular cases of evolution had attracted not a few naturalists before darwins day though no one except herbert spencer in the psychological domain 1855 had come near him in precision and thoroughness of inquiry iii in the third place darwin contributed largely to a knowledge of the factors in the evolutionprocess especially by his analysis of what occurs in the case of domestic animals and cultivated plants and by his elaboration of the theory of natural selection which alfred russel wallace independently stated at the same time and of which there had been a few previous suggestions of a more or less vague description it was here that darwins originality was greatest for he revealed to naturalists the many different formsoften very subtlewhich natural selection takes and with the insight of a disciplined scientific imagination he realised what a mighty engine of progress it has been and is iv as an epochmarking contribution not only to tiology but to natural history in the widest sense we rank the picture which darwin gave to the world of the web of life that is to say of the interrelations and linkages in nature for the biology of the individualif that be not a contradiction in termsno idea is more fundamental than that of the correlation of organs but darwins most characteristic contribution was not less fundamentalit was the idea of the correlation of organisms this again was not novel we find it in the works of naturalists like christian conrad sprengel gilbert white and alexander von humboldt but the realisation of its full import was distinctly darwinian as regards the general idea of organic evolution while it is true as prof h f osborn puts it that before and after darwin will always be the ante et post urbem conditam of biological history it is also true that the general idea of organic evolution is very ancient in his admirable sketch from the greeks to darwin1 prof osborn has shown that several of the ancient philosophers looked upon nature as a gradual development and as still in process of change in the suggestions of empedocles to take the best instance there were four sparks of truthfirst that the development of life was a gradual process second that plants were evolved before animals third that imperfect forms were gradually replaced not succeeded by perfect forms fourth that the natural cause of the production of perfect forms was the extinction of the imperfect2 but the fundamental idea of one stage giving origin to another was absent as the blue gean teemed with treasures of beauty and threw many upon its shores so did nature produce like a fertile artist what had to be rejected as well as what was able to survive but the idea of one species emerging out of another was not yet conceived aristotles views of nature3 seem to have been more definitely evolutionist than those of his predecessors in this sense at least that he recognised not only an ascending scale but a genetic series from polyp to man and an agelong movement towards perfection it is due to the resistance of matter to form that nature can only rise by degrees from lower to higher types nature produces those things which being continually moved by a certain principle contained in themselves arrive at a certain end to discern the outcrop of evolutiondoctrine in the long interval between aristotle and bacon seems to be very difficult and some of the instances that have been cited strike one as forced epicurus and lucretius often called poets of evolution both pictured animals as arising directly out of the earth very much as miltons lion long afterwards pawed its way out even when we come to bruno who wrote that to the sound of the harp of the universal apollo the world spirit the lower organisms are called by stages to higher and the lower stages are connected by intermediate forms with the higher there is great room as prof osborn points out4 for difference of opinion as to how far he was an evolutionist in our sense of the term the awakening of natural science in the sixteenth century brought the possibility of a concrete evolution theory nearer and in the early seventeenth century we find evidences of a new spiritin the embryology of harvey and the classifications of ray besides sober naturalists there were speculative dreamers in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries who had at least got beyond static formulae but as professor osborn points out5 it is a very striking fact that the basis of our modern methods of studying the evolution problem was established not by the early naturalists nor by the speculative writers but by the philosophers he refers to bacon descartes leibnitz hume kant lessing herder and schelling they alone were upon the main track of modern thought it is evident that they were groping in the dark for a working theory of the evolution of life and it is remarkable that they clearly perceived from the outset that the point to which observation should be directed was not the past but the present mutability of species and further that this mutability was simply the variation of individuals on an extended scale bacon seems to have been one of the first to think definitely about the mutability of species and he was far ahead of his age in his suggestion of what we now call a station of experimental evolution leibnitz discusses in so many words how the species of animals may be changed and how intermediate species may once have linked those that now seem discontinuous all natural orders of beings present but a single chain all advances by degrees in nature and nothing by leaps similar evolutionist statements are to be found in the works of the other philosophers to whom prof osborn refers who were indeed more scientific than the naturalists of their day it must be borne in mind that the general idea of organic evolutionthat the present is the child of the pastis in great part just the idea of human history projected upon the natural world differentiated by the qualification that the continuous becoming has been wrought out by forces inherent in the organisms themselves and in their environment a reference to kant6 should come in historical order after buffon with whose writings he was acquainted but he seems along with herder and schelling to be best regarded as the culmination of the evolutionist philosophersof those at least who interested themselves in scientific problems in a famous passage he speaks of the agreement of so many kinds of animals in a certain common plan of structure an analogy of forms which strengthens the supposition that they have an actual bloodrelationship due to derivation from a common parent he speaks of the great family of creatures for as a family we must conceive it if the abovementioned continuous and connected relationship has a real foundation prof osborn alludes to the scientific caution which led kant biology being what it was to refuse to entertain the hope that a newton may one day arise even to make the production of a blade of grass comprehensible according to natural laws ordained by no intention as prof haeckel finely observes darwin rose up as kants newton7 the scientific renaissance brought a wealth of fresh impressions and some freedom from the tyranny of tradition and the twofold stimulus stirred the speculative activity of a great variety of men from old claude duret of moulins of whose weird transformism 1609 dr henry de varigny8 gives us a glimpse to lorenz oken 17791851 whose writings are such mixtures of sense and nonsense that some regard him as a farseeing prophet and others as a fatuous follower of intellectual willothewisps similarly for de maillet maupertuis diderot bonnet and others we must agree with professor osborn that they were not actually in the main evolution movement some have been included in the roll of honour on very slender evidence robinet for instance whose evolutionism seems to us extremely dubious9 the first naturalist to give a broad and concrete expression to the evolutionist doctrine of descent was buffon 17071788 but it is interesting to recall the fact that his contemporary linnus 17071778 protagonist of the counterdoctrine of the fixity of species10 went the length of admitting in 1762 that new species might arise by intercrossing buffons position among the pioneers of the evolutiondoctrine is weakened by his habit of vacillating between his own conclusions and the orthodoxy of the sorbonne but there is no doubt that he had firm grasp of the general idea of lenchanment des tres erasmus darwin 17311802 probably influenced by buffon was another firm evolutionist and the outline of his argument in the zoonomia11 might serve in part at least today when we revolve in our minds the metamorphoses of animals as from the tadpole to the frog secondly the changes produced by artificial cultivation as in the breeds of horses dogs and sheep thirdly the changes produced by conditions of climate and of season as in the sheep of warm climates being covered with hair instead of wool and the hares and partridges of northern climates becoming white in winter when further we observe the changes of structure produced by habit as seen especially in men of different occupations or the changes produced by artificial mutilation and prenatal influences as in the crossing of species and production of monsters fourth when we observe the essential unity of plan in all warmblooded animalswe are led to conclude that they have been alike produced from a similar living filament from thus meditating upon the minute portion of time in which many of the above changes have been produced would it be too bold to imagine in the great length of time since the earth began to exist perhaps millions of years before the commencement of the history of mankind that all warmblooded animals have arisen from one living filament this idea of the gradual generation of all things seems to have been as familiar to the ancient philosophers as to the modern ones and to have given rise to the beautiful hieroglyphic figure of the greek prton on or first great egg produced by night that is whose origin is involved in obscurity and animated by greek ers that is by divine love from whence proceeded all things which exist lamarck 17441829 seems to have become an evolutionist independently of erasmus darwins influence though the parallelism between them is striking he probably owed something to buffon but he developed his theory along a different line whatever view be held in regard to that theory there is no doubt that lamarck was a thoroughgoing evolutionist professor haeckel speaks of the philosophie zoologique as the first connected and thoroughly logical exposition of the theory of descent12 besides the three old masters as we may call them buffon erasmus darwin and lamarck there were other quite convinced predarwinian evolutionists the historian of the theory of descent must take account of treviranus whose biology or philosophy of animate nature is full of evolutionary suggestions of etienne geoffroy st hilaire who in 1830 before the french academy of sciences fought with cuvier the fellowworker of his youth an intellectual duel on the question of descent of goethe one of the founders of morphology and the greatest poet of evolutionwho in his eightyfirst year heard the tidings of geoffrey st hilaires defeat with an interest which transcended the political anxieties of the time and of many others who had gained with more or less confidence and clearness a new outlook on nature it will be remembered that darwin refers to thirtyfour more or less evolutionist authors in his historical sketch and the list might be added to especially when we come near to 1858 do the numbers increase and one of the most remarkable as also most independent champions of the evolutionidea before that date was herbert spencer who not only marshalled the arguments in a very forcible way in 1852 but applied the formula in detail in his principles of psychology in 185513 it is right and proper that we should shake ourselves free from all creationist appreciations of darwin and that we should recognise the services of predarwinian evolutionists who helped to make the time ripe yet one cannot help feeling that the citation of them is apt to suggest two fallacies it may suggest that darwin simply entered into the labours of his predecessors whereas as a matter of fact he knew very little about them till after he had been for years at work to write as samuel butler did buffon planted erasmus darwin and lamarck watered but it was mr darwin who said that fruit is ripe and shook it into his lap seems to us a quite misleading version of the facts of the case the second fallacy which the historical citation is a little apt to suggest is that the filiation of ideas is a simple problem on the contrary the history of an idea like the pedigree of an organism is often very intricate and the evolution of the evolutionidea is bound up with the whole progress of the world thus in order to interpret darwins clear formulation of the idea of organic evolution and his convincing presentation of it we have to do more than go back to his immediate predecessors such as buffon erasmus darwin and lamarck we have to inquire into the acceptance of evolutionary conceptions in regard to other orders of facts such as the earth and the solar system14 we have to realise how the growing success of scientific interpretation along other lines gave confidence to those who refused to admit that there was any domain from which science could be excluded as a trespasser we have to take account of the development of philosophical thought and even of theological and religious movements we should also if we are wise enough consider social changes in short we must abandon the idea that we can understand the history of any science as such without reference to contemporary evolution in other departments of activity while there were many evolutionists before darwin few of them were expert naturalists and few were known outside a small circle what was of much more importance was that the genetic view of nature was insinuating itself in regard to other than biological orders of facts here a little and there a little and that the scientific spirit had ripened since the days when cuvier laughed lamarck out of court how was it that darwin succeeded where others had failed because in the first place he had clear visionspenses de la jeunesse executes par lge mrwhich a university curriculum had not made impossible which the beagle voyage made vivid which an unrivalled british doggedness made realvisions of the web of life of the fountain of change within the organism of the struggle for existence and its winnowing and of the spreading genealogical tree because in the second place he put so much grit into the verification of his visions putting them to the proof in an argument which is of its kinddirect demonstration being out of the questionquite unequalled because in the third place he broke down the opposition which the most scientific had felt to the seductive modal formula of evolution by bringing forward a more plausible theory of the process than had been previously suggested nor can one forget since questions of this magnitude are human and not merely academic that he wrote so that all men could understand as regards the factors of evolution it is admitted by all who are acquainted with the history of biology that the general idea of organic evolution as expressed in the doctrine of descent was quite familiar to darwins grandfather and to others before and after him as we have briefly indicated it must also be admitted that some of these pioneers of evolutionism did more than apply the evolutionidea as a modal formula of becoming they began to inquire into the factors in the process thus there were predarwinian theories of evolution and to these we must now briefly refer15 in all biological thinking we have to work with the categories organismfunctionenvironment and theories of evolution may be classified in relation to these to some it has always seemed that the fundamental fact is the living organisma creative agent a striving will a changeful proteus selecting its environment adjusting itself to it selfdifferentiating and selfadaptive the necessity of recognising the importance of the organism is admitted by all darwinians who start with inborn variations but it is open to question whether the whole truth of what we might call the goethian position is exhausted in the postulate of inherent variability to others it has always seemed that the emphasis should be laid on functionon use and disuse on doing and not doing practice makes perfect cest force de forger quon devient forgeron this is one of the fundamental ideas of lamarckism to some extent it met with darwins approval and it finds many supporters today one of the ablest of thesemr francis darwinhas recently given strong reasons for combining a modernised lamarckism with what we usually regard as sound darwinism16 to others it has always seemed that the emphasis should be laid on the environment which wakes the organism to action prompts it to change makes dints upon it moulds it prunes it and finally perhaps kills it it is again impossible to doubt that there is truth in this view for even if environmentally induced modifications be not transmissible environmentally induced variations are and even if the direct influence of the environment be less important than many enthusiastic supporters of this viewmay we call them buffoniansthink there remains the indirect influence which darwinians in part rely onthe eliminative process even if the extreme view be held that the only form of discriminate elimination that counts is interorganismal competition this might be included under the rubric of the animate environment in many passages buffon17 definitely suggested that environmental influencesespecially of climate and foodwere directly productive of changes in organisms but he did not discuss the question of the transmissibility of the modifications so induced and it is difficult to gather from his inconsistent writings what extent of transformation he really believed in prof osborn says of buffon the struggle for existence the elimination of the leastperfected species the contest between the fecundity of certain species and their constant destruction are all clearly expressed in various passages he quotes two of these18 le cours ordinaire de la nature vivante est en gnral toujours constant toujours le mme son mouvement toujours rgulier roule sur deux points inbranlables lun la fcondit sans bornes donne toutes les espces lautre les obstacles sans nombre qui rduisent cette fcondit une mesure dtermine et ne laissent en tout temps qu peu prs la mme quantit dindividus de chaque espce les espces les moins parfaites les plus dlicates les plus pesantes les moins agissantes les moins armes etc ont dj disparu ou disparatront erasmus darwin19 had a firm grip of the idea of the gradual formation and improvement of the animal world and he had his theory of the process no sentence is more characteristic than this all animals undergo transformations which are in part produced by their own exertions in response to pleasures and pains and many of these acquired forms or propensities are transmitted to their posterity this is lamarckism before lamarck as his grandson pointed out his central idea is that wants stimulate efforts and that these result in improvements which subsequent generations make better still he realised something of the struggle for existence and even pointed out that this advantageously checks the rapid multiplication as dr krause points out darwin just misses the connection between this struggle and the survival of the fittest20 lamarck21 17441829 seems to have thought out his theory of evolution without any knowledge of erasmus darwins which it closely resembled the central idea of his theory was the cumulative inheritance of functional modifications changes in environment bring about changes in the habits of animals changes in their wants necessarily bring about parallel changes in their habits if new wants become constant or very lasting they form new habits the new habits involve the use of new parts or a different use of old parts which results finally in the production of new organs and the modification of old ones he differed from buffon in not attaching importance as far as animals are concerned to the direct influence of the environment for environment can effect no direct change whatever upon the organisation of animals but in regard to plants he agreed with buffon that external conditions directly moulded them treviranus22 17761837 whom huxley ranked beside lamarck was on the whole buffonian attaching chief importance to the influence of a changeful environment both in modifying and in eliminating but he was also goethian for instance in his idea that species like individuals pass through periods of growth full bloom and decline thus it is not only the great catastrophes of nature which have caused extinction but the completion of cycles of existence out of which new cycles have begun a characteristic sentence is quoted by prof osborn in every living being there exists a capability of an endless variety of formassumption each possesses the power to adapt its organisation to the changes of the outer world and it is this power put into action by the change of the universe that has raised the simple zoophytes of the primitive world to continually higher stages of organisation and has introduced a countless variety of species into animate nature goethe23 17491832 who knew buffons work but not lamarcks is peculiarly interesting as one of the first to use the evolutionidea as a guiding hypothesis eg in the interpretation of vestigial structures in man and to realise that organisms express an attempt to make a compromise between specific inertia and individual change he gave the finest expression that science has yet knownif it has known itof the kernelidea of what is called bathmism the idea of an inherent growthforceand at the same time he held that the way of life powerfully reacts upon all form and that the orderly growth of form yields to change from externally acting causes besides buffon erasmus darwin lamarck treviranus and goethe there were other pioneers of evolution whose views have been often discussed and appraised tienne geoffroy sainthilaire 17721884 whose work goethe so much admired was on the whole buffonian emphasising the direct action of the changeful milieu species vary with their environment and existing species have descended by modification from earlier and somewhat simpler species he had a glimpse of the selection idea and believed in mutations or sudden leapsinduced in the embryonic condition by external influences the complete history of evolutiontheories will include many instances of guesses at truth which were afterwards substantiated thus the geographer von buch 17731853 detected the importance of the isolation factor on which wagner romanes gulick and others have laid great stress but we must content ourselves with recalling one other pioneer the author of the vestiges of creation 1844 a work which passed through ten editions in nine years and certainly helped to harrow the soil for darwins sowing as darwin said it did excellent service in this country in calling attention to the subject in removing prejudice and in thus preparing the ground for the reception of analogous views24 its author robert chambers 18021871 was in part a buffonianmaintaining that environment moulded organisms adaptively and in part a goethianbelieving in an inherent progressive impulse which lifted organisms from one grade of organisation to another as regards natural selection the only thinker to whom darwin was directly indebted so far as the theory of natural selection is concerned was malthus and we may once more quote the wellknown passage in the autobiography in october 1838 that is fifteen months after i had begun my systematic enquiry i happened to read for amusement malthus on population and being well prepared to appreciate the struggle for existence which everywhere goes on from longcontinued observation of the habits of animals and plants it at once struck me that under these circumstances favourable variations would tend to be preserved and unfavourable ones to be destroyed the result of this would be the formation of new species25 although malthus gives no adumbration of the idea of natural selection in his exposition of the eliminative processes which go on in mankind the suggestive value of his essay is undeniable as is strikingly borne out by the fact that it gave to alfred russel wallace also the longsought clue to the effective agent in the evolution of organic species26 one day in ternate when he was resting between fits of fever something brought to his recollection the work of malthus which he had read twelve years before i thought of his clear exposition of the positive checks to increasedisease accidents war and faminewhich keep down the population of savage races to so much lower an average than that of more civilized peoples it then occurred to me that these causes or their equivalents are continually acting in the case of animals also and as animals usually breed much more rapidly than does mankind the destruction every year from these causes must be enormous in order to keep down the numbers of each species since they evidently do not increase regularly from year to year as otherwise the world would long ago have been densely crowded with those that breed most quickly vaguely thinking over the enormous and constant destruction which this implied it occurred to me to ask the question why do some die and some live and the answer was clearly that on the whole the best fitted live from the effects of disease the most healthy escaped from enemies the strongest the swiftest or the most cunning from famine the best hunters or those with the best digestion and so on then it suddenly flashed upon me that this selfacting process would necessarily improve the race because in every generation the inferior would inevitably be killed off and the superior would remainthat is the fittest would survive27 we need not apologise for this long quotation it is a tribute to darwins magnanimous colleague the nestor of the evolutionist campand it probably indicates the line of thought which darwin himself followed it is interesting also to recall the fact that in 1852 when herbert spencer wrote his famous leader article on the development hypothesis in which he argued powerfully for the thesis that the whole animate world is the result of an agelong process of natural transformation he wrote for the westminster review another important essay a theory of population deduced from the general law of animal fertility towards the close of which he came within an ace of recognising that the struggle for existence was a factor in organic evolution at a time when pressure of population was practically interesting mens minds darwin wallace and spencer were being independently led from a social problem to a biological theory there could be no better illustration as prof patrick geddes has pointed out of the comtian thesis that science is a social phenomenon therefore as far more important than any further ferreting out of vague hints of natural selection in books which darwin never read we would indicate by a quotation the view that the central idea in darwinism is correlated with contemporary social evolution the substitution of darwin for paley as the chief interpreter of the order of nature is currently regarded as the displacement of an anthropomorphic view by a purely scientific one a little reflection however will show that what has actually happened has been merely the replacement of the anthropomorphism of the eighteenth century by that of the nineteenth for the place vacated by paleys theological and metaphysical explanation has simply been occupied by that suggested to darwin and wallace by malthus in terms of the prevalent severity of industrial competition and those phenomena of the struggle for existence which the light of contemporary economic theory has enabled us to discern have thus come to be temporarily exalted into a complete explanation of organic progress28 it goes without saying that the idea suggested by malthus was developed by darwin into a biological theory which was then painstakingly verified by being used as an interpretative formula and that the validity of a theory so established is not affected by what suggested it but the practical question which this line of thought raises in the mind is this if biology did thus borrow with such splendid results from social theory why should we not more deliberately repeat the experiment darwin was characteristically frank and generous in admitting that the principle of natural selection had been independently recognised by dr w c wells in 1813 and by mr patrick matthew in 1831 but he had no knowledge of these anticipations when he published the first edition of the origin of species wells whose essay on dew is still remembered read in 1813 before the royal society a short paper entitled an account of a white female part of whose skin resembles that of a negro published in 1818 in this communication as darwin said he observes firstly that all animals tend to vary in some degree and secondly that agriculturists improve their domesticated animals by selection and then he adds but what is done in this latter case by art seems to be done with equal efficacy though more slowly by nature in the formation of varieties of mankind fitted for the country which they inhabit29 thus wells had the clear idea of survival dependent upon a favourable variation but he makes no more use of the idea and applies it only to man there is not in the paper the least hint that the author ever thought of generalising the remarkable sentence quoted above of mr patrick matthew who buried his treasure in an appendix to a work on naval timber and arboriculture darwin said that he clearly saw the full force of the principle of natural selection in 1860 darwin wrotevery characteristicallyabout this to lyell mr patrick matthew publishes a long extract from his work on naval timber and arboriculture published in 1831 in which he briefly but completely anticipates the theory of natural selection i have ordered the book as some passages are rather obscure but it is certainly i think a complete but not developed anticipation erasmus always said that surely this would be shown to be the case some day anyhow one may be excused in not having discovered the fact in a work on naval timber30 de quatrefages and de varigny have maintained that the botanist naudin stated the theory of evolution by natural selection in 1852 he explains very clearly the process of artificial selection and says that in the garden we are following natures method we do not think that nature has made her species in a different fashion from that in which we proceed ourselves in order to make our variations but as darwin said he does not show how selection acts under nature similarly it must be noted in regard to several predarwinian pictures of the struggle for existence such as herders who wrote in 1790 all is in struggle each one for himself and so on that a recognition of this is only the first step in darwinism profs e perrier and h f osborn have called attention to a remarkable anticipation of the selectionidea which is to be found in the speculations of tienne geoffroy sainthilaire 18251828 on the evolution of modern crocodilians from the ancient teleosaurs changing environment induced changes in the respiratory system and farreaching consequences followed the atmosphere acting upon the pulmonary cells brings about modifications which are favourable or destructive funestes these are inherited and they influence all the rest of the organisation of the animal because if these modifications lead to injurious effects the animals which exhibit them perish and are replaced by others of a somewhat different form a form changed so as to be adapted to la convenance the new environment prof e b poulton31 has shown that the anthropologist james cowles prichard 17861848 must be included even in spite of himself among the precursors of darwin in some passages of the second edition of his researches into the physical history of mankind 1826 he certainly talks evolution and anticipates prof weismann in denying the transmission of acquired characters he is however sadly selfcontradictory and his evolutionism weakens in subsequent editionsthe only ones that darwin saw prof poulton finds in prichards work a recognition of the operation of natural selection after inquiring how it is that these varieties are developed and preserved in connexion with particular climates and differences of local situation he gives the following very significant answer one cause which tends to maintain this relation is obvious individuals and families and even whole colonies perish and disappear in climates for which they are by peculiarity of constitution not adapted of this fact proofs have been already mentioned mr francis darwin and prof a c seward discuss prichards anticipations in more letters of charles darwin vol i p 43 and come to the conclusion that the evolutionary passages are entirely neutralised by others of an opposite trend there is the same difficulty with buffon hints of the idea of natural selection have been detected elsewhere james watt32 for instance has been reported as one of the anticipators 1851 but we need not prolong the inquiry further since darwin did not know of any anticipations until after he had published the immortal work of 1859 and since none of those who got hold of the idea made any use of it what darwin did was to follow the clue which malthus gave him to realise first by genius and afterwards by patience how the complex and subtle struggle for existence works out a natural selection of those organisms which vary in the direction of fitter adaptation to the conditions of their life so much success attended his application of the selectionformula that for a time he regarded natural selection as almost the sole factor in evolution variations being presupposed gradually however he came to recognise that there was some validity in the factors which had been emphasised by lamarck and by buffon and in his well known summing up in the sixth edition of the origin he says of the transformation of species this has been effected chiefly through the natural selection of numerous successive slight favourable variations aided in an important manner by the inherited effects of the use and disuse of parts and in an unimportant manner that is in relation to adaptive structures whether past or present by the direct action of external conditions and by variations which seem to us in our ignorance to arise spontaneously to sum up the idea of organic evolution older than aristotle slowly developed from the stage of suggestion to the stage of verification and the first convincing verification was darwins from being an a priori anticipation it has become an interpretation of nature and darwin is still the chief interpreter from being a modal interpretation it has advanced to the rank of a causal theory

life not only thrown a flood of light on the process of development of the whole organic world but also established a firm foundation for all future study of nature darwinism london 1889 p 9 see also

geddess article variation and selection encyclopaedia britannica 9th edit 1888 ii the selection theory by august weismann professor of zoology in the university of freiburg baden i the idea of selection many and diverse were the discoveries made by charles darwin in the course of a long and strenuous life but none of them has had so farreaching an influence on the science and thought of his time as the theory of selection i do not believe that the theory of evolution would have made its way so easily and so quickly after darwin took up the cudgels in favour of it if he had not been able to support it by a principle which was capable of solving in a simple manner the greatest riddle that living nature presents to usi mean the purposiveness of every living form relative to the conditions of its life and its marvellously exact adaptation to these everyone knows that darwin was not alone in discovering the principle of selection and that the same idea occurred simultaneously and independently to alfred russel wallace at the memorable meeting of the linnean society on 1st july 1858 two papers were read communicated by lyell and hooker both setting forth the same idea of selection one was written by charles darwin in kent the other by alfred wallace in ternate in the malay archipelago it was a splendid proof of the magnanimity of these two investigators that they thus in all friendliness and without envy united in laying their ideas before a scientific tribunal their names will always shine side by side as two of the brightest stars in the scientific sky the idea of selection set forth by the two naturalists was at the time absolutely new but it was also so simple that huxley could say of it later how extremely stupid not to have thought of that as darwin was led to the general doctrine of descent not through the labours of his predecessors in the early years of the century but by his own observations so it was in regard to the principle of selection he was struck by the innumerable cases of adaptation as for instance that of the woodpeckers and treefrogs to climbing or the hooks and featherlike appendages of seeds which aid in the distribution of plants and he said to himself that an explanation of adaptations was the first thing to be sought for in attempting to formulate a theory of evolution but since adaptations point to changes which have been undergone by the ancestral forms of existing species it is necessary first of all to inquire how far species in general are variable thus darwins attention was directed in the first place to the phenomenon of variability and the use man has made of this from very early times in the breeding of his domesticated animals and cultivated plants he inquired carefully how breeders set to work when they wished to modify the structure and appearance of a species to their own ends and it was soon clear to him that selection for breeding purposes played the chief part but how was it possible that such processes should occur in free nature who is here the breeder making the selection choosing out one individual to bring forth offspring and rejecting others that was the problem that for a long time remained a riddle to him darwin himself relates how illumination suddenly came to him he had been reading for his own pleasure malthus book on population and as he had long known from numerous observations that every species gives rise to many more descendants than ever attain to maturity and that therefore the greater number of the descendants of a species perish without reproducing the idea came to him that the decision as to which member of a species was to perish and which was to attain to maturity and reproduction might not be a matter of chance but might be determined by the constitution of the individuals themselves according as they were more or less fitted for survival with this idea the foundation of the theory of selection was laid in artificial selection the breeder chooses out for pairing only such individuals as possess the character desired by him in a somewhat higher degree than the rest of the race some of the descendants inherit this character often in a still higher degree and if this method be pursued throughout several generations the race is transformed in respect of that particular character natural selection depends on the same three factors as artificial selection on variability inheritance and selection for breeding but this last is here carried out not by a breeder but by what darwin called the struggle for existence this last factor is one of the special features of the darwinian conception of nature that there are carnivorous animals which take heavy toll in every generation of the progeny of the animals on which they prey and that there are herbivores which decimate the plants in every generation had long been known but it is only since darwins time that sufficient attention has been paid to the facts that in addition to this regular destruction there exists between the members of a species a keen competition for space and food which limits multiplication and that numerous individuals of each species perish because of unfavourable climatic conditions the struggle for existence which darwin regarded as taking the place of the human breeder in free nature is not a direct struggle between carnivores and their prey but is the assumed competition for survival between individuals of the same species of which on an average only those survive to reproduce which have the greatest power of resistance while the others less favourably constituted perish early this struggle is so keen that within a limited area where the conditions of life have long remained unchanged of every species whatever be the degree of fertility only two on an average of the descendants of each pair survive the others succumb either to enemies or to disadvantages of climate or to accident a high degree of fertility is thus not an indication of the special success of a species but of the numerous dangers that have attended its evolution of the six young brought forth by a pair of elephants in the course of their lives only two survive in a given area similarly of the millions of eggs which two threadworms leave behind them only two survive it is thus possible to estimate the dangers which threaten a species by its ratio of elimination or since this cannot be done directly by its fertility although a great number of the descendants of each generation fall victims to accident among those that remain it is still the greater or less fitness of the organism that determines the selection for breeding purposes and it would be incomprehensible if in this competition it were not ultimately that is on an average the best equipped which survive in the sense of living long enough to reproduce thus the principle of natural selection is the selection of the best for reproduction whether the best refers to the whole constitution to one or more parts of the organism or to one or more stages of development every organ every part every character of an animal fertility and intelligence included must be improved in this manner and be gradually brought up in the course of generations to its highest attainable state of perfection and not only may improvement of parts be brought about in this way but new parts and organs may arise since through the slow and minute steps of individual or fluctuating variations a part may be added here or dropped out there and thus something new is produced the principle of selection solved the riddle as to how what was purposive could conceivably be brought about without the intervention of a directing power the riddle which animate nature presents to our intelligence at every turn and in face of which the mind of a kant could find no way out for he regarded a solution of it as not to be hoped for for even if we were to assume an evolutionary force that is continually transforming the most primitive and the simplest forms of life into ever higher forms and the homogeneity of primitive times into the infinite variety of the present we should still be unable to infer from this alone how each of the numberless forms adapted to particular conditions of life should have appeared precisely at the right moment in the history of the earth to which their adaptations were appropriate and precisely at the proper place in which all the conditions of life to which they were adapted occurred the hummingbirds at the same time as the flowers the trichina at the same time as the pig the barkcoloured moth at the same time as the oak and the wasplike moth at the same time as the wasp which protects it without processes of selection we should be obliged to assume a preestablished harmony after the famous leibnitzian model by means of which the clock of the evolution of organisms is so regulated as to strike in exact synchronism with that of the history of the earth all forms of life are strictly adapted to the conditions of their life and can persist under these conditions alone there must therefore be an intrinsic connection between the conditions and the structural adaptations of the organism and since the conditions of life cannot be determined by the animal itself the adaptations must be called forth by the conditions the selection theory teaches us how this is conceivable since it enables us to understand that there is a continual production of what is nonpurposive as well as of what is purposive but the purposive alone survives while the nonpurposive perishes in the very act of arising this is the old wisdom taught long ago by empedocles ii the lamarckian principle lamarck as is well known formulated a definite theory of evolution at the beginning of the nineteenth century exactly fifty years before the darwinwallace principle of selection was given to the world this brilliant investigator also endeavoured to support his theory by demonstrating forces which might have brought about the transformations of the organic world in the course of the ages in addition to other factors he laid special emphasis on the increased or diminished use of the parts of the body assuming that the strengthening or weakening which takes place from this cause during the individual life could be handed on to the offspring and thus intensified and raised to the rank of a specific character darwin also regarded this lamarckian principle as it is now generally called as a factor in evolution but he was not fully convinced of the transmissibility of acquired characters as i have here to deal only with the theory of selection i need not discuss the lamarckian hypothesis but i must express my opinion that there is room for much doubt as to the coperation of this principle in evolution not only is it difficult to imagine how the transmission of functional modifications could take place but up to the present time notwithstanding the endeavours of many excellent investigators not a single actual proof of such inheritance has been brought forward semons experiments on plants are according to the botanist pfeffer not to be relied on and even the recent beautiful experiments made by dr kammerer on salamanders cannot as i hope to show elsewhere be regarded as proof if only because they do not deal at all with functional modifications that is with modifications brought about by use and it is to these alone that the lamarckian principle refers iii objections to the theory of selection a saltatory evolution the darwinian doctrine of evolution depends essentially on the cumulative augmentation of minute variations in the direction of utility but can such minute variations which are undoubtedly continually appearing among the individuals of the same species possess any selectionvalue can they determine which individuals are to survive and which are to succumb can they be increased by natural selection till they attain to the highest development of a purposive variation to many this seems so improbable that they have urged a theory of evolution by leaps from species to species klliker in 1872 compared the evolution of species with the processes which we can observe in the individual life in cases of alternation of generations but a polyp only gives rise to a medusa because it has itself arisen from one and there can be no question of a medusa ever having arisen suddenly and de novo from a polypbud if only because both forms are adapted in their structure as a whole and in every detail to the conditions of their life a sudden origin in a natural way of numerous adaptations is inconceivable even the degeneration of a medusoid from a freeswimming animal to a mere broodsac gonophore is not sudden and saltatory but occurs by imperceptible modifications throughout hundreds of years as we can learn from the numerous stages of the process of degeneration persisting at the same time in different species if then the degeneration to a simple broodsac takes place only by very slow transitions each stage of which may last for centuries how could the much more complex ascending evolution possibly have taken place by sudden leaps i regard this argument as capable of further extension for wherever in nature we come upon degeneration it is taking place by minute steps and with a slowness that makes it not directly perceptible and i believe that this in itself justifies us in concluding that the same must be true of ascending evolution but in the latter case the goal can seldom be distinctly recognised while in cases of degeneration the startingpoint of the process can often be inferred because several nearly related species may represent different stages in recent years bateson in particular has championed the idea of saltatory or socalled discontinuous evolution and has collected a number of cases in which more or less marked variations have suddenly appeared these are taken for the most part from among domesticated animals which have been bred and crossed for a long time and it is hardly to be wondered at that their much mixed and much influenced germplasm should under certain conditions give rise to remarkable phenomena often indeed producing forms which are strongly suggestive of monstrosities and which would undoubtedly not survive in free nature unprotected by man i should regard such cases as due to an intensified germinal selectionthough this is to anticipate a littleand from this point of view it cannot be denied that they have a special interest but they seem to me to have no significance as far as the transformation of species is concerned if only because of the extreme rarity of their occurrence there are however many variations which have appeared in a sudden and saltatory manner and some of these darwin pointed out and discussed in detail the copper beech the weeping trees the oak with fernlike leaves certain gardenflowers etc but none of them have persisted in free nature or evolved into permanent types on the other hand wherever enduring types have arisen we find traces of a gradual origin by successive stages even if at first sight their origin may appear to have been sudden this is the case with seasonal dimorphism the first known cases of which exhibited marked differences between the two generations the winter and the summer brood take for instance the much discussed and studied form vanessa araschnia levanaprorsa here the differences between the two forms are so great and so apparently disconnected that one might almost believe it to be a sudden mutation were it not that old transitionstages can be called forth by particular temperatures and we know other butterflies as for instance our garden whites in which the differences between the two generations are not nearly so marked indeed they are so little apparent that they are scarcely likely to be noticed except by experts thus here again there are small initial steps some of which indeed must be regarded as adaptations such as the greensprinkled or lightly tinted undersurface which gives them a deceptive resemblance to parsley or to cardamine leaves even if saltatory variations do occur we cannot assume that these have ever led to forms which are capable of survival under the conditions of wild life experience has shown that in plants which have suddenly varied the power of persistence is diminished korschinsky attributes to them weaknesses of organisation in general they bloom late ripen few of their seeds and show great sensitiveness to cold these are not the characters which make for success in the struggle for existence we must briefly refer here to the viewsmuch discussed in the last decadeof h de vries who believes that the roots of transformation must be sought for in saltatory variations arising from internal causes and distinguishes such mutations as he has called them from ordinary individual variations in that they breed true that is with strict inbreeding they are handed on pure to the next generation i have elsewhere endeavoured to point out the weaknesses of this theory33 and i am the less inclined to return to it here that it now appears34 that the farreaching conclusions drawn by de vries from his observations on the evening primrose oenothera lamarckiana rest upon a very insecure foundation the plant from which de vries saw numerous specieshis mutationsarise was not as he assumed a wild species that had been introduced to europe from america but was probably a hybrid form which was first discovered in the jardin des plantes in paris and which does not appear to exist anywhere in america as a wild species this gives a severe shock to the mutation theory for the other actually wild species with which de vries experimented showed no mutations but yielded only negative results thus we come to the conclusion that darwin35 was right in regarding transformations as taking place by minute steps which if useful are augmented in the course of innumerable generations because their possessors more frequently survive in the struggle for existence b selectionvalue of the initial steps is it possible that the insignificant deviations which we know as individual variations can form the beginning of a process of selection can they decide which is to perish and which to survive to use a phrase of romanes can they have selectionvalue darwin himself answered this question and brought together many excellent examples to show that differences apparently insignificant because very small might be of decisive importance for the life of the possessor but it is by no means enough to bring forward cases of this kind for the question is not merely whether finished adaptations have selectionvalue but whether the first beginnings of these and whether the small i might almost say minimal increments which have led up from these beginnings to the perfect adaptation have also had selectionvalue to this question even one who like myself has been for many years a convinced adherent of the theory of selection can only reply we must assume so but we cannot prove it in any case it is not upon demonstrative evidence that we rely when we champion the doctrine of selection as a scientific truth we base our argument on quite other grounds undoubtedly there are many apparently insignificant features which can nevertheless be shown to be adaptationsfor instance the thickness of the basinshaped shell of the limpets that live among the breakers on the shore there can be no doubt that the thickness of these shells combined with their flat forms protects the animals from the force of the waves breaking upon thembut how have they become so thick what proportion of thickness was sufficient to decide that of two variants of a limpet one should survive the other be eliminated we can say nothing more than that we infer from the present state of the shell that it must have varied in regard to differences in shellthickness and that these differences must have had selectionvalueno proof therefore but an assumption which we must show to be convincing for a long time the marvellously complex radiate and latticework skeletons of radiolarians were regarded as a mere outflow of natures infinite wealth of form as an instance of a purely morphological character with no biological significance but recent investigations have shown that these too have an adaptive significance hcker the same thing has been shown by schtt in regard to the lowly unicellular plants the peridineae which abound alike on the surface of the ocean and in its depths it has been shown that the long skeletal processes which grow out from these organisms have significance not merely as a supporting skeleton but also as an extension of the superficial area which increases the contact with the waterparticles and prevents the floating organisms from sinking it has been established that the processes are considerably shorter in the colder layers of the ocean and that they may be twelve times as long36 in the warmer layers thus corresponding to the greater or smaller amount of friction which takes place in the denser and less dense layers of the water the peridineae of the warmer ocean layers have thus become longrayed those of the colder layers shortrayed not through the direct effect of friction on the protoplasm but through processes of selection which favoured the longer rays in warm water since they kept the organism afloat while those with short rays sank and were eliminated if we put the question as to selectionvalue in this case and ask how great the variations in the length of processes must be in order to possess selectionvalue what can we answer except that these variations must have been minimal and yet sufficient to prevent too rapid sinking and consequent elimination yet this very case would give the ideal opportunity for a mathematical calculation of the minimal selectionvalue although of course it is not feasible from lack of data to carry out the actual calculation but even in organisms of more than microscopic size there must frequently be minute even microscopic differences which set going the process of selection and regulate its progress to the highest possible perfection many tropical trees possess thick leathery leaves as a protection against the force of the tropical raindrops the direct influence of the rain cannot be the cause of this power of resistance for the leaves while they were still thin would simply have been torn to pieces their toughness must therefore be referred to selection which would favour the trees with slightly thicker leaves though we cannot calculate with any exactness how great the first stages of increase in thickness must have been our hypothesis receives further support from the fact that in many such trees the leaves are drawn out into a beaklike prolongation stahl and haberlandt which facilitates the rapid falling off of the rain water and also from the fact that the leaves while they are still young hang limply down in bunches which offer the least possible resistance to the rain thus there are here three adaptations which can only be interpreted as due to selection the initial stages of these adaptations must undoubtedly have had selectionvalue but even in regard to this case we are reasoning in a circle not giving proofs and no one who does not wish to believe in the selectionvalue of the initial stages can be forced to do so among the many pieces of presumptive evidence a particularly weighty one seems to me to be the smallness of the steps of progress which we can observe in certain cases as for instance in leafimitation among butterflies and in mimicry generally the resemblance to a leaf for instance of a particular kallima seems to us so close as to be deceptive and yet we find in another individual or it may be in many others a spot added which increases the resemblance and which could not have become fixed unless the increased deceptiveness so produced had frequently led to the overlooking of its much persecuted possessor but if we take the selectionvalue of the initial stages for granted we are confronted with the further question which i myself formulated many years ago how does it happen that the necessary beginnings of a useful variation are always present how could insects which live upon or among green leaves become all green while those that live on bark become brown how have the desert animals become yellow and the arctic animals white why were the necessary variations always present how could the green locust lay brown eggs or the privet caterpillar develop white and lilaccoloured lines on its green skin it is of no use answering to this that the question is wrongly formulated37 and that it is the converse that is true that the process of selection takes place in accordance with the variations that present themselves this proposition is undeniably true but so also is another which apparently negatives it the variation required has in the majority of cases actually presented itself selection cannot solve this contradiction it does not call forth the useful variation but simply works upon it the ultimate reason why one and the same insect should occur in green and in brown as often happens in caterpillars and locusts lies in the fact that variations towards brown presented themselves and so also did variations towards green the kernel of the riddle lies in the varying and for the present we can only say that small variations in different directions present themselves in every species otherwise so many different kinds of variations could not have arisen i have endeavoured to explain this remarkable fact by means of the intimate processes that must take place within the germplasm and i shall return to the problem when dealing with germinal selection we have however to make still greater demands on variation for it is not enough that the necessary variation should occur in isolated individuals because in that case there would be small prospect of its being preserved notwithstanding its utility darwin at first believed that even single variations might lead to transformation of the species but later he became convinced that this was impossible at least without the coperation of other factors such as isolation and sexual selection in the case of the green caterpillars with bright longitudinal stripes numerous individuals exhibiting this useful variation must have been produced to start with in all higher that is multicellular organisms the germsubstance is the source of all transmissible variations and this germplasm is not a simple substance but is made up of many primary constituents the question can therefore be more precisely stated thus how does it come about that in so many cases the useful variations present themselves in numbers just where they are required the white oblique lines in the leafcaterpillar on the under surface of the body the accompanying coloured stripes just above them and further how has it come about that in grass caterpillars not oblique but longitudinal stripes which are more effective for concealment among grass and plants have been evolved and finally how is it that the same hawkmoth caterpillars which today show oblique stripes possessed longitudinal stripes in tertiary times we can read this fact from the history of their development and i have before attempted to show the biological significance of this change of colour38 for the present i need only draw the conclusion that one and the same caterpillar may exhibit the initial stages of both and that it depends on the manner in which these marking elements are intensified and combined by natural selection whether whitish longitudinal or oblique stripes should result in this case then the useful variations were actually always there and we see that in the same group of lepidoptera eg species of sphingidae evolution has occurred in both directions according to whether the form lived among grass or on broad leaves with oblique lateral veins and we can observe even now that the species with oblique stripes have longitudinal stripes when young that is to say while the stripes have no biological significance the white places in the skin which gave rise probably first as small spots to this protective marking could be combined in one way or another according to the requirements of the species they must therefore either have possessed selectionvalue from the first or if this was not the case at their earliest occurrence there must have been some other factors which raised them to the point of selectionvalue i shall return to this in discussing germinal selection but the case may be followed still farther and leads us to the same alternative on a still more secure basis many years ago i observed in caterpillars of smerinthus populi the poplar hawkmoth which also possess white oblique stripes that certain individuals showed red spots above these stripes these spots occurred only on certain segments and never flowed together to form continuous stripes in another species smerinthus tiliae similar bloodred spots unite to form a linelike coloured seam in the last stage of larval life while in s ocellata rustred spots appear in individual caterpillars but more rarely than in s populi and they show no tendency to flow together thus we have here the origin of a new character arising from small beginnings at least in s tiliae in which species the coloured stripes are a normal specific character in the other species s populi and s ocellata we find the beginnings of the same variation in one more rarely than in the other and we can imagine that in the course of time in these two species coloured lines over the oblique stripes will arise in any case these spots are the elements of variation out of which coloured lines may be evolved if they are combined in this direction through the agency of natural selection in s populi the spots are often small but sometimes it seems as though several had united to form large spots whether a process of selection in this direction will arise in s populi and s ocellata or whether it is now going on cannot be determined since we cannot tell in advance what biological value the marking might have for these two species it is conceivable that the spots may have no selectionvalue as far as these species are concerned and may therefore disappear again in the course of phylogeny or on the other hand that they may be changed in another direction for instance towards imitation of the rustred fungoid patches on poplar and willow leaves in any case we may regard the smallest spots as the initial stages of variation the larger as a cumulative summation of these therefore either these initial stages must already possess selectionvalue or as i said before there must be some other reason for their cumulative summation i should like to give one more example in which we can infer though we cannot directly observe the initial stages all the holothurians or seacucumbers have in the skin calcereous bodies of different forms usually thick and irregular which make the skin tough and resistant in a small group of themthe species of synaptathe calcareous bodies occur in the form of delicate anchors of microscopic size up till 1897 these anchors like many other delicate microscopic structures were regarded as curiosities as natural marvels but a swedish observer oestergren has recently shown that they have a biological significance they serve the footless synapta as auxiliary organs of locomotion since when the body swells up in the act of creeping they press firmly with their tips which are embedded in the skin against the substratum on which the animal creeps and thus prevent slipping backwards in other holothurians this slipping is made impossible by the fixing of the tubefeet the anchors act automatically sinking their tips towards the ground when the corresponding part of the body thickens and returning to the original position at an angle of 45 degrees to the upper surface when the part becomes thin again the arms of the anchor do not lie in the same plane as the shaft and thus the curve of the arms forms the outermost part of the anchor and offers no further resistance to the gliding of the animal every detail of the anchor the curved portion the little teeth at the head the arms etc can be interpreted in the most beautiful way above all the form of the anchor itself for the two arms prevent it from swaying round to the side the position of the anchors too is definite and significant they lie obliquely to the longitudinal axis of the animal and therefore they act alike whether the animal is creeping backwards or forwards moreover the tips would pierce through the skin if the anchors lay in the longitudinal direction synapta burrows in the sand it first pushes in the thin anterior end and thickens this again thus enlarging the hole then the anterior tentacles displace more sand the body is worked in a little farther and the process begins anew in the first act the anchors are passive but they begin to take an active share in the forward movement when the body is contracted again frequently the animal retains only the posterior end buried in the sand and then the anchors keep it in position and make rapid withdrawal possible thus we have in these apparently random forms of the calcereous bodies complex adaptations in which every little detail as to direction curve and pointing is exactly determined that they have selectionvalue in their present perfected form is beyond all doubt since the animals are enabled by means of them to bore rapidly into the ground and so to escape from enemies we do not know what the initial stages were but we cannot doubt that the little improvements which occurred as variations of the originally simple slimy bodies of the holothurians were preserved because they already possessed selectionvalue for the synaptidae for such minute microscopic structures whose form is so delicately adapted to the rle they have to play in the life of the animal cannot have arisen suddenly and as a whole and every new variation of the anchor that is in the direction of the development of the two arms and every curving of the shaft which prevented the tips from projecting at the wrong time in short every little adaptation in the modelling of the anchor must have possessed selectionvalue and that such minute changes of form fall within the sphere of fluctuating variations that is to say that they occur is beyond all doubt in many of the synaptidae the anchors are replaced by calcareous rods bent in the form of an s which are said to act in the same way others such as those of the genus ankyroderma have anchors which project considerably beyond the skin and according to oestergren serve to catch plantparticles and other substances and so mask the animal thus we see that in the synaptidae the thick and irregular calcareous bodies of the holothurians have been modified and transformed in various ways in adaptation to the footlessness of these animals and to the peculiar conditions of their life and we must conclude that the earlier stages of these changes presented themselves to the processes of selection in the form of microscopic variations for it is as impossible to think of any origin other than through selection in this case as in the case of the toughness and the driptips of tropical leaves and as these last could not have been produced directly by the beating of the heavy raindrops upon them so the calcareous anchors of synapta cannot have been produced directly by the friction of the sand and mud at the bottom of the sea and since they are parts whose function is passive the lamarckian factor of use and disuse does not come into question the conclusion is unavoidable that the microscopically small variations of the calcareous bodies in the ancestral forms have been intensified and accumulated in a particular direction till they have led to the formation of the anchor whether this has taken place by the action of natural selection alone or whether the laws of variation and the intimate processes within the germplasm have coperated will become clear in the discussion of germinal selection this whole process of adaptation has obviously taken place within the time that has elapsed since this group of seacucumbers lost their tubefeet those characteristic organs of locomotion which occur in no group except the echinoderms and yet have totally disappeared in the synaptidae and after all what would animals that live in sand and mud do with tubefeet c coadaptation darwin pointed out that one of the essential differences between artificial and natural selection lies in the fact that the former can modify only a few characters usually only one at a time while nature preserves in the struggle for existence all the variations of a species at the same time and in a purely mechanical way if they possess selectionvalue herbert spencer though himself an adherent of the theory of selection declared in the beginning of the nineties that in his opinion the range of this principle was greatly overestimated if the great changes which have taken place in so many organisms in the course of ages are to be interpreted as due to this process of selection alone since no transformation of any importance can be evolved by itself it is always accompanied by a host of secondary changes he gives the familiar example of the giant stag of the irish peat the enormous antlers of which required not only a much stronger skull cap but also greater strength of the sinews muscles nerves and bones of the whole anterior half of the animal if their mass was not to weigh down the animal altogether it is inconceivable he says that so many processes of selection should take place simultaneously and we are therefore forced to fall back on the lamarckian factor of the use and disuse of functional parts and how he asks could natural selection follow two opposite directions of evolution in different parts of the body at the same time as for instance in the case of the kangaroo in which the forelegs must have become shorter while the hind legs and the tail were becoming longer and stronger spencers main object was to substantiate the validity of the lamarckian principle the coperation of which with selection had been doubted by many and it does seem as though this principle if it operates in nature at all offers a ready and simple explanation of all such secondary variations not only muscles but nerves bones sinews in short all tissues which function actively increase in strength in proportion as they are used and conversely they decrease when the claims on them diminish all the parts therefore which depend on the part that varied first as for instance the enlarged antlers of the irish elk must have been increased or decreased in strength in exact proportion to the claims made upon themjust as is actually the case but beautiful as this explanation would be i regard it as untenable because it assumes the transmissibility of functional modifications socalled acquired characters and this is not only undemonstrable but is scarcely theoretically conceivable for the secondary variations which accompany or follow the first as correlative variations occur also in cases in which the animals concerned are sterile and therefore cannot transmit anything to their descendants this is true of worker bees and particularly of ants and i shall here give a brief survey of the present state of the problem as it appears to me much has been written on both sides of this question since the published controversy on the subject in the nineties between herbert spencer and myself i should like to return to the matter in detail if the space at my disposal permitted because it seems to me that the arguments i advanced at that time are equally cogent today notwithstanding all the objections that have since been urged against them moreover the matter is by no means one of subordinate interest it is the very kernel of the whole question of the reality and value of the principle of selection for if selection alone does not suffice to explain harmonious adaptation as i have called spencers coadaptation and if we require to call in the aid of the lamarckian factor it would be questionable whether selection would explain any adaptations whatever in this particular caseof worker beesthe lamarckian factor may be excluded altogether for it can be demonstrated that here at any rate the effects of use and disuse cannot be transmitted but if it be asked why we are unwilling to admit the coperation of the darwinian factor of selection and the lamarckian factor since this would afford us an easy and satisfactory explanation of the phenomena i answer because the lamarckian principle is fallacious and because by accepting it we close the way towards deeper insight it is not a spirit of combativeness or a desire for selfvindication that induces me to take the field once more against the lamarckian principle it is the conviction that the progress of our knowledge is being obstructed by the acceptance of this fallacious principle since the facile explanation it apparently affords prevents our seeking after a truer explanation and a deeper analysis the workers in the various species of ants are sterile that is to say they take no regular part in the reproduction of the species although individuals among them may occasionally lay eggs in addition to this they have lost the wings and the receptaculum seminis and their compound eyes have degenerated to a few facets how could this last change have come about through disuse since the eyes of workers are exposed to light in the same way as are those of the sexual insects and thus in this particular case are not liable to disuse at all the same is true of the receptaculum seminis which can only have been disused as far as its glandular portion and its stalk are concerned and also of the wings the nerves tracheae and epidermal cells of which could not cease to function until the whole wing had degenerated for the chitinous skeleton of the wing does not function at all in the active sense but on the other hand the workers in all species have undergone modifications in a positive direction as for instance the greater development of brain in many species large workers have evolvedthe socalled soldiers with enormous jaws and teeth which defend the colonyand in others there are small workers which have taken over other special functions such as the rearing of the young aphides this kind of division of the workers into two castes occurs among several tropical species of ants but it is also present in the italian species colobopsis truncata beautifully as the size of the jaws could be explained as due to the increased use made of them by the soldiers or the enlarged brain as due to the mental activities of the workers the fact of the infertility of these forms is an insurmountable obstacle to accepting such an explanation neither jaws nor brain can have been evolved on the lamarckian principle the problem of coadaptation is no easier in the case of the ant than in the case of the giant stag darwin himself gave a pretty illustration to show how imposing the difference between the two kinds of workers in one species would seem if we translated it into human terms in regard to the driver ants anomma we must picture to ourselves a piece of work for instance the building of a house being carried on by two kinds of workers of which one group was five feet four inches high the other sixteen feet high39 although the ant is a small animal as compared with man or with the irish elk the soldier with its relatively enormous jaws is hardly less heavily burdened than the elk with its antlers and in the ants case too a strengthening of the skeleton of the muscles the nerves of the head and of the legs must have taken place parallel with the enlargement of the jaws harmonious adaptation coadaptation has here been active in a high degree and yet these soldiers are sterile there thus remains nothing for it but to refer all their adaptations positive and negative alike to processes of selection which have taken place in the rudiments of the workers within the egg and spermcells of their parents there is no way out of the difficulty except the one darwin pointed out he himself did not find the solution of the riddle at once at first he believed that the case of the workers among social insects presented the most serious special difficulty in the way of his theory of natural selection and it was only after it had become clear to him that it was not the sterile insects themselves but their parents that were selected according as they produced more or less well adapted workers that he was able to refer to this very case of the conditions among ants in order to show the power of natural selection40 he explains his view by a simple but interesting illustration gardeners have produced by means of long continued artificial selection a variety of stock which bears entirely double and therefore infertile flowers41 nevertheless the variety continues to be reproduced from seed because in addition to the double and infertile flowers the seeds always produce a certain number of single fertile blossoms and these are used to reproduce the double variety these single and fertile plants correspond to the males and females of an antcolony the infertile plants which are regularly produced in large numbers to the neuter workers of the colony this illustration is entirely apt the only difference between the two cases consisting in the fact that the variation in the flower is not a useful but a disadvantageous one which can only be preserved by artificial selection on the part of the gardener while the transformations that have taken place parallel with the sterility of the ants are useful since they procure for the colony an advantage in the struggle for existence and they are therefore preserved by natural selection even the sterility itself in this case is not disadvantageous since the fertility of the true females has at the same time considerably increased we may therefore regard the sterile forms of ants which have gradually been adapted in several directions to varying functions as a certain proof that selection really takes place in the germcells of the fathers and mothers of the workers and that special complexes of primordia ids are present in the workers and in the males and females and these complexes contain the primordia of the individual parts determinants but since all living entities vary the determinants must also vary now in a favourable now in an unfavourable direction if a female produces eggs which contain favourably varying determinants in the workerids then these eggs will give rise to workers modified in the favourable direction and if this happens with many females the colony concerned will contain a better kind of worker than other colonies i digress here in order to give an account of the intimate processes which according to my view take place within the germplasm and which i have called germinal selection these processes are of importance since they form the roots of variation which in its turn is the root of natural selection i cannot here do more than give a brief outline of the theory in order to show how the darwinwallace theory of selection has gained support from it with others i regard the minimal amount of substance which is contained within the nucleus of the germcells in the form of rods bands or granules as the germsubstance or germplasm and i call the individual granules ids there is always a multiplicity of such ids present in the nucleus either occurring individually or united in the form of rods or bands chromosomes each id contains the primary constituents of a whole individual so that several ids are concerned in the development of a new individual in every being of complex structure thousands of primary constituents must go to make up a single id these i call determinants and i mean by this name very small individual particles far below the limits of microscopic visibility vital units which feed grow and multiply by division these determinants control the parts of the developing embryoin what manner need not here concern us the determinants differ among themselves those of a muscle are differently constituted from those of a nervecell or a glandular cell etc and every determinant is in its turn made up of minute vital units which i call biophores or the bearers of life according to my view these determinants not only assimilate like every other living unit but they vary in the course of their growth as every living unit does they may vary qualitatively if the elements of which they are composed vary they may grow and divide more or less rapidly and their variations give rise to corresponding variations of the organ cell or cellgroup which they determine that they are undergoing ceaseless fluctuations in regard to size and quality seems to me the inevitable consequence of their unequal nutrition for although the germcell as a whole usually receives sufficient nutriment minute fluctuations in the amount carried to different parts within the germplasm cannot fail to occur now if a determinant for instance of a sensory cell receives for a considerable time more abundant nutriment than before it will grow more rapidlybecome bigger and divide more quickly and later when the id concerned develops into an embryo this sensory cell will become stronger than in the parents possibly even twice as strong this is an instance of a hereditary individual variation arising from the germ the nutritive stream which according to our hypothesis favours the determinant n by chance that is for reasons unknown to us may remain strong for a considerable time or may decrease again but even in the latter case it is conceivable that the ascending movement of the determinant may continue because the strengthened determinant now actively nourishes itself more abundantlythat is to say it attracts the nutriment to itself and to a certain extent withdraws it from its fellowdeterminants in this way it mayas it seems to meget into permanent upward movement and attain a degree of strength from which there is no falling back then positive or negative selection sets in favouring the variations which are advantageous setting aside those which are disadvantageous in a similar manner a downward variation of the determinants may take place if its progress be started by a diminished flow of nutriment the determinants which are weakened by this diminished flow will have less affinity for attracting nutriment because of their diminished strength and they will assimilate more feebly and grow more slowly unless chance streams of nutriment help them to recover themselves but as will presently be shown a change of direction cannot take place at every stage of the degenerative process if a certain critical stage of downward progress be passed even favourable conditions of foodsupply will no longer suffice permanently to change the direction of the variation only two cases are conceivable if the determinant corresponds to a useful organ only its removal can bring back the germplasm to its former level therefore personal selection removes the id in question with its determinants from the germplasm by causing the elimination of the individual in the struggle for existence but there is another conceivable case the determinants concerned may be those of an organ which has become useless and they will then continue unobstructed but with exceeding slowness along the downward path until the organ becomes vestigial and finally disappears altogether the fluctuations of the determinants hither and thither may thus be transformed into a lasting ascending or descending movement and this is the crucial point of these germinal processes this is not a fantastic assumption we can read it in the fact of the degeneration of disused parts useless organs are the only ones which are not helped to ascend again by personal selection and therefore in their case alone can we form any idea of how the primary constituents behave when they are subject solely to intragerminal forces the whole determinant system of an id as i conceive it is in a state of continual fluctuation upwards and downwards in most cases the fluctuations will counteract one another because the passive streams of nutriment soon change but in many cases the limit from which a return is possible will be passed and then the determinants concerned will continue to vary in the same direction till they attain positive or negative selectionvalue at this stage personal selection intervenes and sets aside the variation if it is disadvantageous or favoursthat is to say preservesit if it is advantageous only the determinant of a useless organ is uninfluenced by personal selection and as experience shows it sinks downwards that is the organ that corresponds to it degenerates very slowly but uninterruptedly till after what must obviously be an immense stretch of time it disappears from the germplasm altogether thus we find in the fact of the degeneration of disused parts the proof that not all the fluctuations of a determinant return to equilibrium again but that when the movement has attained to a certain strength it continues in the same direction we have entire certainty in regard to this as far as the downward progress is concerned and we must assume it also in regard to ascending variations as the phenomena of artificial selection certainly justify us in doing if the japanese breeders were able to lengthen the tailfeathers of the cock to six feet it can only have been because the determinants of the tailfeathers in the germplasm had already struck out a path of ascending variation and this movement was taken advantage of by the breeder who continually selected for reproduction the individuals in which the ascending variation was most marked for all breeding depends upon the unconscious selection of germinal variations of course these germinal processes cannot be proved mathematically since we cannot actually see the play of forces of the passive fluctuations and their causes we cannot say how great these fluctuations are and how quickly or slowly how regularly or irregularly they change nor do we know how far a determinant must be strengthened by the passive flow of the nutritive stream if it is to be beyond the danger of unfavourable variations or how far it must be weakened passively before it loses the power of recovering itself by its own strength it is no more possible to bring forward actual proofs in this case than it was in regard to the selectionvalue of the initial stages of an adaptation but if we consider that all heritable variations must have their roots in the germplasm and further that when personal selection does not intervene that is to say in the case of parts which have become useless a degeneration of the part and therefore also of its determinant must inevitably take place then we must conclude that processes such as i have assumed are running their course within the germplasm and we can do this with as much certainty as we were able to infer from the phenomena of adaptation the selectionvalue of their initial stages the fact of the degeneration of disused parts seems to me to afford irrefutable proof that the fluctuations within the germplasm are the real root of all hereditary variation and the preliminary condition for the occurrence of the darwinwallace factor of selection germinal selection supplies the stones out of which personal selection builds her temples and palaces adaptations the importance for the theory of the process of degeneration of disused parts cannot be overestimated especially when it occurs in sterile animal forms where we are free from the doubt as to the alleged lamarckian factor which is apt to confuse our ideas in regard to other cases if we regard the variation of the many determinants concerned in the transformation of the female into the sterile worker as having come about through the gradual transformation of the ids into workerids we shall see that the germplasm of the sexual ants must contain three kinds of ids male female and worker ids or if the workers have diverged into soldiers and nestbuilders then four kinds we understand that the workerids arose because their determinants struck out a useful path of variation whether upward or downward and that they continued in this path until the highest attainable degree of utility of the parts determined was reached but in addition to the organs of positive or negative selectionvalue there were some which were indifferent as far as the success and especially the functional capacity of the workers was concerned wings ovarian tubes receptaculum seminis a number of the facets of the eye perhaps even the whole eye as to the ovarian tubes it is is possible that their degeneration was an advantage for the workers in saving energy and if so selection would favour the degeneration but how could the presence of eyes diminish the usefulness of the workers to the colony or the minute receptaculum seminis or even the wings these parts have therefore degenerated because they were of no further value to the insect but if selection did not influence the setting aside of these parts because they were neither of advantage nor of disadvantage to the species then the darwinian factor of selection is here confronted with a puzzle which it cannot solve alone but which at once becomes clear when germinal selection is added for the determinants of organs that have no further value for the organism must as we have already explained embark on a gradual course of retrograde development in ants the degeneration has gone so far that there are no wingrudiments present in any species as is the case with so many butterflies flies and locusts but in the larvae the imaginable discs of the wings are still laid down with regard to the ovaries degeneration has reached different levels in different species of ants as has been shown by the researches of my former pupil elizabeth bickford in many species there are twelve ovarian tubes and they decrease from that number to one indeed in one species no ovarian tube at all is present so much at least is certain from what has been said that in this case everything depends on the fluctuations of the elements of the germplasm germinal selection here as elsewhere presents the variations of the determinants and personal selection favours or rejects these orif it be a question of organs which have become uselessit does not come into play at all and allows the descending variation free course it is obvious that even the problem of coadaptation in sterile animals can thus be satisfactorily explained if the determinants are oscillating upwards and downwards in continual fluctuation and varying more pronouncedly now in one direction now in the other useful variations of every determinant will continually present themselves anew and may in the course of generations be combined with one another in various ways but there is one character of the determinants that greatly facilitates this complex process of selection that after a certain limit has been reached they go on varying in the same direction from this it follows that development along a path once struck out may proceed without the continual intervention of personal selection this factor only operates so to speak at the beginning when it selects the determinants which are varying in the right direction and again at the end when it is necessary to put a check upon further variation in addition to this enormously long periods have been available for all these adaptations as the very gradual transition stages between females and workers in many species plainly show and thus this process of transformation loses the marvellous and mysterious character that seemed at the first glance to invest it and takes rank without any straining among the other processes of selection it seems to me that from the facts that sterile animal forms can adapt themselves to new vital functions their superfluous parts degenerate and the parts more used adapt themselves in an ascending direction those less used in a descending direction we must draw the conclusion that harmonious adaptation here comes about without the coperation of the lamarckian principle this conclusion once established however we have no reason to refer the thousands of cases of harmonious adaptation which occur in exactly the same way among other animals or plants to a principle the active intervention of which in the transformation of species is nowhere proved we do not require it to explain the facts and therefore we must not assume it the fact of coadaptation which was supposed to furnish the strongest argument against the principle of selection in reality yields the clearest evidence in favour of it we must assume it because no other possibility of explanation is open to us and because these adaptations actually exist that is to say have really taken place with this conviction i attempted as far back as 1894 when the idea of germinal selection had not yet occurred to me to make harmonious adaptation coadaptation more easily intelligible in some way or other and so i was led to the idea which was subsequently expounded in detail by baldwin and lloyd morgan and also by osborn and gulick as organic selection it seemed to me that it was not necessary that all the germinal variations required for secondary variations should have occurred simultaneously since for instance in the case of the stag the bones muscles sinews and nerves would be incited by the increasing heaviness of the antlers to greater activity in the individual life and so would be strengthened the antlers can only have increased in size by very slow degrees so that the muscles and bones may have been able to keep pace with their growth in the individual life until the requisite germinal variations presented themselves in this way a disharmony between the increasing weight of the antlers and the parts which support and move them would be avoided since time would be given for the appropriate germinal variations to occur and so to set agoing the hereditary variation of the muscles sinews and bones42 i still regard this idea as correct but i attribute less importance to organic selection than i did at that time in so far that i do not believe that it alone could effect complex harmonious adaptations germinal selection now seems to me to play the chief part in bringing about such adaptations something the same is true of the principle i have called panmixia as i became more and more convinced in the course of years that the lamarckian principle ought not to be called in to explain the dwindling of disused parts i believed that this process might be simply explained as due to the cessation of the conservative effect of natural selection i said to myself that from the moment in which a part ceases to be of use natural selection withdraws its hand from it and then it must inevitably fall from the height of its adaptiveness because inferior variants would have as good a chance of persisting as better ones since all grades of fitness of the part in question would be mingled with one another indiscriminately this is undoubtedly true as romanes pointed out ten years before i did and this mingling of the bad with the good probably does bring about a deterioration of the part concerned but it cannot account for the steady diminution which always occurs when a part is in process of becoming rudimentary and which goes on until it ultimately disappears altogether the process of dwindling cannot therefore be explained as due to panmixia alone we can only find a sufficient explanation in germinal selection iv derivatives of the theory of selection the impetus in all directions given by darwin through his theory of selection has been an immeasurable one and its influence is still felt it falls within the province of the historian of science to enumerate all the ideas which in the last quarter of the nineteenth century grew out of darwins theories in the endeavour to penetrate more deeply into the problem of the evolution of the organic world within the narrow limits to which this paper is restricted i cannot attempt to discuss any of these v arguments for the reality of the processes of selection a sexual selection sexual selection goes hand in hand with natural selection from the very first i have regarded sexual selection as affording an extremely important and interesting corroboration of natural selection but singularly enough it is precisely against this theory that an adverse judgment has been pronounced in so many quarters and it is only quite recently and probably in proportion as the wealth of facts in proof of it penetrates into a wider circle that we seem to be approaching a more general recognition of this side of the problem of adaptations thus darwins words in his preface to the second edition 1874 of his book the descent of man and sexual selection are being justified my conviction as to the operation of natural selection remains unshaken and further if naturalists were to become more familiar with the idea of sexual selection it would i think be accepted to a much greater extent and already it is fully and favourably accepted by many competent judges darwin was able to speak thus because he was already acquainted with an immense mass of facts which taken together yield overwhelming evidence of the validity of the principle of sexual selection natural selection chooses out for reproduction the individuals that are best equipped for the struggle for existence and it does so at every stage of development it thus improves the species in all its stages and forms sexual selection operates only on individuals that are already capable of reproduction and does so only in relation to the attainment of reproduction it arises from the rivalry of one sex usually the male for the possession of the other usually the female its influence can therefore only directly affect one sex in that it equips it better for attaining possession of the other but the effect may extend indirectly to the female sex and thus the whole species may be modified without however becoming any more capable of resistance in the struggle for existence for sexual selection only gives rise to adaptations which are likely to give their possessor the victory over rivals in the struggle for possession of the female and which are therefore peculiar to the wooing sex the manifold secondary sexual characters the diversity of these characters is so great that i cannot here attempt to give anything approaching a complete treatment of them but i should like to give a sufficient number of examples to make the principle itself in its various modes of expression quite clear one of the chief preliminary postulates of sexual selection is the unequal number of individuals in the two sexes for if every male immediately finds his mate there can be no competition for the possession of the female darwin has shown that for the most part the inequality between the sexes is due simply to the fact that there are more males than females and therefore the males must take some pains to secure a mate but the inequality does not always depend on the numerical preponderance of the males it is often due to polygamy for if one male claims several females the number of females in proportion to the rest of the males will be reduced since it is almost always the males that are the wooers we must expect to find the occurrence of secondary sexual characters chiefly among them and to find it especially frequent in polygamous species and this is actually the case if we were to try to guesswithout knowing the factswhat means the male animals make use of to overcome their rivals in the struggle for the possession of the female we might name many kinds of means but it would be difficult to suggest any which is not actually employed in some animal group of other i begin with the mere difference in strength through which the male of many animals is so sharply distinguished from the female as for instance the lion walrus seaelephant and others among these the males fight violently for the possession of the female who falls to the victor in the combat in this simple case no one can doubt the operation of selection and there is just as little room for doubt as to the selectionvalue of the initial stages of the variation differences in bodily strength are apparent even among human beings although in their case the struggle for the possession of the female is no longer decided by bodily strength alone combats between male animals are often violent and obstinate and the employment of the natural weapons of the species in this way has led to perfecting of these eg the tusks of the boar the antlers of the stag and the enormous antlerlike jaws of the stagbeetle here again it is impossible to doubt that variations in these organs presented themselves and that these were considerable enough to be decisive in combat and so to lead to the improvement of the weapon among many animals however the females at first withdraw from the males they are coy and have to be sought out and sometimes held by force this tracking and grasping of the females by the males has given rise to many different characters in the latter as for instance the larger eyes of the male bee and especially of the males of the ephemerids mayflies some species of which show in addition to the usual compound eyes large socalled turbaneyes so that the whole head is covered with seeing surfaces in these species the females are very greatly in the minority 1100 and it is easy to understand that a keen competition for them must take place and that when the insects of both sexes are floating freely in the air an unusually wide range of vision will carry with it a decided advantage here again the actual adaptations are in accordance with the preliminary postulates of the theory we do not know the stages through which the eye has passed to its present perfected state but since the number of simple eyes facets has become very much greater in the male than in the female we may assume that their increase is due to a gradual duplication of the determinants of the ommatidium in the germplasm as i have already indicated in regard to senseorgans in general in this case again the selectionvalue of the initial stages hardly admits of doubt better vision directly secures reproduction in many cases the organ of smell shows a similar improvement many lower crustaceans daphnidae have better developed organs of smell in the male sex the difference is often slight and amounts only to one or two olfactory filaments but certain species show a difference of nearly a hundred of these filaments leptodora the same thing occurs among insects we must briefly consider the clasping or grasping organs which have developed in the males among many lower crustaceans but here natural selection plays its part along with sexual selection for the union of the sexes is an indispensable condition for the maintenance of the species and as darwin himself pointed out in many cases the two forms of selection merge into each other this fact has always seemed to me to be a proof of natural selection for in regard to sexual selection it is quite obvious that the victory of the bestequipped could have brought about the improvement only of the organs concerned the factors in the struggle such as the eye and the olfactory organ we come now to the excitants that is to the group of sexual characters whose origin through processes of selection has been most frequently called in question we may cite the lovecalls produced by many male insects such as crickets and cicadas these could only have arisen in animal groups in which the female did not rapidly flee from the male but was inclined to accept his wooing from the first thus notes like the chirping of the male cricket serve to entice the females at first they were merely the signal which showed the presence of a male in the neighbourhood and the female was gradually enticed nearer and nearer by the continued chirping the male that could make himself heard to the greatest distance would obtain the largest following and would transmit the beginnings and later the improvement of his voice to the greatest number of descendants but sexual excitement in the female became associated with the hearing of the lovecall and then the soundproducing organ of the male began to improve until it attained to the emission of the longdrawnout soft notes of the molecricket or the maenadlike cry of the cicadas i cannot here follow the process of development in detail but will call attention to the fact that the original purpose of the voice the announcing of the males presence became subsidiary and the exciting of the female became the chief goal to be aimed at the loudest singers awakened the strongest excitement and the improvement resulted as a matter of course i conceive of the origin of birdsong in a somewhat similar manner first as a means of enticing then of exciting the female one more kind of secondary sexual character must here be mentioned the odour which emanates from so many animals at the breeding season it is possible that this odour also served at first merely to give notice of the presence of individuals of the other sex but it soon became an excitant and as the individuals which caused the greatest degree of excitement were preferred it reached as high a pitch of perfection as was possible to it i shall confine myself here to the comparatively recently discovered fragrance of butterflies since fritz mller found out that certain brazilian butterflies gave off fragrance like a flower we have become acquainted with many such cases and we now know that in all lands not only many diurnal lepidoptera but nocturnal ones also give off a delicate odour which is agreeable even to man the ethereal oil to which this fragrance is due is secreted by the skincells usually of the wing as i showed soon after the discovery of the scentscales this is the case in the males the females have no special scentscales recognisable as such by their form but they must nevertheless give off an extremely delicate fragrance although our imperfect organ of smell cannot perceive it for the males become aware of the presence of a female even at night from a long distance off and gather round her we may therefore conclude that both sexes have long given forth a very delicate perfume which announced their presence to others of the same species and that in many species not in all these small beginnings become in the males particularly strong scentscales of characteristic form lute brush or lyreshaped at first these scales were scattered over the surface of the wing but gradually they concentrated themselves and formed broad velvety bands or strong prominent brushes and they attained their highest pitch of evolution when they became enclosed within pits or folds of the skin which could be opened to let the delicious fragrance stream forth suddenly towards the female thus in this case also we see that characters the original use of which was to bring the sexes together and so to maintain the species have been evolved in the males into means for exciting the female and we can hardly doubt that the females are most readily enticed to yield to the butterfly that sends out the strongest fragrancethat is to say that excites them to the highest degree it is a pity that our organs of smell are not fine enough to examine the fragrance of male lepidoptera in general and to compare it with other perfumes which attract these insects43 as far as we can perceive them they resemble the fragrance of flowers but there are lepidoptera whose scent suggests musk a smell of musk is also given off by several plants it is a sexual excitant in the muskdeer the musksheep and the crocodile as far as we know then it is perfumes similar to those of flowers that the male lepidoptera give off in order to entice their mates and this is a further indication that animals like plants can to a large extent meet the claims made upon them by life and produce the adaptations which are most purposivea further proof too of my proposition that the useful variations so to speak are always there the flowers developed the perfumes which entice their visitors and the male lepidoptera developed the perfumes which entice and excite their mates there are many pretty little problems to be solved in this connection for there are insects such as some flies that are attracted by smells which are unpleasant to us like those from decaying flesh and carrion but there are also certain flowers some orchids for instance which give forth no very agreeable odour but one which is to us repulsive and disgusting and we should therefore expect that the males of such insects would give off a smell unpleasant to us but there is no case known to me in which this has been demonstrated in cases such as we have discussed it is obvious that there is no possible explanation except through selection this brings us to the last kind of secondary sexual characters and the one in regard to which doubt has been most frequently expresseddecorative colours and decorative forms the brilliant plumage of the male pheasant the hummingbirds and the bird of paradise as well as the bright colours of many species of butterfly from the beautiful blue of our little lycaenidae to the magnificent azure of the large morphinae of brazil in a great many cases though not by any means in all the male butterflies are more beautiful than the females and in the tropics in particular they shine and glow in the most superb colours i really see no reason why we should doubt the power of sexual selection and i myself stand wholly on darwins side even though we certainly cannot assume that the females exercise a conscious choice of the handsomest mate and deliberate like the judges in a court of justice over the perfections of their wooers we have no reason to doubt that distinctive forms decorative feathers and colours have a particularly exciting effect upon the female just as certain odours have among animals of so many different groups including the butterflies the doubts which existed for a considerable time as a result of fallacious experiments as to whether the colours of flowers really had any influence in attracting butterflies have now been set at rest through a series of more careful investigations we now know that the colours of flowers are there on account of the butterflies as sprengel first showed and that the blossoms of phanerogams are selected in relation to them as darwin pointed out certainly it is not possible to bring forward any convincing proof of the origin of decorative colours through sexual selection but there are many weighty arguments in favour of it and these form a body of presumptive evidence so strong that it almost amounts to certainty in the first place there is the analogy with other secondary sexual characters if the song of birds and the chirping of the cricket have been evolved through sexual selection if the penetrating odours of male animalsthe crocodile the muskdeer the beaver the carnivores and finally the flowerlike fragrances of the butterflies have been evolved to their present pitch in this way why should decorative colours have arisen in some other way why should the eye be less sensitive to specifically male colours and other visible signs enticing to the female than the olfactory sense to specifically male odours or the sense of hearing to specifically male sounds moreover the decorative feathers of birds are almost always spread out and displayed before the female during courtship i have elsewhere44 pointed out that decorative colouring and sweetscentedness may replace one another in lepidoptera as well as in flowers for just as some modestly coloured flowers mignonette and violet have often a strong perfume while strikingly coloured ones are sometimes quite devoid of fragrance so we find that the most beautiful and gailycoloured of our native lepidoptera the species of vanessa have no scentscales while these are often markedly developed in grey nocturnal lepidoptera both attractions may however be combined in butterflies just as in flowers of course we cannot explain why both means of attraction should exist in one genus and only one of them in another since we do not know the minutest details of the conditions of life of the genera concerned but from the sporadic distribution of scentscales in lepidoptera and from their occurrence or absence in nearly related species we may conclude that fragrance is a relatively modern acquirement more recent than brilliant colouring one thing in particular that stamps decorative colouring as a product of selection is its gradual intensification by the addition of new spots which we can quite well observe because in many cases the colours have been first acquired by the males and later transmitted to the females by inheritance the scentscales are never thus transmitted probably for the same reason that the decorative colours of many birds are often not transmitted to the females because with these they would be exposed to too great elimination by enemies wallace was the first to point out that in species with concealed nests the beautiful feathers of the male occurred in the female also as in the parrots for instance but this is not the case in species which brood on an exposed nest in the parrots one can often observe that the general brilliant colouring of the male is found in the female but that certain spots of colour are absent and these have probably been acquired comparatively recently by the male and have not yet been transmitted to the female isolation of the group of individuals which is in process of varying is undoubtedly of great value in sexual selection for even a solitary conspicuous variation will become dominant much sooner in a small isolated colony than among a large number of members of a species any one who agrees with me in deriving variations from germinal selection will regard that process as an essential aid towards explaining the selection of distinctive courtshipcharacters such as coloured spots decorative feathers horny outgrowths in birds and reptiles combs feathertufts and the like since the beginnings of these would be presented with relative frequency in the struggle between the determinants within the germplasm the process of transmission of decorative feathers to the female results as darwin pointed out and illustrated by interesting examples in the colourtransformation of a whole species and this process as the phyletically older colouring of young birds shows must in the course of thousands of years have repeated itself several times in a line of descent if we survey the wealth of phenomena presented to us by secondary sexual characters we can hardly fail to be convinced of the truth of the principle of sexual selection and certainly no one who has accepted natural selection should reject sexual selection for not only do the two processes rest upon the same basis but they merge into one another so that it is often impossible to say how much of a particular character depends on one and how much on the other form of selection b natural selection an actual proof of the theory of sexual selection is out of the question if only because we cannot tell when a variation attains to selectionvalue it is certain that a delicate sense of smell is of value to the male moth in his search for the female but whether the possession of one additional olfactory hair or of ten or of twenty additional hairs leads to the success of its possessor we are unable to tell and we are groping even more in the dark when we discuss the excitement caused in the female by agreeable perfumes or by striking and beautiful colours that these do make an impression is beyond doubt but we can only assume that slight intensifications of them give any advantage and we must assume this since otherwise secondary sexual characters remain inexplicable the same thing is true in regard to natural selection it is not possible to bring forward any actual proof of the selectionvalue of the initial stages and the stages in the increase of variations as has been already shown but the selectionvalue of a finished adaptation can in many cases be statistically determined cesnola and poulton have made valuable experiments in this direction the former attached fortyfive individuals of the green and sixtyfive of the brown variety of the praying mantis mantis religiosa by a silk thread to plants and watched them for seven days the insects which were on a surface of a colour similar to their own remained uneaten while twentyfive green insects on brown parts of plants had all disappeared in eleven days the experiments of poulton and sanders45 were made with 600 pupae of vanessa urticae the tortoiseshell butterfly the pupae were artificially attached to nettles treetrunks fences walls and to the ground some at oxford some at st helens in the isle of wight in the course of a month 93 of the pupae at oxford were killed chiefly by small birds while at st helens 68 perished the experiments showed very clearly that the colour and character of the surface on which the pupa restsand thus its own conspicuousnessare of the greatest importance at oxford only the four pupae which were fastened to nettles emerged all the reston bark stones and the likeperished at st helens the elimination was as follows on fences where the pupae were conspicuous 92 on bark 66 on walls 54 and among nettles 57 these interesting experiments confirm our views as to protective coloration and show further that the ratio of elimination in the species is a very high one and that therefore selection must be very keen we may say that the process of selection follows as a logical necessity from the fulfilment of the three preliminary postulates of the theory variability heredity and the struggle for existence with its enormous ratio of elimination in all species to this we must add a fourth factor the intensification of variations which darwin established as a fact and which we are now able to account for theoretically on the basis of germinal selection it may be objected that there is considerable uncertainty about this logical proof because of our inability to demonstrate the selectionvalue of the initial stages and the individual stages of increase we have therefore to fall back on presumptive evidence this is to be found in the interpretative value of the theory let us consider this point in greater detail in the first place it is necessary to emphasize what is often overlooked namely that the theory not only explains the transformations of species it also explains their remaining the same in addition to the principle of varying it contains within itself that of persisting it is part of the essence of selection that it not only causes a part to vary till it has reached its highest pitch of adaptation but that it maintains it at this pitch this conserving influence of natural selection is of great importance and was early recognised by darwin it follows naturally from the principle of the survival of the fittest we understand from this how it is that a species which has become fully adapted to certain conditions of life ceases to vary but remains constant as long as the conditions of life for it remain unchanged whether this be for thousands of years or for whole geological epochs but the most convincing proof of the power of the principle of selection lies in the innumerable multitude of phenomena which cannot be explained in any other way to this category belong all structures which are only passively of advantage to the organism because none of these can have arisen by the alleged lamarckian principle these have been so often discussed that we need do no more than indicate them here until quite recently the sympathetic coloration of animalsfor instance the whiteness of arctic animalswas referred at least in part to the direct influence of external factors but the facts can best be explained by referring them to the processes of selection for then it is unnecessary to make the gratuitous assumption that many species are sensitive to the stimulus of cold and that others are not the great majority of arctic landanimals mammals and birds are white and this proves that they were all able to present the variation which was most useful for them the sable is brown but it lives in trees where the brown colouring protects and conceals it more effectively the musksheep ovibos moschatus is also brown and contrasts sharply with the ice and snow but it is protected from beasts of prey by its gregarious habit and therefore it is of advantage to be visible from as great a distance as possible that so many species have been able to give rise to white varieties does not depend on a special sensitiveness of the skin to the influence of cold but to the fact that mammals and birds have a general tendency to vary towards white even with us many birdsstarlings blackbirds swallows etcoccasionally produce white individuals but the white variety does not persist because it readily falls a victim to the carnivores this is true of white fawns foxes deer etc the whiteness therefore arises from internal causes and only persists when it is useful a great many animals living in a green environment have become clothed in green especially insects caterpillars and mantidae both persecuted and persecutors that it is not the direct effect of the environment which calls forth the green colour is shown by the many kinds of caterpillar which rest on leaves and feed on them but are nevertheless brown these feed by night and betake themselves through the day to the trunk of the tree and hide in the furrows of the bark we cannot however conclude from this that they were unable to vary towards green for there are arctic animals which are white only in winter and brown in summer alpine hare and the ptarmigan of the alps and there are also green leafinsects which remain green only while they are young and difficult to see on the leaf but which become brown again in the last stage of larval life when they have outgrown the leaf they then conceal themselves by day sometimes only among withered leaves on the ground sometimes in the earth itself it is interesting that in one genus chaerocampa one species is brown in the last stage of larval life another becomes brown earlier and in many species the last stage is not wholly brown a part remaining green whether this is a case of a double adaptation or whether the green is being gradually crowded out by the brown the fact remains that the same species even the same individual can exhibit both variations the case is the same with many of the leaflike orthoptera as for instance the praying mantis mantis religiosa which we have already mentioned but the best proofs are furnished by those of tencited cases in which the insect bears a deceptive resemblance to another object we now know many such cases such as the numerous imitations of green or withered leaves which are brought about in the most diverse ways sometimes by mere variations in the form of the insect and in its colour sometimes by an elaborate marking like that which occurs in the indian leafbutterflies kallima inachis in the single butterflygenus anaea in the woods of south america there are about a hundred species which are all gaily coloured on the upper surface and on the reverse side exhibit the most delicate imitation of the colouring and pattern of a leaf generally without any indication of the leafribs but extremely deceptive nevertheless anyone who has seen only one such butterfly may doubt whether many of the insignificant details of the marking can really be of advantage to the insect such details are for instance the apparent holes and splits in the apparently dry or halfrotten leaf which are usually due to the fact that the scales are absent on a circular or oval patch so that the colourless wingmembrane lies bare and one can look through the spot as through a window whether the bird which is seeking or pursuing the butterflies takes these holes for dewdrops or for the work of a devouring insect does not affect the question the mirrorlike spot undoubtedly increases the general deceptiveness for the same thing occurs in many leafbutterflies though not in all and in some cases it is replaced in quite a peculiar manner in one species of anaea a divina the resting butterfly looks exactly like a leaf out of the outer edge of which a large semicircular piece has been eaten possibly by a caterpillar but if we look more closely it is obvious that there is no part of the wing absent and that the semicircular piece is of a clear pale yellow colour while the rest of the wing is of a strongly contrasted dark brown but the deceptive resemblance may be caused in quite a different manner i have often speculated as to what advantage the brilliant white c could give to the otherwise duskycoloured comma butterfly grapta c album poultons recent observations46 have shown that this represents the imitation of a crack such as is often seen in dry leaves and is very conspicuous because the light shines through it the utility obviously lies in presenting to the bird the very familiar picture of a broken leaf with a clear shining slit and we may conclude from the imitation of such small details that the birds are very sharp observers and that the smallest deviation from the usual arrests their attention and incites them to closer investigation it is obvious that such detailedwe might almost say such subtledeceptive resemblances could only have come about in the course of long ages through the acquirement from time to time of something new which heightened the already existing resemblance in face of facts like these there can be no question of chance and no one has succeeded so far in finding any other explanation to replace that by selection for the rest the apparent leaves are by no means perfect copies of a leaf many of them only represent the torn or broken piece or the half or twothirds of a leaf but then the leaves themselves frequently do not present themselves to the eye as a whole but partially concealed among other leaves even those butterflies which like the species of kallima and anaea represent the whole of a leaf with stalk ribs apex and the whole breadth are not actual copies which would satisfy a botanist there is often much wanting in kallima the lateral ribs of the leaf are never all included in the markings there are only two or three on the left side and at more four or five on the right and in many individuals these are rather obscure while in others they are comparatively distinct this furnishes us with fresh evidence in favour of their origin through processes of selection for a botanically perfect picture could not arise in this way there could only be a fixing of such details as heightened the deceptive resemblance our postulate of origin through selection also enables us to understand why the leafimitation is on the lower surface of the wing in the diurnal lepidoptera and on the upper surface in the nocturnal forms corresponding to the attitude of the wings in the resting position of the two groups the strongest of all proofs of the theory however is afforded by cases of true mimicry those adaptations discovered by bates in 1861 consisting in the imitation of one species by another which becomes more and more like its model the model is always a species that enjoys some special protection from enemies whether because it is unpleasant to taste or because it is in some way dangerous it is chiefly among insects and especially among butterflies that we find the greatest number of such cases several of these have been minutely studied and every detail has been investigated so that it is difficult to understand how there can still be disbelief in regard to them if the many and exact observations which have been carefully collected and critically discussed for instance by poulton47 were thoroughly studied the arguments which are still frequently urged against mimicry would be found untenable we can hardly hope to find more convincing proof of the actuality of the processes of selection than these cases put into our hands the preliminary postulates of the theory of mimicry have been disputed for instance that diurnal butterflies are persecuted and eaten by birds but observations specially directed towards this point in india africa america and europe have placed it beyond all doubt if it were necessary i could myself furnish an account of my own observations on this point in the same way it has been established by experiment and observation in the field that in all the great regions of distribution there are butterflies which are rejected by birds and lizards their chief enemies on account of their unpleasant smell or taste these butterflies are usually gaily and conspicuously coloured and thusas wallace first interpreted itare furnished with an easily recognisable sign a sign of unpalatableness or warning colours if they were not thus recognisable easily and from a distance they would frequently be pecked at by birds and then rejected because of their unpleasant taste but as it is the insecteaters recognise them at once as unpalatable booty and ignore them such immune48 species wherever they occur are imitated by other palatable species which thus acquire a certain degree of protection it is true that this explanation of the bright conspicuous colours is only a hypothesis but its foundationsunpalatableness and the liability of other butterflies to be eatenare certain and its consequencesthe existence of mimetic palatable formsconform it in the most convincing manner of the many cases now known i select one which is especially remarkable and which has been thoroughly investigated papilla dardanus merope a large beautiful diurnal butterfly which ranges from abyssinia throughout the whole of africa to the south coast of cape colony the males of this form are everywhere almost the same in colour and in form of wings save for a few variations in the sparse black markings on the pale yellow ground but the females occur in several quite different forms and colourings and one of these only the abyssinian form is like the male while the other three or four are mimetic that is to say they copy a butterfly of quite a different family the danaids which are among the immune forms in each region the females have thus copied two or three different immune species there is much that is interesting to be said in regard to these species but it would be out of keeping with the general tenor of this paper to give details of this very complicated case of polymorphism in p dardanus anyone who is interested in the matter will find a full and exact statement of the case in as far as we know it in poultons essays on evolution pp 37337549 i need only add that three different mimetic female forms have been reared from the eggs of a single female in south africa the resemblance of the forms to their immune models goes so far that even the details of the local forms of the models are copied by the mimetic species it remains to be said that in madagascar a butterfly papilio meriones occurs of which both sexes are very similar in form and markings to the nonmimetic male of p dardanus so that it probably represents the ancestor of this latter species in face of such facts as these every attempt at another explanation must fail similarly all the other details of the case fulfil the preliminary postulates of selection and leave no room for any other interpretation that the males do not take on the protective colouring is easily explained because they are in general more numerous and the females are more important for the preservation of the species and must also live longer in order to deposit their eggs we find the same state of things in many other species and in one case elymnias undularis in which the male is also mimetically coloured it copies quite a differently coloured immune species from the model followed by the female this is quite intelligible when we consider that if there were too many false immune types the birds would soon discover that there were palatable individuals among those with unpalatable warning colours hence the imitation of different immune species by papilio dardanus i regret that lack of space prevents my bringing forward more examples of mimicry and discussing them fully but from the case of papilio dardanus alone there is much to be learnt which is of the highest importance for our understanding of transformations it shows us chiefly what i once called somewhat strongly perhaps the omnipotence of natural selection in answer to an opponent who had spoken of its inadequacy we here see that one and the same species is capable of producing four or five different patterns of colouring and marking thus the colouring and marking are not as has often been supposed a necessary outcome of the specific nature of the species but a true adaptation which cannot arise as a direct effect of climatic conditions but solely through what i may call the sorting out of the variations produced by the species according to their utility that caterpillars may be either green or brown is already something more than could have been expected according to the old conception of species but that one and the same butterfly should be now pale yellow with black now red with black and pure white now deep black with large pure white spots and again black with a large ocheousyellow spot and many small white and yellow spots that in one subspecies it may be tailed like the ancestral form and in another tailless like its danaid modelall this shows a farreaching capacity for variation and adaptation that we could never have expected if we did not see the facts before us how it is possible that the primary colourvariations should thus be intensified and combined remains a puzzle even now we are reminded of the modern threecolour printingperhaps similar combinations of the primary colours take place in this case in any case the direction of these primary variations is determined by the artist whom we know as natural selection for there is no other conceivable way in which the model could affect the butterfly that is becoming more and more like it the same climate surrounds all four forms of female they are subject to the same conditions of nutrition moreover papilio dardanus is by no means the only species of butterfly which exhibits different kinds of colourpattern on its wings many species of the asiatic genus elymnias have on the upper surface a very good imitation of an immune euploeine danainae often with a steelblue groundcolour while the under surface is well concealed when the butterfly is at restthus there are two kinds of protective coloration each with a different meaning the same thing may be observed in many nonmimetic butterflies for instance in all our species of vanessa in which the under side shows a greybrown or brownishblack protective coloration but we do not yet know with certainty what may be the biological significance of the gaily coloured upper surface in general it may be said that mimetic butterflies are comparatively rare species but there are exceptions for instance limenitis archippus in north america of which the immune model danaida plexippus also occurs in enormous numbers in another mimicrycategory the imitators are often more numerous than the models namely in the case of the imitation of dangerous insects by harmless species bees and wasps are dreaded for their sting and they are copied by harmless flies of the genera eristalis and syrphus and these mimics often occur in swarms about flowering plants without damage to themselves or to their models they are feared and are therefore left unmolested in regard also to the faithfulness of the copy the facts are quite in harmony with the theory according to which the resemblance must have arisen and increased by degrees we can recognise this in many cases for even now the mimetic species show very varying degrees of resemblance to their immune model if we compare for instance the many different imitators of danaida chrysippus we find that with their brownishyellow groundcolour and the position and size and more or less sharp limitation of their clear marginal spots they have reached very different degrees of nearness to their model or compare the female of elymnias undularis with its model danaida genutia there is a general resemblance but the marking of the danaida is very roughly imitated in elymnias another fact that bears out the theory of mimicry is that even when the resemblance in colourpattern is very great the wingvenation which is so constant and so important in determining the systematic position of butterflies is never affected by the variation the pursuers of the butterfly have no time to trouble about entomological intricacies i must not pass over a discovery of poultons which is of great theoretical importancethat mimetic butterflies may reach the same effect by very different means50 thus the glasslike transparency of the wing of a certain ithomiine methona and its pierine mimic dismorphia orise depends on a diminution in the size of the scales in the danaine genus itune it is due to the fewness of the scales and in a third imitator a moth castnia linus var heliconoides the glasslike appearance of the wing is due neither to diminution nor to absence of scales but to their absolute colourlessness and transparency and to the fact that they stand upright in another moth mimic anthomyza the arrangement of the transparent scales is normal thus it is not some unknown external influence that has brought about the transparency of the wing in these five forms as has sometimes been supposed nor is it a hypothetical internal evolutionary tendency for all three vary in a different manner the cause of this agreement can only lie in selection which preserves and intensifies in each species the favourable variations that present themselves the great faithfulness of the copy is astonishing in these cases for it is not the whole wing which is transparent certain markings are black in colour and these contrast sharply with the glasslike ground it is obvious that the pursuers of these butterflies must be very sharpsighted for otherwise the agreement between the species could never have been pushed so far the less the enemies see and observe the more defective must the imitation be and if they had been blind no visible resemblance between the species which required protection could ever have arisen a seemingly irreconcilable contradiction to the mimicry theory is presented in the following cases which were known to bates who however never succeeded in bringing them into line with the principle of mimicry in south america there are as we have already said many mimics of the immune ithomiinae or as bates called them heliconidae among these there occur not merely species which are edible and thus require the protection of a disguise but others which are rejected on account of their unpalatableness how could the ithomiine dress have developed in their case and of what use is it since the species would in any case be immune in eastern brazil for instance there are four butterflies which bear a most confusing resemblance to one another in colour marking and form of wing and all four are unpalatable to birds they belong to four different genera and three subfamilies and we have to inquire whence came this resemblance and what end does it serve for a long time no satisfactory answer could be found but fritz mller51 seventeen years after bates offered a solution to the riddle when he pointed out that young birds could not have an instinctive knowledge of the unpalatableness of the ithomiines but must learn by experience which species were edible and which inedible thus each young bird must have tasted at least one individual of each inedible species and discovered its unpalatability before it learnt to avoid and thus to spare the species but if the four species resemble each other very closely the bird will regard them all as of the same kind and avoid them all thus there developed a process of selection which resulted in the survival of the ithomiinelike individuals and in so great an increase of resemblance between the four species that they are difficult to distinguish one from another even in a collection the advantage for the four species living side by side as they do eg in bahia lies in the fact that only one individual from the mimicryring inedible association need be tasted by a young bird instead of at least four individuals as would otherwise be the case as the number of young birds is great this makes a considerable difference in the ratio of elimination the four brazilian species are lycorea halia danainae heliconius narcaea eucrate heliconinae melinaea ethra and mechanitis lysimnia ithomiinae these interesting mimicryrings trusts which have much significance for the theory have been the subject of numerous and careful investigations and at least their essential features are now fully established mller took for granted without making any investigations that young birds only learn by experience to distinguish between different kinds of victims but lloyd morgans52 experiments with young birds proved that this is really the case and at the same time furnished an additional argument against the lamarckian principle in addition to the mimicryrings first observed in south america others have been described from tropical india by moore and by poulton and dixey from africa and we may expect to learn many more interesting facts in this connection here again the preliminary postulates of the theory are satisfied and how much more that would lead to the same conclusion might be added as in the case of mimicry many species have come to resemble one another through processes of selection so we know whole classes of phenomena in which plants and animals have become adapted to one another and have thus been modified to a considerable degree i refer particularly to the relation between flowers and insects darwin has shown that the originally inconspicuous blossoms of the phanerogams were transformed into flowers through the visits of insects and that conversely several large orders of insects have been gradually modified by their association with flowers especially as regards the parts of their body actively concerned bees and butterflies in particular have become what they are through their relation to flowers in this case again all that is apparently contradictory to the theory can on closer investigation be beautifully interpreted in corroboration of it selection can give rise only to what is of use to the organism actually concerned never to what is of use to some other organism and we must therefore expect to find that in flowers only characters of use to themselves have arisen never characters which are of use to insects only and conversely that in the insects characters useful to them and not merely to the plants would have originated for a long time it seemed as if an exception to this rule existed in the case of the fertilisation of the yucca blossoms by a little moth pronuba yuccasella this little moth has a sickleshaped appendage to its mouthparts which occurs hi no other lepidopteron and which is used for pushing the yellow pollen into the opening of the pistil thus fertilising the flower thus it appears as if a new structure which is useful only to the plant has arisen in the insect but the difficulty is solved as soon as we learn that the moth lays its eggs in the fruitbuds of the yucca and that the larvae when they emerge feed on the developing seeds in effecting the fertilisation of the flower the moth is at the same time making provision for its own offspring since it is only after fertilisation that the seeds begin to develop there is thus nothing to prevent our referring this structural adaptation in pronuba yuccasella to processes of selection which have gradually transformed the maxillary palps of the female into the sickleshaped instrument for collecting the pollen and which have at the same time developed in the insect the instinct to press the pollen into the pistil in this domain then the theory of selection finds nothing but corroboration and it would be impossible to substitute for it any other explanation which now that the facts are so well known could be regarded as a serious rival to it that selection is a factor and a very powerful factor in the evolution of organisms can no longer be doubted even although we cannot bring forward formal proofs of it in detail cannot calculate definitely the size of the variations which present themselves and their selectionvalue cannot in short reduce the whole process to a mathematical formula yet we must assume selection because it is the only possible explanation applicable to whole classes of phenomena and because on the other hand it is made up of factors which we know can be proved actually to exist and which if they exist must of logical necessity coperate in the manner required by the theory we must accept it because the phenomena of evolution and adaptation must have a natural basis and because it is the only possible explanation of them53 many people are willing to admit that selection explains adaptations but they maintain that only a part of the phenomena are thus explained because everything does not depend upon adaptation they regard adaptation as so to speak a special effort on the part of nature which she keeps in readiness to meet particularly difficult claims of the external world on organisms but if we look at the matter more carefully we shall find that adaptations are by no means exceptional but that they are present everywhere in such enormous numbers that it would be difficult in regard to any structure whatever to prove that adaptation had not played a part in its evolution how often has the senseless objection been urged against selection that it can create nothing it can only reject it is true that it cannot create either the living substance or the variations of it both must be given but in rejecting one thing it preserves another intensifies it combines it and in this way creates what is new everything in organisms depends on adaptation that is to say everything must be admitted through the narrow door of selection otherwise it can take no part in the building up of the whole but it is asked what of the direct effect of external conditions temperature nutrition climate and the like undoubtedly these can give rise to variations but they too must pass through the door of selection and if they cannot do this they are rejected eliminated from the constitution of the species it may perhaps be objected that such external influences are often of a compelling power and that every animal must submit to them and that thus selection has no choice and can neither select nor reject there may be such cases let us assume for instance that the effect of the cold of the arctic regions was to make all the mammals become black the result would be that they would all be eliminated by selection and that no mammals would be able to live there at all but in most cases a certain percentage of animals resists these strong influences and thus selection secures a foothold on which to work eliminating the unfavourable variation and establishing a useful colouring consistent with what is required for the maintenance of the species everything depends upon adaptation we have spoken much of adaptation in colouring in connection with the examples brought into prominence by darwin because these are conspicuous easily verified and at the same time convincing for the theory of selection but is it only desert and polar animals whose colouring is determined through adaptation or the leafbutterflies and the mimetic species or the terrifying markings and warningcolours and a thousand other kinds of sympathetic colouring it is indeed never the colouring alone which makes up the adaptation the structure of the animal plays a part often a very essential part in the protective disguise and thus many variations may cooperate towards one common end and it is to be noted that it is by no means only external parts that are changed internal parts are always modified at the same timefor instance the delicate elements of the nervous system on which depend the instinct of the insect to hold its wings when at rest in a perfectly definite position which in the leafbutterfly has the effect of bringing the two pieces on which the marking occurs on the anterior and posterior wing into the same direction and thus displaying as a whole the fine curve of the midrib on the seeming leaf but the wingholding instinct is not regulated in the same way in all leafbutterflies even our indigenous species of vanessa with their protective groundcolouring have quite a distinctive way of holding their wings so that the greater part of the anterior wing is covered by the posterior when the butterfly is at rest but the protective colouring appears on the posterior wing and on the tip of the anterior to precisely the distance to which it is left uncovered this occurs as standfuss has shown in different degrees in our two most nearly allied species the uncovered portion being smaller in v urticae than in v polychloros in this case as in most leafbutterflies the holding of the wing was probably the primary character only after that was thoroughly established did the protective marking develop in any case the instinctive manner of holding the wings is associated with the protective colouring and must remain as it is if the latter is to be effective how greatly instincts may change that is to say may be adapted is shown by the case of the noctuid shark moth xylina vetusta this form bears a most deceptive resemblance to a piece of rotten wood and the appearance is greatly increased by the modification of the innate impulse to flight common to so many animals which has here been transformed into an almost contrary instinct this moth does not fly away from danger but feigns death that is it draws antennae legs and wings close to the body and remains perfectly motionless it may be touched picked up and thrown down again and still it does not move this remarkable instinct must surely have developed simultaneously with the woodcolouring at all events both coperating variations are now present and prove that both the external and the most minute internal structure have undergone a process of adaptation the case is the same with all structural variations of animal parts which are not absolutely insignificant when the insects acquired wings they must also have acquired the mechanism with which to move themthe musculature and the nervous apparatus necessary for its automatic regulation all instincts depend upon compound reflex mechanisms and are just as indispensable as the parts they have to set in motion and all may have arisen through processes of selection if the reasons which i have elsewhere given for this view are correct54 thus there is no lack of adaptations within the organism and particularly in its most important and complicated parts so that we may say that there is no actively functional organ that has not undergone a process of adaptation relative to its function and the requirements of the organism not only is every gland structurally adapted down to the very minutest histological details to its function but the function is equally minutely adapted to the needs of the body every cell in the mucous lining of the intestine is exactly regulated in its relation to the different nutritive substances and behaves in quite a different way towards the fats and towards nitrogenous substances or peptones i have elsewhere called attention to the many adaptations of the whale to the surrounding medium and have pointed outwhat has long been known but is not universally admitted even nowthat in it a great number of important organs have been transformed in adaptation to the peculiar conditions of aquatic life although the ancestors of the whale must have lived like other haircovered mammals on land i cited a number of these transformationsthe fishlike form of the body the hairlessness of the skin the transformation of the forelimbs to fins the disappearance of the hindlimbs and the development of a tail fin the layer of blubber under the skin which affords the protection from cold necessary to a warmblooded animal the disappearance of the earmuscles and the auditory passages the displacement of the external nares to the forehead for the greater security of the breathinghole during the brief appearance at the surface and certain remarkable changes in the respiratory and circulatory organs which enable the animal to remain for a long time under water i might have added many more for the list of adaptations in the whale to aquatic life is by no means exhausted they are found in the histological structure and in the minutest combinations in the nervous system for it is obvious that a tailfin must be used in quite a different way from a tail which serves as a flybrush in hoofed animals or as an aid to springing in the kangaroo or as a climbing organ it will require quite different reflexmechanisms and nerve combinations in the motor centres i used this example in order to show how unnecessary it is to assume a special internal evolutionary power for the phylogenesis of species for this whole order of whales is so to speak made up of adaptations it deviates in many essential respects from the usual mammalian type and all the deviations are adaptations to aquatic life but if precisely the most essential features of the organisation thus depend upon adaptation what is left for a phyletic force to do since it is these essential features of the structure it would have to determine there are few people now who believe in a phyletic evolutionary power which is not made up of the forces known to usadaptation and hereditybut the conviction that every part of an organism depends upon adaptation has not yet gained a firm footing nevertheless i must continue to regard this conception as the correct one as i have long done i may be permitted one more example the feather of a bird is a marvellous structure and no one will deny that as a whole it depends upon adaptation but what part of it does not depend upon adaptation the hollow quill the shaft with its hard thin light cortex and the spongy substance within it its square section compared with the round section of the quill the flat barbs their short hooked barbules which in the flightfeathers hook into one another with just sufficient firmness to resist the pressure of the air at each wingbeat the lightness and firmness of the whole apparatus the elasticity of the vane and so on and yet all this belongs to an organ which is only passively functional and therefore can have nothing to do with the lamarckian principle nor can the feather have arisen through some magical effect of temperature moisture electricity or specific nutrition and thus selection is again our only anchor of safety butit will be objectedthe substance of which the feather consists this peculiar kind of horny substance did not first arise through selection in the course of the evolution of the birds for it formed the covering of the scales of their reptilian ancestors it is quite true that a similar substance covered the scales of the reptiles but why should it not have arisen among them through selection or in what other way could it have arisen since scales are also passively useful parts it is true that if we are only to call adaptation what has been acquired by the species we happen to be considering there would remain a great deal that could not be referred to selection but we are postulating an evolution which has stretched back through aeons and in the course of which innumerable adaptations took place which had not merely ephemeral persistence in a genus a family or a class but which was continued into whole phyla of animals with continual fresh adaptations to the special conditions of each species family or class yet with persistence of the fundamental elements thus the feather once acquired persisted in all birds and the vertebral column once gained by adaptation in the lowest forms has persisted in all the vertebrates from amphioxus upwards although with constant readaptation to the conditions of each particular group thus everything we can see in animals is adaptation whether of today or of yesterday or of ages long gone by every kind of cell whether glandular muscular nervous epidermic or skeletal is adapted to absolutely definite and specific functions and every organ which is composed of these different kinds of cells contains them in the proper proportions and in the particular arrangement which best serves the function of the organ it is thus adapted to its function all parts of the organism are tuned to one another that is they are adapted to one another and in the same way the organism as a whole is adapted to the conditions of its life and it is so at every stage of its evolution but all adaptations can be referred to selection the only point that remains doubtful is whether they all must be referred to it however that may be whether the lamarckian principle is a factor that has coperated with selection in evolution or whether it is altogether fallacious the fact remains that selection is the cause of a great part of the phyletic evolution of organisms on our earth those who agree with me in rejecting the lamarckian principle will regard selection as the only guiding factor in evolution which creates what is new out of the transmissible variations by ordering and arranging these selecting them in relation to their number and size as the architect does his buildingstones so that a particular style must result55 but the buildingstones themselves the variations have their basis in the influences which cause variation in those vital units which are handed on from one generation to another whether taken together they form the whole organism as in bacteria and other low forms of life or only a germsubstance as in unicellular and multicellular

modern lights by w bateson ma frs professor of biology in the university of cambridge darwins work has the property of greatness in that it may be admired from more aspects than one for some the perception of the principle of natural selection stands out as his most wonderful achievement to which all the rest is subordinate others among whom i would range myself look up to him rather as the first who plainly distinguished collected and comprehensively studied that new class of evidence from which hereafter a true understanding of the process of evolution may be developed we each prefer our own standpoint of admiration but i think that it will be in their wider aspect that his labours will most command the veneration of posterity a treatise written to advance knowledge may be read in two moods the reader may keep his mind passive willing merely to receive the impress of the writers thought or he may read with his attention strained and alert asking at every instant how the new knowledge can be used in a further advance watching continually for fresh footholds by which to climb higher still of shelley it has been said that he was a poet for poets so darwin was a naturalist for naturalists it is when his writings are used in the critical and more exacting spirit with which we test the outfit for our own enterprise that we learn their full value and strength whether we glance back and compare his performance with the efforts of his predecessors or look forward along the course which modern research is disclosing we shall honour most in him not the rounded merit of finite accomplishment but the creative power by which he inaugurated a line of discovery endless in variety and extension let us attempt thus to see his work in true perspective between the past from which it grew and the present which is its consequence darwin attacked the problem of evolution by reference to facts of three classes variation heredity natural selection his work was not as the laity suppose a sudden and unheralded revelation but the first fruit of a long and hitherto barren controversy the occurrence of variation from type and the hereditary transmission of such variation had of course been long familiar to practical men and inferences as to the possible bearing of those phenomena on the nature of specific difference had been from time to time drawn by naturalists maupertuis for example wrote ce qui nous reste examiner cest comment dun seul individu il a pu natre tant despces si diffrentes and again la nature contient le fonds de toutes ces varits mais le hasard ou lart les mettent en oeuvre cest ainsi que ceux dont lindustrie sapplique satisfaire le got des curieux sont pour ainsi dire crateurs despces nouvelles56 such passages of which many though few so emphatic can be found in eighteenth century writers indicate a true perception of the mode of evolution the speculations hinted at by buffon57 developed by erasmus darwin and independently proclaimed above all by lamarck gave to the doctrine of descent a wide renown the uniformitarian teaching which lyell deduced from geological observation had gained acceptance the facts of geographical distribution58 had been shown to be obviously inconsistent with the mosaic legend prichard and lawrence following the example of blumenbach had successfully demonstrated that the races of man could be regarded as different forms of one species contrary to the opinion up till then received these treatises all begin it is true with a profound obeisance to the sons of noah but that performed they continue on strictly modern lines the question of the mutability of species was thus prominently raised those who rate lamarck no higher than did huxley in his contemptuous phrase buccinator tantum will scarcely deny that the sound of the trumpet had carried far or that its note was clear if then there were few who had already turned to evolution with positive conviction all scientific men must at least have known that such views had been promulgated and many must as huxley says have taken up his own position of critical expectancy59 why then was it that darwin succeeded where the rest had failed the cause of that success was twofold first and obviously in the principle of natural selection he had a suggestion which would work it might not go the whole way but it was true as far as it went evolution could thus in great measure be fairly represented as a consequence of demonstrable processes darwin seldom endangers the mechanism he devised by putting on it strains much greater than it can bear he at least was under no illusion as to the omnipotence of selection and he introduces none of the forced pleading which in recent years has threatened to discredit that principle for example in the latest text of the origin60 we find him saying but as my conclusions have lately been much misrepresented and it has been stated that i attribute the modification of species exclusively to natural selection i may be permitted to remark that in the first edition of this work and subsequently i placed in a most conspicuous positionnamely at the close of the introductionthe following words i am convinced that natural selection has been the main but not the exclusive means of modification but apart from the invention of this reasonable hypothesis which may well as huxley estimated be the guide of biological and psychological speculation for the next three or four generations darwin made a more significant and imperishable contribution not for a few generations but through all ages he should be remembered as the first who showed clearly that the problems of heredity and variation are soluble by observation and laid down the course by which we must proceed to their solution61 the moment of inspiration did not come with the reading of malthus but with the opening of the first notebook on transmutation of species62 evolution is a process of variation and heredity the older writers though they had some vague idea that it must be so did not study variation and heredity darwin did and so begat not a theory but a science the extent to which this is true the scientific world is only beginning to realise so little was the fact appreciated in darwins own time that the success of his writings was followed by an almost total cessation of work in that special field of the causes which led to these remarkable consequences i have spoken elsewhere they proceeded from circumstances peculiar to the time but whatever the causes there is no doubt that this statement of the result is historically exact and those who make it their business to collect facts elucidating the physiology of heredity and variation are well aware that they will find little to reward their quest in the leading scientific journals of the darwinian epoch in those thirty years the original stock of evidence current and in circulation even underwent a process of attrition as in the story of the eastern sage who first wrote the collected learning of the universe for his sons in a thousand volumes and by successive compression and burning reduced them to one and from this by further burning distilled the single ejaculation of the faith there is no god but god and mohammed is the prophet of god which was all his maturer wisdom deemed essentialso in the books of that period do we find the corpus of genetic knowledge dwindle to a few prerogative instances and these at last to the brief formula of an unquestioned creed and yet in all else that concerns biological science this period was in very truth our golden age when the natural history of the earth was explored as never before morphology and embryology were exhaustively ransacked the physiology of plants and animals began to rival chemistry and physics in precision of method and in the rapidity of its advances and the foundations of pathology were laid in contrast with this immense activity elsewhere the neglect which befel the special physiology of descent or genetics as we now call it is astonishing this may of course be interpreted as meaning that the favoured studies seemed to promise a quicker return for effort but it would be more true to say that those who chose these other pursuits did so without making any such comparison for the idea that the physiology of heredity and variation was a coherent science offering possibilities of extraordinary discovery was not present to their minds at all in a word the existence of such a science was well nigh forgotten it is true that in ancillary periodicals as for example those that treat of entomology or horticulture or in the writings of the already isolated systematists63 observations with this special bearing were from time to time related but the class of fact on which darwin built his conceptions of heredity and variation was not seen in the highways of biology it formed no part of the official curriculum of biological students and found no place among the subjects which their teachers were investigating during this period nevertheless one distinct advance was made that with which weismanns name is prominently connected in darwins genetic scheme the hereditary transmission of parental experience and its consequences played a considerable role exactly how great that role was supposed to be he with his habitual caution refrained from specifying for the sufficient reason that he did not know nevertheless much of the process of evolution especially that by which organs have become degenerate and rudimentary was certainly attributed by darwin to such inheritance though since belief in the inheritance of acquired characters fell into dispute the fact has been a good deal overlooked the origin without use and disuse would be a materially different book a certain vacillation is discernible in darwins utterances on this question and the fact gave to the astute butler an opportunity for his most telling attack the discussion which best illustrates the genetic views of the period arose in regard to the production of the rudimentary condition of the wings of many beetles in the madeira group of islands and by comparing passages from the origin64 butler convicts darwin of saying first that this condition was in the main the result of selection with disuse aiding and in another place that the main cause of degeneration was disuse but that selection had aided to darwin however i think the point would have seemed one of dialetics merely to him the one paramount purpose was to show that somehow an evolution by means of variation and heredity might have brought about the facts observed and whether they had come to pass in the one way or the other was a matter of subordinate concern to us moderns the question at issue has a diminished significance for over all such debates a change has been brought by weismanns challenge for evidence that use and disuse have any transmitted effects at all hitherto the transmission of many acquired characteristics had seemed to most naturalists so obvious as not to call for demonstration65 weismanns demand for facts in support of the main proposition revealed at once that none having real cogency could be produced the timehonoured examples were easily shown to be capable of different explanations a few certainly remain which cannot be so summarily dismissed butthough it is manifestly impossible here to do justice to such a subjecti think no one will dispute that these residual and doubtful phenomena whatever be their true nature are not of a kind to help us much in the interpretation of any of those complex cases of adaptation which on the hypothesis of unguided natural selection are especially difficult to understand use and disuse were invoked expressly to help us over these hard places but whatever changes can be induced in offspring by direct treatment of the parents they are not of a kind to encourage hope of real assistance from that quarter it is not to be denied that through the collapse of this second line of argument the selection hypothesis has had to take an increased and perilous burden various ways of meeting the difficulty have been proposed but these mostly resolve themselves into improbable attempts to expand or magnify the powers of natural selection weismanns interpellation though negative in purpose has had a lasting and beneficial effect for through his thorough demolition of the old loose and distracting notions of inherited experience the ground has been cleared for the construction of a true knowledge of heredity based on experimental fact in another way he made a contribution of a more positive character for his elaborate speculations as to the genetic meaning of cytological appearances have led to a minute investigation of the visible phenomena occurring in those celldivisions by which germcells arise though the particular views he advocated have very largely proved incompatible with the observed facts of heredity yet we must acknowledge that it was chiefly through the stimulus of weismanns ideas that those advances in cytology were made and though the doctrine of the continuity of germplasm cannot be maintained in the form originally propounded it is in the main true and illuminating66 nevertheless in the present state of knowledge we are still as a rule quite unable to connect cytological appearances with any genetic consequences and save in one respect obviously of extreme importanceto be spoken of later the two sets of phenomena might for all we can see be entirely distinct i cannot avoid attaching importance to this want of connection between the nuclear phenomena and the features of bodily organisation all attempts to investigate heredity by cytological means lie under the disadvantage that it is the nuclear changes which can alone be effectively observed important as they must surely be i have never been persuaded that the rest of the cell counts for nothing what we know of the behaviour and variability of chromosomes seems in my opinion quite incompatible with the belief that they alone govern form and are the sole agents responsible in heredity67 if then progress was to be made in genetics work of a different kind was required to learn the laws of heredity and variation there is no other way than that which darwin himself followed the direct examination of the phenomena a beginning could be made by collecting fortuitous observations of this class which have often thrown a suggestive light but such evidence can be at best but superficial and some more penetrating instrument of research is required this can only be provided by actual experiments in breeding the truth of these general considerations was becoming gradually clear to many of us when in 1900 mendels work was rediscovered segregation a phenomenon of the utmost novelty was thus revealed from that moment not only in the problem of the origin of species but in all the great problems of biology a new era began so unexpected was the discovery that many naturalists were convinced it was untrue and at once proclaimed mendels conclusions as either altogether mistaken or if true of very limited application many fantastic notions about the workings of heredity had been asserted as general principles before this was probably only another fancy of the same class nevertheless those who had a preliminary acquaintance with the facts of variation were not wholly unprepared for some such revelation the essential deduction from the discovery of segregation was that the characters of living things are dependent on the presence of definite elements or factors which are treated as units in the processes of heredity these factors can thus be recombined in various ways they act sometimes separately and sometimes they interact in conduction with each other producing their various effects all this indicates a definiteness and specific order in heredity and therefore in variation this order cannot by the nature of the case be dependent on natural selection for its existence but must be a consequence of the fundamental chemical and physical nature of living things the study of variation had from the first shown that an orderliness of this kind was present the bodies and the properties of livings things are cosmic not chaotic no matter how low in the scale we go never do we find the slightest hint of a diminution in that allpervading orderliness nor can we conceive an organism existing for a moment in any other state moreover not only does this order prevail in normal forms but again and again it is to be seen in newlysprung varieties which by general consent cannot have been subjected to a prolonged selection the discovery of mendelian elements admirably coincided with and at once gave a rationale of these facts genetic variation is then primarily the consequence of additions to or omissions from the stock of elements which the species contains the further investigation of the speciesproblem must thus proceed by the analytical method which breeding experiments provide in the nine years which have elapsed since mendels clue became generally known progress has been rapid we now understand the process by which a polymorphic race maintains its polymorphism when a family consists of dissimilar members given the numerical proportions in which these members are occurring we can represent their composition symbolically and state what types can be transmitted by the various members the difficulty of the swamping effects of intercrossing is practically at an end even the famous puzzle of sexlimited inheritance is solved at all events in its more regular manifestations and we know now how it is brought about that the normal sisters of a colourblind man can transmit the colourblindness while his normal brothers cannot transmit it we are still only on the fringe of the inquiry it can be seen extending and ramifying in many directions to enumerate these here would be impossible a whole new range of possibilities is being brought into view by study of the interrelations between the simple factors by following up the evidence as to segregation indications have been obtained which can only be interpreted as meaning that when many factors are being simultaneously redistributed among the germcells certain of them exert what must be described as a repulsion upon other factors we cannot surmise whither this discovery may lead in the new light all the old problems wear a fresh aspect upon the question of the nature of sex for example the bearing of mendelian evidence is close elsewhere i have shown that from several sets of parallel experiments the conclusion is almost forced upon us that in the types investigated of the two sexes the female is to be regarded as heterozygous in sex containing one unpaired dominant element while the male is similarly homozygous in the absence of that element68 it is not a little remarkable that on this pointwhich is the only one where observations of the nuclear processes of gametogenesis have yet been brought into relation with the visible characteristics of the organisms themselvesthere should be diametrical opposition between the results of breeding experiments and those derived from cytology those who have followed the researches of the american school will be aware that after it had been found in certain insects that the spermatozoa were of two kinds according as they contained or did not contain the accessory chromosome e b wilson succeeded in proving that the sperms possessing this accessory body were destined to form females on fertilisation while sperms without it form males the eggs being apparently indifferent perhaps the most striking of all this series of observations is that lately made by t h morgan69 since confirmed by von baehr that in a phylloxeran two kinds of spermatids are formed respectively with and without an accessory in this case double chromosome of these only those possessing the accessory body become functional spermatozoa the others degenerating we have thus an elucidation of the puzzling fact that in these forms fertilisation results in the formation of females only how the males are formedfor of course males are eventually produced by the parthenogenetic femaleswe do not know if the accessory body is really to be regarded as bearing the factor for femaleness then in mendelian terms female is dd and male is dr the eggs are indifferent and the spermatozoa are each male or female but according to the evidence derived from a study of the sexlimited descent of certain features in other animals the conclusion seems equally clear that in them female must be regarded as dr and male as rr the eggs are thus each either male or female and the spermatozoa are indifferent how this contradictory evidence is to be reconciled we do not yet know the breeding work concerns fowls canaries and the currant moth abraxas grossulariata the accessory chromosome has been now observed in most of the great divisions of insects70 except as it happens lepidoptera at first sight it seems difficult to suppose that a feature apparently so fundamental as sex should be differently constituted in different animals but that seems at present the least improbable inference i mention these two groups of facts as illustrating the nature and methods of modern genetic work we must proceed by minute and specific analytical investigation wherever we look we find traces of the operation of precise and specific rules in the light of present knowledge it is evident that before we can attack the speciesproblem with any hope of success there are vast arrears to be made up he would be a bold man who would now assert that there was no sense in which the term species might not have a strict and concrete meaning in contradistinction to the term variety we have been taught to regard the difference between species and variety as one of degree i think it unlikely that this conclusion will bear the test of further research to darwin the question what is a variation presented no difficulties any difference between parent and offspring was a variation now we have to be more precise first we must as de vries has shown distinguish real genetic variation from fluctuational variations due to environmental and other accidents which cannot be transmitted having excluded these sources of error the variations observed must be expressed in terms of the factors to which they are due before their significance can be understood for example numbers of the variations seen under domestication and not a few witnessed in nature are simply the consequence of some ingredient being in an unknown way omitted from the composition of the varying individual the variation may on the contrary be due to the addition of some new element but to prove that it is so is by no means an easy matter casual observation is useless for though these latter variations will always be dominants yet many dominant characteristics may arise from another cause namely the meeting of complementary factors and special study of each case in two generations at least is needed before these two phenomena can be distinguished when such considerations are fully appreciated it will be realised that medleys of most dissimilar occurrences are all confused together under the term variation one of the first objects of genetic analysis is to disentangle this mass of confusion to those who have made no study of heredity it sometimes appears that the question of the effect of conditions in causing variation is one which we should immediately investigate but a little thought will show that before any critical inquiry into such possibilities can be attempted a knowledge of the working of heredity under conditions as far as possible uniform must be obtained at the time when darwin was writing if a plant brought into cultivation gave off an albino variety such an event was without hesitation ascribed to the change of life now we see that albino gametes germs that is to say which are destitute of the pigmentforming factor may have been originally produced by individuals standing an indefinite number of generations back in the ancestry of the actual albino and it is indeed almost certain that the variation to which the appearance of the albino is due cannot have taken place in a generation later than that of the grandparents it is true that when a new dominant appears we should feel greater confidence that we were witnessing the original variation but such events are of extreme rarity and no such case has come under the notice of an experimenter in modern times as far as i am aware that they must have appeared is clear enough nothing corresponding to the brownbreasted game fowl is known wild yet that colour is a most definite dominant and at some moment since gallus bankiva was domesticated the element on which that special colour depends must have at least once been formed in the germcell of a fowl but we need harder evidence than any which has yet been produced before we can declare that this novelty came through overfeeding or change of climate or any other disturbance consequent on domestication when we reflect on the intricacies of genetic problems as we must now conceive them there come moments when we feel almost thankful that the mendelian principles were unknown to darwin the time called for a bold pronouncement and he made it to our lasting profit and delight with fuller knowledge we pass once more into a period of cautious expectation and reserve in every arduous enterprise it is pleasanter to look back at difficulties overcome than forward to those which still seem insurmountable but in the next stage there is nothing to be stained by disguising the fact that the attributes of living things are not what we used to suppose if they are more complex in the sense that the properties they display are throughout so regular71 that the selection of minute random variations is an unacceptable account of the origin of their diversity yet by virtue of that very regularity the problem is limited in scope and thus simplified to begin with we must relegate selection to its proper place selection permits the viable to continue and decides that the nonviable shall perish just as the temperature of our atmosphere decides that no liquid carbon shall be found on the face of the earth but we do not suppose that the form of the diamond has been gradually achieved by a process of selection so again as the course of descent branches in the successive generations selection determines along which branch evolution shall proceed but it does not decide what novelties that branch shall bring forth la nature contient le fonds de toutes ces varits mais le hazard ou lart les mettent en oeuvre as maupertuis most truly said not till knowledge of the genetic properties of organisms has attained to far greater completeness can evolutionary speculations have more than a suggestive value by genetic experiment cytology and physiological chemistry aiding we may hope to acquire such knowledge in 1872 nathusius wrote72 das gesetz der vererbung ist noch nicht erkannt der apfel ist noch nicht vom baum der erkenntniss gefallen welcher der sage nach newton auf den rechten weg zur ergrndung der gravitationsgesetze fhrte we cannot pretend that the words are not still true but in mendelian analysis the seeds of that appletree at last are sown if we were asked what discovery would do most to forward our inquiry what one bit of knowledge would more than any other illuminate the problem i think we may give the answer without hesitation the greatest advance that we can foresee will be made when it is found possible to connect the geometrical phenomena of development with the chemical the geometrical symmetry of living things is the key to a knowledge of their regularity and the forces which cause it in the symmetry of the dividing cell the basis of that resemblance we call heredity is contained to imitate the morphological phenomena of life we have to devise a system which can divide it must be able to divide and to segment asgrosslya vibrating plate or rod does or as an icicle can do as it becomes ribbed in a continuous stream of water but with this distinction that the distribution of chemical differences and properties must simultaneously be decided and disposed in orderly relation to the pattern of the segmentation even if a model which would do this could be constructed it might prove to be a useful beginning this may be looking too far ahead if we had to choose some one piece of more proximate knowledge which we would more especially like to acquire i suppose we should ask for the secret of interracial sterility nothing has yet been discovered to remove the grave difficulty by which huxley in particular was so much oppressed that among the many varieties produced under domesticationwhich we all regard as analogous to the species seen in natureno clear case of interracial sterility has been demonstrated the phenomenon is probably the only one to which the domesticated products seem to afford no parallel no solution of the difficulty can be offered which has positive value but it is perhaps worth considering the facts in the light of modern ideas it should be observed that we are not discussing incompatibility of two species to produce offspring a totally distinct phenomenon but the sterility of the offspring which many of them do produce when two species both perfectly fertile severally produce on crossing a sterile progeny there is a presumption that the sterility is due to the development in the hybrid of some substance which can only be formed by the meeting of two complementary factors that some such account is correct in essence may be inferred from the wellknown observation that if the hybrid is not totally sterile but only partially so and thus is able to form some good germcells which develop into new individuals the sterility of these daughterindividuals is sensibly reduced or may be entirely absent the fertility once reestablished the sterility does not return in the later progeny a fact strongly suggestive of segregation now if the sterility of the crossbred be really the consequence of the meeting of two complementary factors we see that the phenomenon could only be produced among the divergent offspring of one species by the acquisition of at least two new factors for if the acquisition of a single factor caused sterility the line would then end moreover each factor must be separately acquired by distinct individuals for if both were present together the possessors would by hypothesis be sterile and in order to imitate the case of species each of these factors must be acquired by distinct breeds the factors need not and probably would not produce any other perceptible effects they might like the colourfactors present in white flowers make no difference in the form or other characters not till the cross was actually made between the two complementary individuals would either factor come into play and the effects even then might be unobserved until an attempt was made to breed from the crossbred next if the factors responsible for sterility were acquired they would in all probability be peculiar to certain individuals and would not readily be distributed to the whole breed any member of the breed also into which both the factors were introduced would drop out of the pedigree by virtue of its sterility hence the evidence that the various domesticated breeds say of dogs or fowls can when mated together produce fertile offspring is beside the mark the real question is do they ever produce sterile offspring i think the evidence is clearly that sometimes they do oftener perhaps than is commonly supposed these suggestions are quite amenable to experimental tests the most obvious way to begin is to get a pair of parents which are known to have had any sterile offspring and to find the proportions in which these steriles were produced if as i anticipate these proportions are found to be definite the rest is simple in passing certain other considerations may be referred to first that there are observations favouring the view that the production of totally sterile crossbreds is seldom a universal property of two species and that it may be a matter of individuals which is just what on the view here proposed would be expected moreover as we all know now though incompatibility may be dependent to some extent on the degree to which the species are dissimilar no such principle can be demonstrated to determine sterility or fertility in general for example though all our finches can breed together the hybrids are all sterile of ducks some species can breed together without producing the slightest sterility others have totally sterile offspring and so on the hybrids between several genera of orchids are perfectly fertile on the female side and some on the male side also but the hybrids produced between the turnip brassica napus and the swede brassica campestris which according to our estimates of affinity should be nearly allied forms are totally sterile73 lastly it may be recalled that in sterility we are almost certainly considering a meristic phenomenon failure to divide is we may feel fairly sure the immediate cause of the sterility now though we know very little about the heredity of meristic differences all that we do know points to the conclusion that the lessdivided is dominant to the moredivided and we are thus justified in supposing that there are factors which can arrest or prevent celldivision my conjecture therefore is that in the case of sterility of crossbreds we see the effect produced by a complementary pair of such factors this and many similar problems are now open to our analysis the question is sometimes asked do the new lights on variation and heredity make the process of evolution easier to understand on the whole the answer may be given that they do there is some appearance of loss of simplicity but the gain is real as was said above the time is not ripe for the discussion of the origin of species with faith in evolution unshakenif indeed the word faith can be used in application to that which is certainwe look on the manner and causation of adapted differentiation as still wholly mysterious as samuel butler so truly said to me it seems that the origin of variation whatever it is is the only true origin of species74 and of that origin not one of us knows anything but given variationand it is given assuming further that the variations are not guided into paths of adaptationand both to the darwinian and to the modern school this hypothesis appears to be sound if unprovenan evolution of species proceeding by definite steps is more rather than less easy to imagine than an evolution proceeding by the accumulation of indefinite and insensible steps those who have lost themselves in contemplating the miracles of adaptation whether real or spurious have not unnaturally fixed their hopes rather on the indefinite than on the definite changes the reasons are obvious by suggesting that the steps through which an adaptative mechanism arose were indefinite and insensible all further trouble is spared while it could be said that species arise by an insensible and imperceptible process of variation there was clearly no use in tiring ourselves by trying to perceive that process this laboursaving counsel found great favour all that had to be done to develop evolutiontheory was to discover the good in everything a task which in the complete absence of any control or test whereby to check the truth of the discovery is not very onerous the doctrine que tout est au mieux was therefore preached with fresh vigour and examples of that illuminating principle were discovered with a facility that pangloss himself might have envied till at last even the spectators wearied of such dazzling performances but in all seriousness why should indefinite and unlimited variation have been regarded as a more probable account of the origin of adaptation only i think because the obstacle was shifted one plane back and so looked rather less prominent the abundance of adaptation we all grant is an immense almost an unsurpassable difficulty in all nonlamarckian views of evolution but if the steps by which that adaptation arose were fortuitious to imagine them insensible is assuredly no help in one most important respect indeed as has often been observed it is a multiplication of troubles for the smaller the steps the less could natural selection act upon them definite variationsand of the occurrence of definite variations in abundance we have now the most convincing proofhave at least the obvious merit that they can make and often do make a real difference in the chances of life there is another aspect of the adaptation problem to which i can allude very briefly may not our present ideas of the universality and precision of adaptation be greatly exaggerated the fit of organism to its environment is not after all so very closea proposition unwelcome perhaps but one which could be illustrated by very copious evidence natural selection is stern but she has her tolerant moods we have now most certain and irrefragable proof that much definiteness exists in living things apart from selection and also much that may very well have been preserved and so in a sense constituted by selection here the matter is likely to rest there is a passage in the sixth edition of the origin which has i think been overlooked on page 70 darwin says the tuft of hair on the breast of the wild turkeycock cannot be of any use and it is doubtful whether it can be ornamental in the eyes of the female bird this tuft of hair is a most definite and unusual structure and i am afraid that the remark that it cannot be of any use may have been made inadvertently but it may have been intended for in the first edition the usual qualification was given and must therefore have been deliberately excised anyhow i should like to think that darwin did throw over that tuft of hair and that he felt relief when he had done so whether however we have his great authority for such a course or not i feel quite sure that we shall be rightly interpreting the facts of nature if we cease to expect to find purposefulness wherever we meet with definite structures or patterns such things are as often as not i suspect rather of the nature of toolmarks mere incidents of manufacture benefiting their possessor not more than the wiremarks in a sheet of paper or the ribbing on the bottom of an oriental plate renders those objects more attractive in our eyes if variation may be in any way definite the question once more arises may it not be definite in direction the belief that it is has had many supporters from lamarck onwards who held that it was guided by need and others who like ngeli while laying no emphasis on need yet were convinced that there was guidance of some kind the latter view under the name of orthogenesis devised i believe by eimer at the present day commends itself to some naturalists the objection to such a suggestion is of course that no fragment of real evidence can be produced in its support on the other hand with the experimental proof that variation consists largely in the unpacking and repacking of an original complexity it is not so certain as we might like to think that the order of these events is not predetermined for instance the original pack may have been made in such a way that at the nth division of the germcells of a sweet pea a colourfactor might be dropped and that at the nnth division the hooded variety be given off and so on i see no ground whatever for holding such a view but in fairness the possibility should not be forgotten and in the light of modern research it scarcely looks so absurdly improbable as before no one can survey the work of recent years without perceiving that evolutionary orthodoxy developed too fast and that a great deal has got to come down but this satisfaction at least remains that in the experimental methods which mendel inaugurated we have means of reaching certainty in regard to the physiology of heredity and variation upon which a more lasting structure may be built footnotes footnote 56 vnus physique contenant deux dissertations lune sur lorigine des hommes et des animaux et lautre sur lorigine des noirs la haye 1746 pp 124 and 129

sometimes been said that the success of the origin proved that the subject was in the air or that mens minds were prepared for it i do not think that this is strictly true for i occasionally sounded not a few naturalists and never happened to come across a single one who seemed to doubt about the permanence of species this experience may perhaps have been an accident due to darwins isolation the literature of the period abounds with indications of critical expectancy a most interesting expression of that feeling is given in the charming account of the early days of darwinism by alfred newton macmillans magazine lvii 1888 p 241 he tells how in 1858 when spending a dreary summer in iceland he and his friend the ornithologist john wolley in default of active occupation spent their days in discussion both of us taking a keen interest in natural history it was but reasonable that a question which in those days was always coming up wherever two or more naturalists were gathered together should be continually recurring that question was what is a species and connected therewith was the other question how did a species begin now we were of course fairly well acquainted with what had been published on these subjects he then enumerates some of these publications mentioning among others t vernon wollastons variation of speciesa work which has in my opinion never been adequately appreciated he proceeds of course we never arrived at anything like a solution of these problems general or special but we felt very strongly that a solution ought to be found and that quickly if the study of botany and zoology was to make any great advance he then describes how on his return home he received the famous number of the linnean journal on a certain evening i sat up late that night to

melancholy sequela of darwinism it seems an irony that we should read in the peroration to the origin that when the darwinian view is accepted systematists will be able to pursue their labours as at

disputes whether or not some fifty species of british brambles are good species will cease origin 6th edit 1882 p 425 true they have ceased to attract the attention of those who lead opinion but anyone who will turn to the literature of systematics will find that they have not ceased in any other sense should there not be something disquieting in the fact that among the workers who come most

natural penetration and from absolutely opposite conclusions back to this underlying truth so that each ovum when impregnate should be considered not as descended from its ancestors but as being a continuation of the personality of every ovum in the chain of its ancestry which every ovum it actually is quite as truly as the octogenarian is the same identity with the ovum from which he has been developed this process cannot stop short of the primordial cell which again will probably turn out to be but a brief restingplace we therefore prove each one of us to be actually the primordial cell

human race of the descent of man is ranked by huxley in his epochmaking book mans place in nature as the deepest with which biology has to concern itself the question of questionsthe problem which underlies all others in the same brilliant and lucid exposition which appeared in 1863 soon after the publication of darwins origin of species huxley stated his own views in regard to this great problem he tells us how the idea of a natural descent of man gradually grew up in his mind it was especially the assertions of owen in regard to the total difference between the human and the simian brain that called forth strong dissent from the great anatomist huxley and he easily succeeded in showing that owens supposed differences had no real existence he even established on the basis of his own anatomical investigations the proposition that the anatomical differences between the marmoset and the chimpanzee are much greater than those between the chimpanzee and man but why do we thus introduce the study of darwins descent of man which is to occupy us here by insisting on the fact that huxley had taken the field in defence of the descent of man in 1863 while darwins book on the subject did not appear till 1871 it is in order that we may clearly understand how it happened that from this time onwards darwin and huxley followed the same great aim in the most intimate association huxley and darwin working at the same problema maximum huxley fiery impetuous eager for battle contemptuous of the resistance of a dull world or energetically triumphing over it darwin calm weighing every problem slowly letting it mature thoroughlynot a fighter yet having the greater and more lasting influence by virtue of his immense mass of critically sifted proofs darwins friend huxley was the first to do him justice to understand his nature and to find in it the reason why the detailed and carefully considered book on the descent of man made its appearance so late huxley always generous never thought of claiming priority for himself in enthusiastic language he tells how darwins immortal work the origin of species first shed light for him on the problem of the descent of man the recognition of a vera causa in the transformation of species illuminated his thoughts as with a flash he was now content to leave what perplexed him what he could not yet solve as he says himself in the mighty hands of darwin happy in the bustle of strife against old and deeprooted prejudices against intolerance and superstition he wielded his sharp weapons on darwins behalf wearing darwins armour he joyously overthrew adversary after adversary darwin spoke of huxley as his general agent75 huxley says of himself i am darwins bulldog76 thus huxley openly acknowledged that it was darwins origin of species that first set the problem of the descent of man in its true light that made the question of the origin of the human race a pressing one that this was the logical consequence of his book darwin himself had long felt he had been reproached with intentionally shirking the application of his theory to man let us hear what he says on this point in his autobiography as soon as i had become in the year 1837 or 1838 convinced that species were mutable productions i could not avoid the belief that man must come under the same law accordingly i collected notes on the subject for my own satisfaction and not for a long time with any intention of publishing although in the origin of species the derivation of any particular species is never discussed yet i thought it best in order that no honourable man should accuse me of concealing my views77 to add that by the work light would be thrown on the origin of man and his history it would have been useless and injurious to the success of the book to have paraded without giving any evidence my conviction with respect to his origin78 in a letter written in january 1860 to the rev l blomefield darwin expresses himself in similar terms with respect to man i am very far from wishing to obtrude my belief but i thought it dishonest to quite conceal my opinion79 the brief allusion in the origin of species is so far from prominent and so incidental that it was excusable to assume that darwin had not touched upon the descent of man in this work it was solely the desire to have his mass of evidence sufficiently complete solely darwins great characteristic of never publishing till he had carefully weighed all aspects of his subject for years solely in short his most fastidious scientific conscience that restrained him from challenging the world in 1859 with a book in which the theory of the descent of man was fully set forth three years frequently interrupted by illhealth were needed for the actual writing of the book80 the first edition which appeared in 1871 was followed in 1874 by a much improved second edition the preparation of which he very reluctantly undertook81 this briefly is the history of the work which with the origin of species marks an epoch in the history of biological sciencesthe work with which the cautious peaceloving investigator ventured forth from his contemplative life into the arena of strife and unrest and laid himself open to all the annoyances that deeprooted belief and prejudice and the prevailing tendency of scientific thought at the time could devise darwin did not take this step lightly of great interest in this connection is a letter written to wallace on dec 22 185782 in which he says you ask me whether i shall discuss man i think i shall avoid the whole subject as so surrounded with prejudices though i fully admit that it is the highest and most interesting problem for the naturalist but his conscientiousness compelled him to state briefly his opinion on the subject in the origin of species in 1859 nevertheless he did not escape reproaches for having been so reticent this is unmistakably apparent from a letter to fritz mller dated feb 22 1869 in which he says i am thinking of writing a little essay on the origin of mankind as i have been taunted with concealing my opinions83 it might be thought that darwin behaved thus hesitatingly and was so slow in deciding on the full publication of his collected material in regard to the descent of man because he had religious difficulties to overcome but this was not the case as we can see from his admirable confession of faith the publication of which we owe to his son francis84 whoever wishes really to understand the lofty character of this great man should read these immortal lines in which he unfolds to us in simple and straightforward words the development of his conception of the universe he describes how though he was still quite orthodox during his voyage round the world on board the beagle he came gradually to see shortly afterwards 18361839 that the old testament was no more to be trusted than the sacred books of the hindoos the miracles by which christianity is supported the discrepancies between the accounts in the different gospels gradually led him to disbelieve in christianity as a divine revelation thus he writes85 disbelief crept over me at a very slow rate but was at last complete the rate was so slow that i felt no distress but darwin was too modest to presume to go beyond the limits laid down by science he wanted nothing more than to be able to go freely and unhampered by belief in authority or in the bible as far as human knowledge could lead him we learn this from the concluding words of his chapter on religion the mystery of the beginning of all things is insoluble by us and i for one must be content to remain an agnostic86 darwin was always very unwilling to give publicity to his views in regard to religion in a letter to asa gray on may 22 186087 he declares that it is always painful to him to have to enter into discussion of religious problems he had he said no intention of writing atheistically finally let us cite one characteristic sentence from a letter from darwin to c ridley88 nov 28 1878 a clergyman dr pusey had asserted that darwin had written the origin of species with some relation to theology darwin writes emphatically many years ago when i was collecting facts for the origin my belief in what is called a personal god was as firm as that of dr pusey himself and as to the eternity of matter i never troubled myself about such insoluble questions the expression many years ago refers to the time of his voyage round the world as has already been pointed out darwin means by this utterance that the views which had gradually developed in his mind in regard to the origin of species were quite compatible with the faith of the church if we consider all these utterances of darwin in regard to religion and to his outlook on life weltanschauung we shall see at least so much that religious reflection could in no way have influenced him in regard to the writing and publishing of his book on the descent of man darwin had early won for himself freedom of thought and to this freedom he remained true to the end of his life uninfluenced by the customs and opinions of the world around him darwin was thus inwardly fortified and armed against the host of calumnies accusations and attacks called forth by the publication of the origin of species and to an even greater extent by the appearance of the descent of man but in his defence he could rely on the aid of a band of distinguished auxiliaries of the rarest ability his faithful confederate huxley was joined by the botanist hooker and after longer resistance by the famous geologist lyell whose conversion afforded darwin peculiar satisfaction all three took the field with enthusiasm in defence of the natural descent of man from wallace on the other hand though he shared with him the idea of natural selection darwin got no support in this matter wallace expressed himself in a strange manner he admitted everything in regard to the morphological descent of man but maintained in a mystic way that something else something of a spiritual nature must have been added to what man inherited from his animal ancestors darwin whose esteem for wallace was extraordinarily high could not understand how he could give utterance to such a mystical view in regard to man the idea seemed to him so incredibly strange that he thought some one else must have added these sentences to wallaces paper even now there are thinkers who like wallace shrink from applying to man the ultimate consequences of the theory of descent the idea that man is derived from apelike forms is to them unpleasant and humiliating so far i have been depicting the development of darwins work on the descent of man in what follows i shall endeavour to give a condensed survey of the contents of the book it must at once be said that the contents of darwins work fall into two parts dealing with entirely different subjects the descent of man includes a very detailed investigation in regard to secondary sexual characters in the animal series and on this investigation darwin founded a new theory that of sexual selection with astonishing patience he gathered together an immense mass of material and showed in regard to arthropods and vertebrates the wide distribution of secondary characters which develop almost exclusively in the male and which enable him on the one hand to get the better of his rivals in the struggle for the female by the greater perfection of his weapons and on the other hand to offer greater allurements to the female through the higher development of decorative characters of song or of scentproducing glands the best equipped males will thus crowd out the less wellequipped in the matter of reproduction and thus the relevant characters will be increased and perfected through sexual selection it is of course a necessary assumption that these secondary sexual characters may be transmitted to the female although perhaps in rudimentary form as we have said this story of sexual selection takes up a great deal of space in darwins book and it need only be considered here in so far as darwin applied it to the descent of man to this latter problem the whole of part i is devoted while part iii contains a discussion of sexual selection in relation to man and a general summary part ii treats of sexual selection in general and may be disregarded in our present study moreover many interesting details must necessarily be passed over in what follows for want of space the first part of the descent of man begins with an enumeration of the proofs of the animal descent of man taken from the structure of the human body darwin chiefly emphasises the fact that the human body consists of the same organs and of the same tissues as those of the other mammals he shows also that man is subject to the same diseases and tormented by the same parasites as the apes he further dwells on the general agreement exhibited by young embryonic forms and he illustrates this by two figures placed one above the other one representing a human embryo after ecker the other a dog embryo after bischoff89 darwin finds further proofs of the animal origin of man in the reduced structures in themselves extremely variable which are either absolutely useless to their possessors or of so little use that they could never have developed under existing conditions of such vestiges he enumerates the defective development of the panniculus carnosus muscle of the skin so widely distributed among mammals the earmuscles the occasional persistence of the animal earpoint in man the rudimentary nictitating membrane plica semilunaris in the human eye the slight development of the organ of smell the general hairiness of the human body the frequently defective development or entire absence of the third molar the wisdom tooth the vermiform appendix the occasional reappearance of a bony canal foramen supracondyloideum at the lower end of the humerus the rudimentary tail of man the socalled taillessness and so on of these rudimentary structures the occasional occurrence of the animal earpoint in man is most fully discussed darwins attention was called to this interesting structure by the sculptor woolner he figures such a case observed in man and also the head of an alleged orangfoetus the photograph of which he received from nitsche darwins interpretation of woolners case as having arisen through a folding over of the free edge of a pointed ear has been fully borne out by my investigations on the external ear90 in particular it was established by these investigations that the human foetus about the middle of its embryonic life possesses a pointed ear somewhat similar to that of the monkey genus macacus one of darwins statements in regard to the head of the orangfoetus must be corrected a large ear with a point is shown in the photograph91 but it can easily be demonstratedand deniker has already pointed this outthat the figure is not that of an orang foetus at all for that form has much smaller ears with no point nor can it be a gibbonfoetus as deniker supposes for the gibbon ear is also without a point i myself regard it as that of a macacusembryo but this mistake which is due to nitsche in no way affects the fact recognised by darwin that earforms showing the point characteristic of the animal ear occur in man with extraordinary frequency finally there is a discussion of those rudimentary structures which occur only in one sex such as the rudimentary mammary glands in the male the vesicula prostatica which corresponds to the uterus of the female and others all these facts tell in favour of the common descent of man and all other vertebrates the conclusion of this section is characteristic it is only our natural prejudice and that arrogance which made our forefathers declare that they were descended from demigods which leads us to demur to this conclusion but the time will before long come when it will be thought wonderful that naturalists who were well acquainted with the comparative structure and development of man and other mammals should have believed that each was the work of a separate act of creation92 in the second chapter there is a more detailed discussion again based upon an extraordinary wealth of facts of the problem as to the manner in which and the causes through which man evolved from a lower form precisely the same causes are here suggested for the origin of man as for the origin of species in general variability which is a necessary assumption in regard to all transformations occurs in man to a high degree moreover the rapid multiplication of the human race creates conditions which necessitate an energetic struggle for existence and thus afford scope for the intervention of natural selection of the exercise of artificial selection in the human race there is nothing to be said unless we cite such cases as the grenadiers of frederick william i or the population of ancient sparta in the passages already referred to and in those which follow the transmission of acquired characters upon which darwin does not dwell is taken for granted in man direct effects of changed conditions can be demonstrated for instance in regard to bodily size and there are also proofs of the influence exerted on his physical constitution by increased use or disuse reference is here made to the fact established by forbes that the quechua indians of the high plateaus of peru show a striking development of lungs and thorax as a result of living constantly at high altitudes such special forms of variation as arrests of development microcephalism and reversion to lower forms are next discussed darwin himself felt93 that these subjects are so nearly related to the cases mentioned in the first chapter that many of them might as well have been dealt with there it seems to me that it would have been better so for the citation of additional instances of reversion at this place rather disturbs the logical sequence of his ideas as to the conditions which have brought about the evolution of man from lower forms the instances of reversion here discussed are microcephalism which darwin wrongly interpreted as atavistic supernumerary mammae supernumerary digits bicornuate uterus the development of abnormal muscles and so on brief mention is also made of correlative variations observed in man darwin next discusses the question as to the manner in which man attained to the erect position from the state of a climbing quadruped here again he puts the influence of natural selection in the first rank the immediate progenitors of man had to maintain a struggle for existence in which success was to the more intelligent and to those with social instincts the hand of these climbing ancestors which had little skill and served mainly for locomotion could only undergo further development when some early member of the primate series came to live more on the ground and less among trees a bipedal existence thus became possible and with it the liberation of the hand from locomotion and the onesided development of the human foot the upright position brought about correlated variations in the bodily structure with the free use of the hand it became possible to manufacture weapons and to use them and this again resulted in a degeneration of the powerful canine teeth and the jaws which were then no longer necessary for defence above all however the intelligence immediately increased and with it skull and brain the nakedness of man and the absence of a tail rudimentariness of the tail vertebrae are next discussed darwin is inclined to attribute the nakedness of man not to the action of natural selection on ancestors who originally inhabited a tropical land but to sexual selection which for aesthetic reasons brought about the loss of the hairy covering in man or primarily in woman an interesting discussion of the loss of the tail which however man shares with the anthropoid apes some other monkeys and lemurs forms the conclusion of the almost superabundant material which darwin worked up in the second chapter his object was to show that some of the most distinctive human characters are in all probability directly or indirectly due to natural selection with characteristic modesty he adds94 hence if i have erred in giving to natural selection great power which i am very far from admitting or in having exaggerated its power which is in itself probable i have at least as i hope done good service in aiding to overthrow the dogma of separate creations at the end of the chapter he touches upon the objection as to mans helpless and defenceless condition against this he urges his intelligence and social instincts the two following chapters contain a detailed discussion of the objections drawn from the supposed great differences between the mental powers of men and animals darwin at once admits that the differences are enormous but not that any fundamental difference between the two can be found very characteristic of him is the following passage in what manner the mental powers were first developed in the lowest organisms is as hopeless an enquiry as how life itself first originated these are problems for the distant future if they are ever to be solved by man95 after some brief observations on instinct and intelligence darwin brings forward evidence to show that the greater number of the emotional states such as pleasure and pain happiness and misery love and hate are common to man and the higher animals he goes on to give various examples showing that wonder and curiosity imitation attention memory and imagination dreams of animals can also be observed in the higher mammals especially in apes in regard even to reason there are no sharply defined limits a certain faculty of deliberation is characteristic of some animals and the more thoroughly we know an animal the more intelligence we are inclined to credit it with examples are brought forward of the intelligent and deliberate actions of apes dogs and elephants but although no sharply defined differences exist between man and animals there is nevertheless a series of other mental powers which are characteristics usually regarded as absolutely peculiar to man some of these characteristics are examined in detail and it is shown that the arguments drawn from them are not conclusive man alone is said to be capable of progressive improvement but against this must be placed as something analogous in animals the fact that they learn cunning and caution through long continued persecution even the use of tools is not in itself peculiar to man monkeys use sticks stones and twigs but man alone fashions and uses implements designed for a special purpose in this connection the remarks taken from lubbock in regard to the origin and gradual development of the earliest flint implements will be read with interest these are similar to the observations on modern eoliths and their bearing on the development of the stone industry it is interesting to learn from a letter to hooker96 that darwin himself at first doubted whether the stone implements discovered by boucher de perthes were really of the nature of tools with the relentless candour as to himself which characterised him he writes four years later in a letter to lyell in regard to this view of boucher de perthes discoveries i know something about his errors and looked at his book many years ago and am ashamed to think that i concluded the whole was rubbish yet he has done for man something like what agassiz did for glaciers97 to return to darwins further comparisons between the higher mental powers of man and animals he takes much of the force from the argument that man alone is capable of abstraction and selfconsciousness by his own observations on dogs one of the main differences between man and animals speech receives detailed treatment he points out that various animals birds monkeys dogs have a large number of different sounds for different emotions that further man produces in common with animals a whole series of inarticulate cries combined with gestures and that dogs learn to understand whole sentences of human speech in regard to human language darwin expresses a view contrary to that held by max mller98 i cannot doubt that language owes its origin to the imitation and modification of various natural sounds the voices of other animals and mans own instinctive cries aided by signs and gestures the development of actual language presupposes a higher degree of intelligence than is found in any kind of ape darwin remarks on this point99 the fact of the higher apes not using their vocal organs for speech no doubt depends on their intelligence not having been sufficiently advanced the sense of beauty too has been alleged to be peculiar to man in refutation of this assertion darwin points to the decorative colours of birds which are used for display and to the last objection that man alone has religion that he alone has a belief in god it is answered that numerous races have existed and still exist who have no idea of one or more gods and who have no words in their languages to express such an idea100 the result of the investigations recorded in this chapter is to show that great as the difference in mental powers between man and the higher animals may be it is undoubtedly only a difference of degree and not of kind101 in the fourth chapter darwin deals with the moral sense or conscience which is the most important of all differences between man and animals it is a result of social instincts which lead to sympathy for other members of the same society to nonegoistic actions for the good of others darwin shows that social tendencies are found among many animals and that among these love and kinsympathy exist and he gives examples of animals especially dogs which may exhibit characters that we should call moral in man eg disinterested selfsacrifice for the sake of others the early apelike progenitors of the human race were undoubtedly social with the increase of intelligence the moral sense develops farther with the acquisition of speech public opinion arises and finally moral sense becomes habit the rest of darwins detailed discussions on moral philosophy may be passed over the fifth chapter may be very briefly summarised in it darwin shows that the intellectual and moral faculties are perfected through natural selection he inquires how it can come about that a tribe at a low level of evolution attains to a higher although the best and bravest among them often pay for their fidelity and courage with their lives without leaving any descendants in this case it is the sentiment of glory praise and blame the admiration of others which bring about the increase of the better members of the tribe property fixed dwellings and the association of families into a community are also indispensable requirements for civilisation in the longer second section of the fifth chapter darwin acts mainly as recorder on the basis of numerous investigations especially those of greg wallace and galton he inquires how far the influence of natural selection can be demonstrated in regard to civilised nations in the final section which deals with the proofs that all civilised nations were once barbarians darwin again uses the results gained by other investigators such as lubbock and tylor there are two sets of facts which prove the proposition in question in the first place we find traces of a former lower state in the customs and beliefs of all civilised nations and in the second place there are proofs to show that savage races are independently able to raise themselves a few steps in the scale of civilisation and that they have thus raised themselves in the sixth chapter of the work morphology comes into the foreground once more darwin first goes back however to the argument based on the great difference between the mental powers of the highest animals and those of man that this is only quantitative not qualitative he has already shown very instructive in this connection is the reference to the enormous difference in mental powers in another class no one would draw from the fact that the cochineal insect coccus and the ant exhibit enormous differences in their mental powers the conclusion that the ant should therefore be regarded as something quite distinct and withdrawn from the class of insects altogether darwin next attempts to establish the specific genealogical tree of man and carefully weighs the differences and resemblances between the different families of the primates the erect position of man is an adaptive character just as are the various characters referable to aquatic life in the seals which notwithstanding these are ranked as a mere family of the carnivores the following utterance is very characteristic of darwin102 if man had not been his own classifier he would never have thought of founding a separate order for his own reception in numerous characters not mentioned in systematic works in the features of the face in the form of the nose in the structure of the external ear man resembles the apes the arrangement of the hair in man has also much in common with the apes as also the occurrence of hair on the forehead of the human embryo the beard the convergence of the hair of the upper and under arm towards the elbow which occurs not only in the anthropoid apes but also in some american monkeys darwin here adopts wallaces explanation of the origin of the ascending direction of the hair in the forearm of the orangthat it has arisen through the habit of holding the hands over the head in rain but this explanation cannot be maintained when we consider that this disposition of the hair is widely distributed among the most different mammals being found in the dog in the sloth and in many of the lower monkeys after further careful analysis of the anatomical characters darwin reaches the conclusion that the new world monkeys platyrrhine may be excluded from the genealogical tree altogether but that man is an offshoot from the old world monkeys catarrhine whose progenitors existed as far back as the miocene period among these old world monkeys the forms to which man shows the greatest resemblance are the anthropoid apes which like him possess neither tail nor ischial callosities the platyrrhine and catarrhine monkeys have their primitive ancestor among extinct forms of the lemuridae darwin also touches on the question of the original home of the human race and supposes that it may have been in africa because it is there that mans nearest relatives the gorilla and the chimpanzee are found but he regards speculation on this point as useless it is remarkable that in this connection darwin regards the loss of the haircovering in man as having some relation to a warm climate while elsewhere he is inclined to make sexual selection responsible for it darwin recognises the great gap between man and his nearest relatives but similar gaps exist at other parts of the mammalian genealogical tree the allied forms have become extinct after the extermination of the lower races of mankind on the one hand and of the anthropoid apes on the other which will undoubtedly take place the gulf will be greater than ever since the baboons will then bound it on the one side and the white races on the other little weight need be attached to the lack of fossil remains to fill up this gap since the discovery of these depends upon chance the last part of the chapter is devoted to a discussion of the earlier stages in the genealogy of man here darwin accepts in the main the genealogical tree which had meantime been published by haeckel who traces the pedigree back through monotrems reptiles amphibians and fishes to amphioxus then follows an attempt to reconstruct from the atavistic characters a picture of our primitive ancestor who was undoubtedly an arboreal animal the occurrence of rudiments of parts in one sex which only come to full development in the other is next discussed this state of things darwin regards as derived from an original hermaphroditism in regard to the mammary glands of the male he does not accept the theory that they are vestigial but considers them rather as not fully developed the last chapter of part i deals with the question whether the different races of man are to be regarded as different species or as subspecies of a race of monophyletic origin the striking differences between the races are first emphasised and the question of the fertility or infertility of hybrids is discussed that fertility is the more usual is shown by the excessive fertility of the hybrid population of brazil this and the great variability of the distinguishing characters of the different races as well as the fact that all grades of transition stages are found between these while considerable general agreement exists tell in favour of the unity of the races and lead to the conclusion that they all had a common primitive ancestor darwin therefore classifies all the different races as subspecies of one and the same species then follows an interesting inquiry into the reasons for the extinction of human races he recognises as the ultimate reason the injurious effects of a change of the conditions of life which may bring about an increase in infantile mortality and a diminished fertility it is precisely the reproductive system among animals also which is most susceptible to changes in the environment the final section of this chapter deals with the formation of the races of mankind darwin discusses the question how far the direct effect of different conditions of life or the inherited effects of increased use or disuse may have brought about the characteristic differences between the different races even in regard to the origin of the colour of the skin he rejects the transmitted effects of an original difference of climate as an explanation in so doing he is following his tendency to exclude lamarckian explanations as far as possible but here he makes gratuitous difficulties from which since natural selection fails there is no escape except by bringing in the principle of sexual selection to which he regarded it as possible skincolouring arrangement of hair and form of features might be traced but with his characteristic conscientiousness he guards himself thus i do not intend to assert that sexual selection will account for all the differences between the races103 i may be permitted a remark as to darwins attitude towards lamarck while at an earlier stage when he was engaged in the preliminary labours for his immortal work the origin of species darwin expresses himself very forcibly against the views of lamarck speaking of lamarckian nonsense104 and of lamarcks absurd though clever work105 and expressly declaring i attribute very little to the direct action of climate etc106 yet in later life he became more and more convinced of the influence of external conditions in 1876 that is two years after the appearance of the second edition of the descent of man he writes with his usual candid honesty in my opinion the greatest error which i have committed has been not allowing sufficient weight to the direct action of the environment ie food climate etc independently of a natural selection107 it is certain from this change of opinion that if he had been able to make up his mind to issue a third edition of the descent of man he would have ascribed a much greater influence to the effect of external conditions in explaining the different characters of the races of man than he did in the second edition he would also undoubtedly have attributed less influence to sexual selection as a factor in the origin of the different bodily characteristics if indeed he would not have excluded it altogether in part iii of the descent two additional chapters are devoted to the discussion of sexual selection in relation to man these may be very briefly referred to darwin here seeks to show that sexual selection has been operative on man and his primitive progenitor space fails me to follow out his interesting arguments i can only mention that he is inclined to trace back hairlessness the development of the beard in man and the characteristic colour of the different human races to sexual selection since bareness of the skin could be no advantage but rather a disadvantage this character cannot have been brought about by natural selection darwin also rejected a direct influence of climate as a cause of the origin of the skincolour i have already expressed the opinion based on the development of his views as shown in his letters that in a third edition darwin would probably have laid more stress on the influence of external environment he himself feels that there are gaps in his proofs here and says in selfcriticism the views here advanced on the part which sexual selection has played in the history of man want scientific precision108 i need here only point out that it is impossible to explain the graduated stages of skincolour by sexual selection since it would have produced races sharply defined by their colour and not united to other races by transition stages and this it is well known is not the case moreover the fact established by me109 that in all races the ventral side of the trunk is paler than the dorsal side and the inner surface of the extremities paler than the outer side cannot be explained by sexual selection in the darwinian sense with this i conclude my brief survey of the rich contents of darwins book i may be permitted to conclude by quoting the magnificent final words of the descent of man we must however acknowledge as it seems to me that man with all his noble qualities with sympathy which feels for the most debased with benevolence which extends not only to other men but to the humblest living creature with his godlike intellect which has penetrated into the movements and constitution of the solar systemwith all these exalted powersman still bears in his bodily frame the indelible stamp of his lowly origin110 what has been the fate of darwins doctrines since his great achievement how have they been received and followed up by the scientific and lay world and what do the successors of the mighty hero and genius think now in regard to the origin of the human race at the present time we are incomparably more favourably placed than darwin was for answering this question of all questions we have at our command an incomparably greater wealth of material than he had at his disposal and we are more fortunate than he in this respect that we now know transitionforms which help to fill up the gap still great between the lowest human races and the highest apes let us consider for a little the more essential additions to our knowledge since the publication of the descent of man since that time our knowledge of animal embryos has increased enormously while darwin was obliged to content himself with comparing a human embryo with that of a dog there are now available the youngest embryos of monkeys of all possible groups orang gibbon semnopithecus macacus thanks to selenkas most successful tour in the east indies in search of such material we can now compare corresponding stages of the lower monkeys and of the anthropoid apes with human embryos and convince ourselves of their great resemblance to one another thus strengthening enormously the armour prepared by darwin in defence of his view on mans nearest relatives it may be said that selenkas material fills up the blanks in darwins array of proofs in the most satisfactory manner the deepening of our knowledge of comparative anatomy also gives us much surer foundations than those on which darwin was obliged to build just of late there have been many workers in the domain of the anatomy of apes and lemurs and their investigations extend to the most different organs our knowledge of fossil apes and lemurs has also become much wider and more exact since darwins time the fossil lemurs have been especially worked up by cope forsyth major ameghino and others darwin knew very little about fossil monkeys he mentions two or three anthropoid apes as occurring in the miocene of europe111 but only names dryopithecus the largest form from the miocene of france it was erroneously supposed that this form was related to hylobates we now know not only a form that actually stands near to the gibbon pliopithecus and remains of other anthropoids pliohylobates and the fossil chimpanzee palaeopithecus but also several lower catarrhine monkeys of which mesopithecus a form nearly related to the modern sacred monkeys a species of semnopithecus and found in strata of the miocene period in greece is the most important quite recently too ameghinos investigations have made us acquainted with fossil monkeys from south america anthropops homunculus which according to their discoverer are to be regarded as in the line of human descent what darwin missed most of allintermediate forms between apes and manhas been recently furnished e dubois as is well known discovered in 1893 near trinil in java in the alluvial deposits of the river bengawan an important form represented by a skullcap some molars and a femur his opinionmuch disputed as it has beenthat in this form which he named pithecanthropus he has found a longdesired transitionform is shared by the present writer and although the geological age of these fossils which according to dubois belong to the uppermost tertiary series the pliocene has recently been fixed at a later date the older diluvium the morphological value of these interesting remains that is the intermediate position of pithecanthropus still holds good volz says with justice112 that even if pithecanthropus is not the missing link it is undoubtedly a missing link as on the one hand there has been found in pithecanthropus a form which though intermediate between apes and man is nevertheless more closely allied to the apes so on the other hand much progress has been made since darwins day in the discovery and description of the oldest human remains since the famous roof of a skull and the bones of the extremities belonging to it were found in 1856 in the neandertal near dsseldorf the most varied judgments have been expressed in regard to the significance of the remains and of the skull in particular in darwins descent of man there is only a passing allusion to them113 in connection with the discussion of the skullcapacity although the investigations of schaaffhausen king and huxley were then known i believe i have shown in a series of papers that the skull in question belongs to a form different from any of the races of man now living and with king and cope i regard it as at least a different species from living man and have therefore designated it homo primigenius the form unquestionably belongs to the older diluvium and in the later diluvium human forms already appear which agree in all essential points with existing human races as far back as 1886 the value of the neandertal skull was greatly enhanced by fraiponts discovery of two skulls and skeletons from spy in belgium these are excellently described by their discoverer114 and are regarded as belonging to the same group of forms as the neandertal remains in 1899 and the following years came the discovery by gorjanovickramberger of different skeletal parts of at least ten individuals in a cave near krapina in croatia115 it is in particular the form of the lower jaw which is different from that of all recent races of man and which clearly indicates the lowly position of homo primigenius while on the other hand the longknown skull from gibraltar which i116 have referred to homo primigenius and which has lately been examined in detail by sollas117 has made us acquainted with the surprising shape of the eyeorbit of the nose and of the whole upper part of the face isolated lower jaws found at la naulette in belgium and at malarnaud in france increase our material which is now as abundant as could be desired the most recent discovery of all is that of a skull dug up in august of this year 1908 by klaatsch and hauser in the lower grotto of the le moustier in southern france but this skull has not yet been fully described thus homo primigenius must also be regarded as occupying a position in the gap existing between the highest apes and the lowest human races pithecanthropus standing in the lower part of it and homo primigenius in the higher near man in order to prevent misunderstanding i should like here to emphasise that in arranging this structural seriesanthropoid apes pithecanthropus homo primigenius homo sapiensi have no intention of establishing it as a direct genealogical series i shall have something to say in regard to the genetic relations of these forms one to another when discussing the different theories of descent current at the present day118 in quite a different domain from that of morphological relationship namely in the physiological study of the blood results have recently been gained which are of the highest importance to the doctrine of descent uhlenhuth nuttall and others have established the fact that the bloodserum of a rabbit which has previously had human blood injected into it forms a precipitate with human blood this biological reaction was tried with a great variety of mammalian species and it was found that those far removed from man gave no precipitate under these conditions but as in other cases among mammals all nearly related forms yield an almost equally marked precipitate so the serum of a rabbit treated with human blood and then added to the blood of an anthropoid ape gives almost as marked a precipitate as in human blood the reaction to the blood of the lower eastern monkeys is weaker that to the western monkeys weaker still indeed in this last case there is only a slight clouding after a considerable time and no actual precipitate the blood of the lemuridae nuttall gives no reaction or an extremely weak one that of the other mammals none whatever we have in this not only a proof of the literal blood relationship between man and apes but the degree of relationship with the different main groups of apes can be determined beyond possibility of mistake finally it must be briefly mentioned that in regard to remains of human handicraft also the material at our disposal has greatly increased of late years that as a result of this the opinions of archaeologists have undergone many changes and that in particular their views in regard to the age of the human race have been greatly influenced there is a tendency at the present time to refer the origin of man back to tertiary times it is true that no remains of tertiary man have been found but flints have been discovered which according to the opinion of most investigators bear traces either of use or of very primitive workmanship since rutots time following mortillets example investigators have called these eoliths and they have been traced back by verworn to the miocene of the auvergne and by rutot even to the upper oligocene although these eoliths are even nowadays the subject of many different views the preoccupation with them has kept the problem of the age of the human race continually before us geology too has made great progress since the days of darwin and lyell and has endeavoured with satisfactory results to arrange the human remains of the diluvial period in chronological order penck i do not intend to enter upon the question of the primitive home of the human race since the space at my disposal will not allow of my touching even very briefly upon all the departments of science which are concerned in the problem of the descent of man how darwin would have rejoiced over each of the discoveries here briefly outlined what use he would have made of the new and precious material which would have prevented the discouragement from which he suffered when preparing the second edition of the descent of man but it was not granted to him to see this progress towards filling up the gaps in his edifice of which he was so painfully conscious he did however have the satisfaction of seeing his ideas steadily gaining ground notwithstanding much hostility and deeprooted prejudice even in the years between the appearance of the origin of species and of the first edition of the descent the idea of a natural descent of man which was only briefly indicated in the work of 1859 had been eagerly welcomed in some quarters it has been already pointed out how brilliantly huxley contributed to the defence and diffusion of darwins doctrines and how in mans place in nature he has given us a classic work as a foundation for the doctrine of the descent of man as huxley was darwins champion in england so in germany carl vogt in particular made himself master of the darwinian ideas but above all it was haeckel who in energy eagerness for battle and knowledge may be placed side by side with huxley who took over the leadership in the controversy over the new conception of the universe as far back as 1866 in his generelle morphologie he had inquired minutely into the question of the descent of man and not content with urging merely the general theory of descent from lower animal forms he drew up for the first time genealogical trees showing the close structural relationships of the different animal groups the last of these illustrated the relationships of mammals and among them of all groups of the primates including man it was haeckels genealogical trees that formed the basis of the special discussion of the relationships of man in the sixth chapter of darwins descent of man in the last section of this essay i shall return to haeckels conception of the special descent of man the main features of which he still upholds and rightly so haeckel has contributed more than any one else to the spread of the darwinian doctrine i can only allow myself a few words as to the spread of the theory of the natural descent of man in other countries the parisian anthropological school founded and guided by the genius of broca took up the idea of the descent of man and made many notable contributions to it broca manouvrier mahoudeau deniker and others in england itself darwins work did not die huxley took care of that for he with his lofty and unprejudiced mind dominated and inspired english biology until his death on june 29 1895 he had the satisfaction shortly before his death of learning of dubois discovery which he illustrated by a humourous sketch119 but there are still many followers in darwins footsteps in england keane has worked at the special genealogical tree of the primates keith has inquired which of the anthropoid apes has the greatest number of characters in common with man morris concerns himself with the evolution of man in general especially with his acquisition of the erect position the recent discoveries of pithecanthropus and homo primigenius are being vigorously discussed but the present writer is not in a position to form an opinion of the extent to which the idea of descent has penetrated throughout england generally in italy independent work in the domain of the descent of man is being produced especially by morselli with him are associated in the investigation of related problems sergi and giuffridaruggeri from the ranks of american investigators we may single out in particular the eminent geologist cope who championed with much decision the idea of the specific difference of homo neandertalensis primigenius and maintained a more direct descent of man from the fossil lemuridae in south america too in argentina new life is stirring in this department of science ameghino in buenos ayres has awakened the fossil primates of the pampas formation to new life he even believes that in his tetraprothomo represented by a femur he has discovered a direct ancestor of man lehmannnitsche is working at the other side of the gulf between apes and man and he describes a remarkable first cervical vertebra atlas from monte hermoso as belonging to a form which may bear the same relation to homo sapiens in south america as homo primigenius does in the old world after a minute investigation he establishes a human species homo neogaeus while ameghino ascribes this atlas vertebra to his tetraprothomo thus throughout the whole scientific world there is arising a new life an eager endeavour to get nearer to huxleys problema maximum to penetrate more deeply into the origin of the human race there are today very few experts in anatomy and zoology who deny the animal descent of man in general religious considerations old prejudices the reluctance to accept man who so far surpasses mentally all other creatures as descended from soulless animals prevent a few investigators from giving full adherence to the doctrine but there are very few of these who still postulate a special act of creation for man although the majority of experts in anatomy and zoology accept unconditionally the descent of man from lower forms there is much diversity of opinion among them in regard to the special line of descent in trying to establish any special hypothesis of descent whether by the graphic method of drawing up genealogical trees or otherwise let us always bear in mind darwins words120 and use them as a critical guiding line as we have no record of the lines of descent the pedigree can be discovered only by observing the degrees of resemblance between the beings which are to be classed darwin carries this further by stating that resemblances in several unimportant structures in useless and rudimentary organs or not now functionally active or in an embryological condition are by far the most serviceable for classification121 it has also to be remembered that numerous separate points of agreement are of much greater importance than the amount of similarity or dissimilarity in a few points the hypotheses as to descent current at the present day may be divided into two main groups the first group seeks for the roots of the human race not among any of the families of the apesthe anatomically nearest formsnor among their very similar but less specialised ancestral forms the fossil representatives of which we can know only in part but setting the monkeys on one side it seeks for them lower down among the fossil eocene pseudolemuridae or lemuridae cope or even among the primitive pentadactylous eocene forms which may either have led directly to the evolution of man adloff or have given rise to an ancestral form common to apes and men klaatsch122 giuffridaruggeri the common ancestral form from which man and apes are thus supposed to have arisen independently may explain the numerous resemblances which actually exist between them that is to say all the characters upon which the great structural resemblance between apes and man depends must have been present in their common ancestor let us take an example of such a common character the bony external earpassage is in general as highly developed in the lower eastern monkeys and the anthropoid apes as in man this character must therefore have already been present in the common primitive form in that case it is not easy to understand why the western monkeys have not also inherited the character instead of possessing only a tympanic ring but it becomes more intelligible if we assume that forms with a primitive tympanic ring were the original type and that from these were evolved on the one hand the existing new world monkeys with persistent tympanic ring and on the other an ancestral form common to the lower old world monkeys the anthropoid apes and man for man shares with these the character in question and it is also one of the unimportant characters required by darwin thus we have two divergent lines arising from the ancestral form the western monkeys platyrrhine on the one hand and an ancestral form common to the lower eastern monkeys the anthropoid apes and man on the other but considerations similar to those which showed it to be impossible that man should have developed from an ancestor common to him and the monkeys yet outside of and parallel with these may be urged also against the likelihood of a parallel evolution of the lower eastern monkeys the anthropoid apes and man the anthropoid apes have in common with man many characters which are not present in the lower old world monkeys these characters must therefore have been present in the ancestral form common to the three groups but here again it is difficult to understand why the lower eastern monkeys should not also have inherited these characters as this is not the case there remains no alternative but to assume divergent evolution from an indifferent form the lower eastern monkeys are carrying on the evolution in one directioni might almost say towards a blind alleywhile anthropoids and men have struck out a progressive path at first in common which explains the many points of resemblance between them without regarding man as derived directly from the anthropoids their many striking points of agreement indicate a common descent and cannot be explained as phenomena of convergence i believe i have shown in the above sketch that a theory which derives man directly from lower forms without regarding apes as transitiontypes leads ad absurdum the close structural relationship between man and monkeys can only be understood if both are brought into the same line of evolution to trace mans line of descent directly back to the old eocene mammals alongside of but with no relation to these very similar forms is to abandon the method of exact comparison which as darwin rightly recognised alone justifies us in drawing up genealogical trees on the basis of resemblances and differences the farther down we go the more does the ground slip from beneath our feet even the lemuridae show very numerous divergent conditions much more so the eocene mammals creodonta condylarthra the chief resemblance of which to man consists in the possession of pentadactylous hands and feet thus the farther course of the line of descent disappears in the darkness of the ancestry of the mammals with just as much reason we might pass by the vertebrates altogether and go back to the lower invertebrates but in that case it would be much easier to say that man has arisen independently and has evolved without relation to any animals from the lowest primitive form to his present isolated and dominant position but this would be to deny all value to classification which must after all be the ultimate basis of a genealogical tree we can as darwin rightly observed only infer the line of descent from the degree of resemblance between single forms if we regard man as directly derived from primitive forms very far back we have no way of explaining the many points of agreement between him and the monkeys in general and the anthropoid apes in particular these must remain an inexplicable marvel i have thus i trust shown that the first class of special theories of descent which assumes that man has developed parallel with the monkeys but without relation to them from very low primitive forms cannot be upheld because it fails to take into account the close structural affinity of man and monkeys i cannot but regard this hypothesis as lamentably retrograde for it makes impossible any application of the facts that have been discovered in the course of the anatomical and embryological study of man and monkeys and indeed prejudges investigations of that class as pointless the whole method is perverted an unjustifiable theory of descent is first formulated with the aid of the imagination and then we are asked to declare that all structural relations between man and monkeys and between the different groups of the latter are valuelessthe fact being that they are the only true basis on which a genealogical tree can be constructed so much for this most modern method of classification which has probably found adherents because it would deliver us from the relationship to apes which many people so much dislike in contrast to it we have the second class of special hypotheses of descent which keeps strictly to the nearest structural relationship this is the only basis that justifies the drawing up of a special hypothesis of descent if this fundamental proposition be recognised it will be admitted that the doctrine of special descent upheld by haeckel and set forth in darwins descent of man is still valid today in the genealogical tree mans place is quite close to the anthropoid apes these again have as their nearest relatives the lower old world monkeys and their progenitors must be sought among the less differentiated platyrrhine monkeys whose most important characters have been handed on to the present day new world monkeys how the different genera are to be arranged within the general scheme indicated depends in the main on the classificatory value attributed to individual characters this is particularly true in regard to pithecanthropus which i consider as the root of a branch which has sprung from the anthropoid ape root and has led up to man the latter i have designated the family of the hominidae for the rest there are as we have said various possible ways of constructing the narrower genealogy within the limits of this branch including men and apes and these methods will probably continue to change with the accumulation of new facts haeckel himself has modified his genealogical tree of the primates in certain details since the publication of his generelle morphologie in 1866 but its general basis remains the same123 all the special genealogical trees drawn up on the lines laid down by haeckel and darwinand that of dubois may be specially mentionedare based in general on the close relationship of monkeys and men although they may vary in detail various hypotheses have been formulated on these lines with special reference to the evolution of man pithecanthropus is regarded by some authorities as the direct ancestor of man by others as a sidetrack failure in the attempt at the evolution of man the problem of the monophyletic or polyphyletic origin of the human race has also been much discussed sergi124 inclines towards the assumption of a polyphyletic origin of the three main races of man the african primitive form of which has given rise also to the gorilla and chimpanzee the asiatic to the orang the gibbon and pithecanthropus kollmann regards existing human races as derived from small primitive races pigmies and considers that homo primigenius must have arisen in a secondary and degenerative manner but this is not the place nor have i the space to criticise the various special theories of descent one however must receive particular notice according to ameghino the south american monkeys pitheculites from the oldest tertiary of the pampas are the forms from which have arisen the existing american monkeys on the one hand and on the other the extinct south american homunculidae which are also small forms from these last anthropoid apes and man have he believes been evolved among the progenitors of man ameghino reckons the form discovered by him tetraprothomo from which a south american primitive man homo pampaeus might be directly evolved while on the other hand all the lower old world monkeys may have arisen from older fossil south american forms clenialitidae the distribution of which may be explained by the bridge formerly existing between south america and africa as may be the derivation of all existing human races from homo pampaeus125 the fossil forms discovered by ameghino deserve the most minute investigation as does also the fossil man from south america of which lehmannnitsche126 has made a thorough study it is obvious that notwithstanding the necessity for fitting mans line of descent into the genealogical tree of the primates especially the apes opinions in regard to it differ greatly in detail this could not be otherwise since the different primate forms especially the fossile forms are still far from being exhaustively known but one thing remains certainthe idea of the close relationship between man and monkeys set forth in darwins descent of man only those who deny the many points of agreement the sole basis of classification and thus of a natural genealogical tree can look upon the position of darwin and haeckel as antiquated or as standing on an insufficient foundation for such a genealogical tree is nothing more than a summarised representation of what is known in regard to the degree of resemblance between the different forms darwins work in regard to the descent of man has not been surpassed the more we immerse ourselves in the study of the structural relationships between apes and man the more is our path illumined by the clear light radiating from him and through his calm and deliberate investigation based on a mass of material in the accumulation of which he has never had an equal darwins fame will be bound up for all time with the unprejudiced investigation of the question of all questions the descent of the human race footnotes

university of jena the great advance that anthropology has made in the second half of the nineteenth century is due in the first place to darwins discovery of the origin of man no other problem in the whole field of research is so momentous as that of mans place in nature which was justly described by huxley 1863 as the most fundamental of all questions yet the scientific solution of this problem was impossible until the theory of descent had been established it is now a hundred years since the great french biologist jean lamarck published his philosophie zoologique by a remarkable coincidence the year in which that work was issued 1809 was the year of the birth of his most distinguished successor charles darwin lamarck had already recognised that the descent of man from a series of other vertebratesthat is from a series of apelike primateswas essentially involved in the general theory of transformation which he had erected on a broad inductive basis and he had sufficient penetration to detect the agencies that had been at work in the evolution of the erect bimanous man from the arboreal and quadrumanous ape he had however few empirical arguments to advance in support of his hypothesis and it could not be established until the further development of the biological sciencesthe founding of comparative embryology by baer 1828 and of the celltheory by schleiden and schwann 1838 the advance of physiology under johannes mller 1833 and the enormous progress of palaeontology and comparative anatomy between 1820 and 1860provided this necessary foundation darwin was the first to coordinate the ample results of these lines of research with no less comprehensiveness than discrimination he consolidated them as a basis of a modified theory of descent and associated with them his own theory of natural selection which we take to be distinctive of darwinism in the stricter sense the illuminating truth of these cumulative arguments was so great in every branch of biology that in spite of the most vehement opposition the battle was won within a single decade and darwin secured the general admiration and recognition that had been denied to his forerunner lamarck up to the hour of his death 1829 before however we consider the momentous influence that darwinism has had in anthropology we shall find it useful to glance at its history in the course of the last half century and notice the various theories that have contributed to its advance the first attempt to give extensive expression to the reform of biology by darwins work will be found in my generelle morphologie 1866127 which was followed by a more popular treatment of the subject in my natrliche schpfungsgeschichte 1868128 a compilation from the earlier work in the first volume of the generelle morphologie i endeavoured to show the great importance of evolution in settling the fundamental questions of biological philosophy especially in regard to comparative anatomy in the second volume i dealt broadly with the principle of evolution distinguishing ontogeny and phylogeny as its two coordinate main branches and associating the two in the biogenetic law the law may be formulated thus ontogeny embryology or the development of the individual is a concise and compressed recapitulation of phylogeny the palaeontological or genealogical series conditioned by laws of heredity and adaptation the systematic introduction to general evolution with which the second volume of the generelle morphologie opens was the first attempt to draw up a natural system of organisms in harmony with the principles of lamarck and darwin in the form of a hypothetical pedigree and was provisionally set forth in eight genealogical tables in the nineteenth chapter of the generelle morphologiea part of which has been republished without any alteration after a lapse of forty yearsi made a critical study of lamarcks theory of descent and of darwins theory of selection and endeavoured to bring the complex phenomena of heredity and adaptation under definite laws for the first time heredity i divided into conservative and progressive adaptation into indirect or potential and direct or actual i then found it possible to give some explanation of the correlation of the two physiological functions in the struggle for life selection and to indicate the important laws of divergence or differentiation and complexity or division of labor which are the direct and inevitable outcome of selection finally i marked off dysteleology as the science of the aimless vestigial abortive atrophied and useless organs and parts of the body in all this i worked from a strictly monistic standpoint and sought to explain all biological phenomena on the mechanical and naturalistic lines that had long been recognised in the study of inorganic nature then 1866 as now being convinced of the unity of nature the fundamental identity of the agencies at work in the inorganic and the organic worlds i discarded vitalism teleology and all hypotheses of a mystic character it was clear from the first that it was essential in the monistic conception of evolution to distinguish between the laws of conservative and progressive heredity conservative heredity maintains from generation to generation the enduring characters of the species each organism transmits to its descendants a part of the morphological and physiological qualities that it has received from its parents and ancestors on the other hand progressive heredity brings new characters to the speciescharacters that were not found in preceding generations each organism may transmit to its offspring a part of the morphological and physiological features that it has itself acquired by adaptation in the course of its individual career through the use or disuse of particular organs the influence of environment climate nutrition etc at that time i gave the name of progressive heredity to this inheritance of acquired characters as a short and convenient expression but have since changed the term to transformative heredity as distinguished from conservative this term is preferable as inherited regressive modifications degeneration retrograde metamorphosis etc come under the same head transformative heredityor the transmission of acquired charactersis one of the most important principles in evolutionary science unless we admit it most of the facts of comparative anatomy and physiology are inexplicable that was the conviction of darwin no less than of lamarck of spencer as well as virchow of huxley as well as gegenbaur indeed of the great majority of speculative biologists this fundamental principle was for the first time called in question and assailed in 1885 by august weismann of freiburg the eminent zoologist to whom the theory of evolution owes a great deal of valuable support and who has attained distinction by his extension of the theory of selection in explanation of the phenomena of heredity he introduced a new theory the theory of the continuity of the germplasm according to him the living substance in all organisms consists of two quite distinct kinds of plasm somatic and germinal the permanent germplasm or the active substance of the two germcells eggcell and spermcell passes unchanged through a series of generations and is not affected by environmental influences the environment modifies only the somaplasm the organs and tissues of the body the modifications that these parts undergo through the influence of the environment or their own activity use and habit do not affect the germplasm and cannot therefore be transmitted this theory of the continuity of the germplasm has been expounded by weismann during the last twentyfour years in a number of able volumes and is regarded by many biologists such as mr francis galton sir e ray lankester and professor j arthur thomson who has recently made a thoroughgoing defence of it in his important work heredity129 as the most striking advance in evolutionary science on the other hand the theory has been rejected by herbert spencer sir w turner gegenbaur klliker hertwig and many others for my part i have with all respect for the distinguished darwinian contested the theory from the first because its whole foundation seems to me erroneous and its deductions do not seem to be in accord with the main facts of comparative morphology and physiology weismanns theory in its entirety is a finely conceived molecular hypothesis but it is devoid of empirical basis the notion of the absolute and permanent independence of the germplasm as distinguished from the somaplasm is purely speculative as is also the theory of germinal selection the determinants ids and idants are purely hypothetical elements the experiments that have been devised to demonstrate their existence really prove nothing it seems to me quite improper to describe this hypothetical structure as neodarwinism darwin was just as convinced as lamarck of the transmission of acquired characters and its great importance in the scheme of evolution i had the good fortune to visit darwin at down three times and discuss with him the main principles of his system and on each occasion we were fully agreed as to the incalculable importance of what i may call transformative inheritance it is only proper to point out that weismanns theory of the germplasm is in express contradiction to the fundamental principles of darwin and lamarck nor is it more acceptable in what one may call its ultradarwinismthe idea that the theory of selection explains everything in the evolution of the organic world this belief in the omnipotence of natural selection was not shared by darwin himself assuredly i regard it as of the utmost value as the process of natural selection through the struggle for life affords an explanation of the mechanical origin of the adapted organisation it solves the great problem how could the finely adapted structure of the animal or plant body be formed unless it was built on a preconceived plan it thus enables us to dispense with the teleology of the metaphysician and the dualist and to set aside the old mythological and poetic legends of creation the idea had occurred in vague form to the great empedocles 2000 years before the time of darwin but it was reserved for modern research to give it ample expression nevertheless natural selection does not of itself give the solution of all our evolutionary problems it has to be taken in conjunction with the transformism of lamarck with which it is in complete harmony the monumental greatness of charles darwin who surpasses every other student of science in the nineteenth century by the loftiness of his monistic conception of nature and the progressive influence of his ideas is perhaps best seen in the fact that not one of his many successors has succeeded in modifying his theory of descent in any essential point or in discovering an entirely new standpoint in the interpretation of the organic world neither ngeli nor weismann neither de vries nor roux has done this ngeli in his mechanischphysiologische theorie der abstammungslehre130 which is to a great extent in agreement with weismann constructed a theory of the idioplasm that represents it like the germplasm as developing continuously in a definite direction from internal causes but his internal principle of progress is at the bottom just as teleological as the vital force of the vitalists and the micella structure of the idioplasm is just as hypothetical as the dominant structure of the germplasm in 1889 moritz wagner sought to explain the origin of species by migration and isolation and on that basis constructed a special migrationtheory this however is not out of harmony with the theory of selection it merely elevates one single factor in the theory to a predominant position isolation is only a special case of selection as i had pointed out in the fifteenth chapter of my natural history of creation the mutationtheory of de vries131 that would explain the origin of species by sudden and saltatory variations rather than by gradual modification is regarded by many botanists as a great step in advance but it is generally rejected by zoologists it affords no explanation of the facts of adaptation and has no causal value much more important than these theories is that of wilhelm roux132 of the struggle of parts within the organism a supplementation of the theory of mechanical adaptation he explains the functional autoformation of the purposive structure by a combination of darwins principle of selection with lamarcks idea of transformative heredity and applies the two in conjunction to the facts of histology he lays stress on the significance of functional adaptation which i had described in 1866 under the head of cumulative adaptation as the most important factor in evolution pointing out its influence in the celllife of the tissues he puts cellular selection above personal selection and shows how the finest conceivable adaptations in the structure of the tissue may be brought about quite mechanically without preconceived plan this mechanical teleology is a valuable extension of darwins monistic principle of selection to the whole field of cellular physiology and histology and is wholly destructive of dualistic vitalism the most important advance that evolution has made since darwin and the most valuable amplification of his theory of selection is in my opinion the work of richard semon die mneme als erhaltendes prinzip im wechsel des organischen geschehens133 he offers a psychological explanation of the facts of heredity by reducing them to a process of unconscious memory the physiologist ewald hering had shown in 1870 that memory must be regarded as a general function of organic matter and that we are quite unable to explain the chief vital phenomena especially those of reproduction and inheritance unless we admit this unconscious memory in my essay die perigenesis der plastidule134 i elaborated this farreaching idea and applied the physical principle of transmitted motion to the plastidules or active molecules of plasm i concluded that heredity is the memory of the plastidules and variability their power of comprehension this provisional attempt to give a mechanical explanation of the elementary processes of evolution i afterwards extended by showing that sensitiveness is as carl ngeli ernst mach and albrecht rau express it a general quality of matter this form of panpsychism finds its simplest expression in the trinity of substance to the two fundamental attributes that spinoza ascribed to substanceextension matter as occupying space and cogitation energy forcewe now add the third fundamental quality of psychoma sensitiveness soul i further elaborated this trinitarian conception of substance in the nineteenth chapter of my die lebenswunder 1904135 and it seems to me well calculated to afford a monistic solution of many of the antitheses of philosophy this important mnemetheory of semon and the luminous physiological experiments and observations associated with it not only throw considerable light on transformative inheritance but provide a sound physiological foundation for the biogenetic law i had endeavoured to show in 1874 in the first chapter of my anthropogenie136 that this fundamental law of organic evolution holds good generally and that there is everywhere a direct causal connection between ontogeny and phylogeny phylogenesis is the mechanical cause of ontogenesis in other words the evolution of the stem or race isin accordance with the laws of heredity and adaptationthe real cause of all the changes that appear in a condensed form in the development of the individual organism from the ovum in either the embryo or the larva it is now fifty years since charles darwin pointed out in the thirteenth chapter of his epochmaking origin of species the fundamental importance of embryology in connection with his theory of descent the leading facts in embryology which are second to none in importance are explained on the principle of variations in the many descendants from some one ancient progenitor having appeared at a not very early period of life and having been inherited at a corresponding period137 he then shows that the striking resemblance of the embryos and larvae of closely related animals which in the mature stage belong to widely different species and genera can only be explained by their descent from a common progenitor fritz mller made a closer study of these important phenomena in the instructive instance of the crustacean larva as given in his able work fr darwin138 1864 i then in 1872 extended the range so as to include all animals with the exception of the unicellular protozoa and showed by means of the theory of the gastraea that all multicellular tissueforming animalsall the metazoadevelop in essentially the same way from the primary germlayers i conceived the embryonic form in which the whole structure consists of only two layers of cells and is known as the gastrula to be the ontogenetic recapitulation maintained by tenacious heredity of a primitive common progenitor of all the metazoa the gastraea at a later date 1895 monticelli discovered that this conjectural ancestral form is still preserved in certain primitive coelenteratapemmatodiscus kunstleria and the nearlyrelated orthonectida the general application of the biogenetic law to all classes of animals and plants has been proved in my systematische phylogenie139 it has however been frequently challenged both by botanists and zoologists chiefly owing to the fact that many have failed to distinguish its two essential elements palingenesis and cenogenesis as early as 1874 i had emphasised in the first chapter of my evolution of man the importance of discriminating carefully between these two sets of phenomena in the evolutionary appreciation of the facts of embryology we must take particular care to distinguish sharply and clearly between the primary palingenetic evolutionary processes and the secondary cenogenetic processes the palingenetic phenomena or embryonic recapitulations are due to heredity to the transmission of characters from one generation to another they enable us to draw direct inferences in regard to corresponding structures in the development of the species eg the chorda or the branchial arches in all vertebrate embryos the cenogenetic phenomena on the other hand or the embryonic variations cannot be traced to inheritance from a mature ancestor but are due to the adaption of the embryo or the larva to certain conditions of its individual development eg the amnion the allantois and the vitelline arteries in the embryos of the higher vertebrates these cenogenetic phenomena are later additions we must not infer from them that there were corresponding processes in the ancestral history and hence they are apt to mislead the fundamental importance of these facts of comparative anatomy atavism and the rudimentary organs was pointed out by darwin in the first part of his classic work the descent of man and selection in relation to sex 1871140 in the general summary and conclusion chap xxi he was able to say with perfect justice he who is not content to look like a savage at the phenomena of nature as disconnected cannot any longer believe that man is the work of a separate act of creation he will be forced to admit that the close resemblance of the embryo of man to that for instance of a dogthe construction of his skull limbs and whole frame on the same plan with that of other mammals independently of the uses to which the parts may be putthe occasional reappearance of various structures for instance of several muscles which man does not normally possess but which are common to the quadrumanaand a crowd of analogous factsall point in the plainest manner to the conclusion that man is the codescendant with other mammals of a common progenitor these few lines of darwins have a greater scientific value than hundreds of those socalled anthropological treatises which give detailed descriptions of single organs or mathematical tables with series of numbers and what are claimed to be exact analyses but are devoid of synoptic conclusions and a philosophical spirit charles darwin is not generally recognised as a great anthropologist nor does the school of modern anthropologists regard him as a leading authority in germany especially the great majority of the members of the anthropological societies took up an attitude of hostility to him from the very beginning of the controversy in 1860 the descent of man was not merely rejected but even the discussion of it was forbidden on the ground that it was unscientific the centre of this inveterate hostility for thirty yearsespecially after 1877was rudolph virchow of berlin the leading investigator in pathological anatomy who did so much for the reform of medicine by his establishment of cellular pathology in 1858 as a prominent representative of exact or descriptive anthropology and lacking a broad equipment in comparative anatomy and ontogeny he was unable to accept the theory of descent in earlier years and especially during his splendid period of activity at wrzburg 18481856 he had been a consistent freethinker and had in a number of able articles collected in his gesammelte abhandlungen141 upheld the unity of human nature the inseparability of body and spirit in later years at berlin where he was more occupied with political work and sociology especially after 1866 he abandoned the positive monistic position for one of agnosticism and scepticism and made concessions to the dualistic dogma of a spiritual world apart from the material frame in the course of a scientific congress at munich in 1877 the conflict of these antithetic views of nature came into sharp relief at this memorable congress i had undertaken to deliver the first address september 18th on the subject of modern evolution in relation to the whole of science i maintained that darwins theory not only solved the great problem of the origin of species but that its implications especially in regard to the nature of man threw considerable light on the whole of science and on anthropology in particular the discovery of the real origin of man by evolution from a long series of mammal ancestors threw light on his place in nature in every respect as huxley had already shown in his excellent lectures of 1863 just as all the organs and tissues of the human body had originated from those of the nearest related mammals certain apelike forms so we were bound to conclude that his mental qualities also had been derived from those of his extinct primate ancestor this monistic view of the origin and nature of man which is now admitted by nearly all who have the requisite acquaintance with biology and approach the subject without prejudice encountered a sharp opposition at that time the opposition found its strongest expression in an address that virchow delivered at munich four days afterwards september 22nd on the freedom of science in the modern state he spoke of the theory of evolution as an unproved hypothesis and declared that it ought not to be taught in the schools because it was dangerous to the state we must not he said teach that man has descended from the ape or any other animal when darwin usually so lenient in his judgment read the english translation of virchows speech he expressed his disapproval in strong terms but the great authority that virchow hadan authority well founded in pathology and sociologyand his prestige as president of the german anthropological society had the effect of preventing any member of the society from raising serious opposition to him for thirty years numbers of journals and treatises repeated his dogmatic statement it is quite certain that man has descended neither from the ape nor from any other animal in this he persisted till his death in 1902 since that time the whole position of german anthropology has changed the question is no longer whether man was created by a distinct supernatural act or evolved from other mammals but to which line of the animal hierarchy we must look for the actual series of ancestors the interested reader will find an account of this battle of munich 1877 in my three berlin lectures april 1905 der kampf um die entwickelungsgedanken142 the main points in our genealogical tree were clearly recognised by darwin in the sixth chapter of the descent of man lowly organised fishes like the lancelot amphioxus are descended from lower invertebrates resembling the larvae of an existing tunicate appendicularia from these primitive fishes were evolved higher fishes of the ganoid type and others of the type of lepidosiren dipneusta it is a very small step from these to the amphibia in the class of animals the steps are not difficult to conceive which led from the ancient monotremata to the ancient marsupials and from these to the early progenitors of the placental mammals we may thus ascend to the lemuridae and the interval is not very wide from these to the simiadae the simiadae then branched off into two great stems the new world and old world monkeys and from the latter at a remote period man the wonder and glory of the universe proceeded143 in these few lines darwin clearly indicated the way in which we were to conceive our ancestral series within the vertebrates it is fully confirmed by all the arguments of comparative anatomy and embryology of palaeontology and physiology and all the research of the subsequent forty years have gone to establish it the deep interest in geology which darwin maintained throughout his life and his complete knowledge of palaeontology enabled him to grasp the fundamental importance of the palaeontological record more clearly than anthropologists and zoologists usually do there has been much debate in subsequent decades whether darwin himself maintained that man was descended from the ape and many writers have sought to deny it but the lines i have quoted verbatim from the conclusion of the sixth chapter of the descent of man 1871 leave no doubt that he was as firmly convinced of it as was his great precursor jean lamarck in 1809 moreover darwin adds with particular explicitness in the general summary and conclusion chap xxi of that standard work144 by considering the embryological structure of manthe homologies which he presents with the lower animalsthe rudiments which he retainsand the reversions to which he is liable we can partly recall in imagination the former condition of our early progenitors and can approximately place them in their proper place in the zoological series we thus learn that man is descended from a hairy tailed quadruped probably arboreal in its habits and an inhabitant of the old world this creature if its whole structure had been examined by a naturalist would have been classed amongst the quadrumana as surely as the still more ancient progenitor of the old and new world monkeys these clear and definite lines leave no doubt that darwinso critical and cautious in regard to important conclusionswas quite as firmly convinced of the descent of man from the apes the catarrhinae in particular as lamarck was in 1809 and huxley in 1863 it is to be noted particularly that in these and other observations on the subject darwin decidedly assumes the monophyletic origin of the mammals including man it is my own conviction that this is of the greatest importance a number of difficult questions in regard to the development of man in respect of anatomy physiology psychology and embryology are easily settled if we do not merely extend our progonotaxis to our nearest relatives the anthropoid apes and the tailed monkeys from which these have descended but go further back and find an ancestor in the group of the lemuridae and still further back to the marsupials and monotremata the essential identity of all the mammals in point of anatomical structure and embryonic developmentin spite of their astonishing differences in external appearance and habits of lifeis so palpably significant that modern zoologists are agreed in the hypothesis that they have all sprung from a common root and that this root may be sought in the earlier palaeozoic amphibia the fundamental importance of this comparative morphology of the mammals as a sound basis of scientific anthropology was recognised just before the beginning of the nineteenth century when lamarck first emphasised 1794 the division of the animal kingdom into vertebrates and invertebrates even thirteen years earlier 1781 when goethe made a close study of the mammal skeleton in the anatomical institute at jena he was intensely interested to find that the composition of the skull was the same in man as in the other mammals his discovery of the os intermaxillare in man 1784 which was contradicted by most of the anatomists of the time and his ingenious vertebral theory of the skull were the splendid fruit of his morphological studies they remind us how germanys greatest philosopher and poet was for many years ardently absorbed in the comparative anatomy of man and the mammals and how he divined that their wonderful identity in structure was no mere superficial resemblance but pointed to a deep internal connection in my generelle morphologie 1866 in which i published the first attempts to construct phylogenetic trees i have given a number of remarkable theses of goethe which may be called phyletic prophecies they justify us in regarding him as a precursor of darwin in the ensuing forty years i have made many conscientious efforts to penetrate further along that line of anthropological research that was opened up by goethe lamarck and darwin i have brought together the many valuable results that have constantly been reached in comparative anatomy physiology ontogeny and palaeontology and maintained the effort to reform the classification of animals and plants in an evolutionary sense the first rough drafts of pedigrees that were published in the generelle morphologie have been improved time after time in the ten editions of my natrlich schpfungsgeschichte 18681902145 a sounded basis for my phyletic hypotheses derived from a discriminating combination of the three great recordsmorphology ontogeny and palaeontologywas provided in the three volumes of my systematische phylogenie146 1894 protists and plants 1895 vertebrates 1896 invertebrates in my anthropogenie147 i endeavoured to employ all the known facts of comparative ontogeny embryology for the purpose of completing my scheme of human phylogeny evolution i attempted to sketch the historical development of each organ of the body beginning with the most elementary structures in the germlayers of the gastraea at the same time i drew up a corrected statement of the most important steps in the line of our ancestral series at the fourth international congress of zoology at cambridge august 26th 1898 i delivered an address on our present knowledge of the descent of man it was translated into english enriched with many valuable notes and additions by my friend and pupil in earlier days dr hans gadow cambridge and published under the title the last link our present knowledge of the descent of man148 the determination of the chief animal forms that occur in the line of our ancestry is there restricted to thirty types and these are distributed in six main groups the first half of this progonotaxis hominis which has no support from fossil evidence comprises three groups i protista unicellular organisms 15 ii invertebrate metazoa coelenteria 68 vermalia 911 iii monorrhine vertebrates acrania 1213 cyclostoma 1415 the second half which is based on fossil records also comprises three groups iv palaeozoic coldblooded craniota fishes 1618 amphibia 19 reptiles 20 v mesozoic mammals monotrema 21 marsupialia 22 mallotheria 23 vi cenozoic primates lemuridae 2425 tailed apes 2627 anthropomorpha 2830 an improved and enlarged edition of this hypothetic progonotaxis hominis was published in 1908 in my essay unsere ahnenreihe149 if i have succeeded in furthering in some degree by these anthropological works the solution of the great problem of mans place in nature and particularly in helping to trace the definite stages in our ancestral series i owe the success not merely to the vast progress that biology has made in the last half century but largely to the luminous example of the great investigators who have applied themselves to the problem with so much assiduity and genius for a century and a quarteri mean goethe and lamarck gegenbaur and huxley but above all charles darwin it was the great genius of darwin that first brought together that symmetrical temple of scientific knowledge the theory of descent it was darwin who put the crown on the edifice by his theory of natural selection not until this broad inductive law was firmly established was it possible to vindicate the special conclusion the descent of man from a series of other vertebrates by his illuminating discovery darwin did more for anthropology than thousands of those writers who are more specifically titled anthropologists have done by their technical treatises we may indeed say that it is not merely as an exact observer and ingenious experimenter but as a distinguished anthropologist and farseeing thinker that darwin takes his place among the greatest men of science of the nineteenth century to appreciate fully the immortal merit of darwin in connection with anthropology we must remember that not only did his chief work the origin of species which opened up a new era in natural history in 1859 sustain the most virulent and widespread opposition for a lengthy period but even thirty years later when its principles were generally recognised and adopted the application of them to man was energetically contested by many high scientific authorities even alfred russel wallace who discovered the principle of natural selection independently in 1858 did not concede that it was applicable to the higher mental and moral qualities of man dr wallace still holds a spiritualist and dualist view of the nature of man contending that he is composed of a material frame descended from the apes and an immortal immaterial soul infused by a higher power this dual conception moreover is still predominant in the wide circles of modern theology and metaphysics and has the general and influential adherence of the more conservative classes of society in strict contradiction to this mystical dualism which is generally connected with teleology and vitalism darwin always maintained the complete unity of human nature and showed convincingly that the psychological side of man was developed in the same way as the body from the less advanced soul of the anthropoid ape and at a still more remote period from the cerebral functions of the older vertebrates the eighth chapter of the origin of species which is devoted to instinct contains weighty evidence that the instincts of animals are subject like all other vital processes to the general laws of historic development the special instincts of particular species were formed by adaptation and the modifications thus acquired were handed on to posterity by heredity in their formation and preservation natural selection plays the same part as in the transformation of every other physiological function the higher moral qualities of civilised man have been derived from the lower mental functions of the uncultivated barbarians and savages and these in turn from the social instincts of the mammals this natural and monistic psychology of darwins was afterwards more fully developed by his friend george romanes in his excellent works mental evolution in animals and mental evolution in man150 many valuable and most interesting contributions to this monistic psychology of man were made by darwin in his fine work on the descent of man and selection in relation to sex and again in his supplementary work the expression of the emotions in man and animals to understand the historical development of darwins anthropology one must read his life and the introduction to the descent of man from the moment that he was convinced of the truth of the principle of descentthat is to say from his thirtieth year in 1838he recognised clearly that man could not be excluded from its range he recognised as a logical necessity the important conclusion that man is the codescendant with other species of some ancient lower and extinct form for many years he gathered notes and arguments in support of this thesis and for the purpose of showing the probable line of mans ancestry but in the first edition of the origin of species 1859 he restricted himself to the single line that by this work light would be thrown on the origin of man and his history in the fifty years that have elapsed since that time the science of the origin and nature of man has made astonishing progress and we are now fairly agreed in a monistic conception of nature that regards the whole universe including man as a wonderful unity governed by unalterable and eternal laws in my philosophical book die weltrtsel 1899151 and in the supplementary volume die lebenswunder 1904152 i have endeavoured to show that this pure monism is securely established and that the admission of the allpowerful rule of the same principle of evolution throughout the universe compels us to formulate a single supreme lawthe allembracing law of substance or the united laws of the constancy of matter and the conservation of energy we should never have reached this supreme general conception if charles darwina monistic philosopher in the true sense of the wordhad not prepared the way by his theory of descent by natural selection and crowned the great work of his life by the association of this theory with a naturalistic anthropology footnotes footnote 127 generelle morphologie der organismen 2 vols berlin 1866 footnote 128 eng transl the history of creation london 1876 footnote 129

factors in evolution by c lloyd morgan lld frs in developing his conception of organic evolution charles darwin was of necessity brought into contact with some of the problems of mental evolution in the origin of species he devoted a chapter to the diversities of instinct and of the other mental faculties in animals of the same class153 when he passed to the detailed consideration of the descent of man it was part of his object to show that there is no fundamental difference between man and the higher mammals in their mental faculties154 if no organic being excepting man he said had possessed any mental power or if his powers had been of a wholly different nature from those of the lower animals then we should never have been able to convince ourselves that our high faculties had been gradually developed155 in his discussion of the expression of the emotions it was important for his purpose fully to recognise that actions readily become associated with other actions and with various states of the mind156 his hypothesis of sexual selection is largely dependent upon the exercise of choice on the part of the female and her preference for not only the more attractive but at the same time the more vigourous and vicious males157 mental processes and physiological processes were for darwin closely correlated and he accepted the conclusion that the nervous system not only regulates most of the existing functions of the body but has indirectly influenced the progressive development of various bodily structures and of certain mental qualities158 throughout his treatment mental evolution was for darwin incidental to and contributory to organic evolution for specialised research in comparative and genetic psychology as an independent field of investigation he had neither the time nor the requisite training none the less his writings and the spirit of his work have exercised a profound influence on this department of evolutionary thought and for those who follow darwins lead mental evolution is still in a measure subservient to organic evolution mental processes are the accompaniments or concomitants of the functional activity of specially differentiated parts of the organism they are in some way dependent on physiological and physical conditions but though they are not physical in their nature and though it is difficult or impossible to conceive that they are physical in their origin they are for darwin and his followers factors in the evolutionary process in its physical or organic aspect by the physiologist within his special and welldefined universe of discourse they may be properly regarded as epiphenomena but by the naturalist in his more catholic survey of nature they cannot be so regarded and were not so regarded by darwin intelligence has contributed to evolution of which it is in a sense a product the facts of observation or of inference which darwin accepted are these conscious experience accompanies some of the modes of animal behaviour it is concomitant with certain physiological processes these processes are the outcome of development in the individual and evolution in the race the accompanying mental processes undergo a like development into the subtle philosophical questions which arise out of the nave acceptance of such a creed it was not darwins province to enter i have nothing to do he said159 with the origin of the mental powers any more than i have with that of life itself he dealt with the natural history of organisms including not only their structure but their modes of behaviour with the natural history of the states of consciousness which accompany some of their actions and with the relation of behaviour to experience we will endeavour to follow darwin in his modesty and candour in making no pretence to give ultimate explanations but we must note one of the implications of this selfdenying ordinance of science development and evolution imply continuity for darwin and his followers the continuity is organic through physical heredity apart from speculative hypothesis legitimate enough in its proper place but here out of court we know nothing of continuity of mental evolution as such consciousness appears afresh in each succeeding generation hence it is that for those who follow darwins lead mental evolution is and must ever be within his universe of discourse subservient to organic evolution only in so far as conscious experience or its neural correlate effects some changes in organic structure can it influence the course of heredity and conversely only in so far as changes in organic structure are transmitted through heredity is mental evolution rendered possible such is the logical outcome of darwins teaching those who abide by the cardinal results of this teaching are bound to regard all behaviour as the expression of the functional activities of the living tissues of the organism and all conscious experience as correlated with such activities for the purposes of scientific treatment mental processes are one mode of expression of the same changes of which the physiological processes accompanying behaviour are another mode of expression this is simply accepted as a fact which others may seek to explain the behaviour itself is the adaptive application of the energies of the organism it is called forth by some form of presentation or stimulation brought to bear on the organism by the environment this presentation is always an individual or personal matter but in order that the organism may be fitted to respond to the presentation of the environment it must have undergone in some way a suitable preparation according to the theory of evolution this preparation is primarily racial and is transmitted through heredity darwins main thesis was that the method of preparation is predominantly by natural selection subordinate to racial preparation and always dependent thereon is individual or personal preparation through some kind of acquisition of which the guidance of behaviour through individually won experience is a typical example we here introduce the mental factor because the facts seem to justify the inference thus there are some modes of behaviour which are wholly and solely dependent upon inherited racial preparation there are other modes of behaviour which are also dependent in part at least on individual preparation in the former case the behaviour is adaptive on the first occurrence of the appropriate presentation in the latter case accommodation to circumstances is only reached after a greater or less amount of acquired organic modification of structure often accompanied as we assume in the higher animals by acquired experience logically and biologically the two classes of behaviour are clearly distinguishable but the analysis of complex cases of behaviour where the two factors coperate is difficult and requires careful and critical study of lifehistory the foundations of the mental life are laid in the conscious experience that accompanies those modes of behaviour dependent entirely on racial preparation which may broadly be described as instinctive in the eighth chapter of the origin of species darwin says160 i will not attempt any definition of instinct every one understands what is meant when it is said that instinct impels the cuckoo to migrate and to lay her eggs in other birds nests an action which we ourselves require experience to enable us to perform when performed by an animal more especially by a very young one without experience and when performed by many individuals in the same way without their knowing for what purpose it is performed is usually said to be instinctive and in the summary at the close of the chapter he says161 i have endeavoured briefly to show that the mental qualities of our domestic animals vary and that the variations are inherited still more briefly i have attempted to show that instincts vary slightly in a state of nature no one will dispute that instincts are of the highest importance to each animal therefore there is no real difficulty under changing conditions of life in natural selection accumulating to any extent slight modifications of instinct which are in any way useful in many cases habit or use and disuse have probably come into play into the details of darwins treatment there is neither space nor need to enter there are some ambiguous passages but it may be said that for him as for his followers today instinctive behaviour is wholly the result of racial preparation transmitted through organic heredity for the performance of the instinctive act no individual preparation under the guidance of personal experience is necessary it is true that darwin quotes with approval hubers saying that a little dose of judgment or reason often comes into play even with animals low in the scale of nature162 but we may fairly interpret his meaning to be that in behaviour which is commonly called instinctive some element of intelligent guidance is often combined if this be conceded the strictly instinctive performance or part of the performance is the outcome of heredity and due to the direct transmission of parental or ancestral aptitudes hence the instinctive response as such depends entirely on how the nervous mechanism has been built up through heredity while intelligent behaviour or the intelligent factor in behaviour depends also on how the nervous mechanism has been modified and moulded by use during its development and concurrently with the growth of individual experience in the customary situations of daily life of course it is essential to the darwinian thesis that what sir e ray lankester has termed educability not less than instinct is hereditary but it is also essential to the understanding of this thesis that the differentiae of the hereditary factor should be clearly grasped for darwin there were two modes of racial preparation 1 natural selection and 2 the establishment of individually acquired habit he showed that instincts are subject to hereditary variation he saw that instincts are also subject to modification through acquisition in the course of individual life he believed that not only the variations but also to some extent the modifications are inherited he therefore held that some instincts the greater number are due to natural selection but that others less numerous are due or partly due to the inheritance of acquired habits the latter involve lamarckian inheritance which of late years has been the centre of so much controversy it is noteworthy however that darwin laid especial emphasis on the fact that many of the most typical and also the most complex instinctsthose of neuter insectsdo not admit of such an interpretation i am surprised he says163 that no one has hitherto advanced this demonstrative case of neuter insects against the wellknown doctrine of inherited habit as advanced by lamarck none the less darwin admitted this doctrine as supplementary to that which was more distinctively his ownfor example in the case of the instincts of domesticated animals still even in such cases it may be doubted he says164 whether any one would have thought of training a dog to point had not some one dog naturally shown a tendency in this line so that habit and some degree of selection have probably concurred in civilising by inheritance our dogs but in the interpretation of the instincts of domesticated animals a more recently suggested hypothesis that of organic selection165 may be helpful according to this hypothesis any intelligent modification of behaviour which is subject to selection is probably coincident in direction with an inherited tendency to behave in this fashion hence in such behaviour there are two factors 1 an incipient variation in the line of such behaviour and 2 an acquired modification by which the behaviour is carried further along the same line under natural selection those organisms in which the two factors coperate are likely to survive under artificial selection they are deliberately chosen out from among the rest organic selection has been termed a compromise between the more strictly darwinian and the lamarckian principles of interpretation but it is not in any sense a compromise the principle of interpretation of that which is instinctive and hereditary is wholly darwinian it is true that some of the facts of observation relied upon by lamarckians are introduced for lamarckians however the modifications which are admittedly factors in survival are regarded as the parents of inherited variations for believers in organic selection they are only the fosterparents or nurses it is because organic selection is the direct outcome of and a natural extension of darwins cardinal thesis that some reference to it here is justifiable the matter may be put with the utmost brevity as follows 1 variations v occur some of which are in the direction of increased adaptation others in the direction of decreased adaptation 2 acquired modifications m also occur some of these are in the direction of increased accommodation to circumstances while others are in the direction of diminished accommodation four major combinations are b v with m c v with m a v with m d v with m of these d must inevitably be eliminated while a are selected the predominant survival of a entails the survival of the adaptive variations which are inherited the contributory acquisitions m are not inherited but there are none the less factors in determining the survival of the coincident variations it is surely abundantly clear that this is darwinism and has no tincture of lamarcks essential principle the inheritance of acquired characters whether darwin himself would have accepted this interpretation of some at least of the evidence put forward by lamarckians is unfortunately a matter of conjecture the fact remains that in his interpretation of instinct and in allied questions he accepted the inheritance of individually acquired modifications of behaviour and structure darwin was chiefly concerned with instinct from the biological rather than from the psychological point of view indeed it must be confessed that from the latter standpoint his conception of instinct as a mental faculty which impels an animal to the performance of certain actions scarcely affords a satisfactory basis for genetic treatment to carry out the spirit of darwins teaching it is necessary to link more closely biological and psychological evolution the first step towards this is to interpret the phenomena of instinctive behaviour in terms of stimulation and response it may be well to take a particular case swimming on the part of a duckling is from the biological point of view a typical example of instinctive behaviour gently lower a recently hatched bird into water coordinated movements of the limbs follow in rhythmical sequence the behaviour is new to the individual though it is no doubt closely related to that of walking which is no less instinctive there is a group of stimuli afforded by the presentation which results from partial immersion upon this there follows as a complex response an application of the functional activities in swimming the sequence of adaptive application on the appropriate presentation is determined by racial preparation we know it is true but little of the physiological details of what takes place in the central nervous system but in broad outline the nature of the organic mechanism and the manner of its functioning may at least be provisionally conjectured in the present state of physiological knowledge similarly in the case of the pecking of newlyhatched chicks there is a visual presentation there is probably a coperating group of stimuli from the alimentary tract in need of food there is an adaptive application of the activities in a definite mode of behaviour like data are afforded in a great number of cases of instinctive procedure sometimes occurring very early in life not infrequently deferred until the organism is more fully developed but all of them dependent upon racial preparation no doubt there is some range of variation in the behaviour just such variation as the theory of natural selection demands but there can be no question that the higher animals inherit a bodily organisation and a nervous system the functional working of which gives rise to those inherited modes of behaviour which are termed instinctive it is to be noted that the term instinctive is here employed in the adjectival form as a descriptive heading under which may be grouped many and various modes of behaviour due to racial preparation we speak of these as inherited but in strictness what is transmitted through heredity is the complex of anatomical and physiological conditions under which in appropriate circumstances the organism so behaves so far the term instinctive has a restricted biological connotation in terms of behaviour but the connecting link between biological evolution and psychological evolution is to be soughtas darwin fully realisedin the phenomena of instinct broadly considered the term instinctive has also a psychological connotation what is that connotation let us take the case of the swimming duckling or the pecking chick and fix our attention on the first instinctive performance grant that just as there is strictly speaking no inherited behaviour but only the conditions which render such behaviour under appropriate circumstances possible so too there is no inherited experience but only the conditions which render such experience possible then the cerebral conditions in both cases are the same the biological behaviourcomplex including the total stimulation and the total response with the intervening or resultant processes in the sensorium is accompanied by an experiencecomplex including the initial stimulationconsciousness and resulting responseconsciousness in the experiencecomplex are comprised data which in psychological analysis are grouped under the headings of cognition affective tone and conation but the complex is probably experienced as an unanalysed whole if then we use the term instinctive so as to comprise all congenital modes of behaviour which contribute to experience we are in a position to grasp the view that the net result in consciousness constitutes what we may term the primary tissue of experience to the development of this experience each instinctive act contributes the nature and manner of organisation of this primary tissue of experience are dependent on inherited biological aptitudes but they are from the outset onwards subject to secondary development dependent on acquired aptitudes biological values are supplemented by psychological values in terms of satisfaction or the reverse in our study of instinct we have to select some particular phase of animal behaviour and isolate it so far as is possible from the life of which it is a part but the animal is a going concern restlessly active in many ways many instinctive performances as darwin pointed out166 are serial in their nature but the whole of active life is a serial and coordinated business the particular instinctive performance is only an episode in a lifehistory and every mode of behaviour is more or less closely correlated with other modes this coordination of behaviour is accompanied by a correlation of the modes of primary experience we may classify the instinctive modes of behaviour and their accompanying modes of instinctive experience under as many heads as may be convenient for our purposes of interpretation and label them instincts of selfpreservation of pugnacity of acquisition the reproductive instincts the parental instincts and so forth an instinct in this sense of the term for example the parental instinct may be described as a specialised part of the primary tissue of experience differentiated in relation to some definite biological end under such an instinct will fall a large number of particular and often welldefined modes of behaviour each with its own peculiar mode of experience it is no doubt exceedingly difficult as a matter of observation and of inference securely based thereon to distinguish what is primary from what is in part due to secondary acquisitiona fact which darwin fully appreciated animals are educable in different degrees but where they are educable they begin to profit by experience from the first only therefore on the occasion of the first instinctive act of a given type can the experience gained be regarded as wholly primary all subsequent performance is liable to be in some degree sometimes more sometimes less modified by the acquired disposition which the initial behaviour engenders but the early stages of acquisition are always along the lines predetermined by instinctive differentiation it is the task of comparative psychology to distinguish the primary tissue of experience from its secondary and acquired modifications we cannot follow up the matter in further detail it must here suffice to suggest that this conception of instinct as a primary form of experience lends itself better to natural history treatment than darwins conception of an impelling force and that it is in line with the main trend of darwins thought in a characteristic workcharacteristic in wealth of detail in closeness and fidelity of observation in breadth of outlook in candour and modestydarwin dealt with the expression of the emotions in man and animals sir charles bell in his anatomy of expression had contended that many of mans facial muscles had been specially created for the sole purpose of being instrumental in the expression of his emotions darwin claimed that a natural explanation consistent with the doctrine of evolution could in many cases be given and would in other cases be afforded by an extension of the principles he advocated no doubt he said167 as long as man and all other animals are viewed as independent creations an effectual stop is put to our natural desire to investigate as far as possible the causes of expression by this doctrine anything and everything can be equally well explained with mankind some expressions can hardly be understood except on the belief that man once existed in a much lower and animallike condition the community of certain expressions in distinct though allied species is rendered somewhat more intelligible if we believe in their descent from a common progenitor he who admits on general grounds that the structure and habits of all animals have been gradually evolved will look at the whole subject of expression in a new and interesting light darwin relied on three principles of explanation the first of these principles is that movements which are serviceable in gratifying some desire or in relieving some sensation if often repeated become so habitual that they are performed whether or not of any service whenever the same desire or sensation is felt even in a very weak degree168 the modes of expression which fall under this head have become instinctive through the hereditary transmission of acquired habit as far as we can judge only a few expressive movements are learnt by each individual that is were consciously and voluntarily performed during the early years of life for some definite object or in imitation of others and then became habitual the far greater number of the movements of expression and all the more important ones are innate or inherited and such cannot be said to depend on the will of the individual nevertheless all those included under our first principle were at first voluntarily performed for a definite objectnamely to escape some danger to relieve some distress or to gratify some desire169 our second principle is that of antithesis the habit of voluntarily performing opposite movements under opposite impulses has become firmly established in us by the practice of our whole lives hence if certain actions have been regularly performed in accordance with our first principle under a certain frame of mind there will be a strong and involuntary tendency to the performance of directly opposite actions whether or not these are of any use under the excitement of an opposite frame of mind170 this principle of antithesis has not been widely accepted nor is darwins own position easy to grasp our third principle he says171 is the direct action of the excited nervous system on the body independently of the will and independently in large part of habit experience shows that nerveforce is generated and set free whenever the cerebrospinal system is excited the direction which this nerveforce follows is necessarily determined by the lines of connection between the nervecells with each other and with various parts of the body lack of space prevents our following up the details of darwins treatment of expression whether we accept or do not accept his three principles of explanation we must regard his work as a masterpiece of descriptive analysis packed full of observations possessing lasting value for a further development of the subject it is essential that the instinctive factors in expression should be more fully distinguished from those which are individually acquireda difficult taskand that the instinctive factors should be rediscussed in the light of modern doctrines of heredity with a view to determining whether lamarckian inheritance on which darwin so largely relied is necessary for an interpretation of the facts the whole subject as darwin realised is very complex even the term expression has a certain amount of ambiguity when the emotion is in full flood the animal fights flees or faints is this fulltide effect to be regarded as expression or are we to restrict the term to the premonitory or residual effectsthe bared canine when the fighting mood is being roused the ruffled fur when reminiscent representations of the object inducing anger cross the mind broadly considered both should be included the activity of premonitory expression as a means of communication was recognised by darwin he might perhaps have emphasised it more strongly in dealing with the lower animals man so largely relies on a special means of communication that of language that he sometimes fails to realise that for animals with their keen powers of perception and dependent as they are on such means of communication the more strictly biological means of expression are full of subtle suggestiveness many modes of expression otherwise useless are signs of behaviour that may be anticipatedsigns which stimulate the appropriate attitude of response this would not however serve to account for the utility of the organic accompanimentsheartaffection respiratory changes vasomotor effects and so forth together with heightened muscular toneon all of which darwin lays stress172 under his third principle the biological value of all this is however of great importance though darwin was hardly in a position to take it fully into account having regard to the instinctive and hereditary factors of emotional expression we may ask whether darwins third principle does not alone suffice as an explanation whether we admit or reject lamarckian inheritance it would appear that all hereditary expression must be due to preestablished connections within the central nervous system and to a transmitted provision for coordinated response under the appropriate stimulation if this be so darwins first and second principles are subordinate and ancillary to the third an expression so far as it is instinctive or heredity being the direct result of the constitution of the nervous system darwin accepted the emotions themselves as hereditary or acquired states of mind and devoted his attention to their expression but these emotions themselves are genetic products and as such dependent on organic conditions it remained therefore for psychologists who accepted evolution and sought to build on biological foundations to trace the genesis of these modes of animal and human experience the subject has been independently developed by professors lange and james173 and some modification of their view is regarded by many evolutionists as affording the best explanation of the facts we must fix our attention on the lower emotions such as anger or fear and on their first occurrence in the life of the individual organism it is a matter of observation that if a group of young birds which have been hatched in an incubator are frightened by an appropriate presentation auditory or visual they instinctively respond in special ways if we speak of this response as the expression we find that there are many factors there are certain visible modes of behaviour crouching at once scattering and then crouching remaining motionless the braced muscles sustaining an attitude of arrest and so forth there are also certain visceral or organic effects such as affections of the heart and respiration these can be readily observed by taking the young bird in the hand other effects cannot be readily observed vasomotor changes affections of the alimentary canal the skin and so forth now the essence of the jameslange view as applied to these congenital effects is that though we are justified in speaking of them as effects of the stimulation we are not justified without further evidence in speaking of them as effects of the emotional state may it not rather be that the emotion as a primary mode of experience is the concomitant of the net result of the organic situationthe initial presentation the instinctive mode of behaviour the visceral disturbances according to this interpretation the primary tissue of experience of the emotional order felt as an unanalysed complex is generated by the stimulation of the sensorium by afferent or incoming physiological impulses from the special senses from the organs concerned in the responsive behaviour from the viscere and vasomotor system some psychologists however contend that the emotional experience is generated in the sensorium prior to and not subsequent to the behaviourresponse and the visceral disturbances it is a direct and not an indirect outcome of the presentation to the special senses be this as it may there is a growing tendency to bring into the closest possible relation or even to identify instinct and emotion in their primary genesis the central core of all such interpretations is that instinctive behaviour and experience its emotional accompaniments and its expression are but different aspects of the outcome of the same organic occurrences such emotions are therefore only a distinguishable aspect of the primary tissue of experience and exhibit a like differentiation here again a biological foundation is laid for a psychological doctrine of the mental development of the individual the intimate relation between emotion as a psychological mode of experience and expression as a group of organic conditions has an important bearing on biological interpretation the emotion as the psychological accompaniment of orderly disturbances in the central nervous system profoundly influences behaviour and often renders it more vigourous and more effective the utility of the emotions in the struggle for existence can therefore scarcely be overestimated just as keenness of perception has survivalvalue just as it is obviously subject to variation just as it must be enhanced under natural selection whether individually acquired increments are inherited or not and just as its value lies not only in this or that special perceptive act but in its importance for life as a whole so the vigourous effectiveness of activity has survivalvalue it is subject to variation it must be enhanced under natural selection and its importance lies not only in particular modes of behaviour but in its value for life as a whole if emotion and its expression as a congenital endowment are but different aspects of the same biological occurrence and if this is a powerful supplement to vigour effectiveness and persistency of behaviour it must on darwins principles be subject to natural selection if we include under the expression of the emotions not only the premonitory symptoms of the initial phases of the organic and mental state not only the signs or conditions of halftide emotion but the fulltide manifestation of an emotion which dominates the situation we are naturally led on to the consideration of many of the phenomena which are discussed under the head of sexual selection the subject is difficult and complex and it was treated by darwin with all the strength he could summon to the task it can only be dealt with here from a special point of viewthat which may serve to illustrate the influence of certain mental factors on the course of evolution from this point of view too much stress can scarcely be laid on the dominance of emotion during the period of courtship and pairing in the more highly organised animals it is a period of maximum vigour maximum activity and correlated with special modes of behaviour and special organic and visceral accompaniments a period also of maximum emotional excitement the combats of males their dances and aerial evolutions their elaborate behaviour and display or the flood of song in birds are emotional expressions which are at any rate coincident in time with sexual periodicity from the combat of the males there follows on darwins principles the elimination of those which are deficient in bodily vigour deficient in special structures offensive or protective which contribute to success deficient in the emotional supplement of which persistent and wholehearted fighting is the expression and deficient in alertness and skill which are the outcome of the psychological development of the powers of perception few biologists question that we have here a mode of selection of much importance though its influence on psychological evolution often fails to receive its due emphasis mr wallace174 regards it as a form of natural selection to it he says we must impute the development of the exceptional strength size and activity of the male together with the possession of special offensive and defensive weapons and of all other characters which arise from the development of these or are correlated with them so far there is little disagreement among the followers of darwinfor mr wallace with fine magnanimity has always preferred to be ranked as such notwithstanding his right on which a smaller man would have constantly insisted to the claim of independent originator of the doctrine of natural selection so far with regard to sexual selection darwin and mr wallace are agreed so far and no farther for darwin says mr wallace175 has extended the principle into a totally different field of action which has none of that character of constancy and of inevitable result that attaches to natural selection including male rivalry for by far the larger portion of the phenomena which he endeavours to explain by the direct action of sexual selection can only be so explained on the hypothesis that the immediate agency is female choice or preference it is to this that he imputes the origin of all secondary sexual characters other than weapons of offence and defence in this extension of sexual selection to include the action of female choice or preference and in the attempt to give to that choice such widereaching effects i am unable to follow him more than a very little way into the details of mr wallaces criticisms it is impossible to enter here we cannot discuss either the mode of origin of the variations in structure which have rendered secondary sexual characters possible or the modes of selection other than sexual which have rendered them within narrow limits specifically constant mendelism and mutation theories may have something to say on the subject when these theories have been more fully correlated with the basal principles of selection it is noteworthy that mr wallace says176 besides the acquisition of weapons by the male for the purpose of fighting with other males there are some other sexual characters which may have been produced by natural selection such are the various sounds and odours which are peculiar to the male and which serve as a call to the female or as an indication of his presence these are evidently a valuable addition to the means of recognition of the two sexes and are a further indication that the pairing season has arrived and the production intensification and differentiation of these sounds and odours are clearly within the power of natural selection the same remark will apply to the peculiar calls of birds and even to the singing of the males why the same remark should not apply to their colours and adornments is not obvious what is obvious is that means of recognition and indication that the pairing season has arrived are dependent on the perceptive powers of the female who recognises and for whom the indication has meaning the hypothesis of female preference stripped of the aesthetic surplusage which is psychologically both unnecessary and unproven is really only different in degree from that which mr wallace admits in principle when he says that it is probable that the female is pleased or excited by the display let us for our present purpose leave on one side and regard as sub judice the question whether the specific details of secondary sexual characters are the outcome of female choice for us the question is whether certain psychological accompaniments of the pairing situation have influenced the course of evolution and whether these psychological accompaniments are themselves the outcome of evolution as a matter of observation specially differentiated modes of behaviour often very elaborate frequently requiring highly developed skill and apparently highly charged with emotional tone are the precursors of pairing they are generally confined to the males whose fierce combats during the period of sexual activity are part of the emotional manifestation it is inconceivable that they have no biological meaning and it is difficult to conceive that they have any other biological end than to evoke in the generally more passive female the pairing impulse they are based on instinctive foundations ingrained in the nervous constitution through natural or may we not say sexual selection in virtue of their profound utility they are called into play by a specialised presentation such as the sight or the scent of the female at or a little in advance of a critical period of the physiological rhythm there is no necessity that the male should have any knowledge of the end to which his strenuous activity leads up in presence of the female there is an elaborate application of all the energies of behaviour just because ages of racial preparation have made him biologically and emotionally what he isa functionally sexual male that must dance or sing or go through hereditary movements of display when the appropriate stimulation comes of course after the first successful courtship his future behaviour will be in some degree modified by his previous experience no doubt during his first courtship he is gaining the primary data of a peculiarly rich experience instinctive and emotional but the biological foundations of the behaviour of courtship are laid in the hereditary coordinations it would seem that in some cases not indeed in all perhaps especially in those cases in which secondary sexual behaviour is most highly evolvedcorrelative with the ardour of the male is a certain amount of reluctance in the female the pairing act on her part only takes place after prolonged stimulation for affording which the behaviour of male courtship is the requisite presentation the most vigourous defiant and mettlesome male is preferred just because he alone affords a contributory stimulation adequate to evoke the pairing impulse with its attendant emotional tone it is true that this places female preference or choice on a much lower psychological plane than darwin in some passages seems to contemplate where for example he says that the female appreciates the display of the male and places to her credit a taste for the beautiful but darwin himself distinctly states177 that it is not probable that she consciously deliberates but she is most excited or attracted by the most beautiful or melodious or gallant males the view here put forward which has been developed by prof groos178 therefore seems to have darwins own sanction the phenomena are not only biological there are psychological elements as well one can hardly suppose that the female is unconscious of the males presence the final yielding must surely be accompanied by heightened emotional tone whether we call it choice or not is merely a matter of definition of terms the behaviour is in part determined by supplementary psychological values prof groos regards the coyness of females as a most efficient means of preventing the too early and too frequent yielding to the sexual impulse179 be that as it may it is in any case if we grant the facts a means through which male sexual behaviour with all its biological and psychological implications is raised to a level otherwise perhaps unattainable by natural means while in the female it affords opportunities for the development in the individual and evolution in the race of what we may follow darwin in calling appreciation if we empty this word of the aesthetic implications which have gathered round it in the mental life of man regarded from this standpoint of sexual selection broadly considered has probably been of great importance the psychological accompaniments of the pairing situation have profoundly influenced the course of biological evolution and are themselves the outcome of that evolution darwin makes only passing reference to those modes of behaviour in animals which go by the name of play nothing he says180 is more common than for animals to take pleasure in practising whatever instinct they follow at other times for some real good this is one of the very numerous cases in which a hint of the master has served to stimulate research in his disciples it was left to prof groos to develop this subject on evolutionary lines and to elaborate in a masterly manner darwins suggestion the utility of play he says181 is incalculable this utility consists in the practice and exercise it affords for some of the more important duties of lifethat is to say for the performance of activities which will in adult life be essential to survival he urges182 that the play of young animals has its origin in the fact that certain very important instincts appear at a time when the animal does not seriously need them it is however questionable whether any instincts appear at a time when they are not needed and it is questionable whether the instinctive and emotional attitude of the playfight to take one example can be identified with those which accompany fighting in earnest though no doubt they are closely related and have some common factors it is probable that play as preparatory behaviour differs in biological detail as it almost certainly does in emotional attributes from the earnest of afterlife and that it has been evolved through differentiation and integration of the primary tissue of experience as a preparation through which certain essential modes of skill may be acquiredthose animals in which the preparatory playpropensity was not inherited in due force and requisite amount being subsequently eliminated in the struggle for existence in any case there is little question that prof groos is right in basing the playpropensity on instinctive foundations183 none the less as he contends the essential biological value of play is that it is a means of training the educable nervetissue of developing that part of the brain which is modified by experience and which thus acquires new characters of elaborating the secondary tissue of experience on the predetermined lines of instinctive differentiation and thus furthering the psychological activities which are included under the comprehensive term intelligent in the descent of man darwin dealt at some length with intelligence and the higher mental faculties184 his object he says is to show that there is no fundamental difference between man and the higher mammals in their mental faculties that these faculties are variable and the variations tend to be inherited and that under natural selection beneficial variations of all kinds will have been preserved and injurious ones eliminated darwin was too good an observer and too honest a man to minimise the enormous difference between the level of mental attainment of civilised man and that reached by any animal his contention was that the difference great as it is is one of degree and not of kind he realised that in the development of the mental faculties of man new factors in evolution have supervenedfactors which play but a subordinate and subsidiary part in animal intelligence intercommunication by means of language approbation and blame and all that arises out of reflective thought are but foreshadowed in the mental life of animals still he contends that these may be explained on the doctrine of evolution he urges185 that man is variable in body and mind and that the variations are induced either directly or indirectly by the same general causes and obey the same general laws as with the lower animals he correlates mental development with the evolution of the brain186 as the various mental faculties gradually developed themselves the brain would almost certainly become larger no one i presume doubts that the large proportion which the size of mans brain bears to his body compared to the same proportion in the gorilla or orang is closely connected with his higher mental powers with respect to the lower animals he says187 m e lartet188 by comparing the crania of tertiary and recent mammals belonging to the same groups has come to the remarkable conclusion that the brain is generally larger and the convolutions are more complex in the more recent form sir e ray lankester has sought to express in the simplest terms the implications of the increase in size of the cerebrum in what he asks does the advantage of a larger cerebral mass consist man he replies is born with fewer readymade tricks of the nervecentresthese performances of an inherited nervous mechanism so often called by the illdefined term instinctsthan are the monkeys or any other animal correlated with the absence of inherited readymade mechanism man has a greater capacity of developing in the course of his individual growth similar nervous mechanisms similar to but not identical with those of instinct than any other animal the power of being educatededucability as we may term itis what man possesses in excess as compared with the apes i think we are justified in forming the hypothesis that it is this educability which is the correlative of the increased size of the cerebrum there has been natural selection of the more educable animals for the character which we describe as educability can be transmitted it is a congenital character but the results of education can not be transmitted in each generation they have to be acquired afresh and with increased educability they are more readily acquired and a larger variety of them the fact is that there is no community between the mechanisms of instinct and the mechanisms of intelligence and that the latter are later in the history of the evolution of the brain than the former and can only develop in proportion as the former become feeble and defective189 in this statement we have a good example of the further development of views which darwin foreshadowed but did not thoroughly work out it states the biological case clearly and tersely plasticity of behaviour in special accommodation to special circumstances is of survival value it depends upon acquired characters it is correlated with increase in size and complexity of the cerebrum under natural selection therefore the larger and more complex cerebrum as the organ of plastic behaviour has been the outcome of natural selection we have thus the biological foundations for a further development of genetic psychology there are diversities of opinion as darwin showed with regard to the range of instinct in man and the higher animals as contrasted with lower types darwin himself said190 that man perhaps has somewhat fewer instincts than those possessed by the animals which come next to him in the series on the other hand prof wm james says191 that man is probably the animal with most instincts the true position is that man and the higher animals have fewer complete and selfsufficing instincts than those which stand lower in the scale of mental evolution but that they have an equally large or perhaps larger mass of instinctive raw material which may furnish the stuff to be elaborated by intelligent processes there is perhaps a greater abundance of the primary tissue of experience to be refashioned and integrated by secondary modification there is probably the same differentiation in relation to the determining biological ends but there is at the outset less differentiation of the particular and specific modes of behaviour the specialised instinctive performances and their concomitant experiencecomplexes are at the outset more indefinite only through acquired connections correlated with experience do they become definitely organised the full workingout of the delicate and subtle relationship of instinct and educabilitythat is of the hereditary and the acquired factors in the mental lifeis the task which lies before genetic and comparative psychology they interact throughout the whole of life and their interactions are very complex no one can read the chapters of the descent of man which darwin devotes to a consideration of the mental characters of man and animals without noticing on the one hand how sedulous he is in his search for hereditary foundations and on the other hand how fully he realises the importance of acquired habits of mind the fact that educability itself has innate tendenciesis in fact a partially differentiated educabilityrenders the unravelling of the factors of mental progress all the more difficult in his comparison of the mental powers of men and animals it was essential that darwin should lay stress on points of similarity rather than on points of difference seeking to establish a doctrine of evolution with its basal concept of continuity of process and community of character he was bound to render clear and to emphasise the contention that the difference in mind between man and the higher animals great as it is is one of degree and not of kind to this end darwin not only recorded a large number of valuable observations of his own and collected a considerable body of information from reliable sources he presented the whole subject in a new light and showed that a natural history of mind might be written and that this method of study offered a wide and rich field for investigation of course those who regarded the study of mind only as a branch of metaphysics smiled at the philosophical ineptitude of the mere man of science but the investigation on natural history lines has been prosecuted with a large measure of success much indeed still remains to be done for special training is required and the workers are still few promise for the future is however afforded by the fact that investigation is prosecuted on experimental lines and that something like organised methods of research are taking form there is now but little reliance on casual observations recorded by those who have not undergone the necessary discipline in these methods there is also some change of emphasis in formulating conclusions now that the general evolutionary thesis is fully and freely accepted by those who carry on such researches more stress is laid on the differentiation of the stages of evolutionary advance than on the fact of their underlying community of nature the conceptual intelligence which is especially characteristic of the higher mental procedure of man is more firmly distinguished from the perceptual intelligence which he shares with the lower animalsdistinguished now as a higher product of evolution no longer as differing in origin or different in kind some progress has been made on the one hand in rendering an account of intelligent profiting by experience under the guidance of pleasure and pain in the perceptual field on lines predetermined by instinctive differentiation for biological ends and on the other hand in elucidating the method of conceptual thought employed for example by the investigator himself in interpreting the perceptual experience of the lower animals thus there is a growing tendency to realise more fully that there are two orders of educabilityfirst an educability of the perceptual intelligence based on the biological foundation of instinct and secondly an educability of the conceptual intelligence which refashions and rearranges the data afforded by previous inheritance and acquisition it is in relation to this second and higher order of educability that the cerebrum of man shows so large an increase of mass and a yet larger increase of effective surface through its rich convolutions it is through educability of this order that the human child is brought intellectually and affectively into touch with the ideal constructions by means of which man has endeavoured with more or less success to reach an interpretation of nature and to guide the course of the further evolution of his raceideal constructions which form part of mans environment it formed no part of darwins purpose to consider save in broad outline the methods or to discuss in any fulness of detail the results of the process by which a differentiation of the mental faculties of man from those of the lower animals has been brought abouta differentiation the existence of which he again and again acknowledges his purpose was rather to show that notwithstanding this differentiation there is basal community in kind this must be remembered in considering his treatment of the biological foundations on which mans systems of ethics are built he definitely stated that he approached the subject exclusively from the side of natural history192 his general conclusion is that the moral sense is fundamentally identical with the social instincts which have been developed for the good of the community and he suggests that the concept which thus enables us to interpret the biological groundplan of morals also enables us to frame a rational ideal of the moral end as the social instincts he says193 both of man and the lower animals have no doubt been developed by nearly the same steps it would be advisable if found practicable to use the same definition in both cases and to take as the standard of morality the general good or welfare of the community rather than the general happiness but the kind of community for the good of which the social instincts of animals and primitive men were biologically developed may be different from that which is the product of civilisation as darwin no doubt realised darwins contention was that conscience is a social instinct and has been evolved because it is useful to the tribe in the struggle for existence against other tribes one the other hand j s mill urged that the moral feelings are not innate but acquired and bain held the same view believing that the moral sense is acquired by each individual during his lifetime darwin who notes194 their opinion with his usual candour adds that on the general theory of evolution this is at least extremely improbable it is impossible to enter into the question here much turns on the exact connotation of the terms conscience and moral sense and on the meaning we attach to the statement that the moral sense is fundamentally identical with the social instincts presumably the majority of those who approach the subjects discussed in the third fourth and fifth chapters of the descent of man in the full conviction that mental phenomena not less than organic phenomena have a natural genesis would without hesitation admit that the intellectual and moral systems of civilised man are ideal constructions the products of conceptual thought and that as such they are in their developed form acquired the moral sentiments are the emotional analogues of highly developed concepts this does not however imply that they are outside the range of natural history treatment even though it may be desirable to differentiate the moral conduct of men from the social behaviour of animals to which some such term as premoral or quasimoral may be applied still the fact remains that as darwin showed there is abundant evidence of the occurrence of such social behavioursocial behaviour which even granted that it is in large part intelligently acquired and is itself so far a product of educability is of survival value it makes for that integration without which no social group could hold together and escape elimination furthermore even if we grant that such behaviour is intelligently acquired that is to say arises through the modification of hereditary instincts and emotions the fact remains that only through these instinctive and emotional data is afforded the primary tissue of the experience which is susceptible of such modification darwin sought to show and succeeded in showing that for the intellectual and moral life there are instinctive foundations which a biological treatment alone can disclose it is true that he did not in all cases analytically distinguish the foundations from the superstructure even today we are scarcely in a position to do so adequately but his treatment was of great value in giving an impetus to further research this value indeed can scarcely be overestimated and when the natural history of the mental operations shall have been written the cardinal fact will stand forth that the instinctive and emotional foundations are the outcome of biological evolution and have been ingrained in the race through natural selection we shall more clearly realise that educability itself is a product of natural selection though the specific results acquired through cerebral modifications are not transmitted through heredity it will perhaps also be realised that the instinctive foundations of social behaviour are for us somewhat out of date and have undergone but little change throughout the progress of civilisation because natural selection has long since ceased to be the dominant factor in human progress the history of human progress has been mainly the history of mans higher educability the products of which he has projected on to his environment this educability remains on the average what it was a dozen generations ago but the thoughtwoven tapestry of his surroundings is refashioned and improved by each succeeding generation few men have in greater measure enriched the thoughtenvironment with which it is the aim of education to bring educable human beings into vital contact than has charles darwin his special field of work was the wide province of biology but he did much to help us to realise that mental factors have contributed to organic evolution and that in man the highest product of evolution they have reached a position of unquestioned supremacy footnotes footnote 153 origin of species 6th edit p 205

university of copenhagen i it is difficult to draw a sharp line between philosophy and natural science the naturalist who introduces a new principle or demonstrates a fact which throws a new light on existence not only renders an important service to philosophy but is himself a philosopher in the broader sense of the word the aim of philosophy in the stricter sense is to attain points of view from which the fundamental phenomena and the principles of the special sciences can be seen in their relative importance and connection but philosophy in this stricter sense has always been influenced by philosophy in the broader sense greek philosophy came under the influence of logic and mathematics modern philosophy under the influence of natural science the name of charles darwin stands with those of galileo newton and robert mayernames which denote new problems and great alterations in our conception of the universe first of all we must lay stress on darwins own personality his deep love of truth his indefatigable inquiry his wide horizon and his steady selfcriticism make him a scientific model even if his results and theories should eventually come to possess mainly an historical interest in the intellectual domain the primary object is to reach high summits from which wide surveys are possible to reach them toiling honestly upwards by the way of experience and then not to turn dizzy when a summit is gained darwinians have sometimes turned dizzy but darwin never he saw from the first the great importance of his hypothesis not only because of its solution of the old problem as to the value of the concept of species not only because of the grand picture of natural evolution which it unrolls but also because of the life and inspiration its method would impart to the study of comparative anatomy of instinct and of heredity and finally because of the influence it would exert on the whole conception of existence he wrote in his notebook in the year 1837 my theory would give zest to recent and fossil comparative anatomy it would lead to the study of instinct heredity and mindheredity whole of metaphysics195 we can distinguish four main points in which darwins investigations possess philosophical importance the evolution hypothesis is much older than darwin it is indeed one of the oldest guessings of human thought in the eighteenth century is was put forward by diderot and lamettrie and suggested by kant 1786 as we shall see later it was held also by several philosophers in the first half of the nineteenth century in his preface to the origin of species darwin mentions the naturalists who were his forerunners but he has set forth the hypothesis of evolution in so energetic and thorough a manner that it perforce attracts the attention of all thoughtful men in a much higher degree than it did before the publication of the origin and further the importance of his teaching rests on the fact that he much more than his predecessors even than lamarck sought a foundation for his hypothesis in definite facts modern science began by demandingwith kepler and newtonevidence of varae causae this demand darwin industriously set himself to satisfyhence the wealth of material which he collected by his observations and his experiments he not only revived an old hypothesis but he saw the necessity of verifying it by facts whether the special cause on which he founded the explanation of the origin of speciesnatural selectionis sufficient is now a subject of discussion he himself had some doubt in regard to this question and the criticisms which are directed against his hypothesis hit darwinism rather than darwin in his indefatigable search for empirical evidence he is a model even for his antagonists he has compelled them to approach the problems of life along other lines than those which were formerly followed whether the special cause to which darwin appealed is sufficient or not at least to it is probably due the greater part of the influence which he has exerted on the general trend of thought struggle for existence and natural selection are principles which have been applied more or less in every department of thought recent research it is true has discovered greater empirical discontinuityleaps mutationswhereas darwin believed in the importance of small variations slowly accumulated it has also been shown by the experimental method which in recent biological work has succeeded darwins more historical method that types once constituted possess great permanence the fluctuations being restricted within clearly defined boundaries the problem has become more precise both as to variation and as to heredity the inner conditions of life have in both respects shown a greater independence than darwin had supposed in his theory though he always admitted that the cause of variation was to him a great enigma a most perplexing problem and that the struggle for life could only occur where variation existed but at any rate it was of the greatest importance that darwin gave a living impression of the struggle for life which is everywhere going on and to which even the highest forms of existence must be amenable the philosophical importance of these ideas does not stand or fall with the answer to the question whether natural selection is a sufficient explanation of the origin of species or not it has an independent positive value for everyone who will observe life and reality with an unbiased mind in accentuating the struggle for life darwin stands as a characteristically english thinker he continues a train of ideas which hobbes and malthus had already begun moreover in his critical views as to the conception of species he had english forerunners in the middle ages occam and duns scotus in the eighteenth century berkeley and hume in his moral philosophy as we shall see later he is an adherent of the school which is represented by hutcheson home and adam smith because he is no philosopher in the stricter sense of the term it is of great interest to see that his attitude of mind is that of the great thinkers of his nation in considering darwins influence on philosophy we will begin with an examination of the attitude of philosophy to the conception of evolution at the time when the origin of species appeared we will then examine the effects which the theory of evolution and especially the idea of the struggle for life has had and naturally must have on the discussion of philosophical problems ii when the origin of species appeared fifty years ago romantic speculation schellings and hegels philosophy still reigned on the continent while in england positivism the philosophy of comte and stuart mill represented the most important trend of thought german speculation had much to say on evolution it even pretended to be a philosophy of evolution but then the word evolution was to be taken in an ideal not in a real sense to speculative thought the forms and types of nature formed a system of ideas within which any form could lead us by continuous transitions to any other it was a classificatory system which was regarded as a divine world of thought or images within which metamorphoses could go ona condition comparable with that in the mind of the poet when one image follows another with imperceptible changes goethes ideas of evolution as expressed in his metamorphosen der pflanzen und der thiere belong to this category it is therefore incorrect to call him a forerunner of darwin schelling and hegel held the same idea hegel expressly rejected the conception of a real evolution in time as coarse and materialistic nature he says is to be considered as a system of stages the one necessarily arising from the other and being the nearest truth of that from which it proceeds but not in such a way that the one is naturally generated by the other on the contrary their connection lies in the inner idea which is the ground of nature the metamorphosis can be ascribed only to the notion as such because it alone is evolution it has been a clumsy idea in the older as well as in the newer philosophy of nature to regard the transformation and the transition from one natural form and sphere to a higher as an outward and actual production196 the only one of the philosophers of romanticism who believed in a real historical evolution a real production of new species was oken197 danish philosophers such as treschow 1812 and sibbern 1846 have also broached the idea of an historical evolution of all living beings from the lowest to the highest schopenhauers philosophy has a more realistic character than that of schellings and hegels his diametrical opposites although he also belongs to the romantic school of thought his philosophical and psychological views were greatly influenced by french naturalists and philosophers especially by cabanis and lamarck he praises the ever memorable lamarck because he laid so much stress on the will to live but he repudiates as a wonderful error the idea that the organs of animals should have reached their present perfection through a development in time during the course of innumerable generations it was he said a consequence of the low standard of contemporary french philosophy that lamarck came to the idea of the construction of living beings in time through succession198 the positivistic stream of thought was not more in favour of a real evolution than was the romantic school its aim was to adhere to positive facts it looked with suspicion on farreaching speculation comte laid great stress on the discontinuity found between the different kingdoms of nature as well as within each single kingdom as he regarded as unscientific every attempt to reduce the number of physical forces so he rejected entirely the hypothesis of lamarck concerning the evolution of species the idea of species would in his eyes absolutely lose its importance if a transition from species to species under the influence of conditions of life were admitted his disciples littr robin continued to direct against darwin the polemics which their master had employed against lamarck stuart mill who in the theory of knowledge represented the empirical or positivistic movement in philosophylike his english forerunners from locke to humefounded his theory of knowledge and morals on the experience of the single individual he sympathised with the theory of the original likeness of all individuals and derived their differences on which he practically and theoretically laid much stress from the influence both of experience and education and generally of physical and social causes he admitted an individual evolution and in the human species an evolution based on social progress but no physiological evolution of species he was afraid that the hypothesis of heredity would carry us back to the old theory of innate ideas darwin was more empirical than comte and mill experience disclosed to him a deeper continuity than they could find closer than before the nature and fate of the single individual were shown to be interwoven in the great web binding the life of the species with nature as a whole and the continuity which so many idealistic philosophers could find only in the world of thought he showed to be present in the world of reality iii darwins energetic renewal of the old idea of evolution has its chief importance in strengthening the conviction of this real continuity in the world of continuity in the series of form and events it was a great support for all those who were prepared to base their conception of life on scientific grounds together with the recently discovered law of the conservation of energy it helped to produce the great realistic movement which characterises the last third of the nineteenth century after the decline of the romantic movement people wished to have firmer ground under their feet and reality now asserted itself in a more emphatic manner than in the period of romanticism it was easy for hegel to proclaim that the real was the rational and that the rational was the real reality itself existed for him only in the interpretation of ideal reason and if there was anything which could not be merged in the higher unity of thought then it was only an example of the impotence of nature to hold to the idea but now concepts are to be founded on nature and not on any system of categories too confidently deduced priori the new devotion to nature had its recompense in itself because the new points of view made us see that nature could indeed hold to ideas though perhaps not to those which we had cogitated beforehand a most important question for philosophers to answer was whether the new views were compatible with an idealistic conception of life and existence some proclaimed that we have now no need of any philosophy beyond the principles of the conservation of matter and energy and the principle of natural evolution existence should and could be definitely and completely explained by the laws of material nature but abler thinkers saw that the thing was not so simple they were prepared to give the new views their just place and to examine what alterations the old views must undergo in order to be brought into harmony with the new data the realistic character of darwins theory was shown not only in the idea of natural continuity but also and not least in the idea of the cause whereby organic life advances step by step this ideathe idea of the struggle for lifeimplied that nothing could persist if it had no power to maintain itself under the given conditions inner value alone does not decide idealism was here put to its hardest trial in continuous evolution it could perhaps still find an analogy to the inner evolution of ideas in the mind but in the demand for power in order to struggle with outward conditions realism seemed to announce itself in its most brutal form every form of idealism had to ask itself seriously how it was going to struggle for life with this new realism we will now give a short account of the position which leading thinkers in different countries have taken up in regard to this question i herbert spencer was the philosopher whose mind was best prepared by his own previous thinking to admit the theory of darwin to a place in his conception of the world his criticism of the arguments which had been put forward against the hypothesis of lamarck showed that spencer as a young man was an adherent to the evolution idea in his social statics 1850 he applied this idea to human life and moral civilisation in 1852 he wrote an essay on the development hypothesis in which he definitely stated his belief that the differentiation of species like the differentiation within a single organism was the result of development in the first edition of his psychology 1855 he took a step which put him in opposition to the older english school from locke to mill he acknowledged innate ideas so far as to admit the tendency of acquired habits to be inherited in the course of generations so that the nature and functions of the individual are only to be understood through its connection with the life of the species in 1857 in his essay on progress he propounded the law of differentiation as a general law of evolution verified by examples from all regions of experience the evolution of species being only one of these examples on the effect which the appearance of the origin of species had on his mind he writes in his autobiography up to that time i held that the sole cause of organic evolution is the inheritance of functionallyproduced modifications the origin of species made it clear to me that i was wrong and that the larger part of the facts cannot be due to any such cause to have the theory of organic evolution justified was of course to get further support for that theory of evolution at large with which all my conceptions were bound up199 instead of the metaphorical expression natural selection spencer introduced the term survival of the fittest which found favour with darwin as well as with wallace in working out his ideas of evolution spencer found that differentiation was not the only form of evolution in its simplest form evolution is mainly a concentration previously scattered elements being integrated and losing independent movement differentiation is only forthcoming when minor wholes arise within a greater whole and the highest form of evolution is reached when there is a harmony between concentration and differentiation a harmony which spencer calls equilibration and which he defines as a moving equilibrium at the same time this definition enables him to illustrate the expression survival of the fittest every living organism exhibits such a moving equilibriuma balanced set of functions constituting its life and the overthrow of this balanced set of functions or moving equilibrium is what we call death some individuals in a species are so constituted that their moving equilibria are less easily overthrown than those of other individuals and these are the fittest which survive or in mr darwins language they are the select which nature preserves200 not only in the domain of organic life but in all domains the summit of evolution is according to spencer characterised by such a harmonyby a moving equilibrium spencers analysis of the concept of evolution based on a great variety of examples has made this concept clearer and more definite than before it contains the three elements integration differentiation and equilibration it is true that a concept which is to be valid for all domains of experience must have an abstract character and between the several domains there is strictly speaking only a relation of analogy so there is only analogy between psychical and physical evolution but this is no serious objection because general concepts do not express more than analogies between the phenomena which they represent spencer takes his leading forms from the material world in defining evolution in the simplest form as integration of matter and dissipation of movement but as henot always quite consistently201assumed a correspondence of mind and matter he could very well give these terms an indirect importance for psychical evolution spencer has always in my opinion with full right repudiated the ascription of materialism he is no more a materialist than spinoza in his principles of psychology 63 he expressed himself very clearly though it seems easier to translate socalled matter into socalled spirit than to translate socalled spirit into socalled matterwhich latter is indeed wholly impossibleyet no translation can carry us beyond our symbols these words lead us naturally to a group of thinkers whose startingpoint was psychical evolution but we have still one aspect of spencers philosophy to mention spencer founded his laws of evolution on an inductive basis but he was convinced that they could be deduced from the law of the conservation of energy such a deduction is perhaps possible for the more elementary forms of evolution integration and differentiation but it is not possible for the highest form the equilibration which is a harmony of integration and differentiation spencer can no more deduce the necessity for the eventual appearance of moving equilibria of harmonious totalities than hegel could guarantee the higher unities in which all contradictions should be reconciled in spencers hands the theory of evolution acquired a more decidedly optimistic character than in darwins but i shall deal later with the relation of darwins hypothesis to the opposition of optimism and pessimism ii while the startingpoint of spencer was biological or cosmological psychical evolution being conceived as in analogy with physical a group of eminent thinkersin germany wundt in france fouille in italy ardigtook each in his own manner their startingpoint in psychical evolution as an original fact and as a type of all evolution the hypothesis of darwin coming in as a corroboration and as a special example they maintain the continuity of evolution they find this character most prominent in psychical evolution and this is for them a motive to demand a corresponding continuity in the material especially in the organic domain to wundt and fouille the concept of will is prominent they see the type of all evolution in the transformation of the life of will from blind impulse to conscious choice the theories of lamarck and darwin are used to support the view that there is in nature a tendency to evolution in steady reciprocity with external conditions the struggle for life is here only a secondary fact its apparent prominence is explained by the circumstance that the influence of external conditions is easily made out while inner conditions can be verified only through their effects for ardig the evolution of thought was the startingpoint and the type in the evolution of a scientific hypothesis we see a progress from the indefinite indistinto to the definite distinto and this is a characteristic of all evolution as ardig has pointed out in a series of works the opposition between indistinto and distinto corresponds to spencers opposition between homogeneity and heterogeneity the hypothesis of the origin of differences of species from more simple forms is a special example of the general law of evolution in the views of wundt and fouille we find the fundamental idea of idealism psychical phenomena as expressions of the innermost nature of existence they differ from the older idealism in the great stress which they lay on evolution as a real historical process which is going on through steady conflict with external conditions the romantic dread of reality is broken it is beyond doubt that darwins emphasis on the struggle for life as a necessary condition of evolution has been a very important factor in carrying philosophy back to reality from the heaven of pure ideas the philosophy of ardig on the other side appears more as a continuation and deepening of positivism though the italian thinker arrived at his point of view independently of frenchenglish positivism the idea of continuous evolution is here maintained in opposition to comtes and mills philosophy of discontinuity from wundt and fouille ardig differs in conceiving psychical evolution not as an immediate revelation of the innermost nature of existence but only as a single though the most accessible example of evolution iii to the french philosophers boutroux and bergson evolution proper is continuous and qualitative while outer experience and physical science give us fragments only sporadic processes and mechanical combinations to bergson in his recent work levolution cratrice evolution consists in an lan de vie which to our fragmentary observation and analytic reflexion appears as broken into a manifold of elements and processes the concept of matter in its scientific form is the result of this breaking asunder essential for all scientific reflexion in these conceptions the strongest opposition between inner and outer conditions of evolution is expressed in the domain of internal conditions spontaneous development of qualitative formsin the domain of external conditions discontinuity and mechanical combination we see then that the theory of evolution has influenced philosophy in a variety of forms it has made idealistic thinkers revise their relation to the real world it has led positivistic thinkers to find a closer connection between the facts on which they based their views it has made us all open our eyes for new possibilities to arise through the prima facie inexplicable spontaneous variations which are the condition of all evolution this last point is one of peculiar interest deeper than speculative philosophy and mechanical science saw in the days of their triumph we catch sight of new streams whose sources and laws we have still to discover most sharply does this appear in the theory of mutation which is only a stronger accentuation of a main point in darwinism it is interesting to see that an analogous problem comes into the foreground in physics through the discovery of radioactive phenomena and in psychology through the assumption of psychical new formations as held by boutroux william james and bergson from this side darwins ideas as well as the analogous ideas in other domains incite us to renewed examination of our first principles their rationality and their value on the other hand his theory of the struggle for existence challenges us to examine the conditions and discuss the outlook as to the persistence of human life and society and of the values that belong to them it is not enough to hope or fear the rising of new forms we have also to investigate the possibility of upholding the forms and ideals which have hitherto been the bases of human life darwin has here given his age the most earnest and most impressive lesson this side of darwins theory is of peculiar interest to some special philosophical problems to which i now pass iv among philosophical problems the problem of knowledge has in the last century occupied a foremost place it is natural then to ask how darwin and the hypothesis whose most eminent representative he is stand to this problem darwin started an hypothesis but every hypothesis is won by inference from certain presuppositions and every inference is based on the general principles of human thought the evolution hypothesis presupposes then human thought and its principles and not only the abstract logical principles are thus presupposed the evolution hypothesis purports to be not only a formal arrangement of phenomena but to express also the law of a real process it supposes then that the real dataall that in our knowledge which we do not produce ourselves but which we in the main simply receiveare subject to laws which are at least analogous to the logical relations of our thoughts in other words it assumes the validity of the principle of causality if organic species could arise without cause there would be no use in framing hypotheses only if we assume the principle of causality is there a problem to solve though darwinism has had a great influence on philosophy considered as a striving after a scientific view of the world yet here is a point of viewthe epistemologicalwhere philosophy is not only independent but reaches beyond any result of natural science perhaps it will be said the powers and functions of organic beings only persist perhaps also only arise when they correspond sufficiently to the conditions under which the struggle of life is to go on human thought itself is then a variation or a mutation which has been able to persist and to survive is not then the problem of knowledge solved by the evolution hypothesis spencer had given an affirmative answer to this question before the appearance of the origin of species for the individual he said there is an priori original basis or anlage for all mental life but in the species all powers have developed in reciprocity with extendal conditions knowledge is here considered from the practical point of view as a weapon in the struggle for life as an organon which has been continuously in use for generations in recent years the economic or pragmatic epistemology as developed by avenarius and mach in germany and by james in america points in the same direction science it is said only maintains those principles and presuppositions which are necessary to the simplest and clearest orientation be applied to experience and to practical work will successively be eliminated in these views a striking and important application is made of the idea of struggle for life to the development of human thought thought must as all other things in the world struggle for life but this whole consideration belongs to psychology not to the theory of knowledge epistemology which is concerned only with the validity of knowledge not with its historical origin every hypothesis to explain the origin of knowledge must submit to crossexamination by the theory of knowledge because it works with the fundamental forms and principles of human thought we cannot go further back than these forms and principles which it is the aim of epistemology to ascertain and for which no further reason can be given202 but there is another side of the problem which is perhaps of more importance and which epistemology generally overlooks if new variations can arise not only in organic but perhaps also in inorganic nature new tasks are placed before the human mind the question is then if it has forms in which there is room for the new matter we are here touching a possibility which the great master of epistemology did not bring to light kant supposed confidently that no other matter of knowledge could stream forth from the dark source which he called the thinginitself than such as could be synthesised in our existing forms of knowledge he mentions the possibility of other forms than the human and warns us against the dogmatic assumption that the human conception of existence should be absolutely adequate but he seems to be quite sure that the thinginitself works constantly and consequently always gives us only what our powers can master this assumption was a consequence of kants rationalistic tendency but one for which no warrant can be given evolutionism and systematism are opposing tendencies which can never be absolutely harmonised one with the other evolution may at any time break some form which the systemmonger regards as finally established darwin himself felt a great difference in looking at variation as an evolutionist and as a systematist when he was working at his evolution theory he was very glad to find variations but they were a hindrance to him when he worked as a systematist in preparing his work on cirripedia he says in a letter i had thought the same parts of the same species more resemble than they do anyhow in cirripedia objects cast in the same mould systematic work would be easy were it not for this confounded variation which however is pleasant to me as a speculatist though odious to me as a systematist203 he could indeed be angry with variations even as an evolutionist but then only because he could not explain them not because he could not classify them if as i must think external conditions produce little direct effect what the devil determines each particular variation204 what darwin experienced in this particular domain holds good of all knowledge all knowledge is systematic in so far as it strives to put phenomena in quite definite relations one to another but the systematisation can never be complete and here darwin has contributed much to widen the world for us he has shown us forces and tendencies in nature which make absolute systems impossible at the same time that they give us new objects and problems there is still a place for what lessing called the unceasing striving after truth while absolute truth in the sense of a closed system is unattainable so long as life and experience are going on there is here a special remark to be made as we have seen above recent research has shown that natural selection or struggle for life is no explanation of variations hugo de vries distinguishes between partial and embryonal variations or between variations and mutations only the lastnamed being heritable and therefore of importance for the origin of new species but the existence of variations is not only of interest for the problem of the origin of species it has also a more general interest an individual does not lose its importance for knowledge because its qualities are not heritable on the contrary in higher beings at least individual peculiarities will become more and more independent objects of interest knowledge takes account of the biographies not only of species but also of individuals it seeks to find the law of development of the single individual205 as leibnitz said long ago individuality consists in the law of the changes of a being la loi du changement fait lindividualit de chaque substance here is a world which is almost new for science which till now has mainly occupied itself with general laws and forms but these are ultimately only means to understand the individual phenomena in whose nature and history a manifold of laws and forms always coperate the importance of this remark will appear in the sequel v to many people the darwinian theory of natural selection or struggle for existence seemed to change the whole conception of life and particularly all the conditions on which the validity of ethical ideas depends if only that has persistence which can be adapted to a given condition what will then be the fate of our ideals of our standards of good and evil blind force seems to reign and the only thing that counts seems to be the most heedless use of power darwinism it was said has proclaimed brutality no other difference seems permanent save that between the sound powerful and happy on the one side the sick feeble and unhappy on the other and every attempt to alleviate this difference seems to lead to general enervation some of those who interpreted darwinism in this manner felt an aesthetic delight in contemplating the heedlessness and energy of the great struggle for existence and anticipated the realisation of a higher human type as the outcome of it so nietzsche and his followers others recognising the same consequences in darwinism regarded these as one of the strongest objections against it so dhring and kropotkin in his earlier works this interpretation of darwinism was frequent in the interval between the two main works of darwinthe origin of species and the descent of man but even during this interval it was evident to an attentive reader that darwin himself did not found his standard of good and evil on the features of the life of nature he had emphasised so strongly he did not justify the ways along which nature reached its ends he only pointed them out the real was not to him as to hegel one with the rational darwin has indeed by his whole conception of nature rendered a great service to ethics in making the difference between the life of nature and the ethical life appear in so strong a light the ethical problem could now be stated in a sharper form than before but this was not the first time that the idea of the struggle for life was put in relation to the ethical problem in the seventeenth century thomas hobbes gave the first impulse to the whole modern discussion of ethical principles in his theory of bellum omnium contra omnes men he taught are in the state of nature enemies one of another and they live either in fright or in the glory of power but it was not the opinion of hobbes that this made ethics impossible on the contrary he found a standard for virtue and vice in the fact that some qualities and actions have a tendency to bring us out of the state of war and to secure peace while other qualities have a contrary tendency in the eighteenth century even immanuel kants ideal ethics hadso far as can be seena similar origin shortly before the foundation of his definitive ethics kant wrote his idee zu einer allgemeinen weltgeschichte 1784 wherein a way which reminds us of hobbes and is prophetic of darwinhe describes the forwarddriving power of struggle in the human world it is here as with the struggle of the trees for light and air through which they compete with one another in height anxiety about war can only be allayed by an ordinance which gives everyone his full liberty under acknowledgment of the equal liberty of others and such ordinance and acknowledgment are also attributes of the content of the moral law as kant proclaimed it in the year after the publication of his essay 1785206 kant really came to his ethics by the way of evolution though he afterwards disavowed it similarly the same line of thought may be traced in hegel though it has been disguised in the form of speculative dialectics207 and in schopenhauers theory of the blind will to live and its abrogation by the ethical feeling which is founded on universal sympathy we have a more individualistic form of the same idea it was then not entirely a foreign point of view which darwin introduced into ethical thought even if we take no account of the poetical character of the word struggle and of the more direct adaptation through the use and nonuse of power which darwin also emphasised in the descent of man he has devoted a special chapter208 to a discussion of the origin of the ethical consciousness the characteristic expression of this consciousness he found just as kant did in the idea of ought it was the origin of this new idea which should be explained his hypothesis was that the ethical ought has its origin in the social and parental instincts which as well as other instincts eg the instinct of selfpreservation lie deeper than pleasure and pain in many species not least in the human species these instincts are fostered by natural selection and when the powers of memory and comparison are developed so that single acts can be valued according to the claims of the deep social instinct then consciousness of duty and remorse are possible blind instinct has developed to conscious ethical will as already stated darwin as a moral philosopher belongs to the school that was founded by shaftesbury and was afterwards represented by hutcheson hume adam smith comte and spencer his merit is first that he has given this tendency of thought a biological foundation and that he has stamped on it a doughty character in showing that ethical ideas and sentiments rightly conceived are forces which are at work in the struggle for life there are still many questions to solve not only does the ethical development within the human species contain features still unexplained209 but we are confronted by the great problem whether after all a genetic historical theory can be of decisive importance here to every consequent ethical consciousness there is a standard of value a primordial value which determines the single ethical judgments as their last presupposition and the rightness of this basis the value of this value can as little be discussed as the rationality of our logical principles there is here revealed a possibility of ethical scepticism which evolutionistic ethics as well as intuitive or rationalistic ethics has overlooked no demonstration can show that the results of the ethical development are definitive and universal we meet here again with the important opposition of systematisation and evolution there will i think always be an open question here though comparative ethics of which we have so far only the first attempts can do much to throw light on it it would carry us too far to discuss all the philosophical works on ethics which have been influenced directly or indirectly by evolutionism i may however here refer to the book of c m williams a review of the systems of ethics founded on the theory of evolution210 in which besides darwin the following authors are reviewed wallace haeckel spencer fiske rolph barratt stephen carneri hffding gizycki alexander re as works which criticise evolutionistic ethics from an intuitive point of view and in an instructive way may be cited guyau la morale anglaise contemporaine211 and sorley ethics of naturalism i will only mention some interesting contributions to ethical discussion which can be found in darwinism besides the idea of struggle for life the attention which darwin has directed to variations has opened our eyes to the differences in human nature as well as in nature generally there is here a fact of great importance for ethical thought no matter from what ultimate premiss it starts only from a very abstract point of view can different individuals be treated in the same manner the most eminent ethical thinkers men such as jeremy bentham and immanuel kant who discussed ethical questions from very opposite standpoints agreed in regarding all men as equal in respect of ethical endowment in regard to bentham leslie stephen remarks he is determined to be thoroughly empirical to take men as he found them but his utilitarianism supposed that mens views of happiness and utility were uniform and clear and that all that was wanted was to show them the means by which their ends could be reached212 and kant supposed that every man would find the categorical imperative in his consciousness when he came to sober reflexion and that all would have the same qualifications to follow it but if continual variations great or small are going on in human nature it is the duty of ethics to make allowance for them both in making claims and in valuing what is done a new set of ethical problems have their origin here213 it is an interesting fact that stuart mills book on liberty appeared in the same year as the origin of species though mill agreed with bentham about the original equality of all mens endowments he regarded individual differences as a necessary result of physical and social influences and he claimed that free play shall be allowed to differences of character so far as is possible without injury to other men it is a condition of individual and social progress that a mans mode of action should be determined by his own character and not by tradition and custom nor by abstract rules this view was to be corroborated by the theory of darwin but here we have reached a point of view from which the criticism which in recent years has often been directed against darwinthat small variations are of no importance in the struggle for lifeis of no weight from an ethical standpoint and particularly from the ethical standpoint of darwin himself it is a duty to foster individual differences that can be valuable even though they can neither be of service for physical preservation nor be physically inherited the distinction between variation and mutation is here without importance it is quite natural that biologists should be particularly interested in such variations as can be inherited and produce new species but in the human world there is not only a physical but also a mental and social heredity when an ideal human character has taken form then there is shaped a type which through imitation and influence can become an important factor in subsequent development even if it cannot form a species in the biological sense of the word spiritually strong men often succumb in the physical struggle for life but they can nevertheless be victorious through the typical influence they exert perhaps on very distant generations if the remembrance of them is kept alive be it in legendary or in historical form their very failure can show that a type has taken form which is maintained at all risks a standard of life which is adhered to in spite of the strongest opposition the question to be or not to be can be put from very different levels of being it has too often been considered a consequence of darwinism that this question is only to be put from the lowest level when a stage is reached where ideal ethical intellectual aesthetic interests are concerned the struggle for life is a struggle for the preservation of this stage the giving up of a higher standard of life is a sort of death for there is not only a physical there is also a spiritual death vi the socratic character of darwins mind appears in his wariness in drawing the last consequences of his doctrine in contrast both with the audacious theories of so many of his followers and with the consequences which his antagonists were busy in drawing though he as we have seen saw from the beginning that his hypothesis would occasion a whole of metaphysics he was himself very reserved as to the ultimate questions and his answers to such questions were extorted from him as to the question of optimism and pessimism darwin held that though pain and suffering were very often the ways by which animals were led to pursue that course of action which is most beneficial to the species yet pleasurable feelings were the most habitual guides we see this in the pleasure from exertion even occasionally from great exertion of the body or mind in the pleasure of our daily meals and especially in the pleasure derived from sociability and from loving our families but there was to him so much suffering in the world that it was a strong argument against the existence of an intelligent first cause214 it seems to me that darwin was not so clear on another question that of the relation between improvement and adaptation he wrote to lyell when you contrast natural selection and improvement you seem always to overlook that every step in the natural selection of each species implies improvement in that species in relation to its condition of life improvement implies i suppose each form obtaining many parts or organs all excellently adapted for their functions all this he adds seems to me quite compatible with certain forms fitted for simple conditions remaining unaltered or being degraded215 but the great question is if the conditions of life will in the long run favour improvement in the sense of differentiation or harmony of differentiation and integration many beings are best adapted to their conditions of life if they have few organs and few necessities pessimism would not only be the consequence if suffering outweighed happiness but also if the most elementary forms of happiness were predominant or if there were a tendency to reduce the standard of life to the simplest possible the contentment of inertia or stable equilibrium there are animals which are very highly differentiated and active in their young state but later lose their complex organisation and concentrate themselves on the one function of nutrition in the human world analogies to this sort of adaptation are not wanting young idealists very often end as old philistines adaptation and progress are not the same another question of great importance in respect to human evolution is whether there will be always a possibility for the existence of an impulse to progress an impulse to make great claims on life to be active and to alter the conditions of life instead of adapting to them in a passive manner many people do not develop because they have too few necessities and because they have no power to imagine other conditions of life than those under which they live in his remarks on the pleasure from exertion darwin has a point of contact with the practical idealism of former timeswith the ideas of lessing and goethe of condorcet and fichte the continual striving which was the condition of salvation to fausts soul is also the condition of salvation to mankind there is a holy fire which we ought to keep burning if adaptation is really to be improvement if as i have tried to show in my philosophy of religion the innermost core of all religion is faith in the persistence of value in the world and if the highest values express themselves in the cry excelsior then the capital point is that this cry should always be heard and followed we have here a corollary of the theory of evolution in its application to human life darwin declared himself an agnostic not only because he could not harmonise the large amount of suffering in the world with the idea of a god as its first cause but also because he was aware that if we admit a first cause the mind still craves to know whence it came and how it arose216 he saw as kant had seen before him and expressed in his kritik der urtheilskraft that we cannot accept either of the only two possibilities which we are able to conceive chance or brute force and design neither mechanism nor teleology can give an absolute answer to ultimate questions the universe and especially the organic life in it can neither be explained as a mere combination of absolute elements nor as the effect of a constructing thought darwin concluded as kant and before him spinoza that the oppositions and distinctions which our experience presents cannot safely be regarded as valid for existence in itself and with kant and fichte he found his stronghold in the conviction that man has something to do even if he cannot solve all enigmas the safest conclusion seems to me that the whole subject is beyond the scope of mans intellect but man can do his duty217 is this the last word of human thought does not the possibility that man can do his duty suppose that the conditions of life allow of continuous ethical striving so that there is a certain harmony between cosmic order and human ideals darwin himself has shown how the consciousness of duty can arise as a natural result of evolution moreover there are lines of evolution which have their end in ethical idealism in a kingdom of values which must struggle for life as all things in the world must do but a kingdom which has its firm foundation in reality footnotes footnote 195 life and letters of charles darwin vol i p 8 footnote 196 encyclopdie der

out certain elements of the darwinian influence upon religious thought and then to show reason for the conclusion that it has been from a christian point of view satisfactory i shall not proceed further to urge that the christian apologetic in relation to biology has been successful a variety of opinions may be held on this question without disturbing the conclusion that the movements of readjustment have been beneficial to those who remain christians and this by making them more christian and not only more liberal the theologians may sometimes have retreated but there has been an advance of theology i know that this account incurs the charge of optimism it is not the worst that could be made the influence has been limited in personal range unequal even divergent in operation and accompanied by the appearance of waste and mischievous products the estimate which follows requires for due balance a full development of many qualifying considerations for this i lack space but i must at least distinguish my view from the popular one that our difficulties about religion and natural science have come to an end concerning the older questions about originsthe origin of the world of species of man of reason conscience religiona large measure of understanding has been reached by some thoughtful men but meanwhile new questions have arisen questions about conduct regarding both the reality of morals and the rule of right action for individuals and societies and these problems still far from solution may also be traced to the influence of darwin for they arise from the renewed attention to heredity brought about by the search for the causes of variation without which the study of the selection of variations has no sufficient basis even the existing understanding about origins is very far from universal on these points there were always thoughtful men who denied the necessity of conflict and there are still thoughtful men who deny the possibility of a truce it must further be remembered that the earlier discussion now as i hope to show producing favourable results created also for a time grave damage not only in the disturbance of faith and the loss of mena loss not repaired by a change in the currents of debatebut in what i believe to be a still more serious respect i mean the introduction of a habit of facile and untested hypothesis in religious as in other departments of thought darwin is not responsible for this but he is in part the cause of it great ideas are dangerous guests in narrow minds and thus it has happened that darwinthe most patient of scientific workers in whom hypothesis waited upon research or if it provisionally outstepped it did so only with the most scrupulously careful acknowledgmenthas led smaller and less conscientious men in natural science in history and in theology to an overeager confidence in probable conjecture and a loose grip upon the facts of experience it is not too much to say that in many quarters the age of materialism was the least matteroffact age conceivable and the age of science the age which showed least of the patient temper of inquiry i have indicated as shortly as i could some losses and dangers which in a balanced account of darwins influence would be discussed at length one other loss must be mentioned it is a defect in our thought which in some quarters has by itself almost cancelled all the advantages secured i mean the exaggerated emphasis on uniformity or continuity the unwillingness to rest any part of faith or of our practical expectation upon anything that from any point of view can be called exceptional the high degree of success reached by naturalists in tracing or reasonably conjecturing the small beginnings of great differences has led the inconsiderate to believe that anything may in time become anything else it is true that this exaggeration of the belief in uniformity has produced in turn its own perilous reaction from refusing to believe whatever can be called exceptional some have come to believe whatever can be called wonderful but on the whole the discontinuous or highly various character of experience received for many years too little deliberate attention the conception of uniformity which is a necessity of scientific description has been taken for the substance of history we have accepted a postulate of scientific method as if it were a conclusion of scientific demonstration in the name of a generalisation which however just on the lines of a particular method is the prize of a difficult exploit of reflexion we have discarded the direct impressions of experience or perhaps it is more true to say we have used for the criticism of alleged experiences a doctrine of uniformity which is only valid in the region of abstract science for every science depends for its advance upon limitation of attention upon the selection out of the whole content of consciousness of that part or aspect which is measurable by the method of the science accordingly there is a science of life which rightly displays the unity underlying all its manifestations but there is another view of life equally valid and practically sometimes more important which recognises the immediate and lasting effect of crisis difference and revolution our ardour for the demonstration of uniformity of process and of minute continuous change needs to be balanced by a recognition of the catastrophic element in experience and also by a recognition of the exceptional significance for us of events which may be perfectly regular from an impersonal point of view an exorbitant jealousy of miracle revelation and ultimate moral distinctions has been imported from evolutionary science into religious thought and it has been a damaging influence because it has taken mens attention from facts and fixed them upon theories ii with this acknowledgment of important drawbacks requiring many words for their proper description i proceed to indicate certain results of darwins doctrine which i believe to be in the long run wholly beneficial to christian thought these are the encouragement in theology of that evolutionary method of observation and study which has shaped all modern research the recoil of christian apologetics towards the ground of religious experience a recoil produced by the pressure of scientific criticism upon other supports of faith the restatement or the recovery of ancient forms of statement of the doctrines of creation and of divine design in nature consequent upon the discussion of evolution and of natural selection as its guiding factor 1 the first of these is quite possibly the most important of all it was well defined in a notable paper read by dr gore now bishop of birmingham to the church congress at shrewsbury in 1896 we have learnt a new caution both in ascribing and in denying significance to items of evidence in utterance or in event there has been as in art a study of values which secures perspective and solidity in our representation of facts on the one hand a given utterance or event cannot be drawn into evidence as if all items were of equal consequence like sovereigns in a bag the question whence and whither must be asked and the particular thing measured as part of a series thus measured it is not less truly important but it may be important in a lower degree on the other hand and for exactly the same reason nothing that is real is unimportant the failures are not mere mistakes we see them in st augustines words as scholars faults which men praise in hope of fruit we cannot safely trace the origin of the evolutionistic method to the influence of natural science the view is tenable that theology led the way probably this is a case of alternate and reciprocal debt quite certainly the evolutionist method in theology in christian history and in the estimate of scripture has received vast reinforcement from biology in which evolution has been the ever present and ever victorious conception 2 the second effect named is the new willingness of christian thinkers to take definite account of religious experience this is related to darwin through the general pressure upon religious faith of scientific criticism the great advance of our knowledge of organisms has been an important element in the general advance of science it has acted by the varied requirements of the theory of organisms upon all other branches of natural inquiry and it held for a long time that leading place in public attention which is now occupied by speculative physics consequently it contributed largely to our present estimation of science as the supreme judge in all matters of inquiry218 to the supposed destruction of mystery and the disparagement of metaphysics which marked the last age as well as to the just recommendation of scientific method in branches of learning where the direct acquisitions of natural science had no place besides this the new application of the idea of law and mechanical regularity to the organic world seemed to rob faith of a kind of refuge the romantics had as berthelot219 shows appealed to life to redress the judgments drawn from mechanism now in spencer evolution gave us a vitalist mechanic or mechanical vitalism and the appeal seemed cut off we may return to this point later when we consider evolution at present i only endeavour to indicate that general pressure of scientific criticism which drove men of faith to seek the grounds of reassurance in a science of their own in a method of experiment of observation of hypothesis checked by known facts it is impossible for me to do more than glance across the threshold of this subject but it is necessary to say that the method is in an elementary stage of revival the imposing success that belongs to natural science is absent we fall short of the unchallengeable unanimity of the biologists on fundamentals the experimental method with its sure repetitions cannot be applied to our subjectmatter but we have something like the observational method of palaeontology and geographical distribution and in biology there are still men who think that the large examination of varieties by way of geography and the search of strata is as truly scientific uses as genuinely the logical method of difference and is as fruitful in sure conclusions as the quasichemical analysis of mendelian laboratory work of which last i desire to express my humble admiration religion also has its observational work in the larger and possibly more arduous manner but the scientific work in religion makes its way through difficulties and dangers we are far from having found the formula of its combination with the historical elements of our apologetic it is exposed therefore to a damaging fire not only from unspiritualist psychology and pathology but also from the side of scholastic dogma it is hard to admit on equal terms a partner to the old undivided rule of books and learning with charles lamb we cry in some distress must knowledge come to me if it come at all by some awkward experiment of intuition and no longer by this familiar process of reading220 and we are answered that the old process has an imperishable value only we have not yet made clear its connection with other contributions and all the work is young liable to be drawn into unprofitable excursions sidetracked by selfdeceit and pretence and it fatally attracts like the older mysticism the curiosity and the expository powers of those least in sympathy with it ready writers who with all the air of extended research have been content with narrow grounds for induction there is a danger besides which accompanies even the most genuine work of this science and must be provided against by all its serious students i mean the danger of unbalanced introspection both for individuals and for societies of a preoccupation comparable to our modern social preoccupation with bodily health of reflexion upon mental states not accompanied by exercise and growth of the mental powers the danger of contemplating will and neglecting work of analysing conviction and not criticising evidence still in spite of dangers and mistakes the work remains full of hopeful indications and in the best examples221 it is truly scientific in its determination to know the very truth to tell what we think not what we think we ought to think222 truly scientific in its employment of hypothesis and verification and in growing conviction of the reality of its subjectmatter through the repeated victories of a mastery which advances like science in the baconian road of obedience it is reasonable to hope that progress in this respect will be more rapid and sure when religious study enlists more men affected by scientific desire and endowed with scientific capacity the class of investigating minds is a small one possibly even smaller than that of reflecting minds very few persons at any period are able to find out anything whatever there are few observers few discoverers few who even wish to discover truth in how many societies the problems of philology which face every person who speaks english are left unattempted and if the inquiring or the successfully inquiring class of minds is small much smaller of course is the class of those possessing the scientific aptitude in an eminent degree during the last age this most distinguished class was to a very great extent absorbed in the study of phenomena a study which had fallen into arrears for we stood possessed in rudiment of means of observation means for travelling and acquisition qualifying men for a larger knowledge than had yet been attempted these were now to be directed with new accuracy and ardour upon the fabric and behaviour of the world of sense our debt to the great masters in physical science who overtook and almost outstripped the task cannot be measured and under the honourable leadership of ruskin we may all well do penance if we have failed in the respect due to their great powers of thought or in the admiration due to the far scope of their discovery223 with what miraculous mental energy and divine good fortuneas romans said of their soldiersdid our men of curiosity face the apparently impenetrable mysteries of nature and how natural it was that immense accessions of knowledge unrelated to the spiritual facts of life should discredit christian faith by the apparent superiority of the new work to the feeble and unprogressive knowledge of christian believers the day is coming when men of this mental character and rank of this curiosity this energy and this good fortune in investigation will be employed in opening mysteries of a spiritual nature they will silence with masterful witness the overconfident denials of naturalism they will be in danger of the widespread recognition which thirty years ago accompanied every utterance of huxley tyndall spencer they will contribute in spite of adulation to the advance of sober religious and moral science and this result will be due to darwin first because by raising the dignity of natural science he encouraged the development of the scientific mind secondly because he gave to religious students the example of patient and ardent investigation and thirdly because by the pressure of naturalistic criticism the religious have been driven to ascertain the causes of their own convictions a work in which they were not without the sympathy of men of science224 in leaving the subject of scientific religious inquiry i will only add that i do not believe it receives any important helpand certainly it suffers incidentally much damaging interruptionfrom the study of abnormal manifestations or abnormal conditions of personality 3 both of the above effects seem to me of high perhaps the very highest importance to faith and to thought but under the third head i name two which are more directly traceable to the personal work of darwin and more definitely characteristic of the age in which his influence was paramount viz the influence of the two conceptions of evolution and natural selection upon the doctrine of creation and of design respectively it is impossible here though it is necessary for a complete sketch of the matter to distinguish the different elements and channels of this darwinian influence in darwins own writings in the vigourous polemic of huxley and strangely enough but very actually for popular thought in the teaching of the definitely antidarwinian evolutionist spencer under the head of the directly and purely darwinian elements i should class as preeminent the work of wallace and of bates for no two sets of facts have done more to fix in ordinary intelligent minds a belief in organic evolution and in natural selection as its guiding factor than the facts of geographical distribution and of protective colour and mimicry the facts of geology were difficult to grasp and the public and theologians heard more often of the imperfection than of the extent of the geological record the witness of embryology depending to a great extent upon microscopic work was and is beyond the appreciation of persons occupied in fields of work other than biology iii from the influence in religion of scientific modes of thought we pass to the influence of particular biological conceptions the former effect comes by way of analogy example encouragement and challenge inspiring or provoking kindred or similar modes of thought in the field of theology the latter by a collision of opinions upon matters of fact or conjecture which seem to concern both science and religion in the case of darwinism the story of this collision is familiar and falls under the heads of evolution and natural selection the doctrine of descent with modification and the doctrine of its guidance or determination by the struggle for existence between related varieties these doctrines though associated and interdependent and in popular thought not only combined but confused must be considered separately it is true that the ancient doctrine of evolution in spite of the ingenuity and ardour of lamarck remained a dream tantalising the intellectual ambition of naturalists until the day when darwin made it conceivable by suggesting the machinery of its guidance and further the idea of natural selection has so effectively opened the door of research and stimulated observation in a score of principal directions that even if the darwinian explanation became one day much less convincing than in spite of recent criticism it now is yet its passing supposing it to pass would leave the doctrine of evolution immeasurably and permanently strengthened for in the interests of the theory of selection fr darwin as mller wrote facts have been collected which remain in any case evidence of the reality of descent with modification but still though thus united in the modern history of convictions though united and confused in the collision of biological and traditional opinion yet evolution and natural selection must be separated in theological no less than in biological estimation evolution seemed inconsistent with creation natural selection with providence and divine design discussion was maintained about these points for many years and with much dark heat it ranged over many particular topics and engaged minds different in tone in quality and in accomplishment there was at most times a degree of misconception some naturalists attributed to theologians in general a poverty of thought which belonged really to men of a particular temper or training the timid theism discerned in darwin by so cautious a theologian as liddon225 was supposed by many biologists to be the necessary foundation of an honest christianity it was really more characteristic of devout naturalists like philip henry gosse than of religious believers as such226 the study of theologians more considerable and even more typically conservative than liddon does not confirm the description of religious intolerance given in good faith but in serious ignorance by a disputant so acute so observant and so candid as huxley something hid from each others knowledge the devoted pilgrims in two great ways of thought the truth may be that naturalists took their view of what creation was from christian men of science who naturally looked in their own special studies for the supports and illustrations of their religious belief of almost every labourious student it may be said hic ab arte sua non recessit and both the believing and the denying naturalists confining habitual attention to a part of experience are apt to affirm and deny with trenchant vigour and something of a narrow clearness qui respiciunt ad pauca de facili pronunciant227 newman says of some secular teachers that they persuade the world of what is false by urging upon it what is true of some early opponents of darwin it might be said by a candid friend that in all sincerity of devotion to truth they tried to persuade the world of what is true by urging upon it what is false if naturalists took their version of orthodoxy from amateurs in theology some conservative christians instead of learning what evolution meant to its regular exponents took their view of it from celebrated persons not of the front rank in theology or in thought but eager to take account of public movements and able to arrest public attention cleverness and eloquence on both sides certainly had their share in producing the very great and general disturbance of mens minds in the early days of darwinian teaching but by far the greater part of that disturbance was due to the practical novelty and the profound importance of the teaching itself and to the fact that the controversy about evolution quickly became much more public than any controversy of equal seriousness had been for many generations we must not think lightly of that great disturbance because it has in some real sense done its work and because it is impossible in days of more coolness and light to recover a full sense of its very real difficulties those who would know them better should add to the calm records of darwin228 and to the story of huxleys impassioned championship all that they can learn of george romanes229 for his life was absorbed in this very struggle and reproduced its stages it began in a certain assured simplicity of biblical interpretation it went on through the glories and adventures of a paladin in darwins train to the darkness and dismay of a man who saw all his most cherished beliefs rendered as he thought incredible230 he lived to find the freer faith for which process and purpose are not irreconcilable but necessary to one another his development scientific intellectual and moral was itself of high significance and its record is of unique value to our own generation so near the age of that doubt and yet so far from it certainly still much in need of the caution and courage by which past endurance prepares men for new emergencies we have little enough reason to be sure that in the discussions awaiting us we shall do as well as our predecessors in theirs remembering their endurance of mental pain their ardour in mental labour the heroic temper and the high sincerity of controversialists on either side we may well speak of our fathers in such words of modesty and selfjudgment as drayton used when he sang the victors of agincourt the progress of biblical study in the departments of introduction and exegesis resulting in the recovery of a point of view anciently tolerated if not prevalent has altered some of the conditions of that discussion in the years near 1858 the witness of scripture was adduced both by christian advocates and their critics as if unmistakably irreconcilable with evolution huxley231 found the path of the blameless naturalist everywhere blocked by moses the believer in revelation was generally held to be forced to a choice between revealed cosmogony and the scientific account of origins it is not clear how far the change in biblical interpretation is due to natural science and how far to the vital movements of theological study which have been quite independent of the controversy about species it belongs to a general renewal of christian movement the recovery of a heritage special creationreally a biological rather than a theological conceptionseems in its rigid form to have been a recent element even in english biblical orthodoxy the middle ages had no suspicion that religious faith forbad inquiry into the natural origination of the different forms of life bartholomaeus anglicus an english franciscan of the thirteenth century was a mutationist in his way as aristotle the philosopher of the christian schoolmen had been in his so late as the seventeenth century as we learn not only from early proceedings of the royal society but from a writer so homely and so regularly pious as walton the variation of species and spontaneous generations had no theological bearing except as instances of that various wonder of the world which in devout minds is food for devotion it was in the eighteenth century that the harder statement took shape something in the preciseness of that age its exaltation of law its cold passion for a stable and measured universe its cold denial its cold affirmation of the power of god a god of ice is the occasion of that rigidity of religious thought about the living world which darwin by accident challenged or rather by one of those movements of genius which goethe232 declares are elevated above all earthly control if religious thought in the eighteenth century was aimed at a fixed and nearly finite world of spirit it followed in all these respects the secular and critical lead la philosophie rformatrice du xviiie sicle233 ramenait la nature et la socit des mcanismes que la pense rflchie peut concevoir et rcomposer in fact religion in a mechanical age is condemned if it takes any but a mechanical tone butlers thought was too moving too vital too evolutionary for the sceptics of his time in a rationalist encyclopaedic period religion also must give hard outline to its facts it must be able to display its secret to any sensible man in the language used by all sensible men miltons prophetic genius furnished the eighteenth century out of the depth of the passionate age before it with the theological tone it was to need in spite of the austere magnificence of his devotion he gives to smaller souls a dangerous lead the rigidity of scripture exegesis belonged to this stately but imperfectly sensitive mode of thought it passed away with the influence of the older rationalists whose precise denials matched the precise and limited affirmations of the static orthodoxy i shall then leave the specially biblical aspect of the debateinteresting as it is and even useful as in huxleys correspondence with the duke of argyll and others in 1892234in order to consider without complication the permanent elements of christian thought brought into question by the teaching of evolution such permanent elements are the doctrine of god as creator of the universe and the doctrine of man as spiritual and unique upon both the doctrine of evolution seemed to fall with crushing force with regard to man i leave out acknowledging a grave omission the doctrine of the fall and of sin and i do so because these have not yet as i believe been adequately treated here the fruitful reaction to the stimulus of evolution is yet to come the doctrine of sin indeed falls principally within the scope of that discussion which has followed or displaced the darwinian and without it the fall cannot be usefully considered for the question about the fall is a question not merely of origins but of the interpretation of moral facts whose moral reality must first be established i confine myself therefore to creation and the dignity of man the meaning of evolution in the most general terms is that the differentiation of forms is not essentially separate from their behaviour and use that if these are within the scope of study that is also that the world has taken the form we see by movements not unlike those we now see in progress that what may be called proximate origins are continuous in the way of force and matter continuous in the way of life with actual occurrences and actual characteristics all this has no revolutionary bearing upon the question of ultimate origins the whole is a statement about process it says nothing to metaphysicians about cause it simply brings within the scope of observation or conjecture that series of changes which has given their special characters to the different parts of the world we see in particular evolutionary science aspires to the discovery of the process or order of the appearance of life itself if it were to achieve its aim it could say nothing of the cause of this or indeed of the most familiar occurrences we should have become spectators or convinced historians of an event which in respect of its cause and ultimate meaning would be still impenetrable with regard to the origin of species supposing life already established biological science has the well founded hopes and the measure of success with which we are all familiar all this has it would seem little chance of collision with a consistent theism a doctrine which has its own difficulties unconnected with any particular view of order or process but when it was stated that species had arisen by processes through which new species were still being made evolutionism came into collision with a statement traditionally religious that species were formed and fixed once for all and long ago what is the theological import of such a statement when it is regarded as essential to belief in god simply that gods activity with respect to the formation of living creatures ceased at some point in past time god rested is made the touchstone of orthodoxy and when under the pressure of the evidences we found ourselves obliged to acknowledge and assert the present and persistent power of god in the maintenance and in the continued formation of types what happened was the abolition of a timelimit we were forced only to a bolder claim to a theistic language less halting more consistent more thorough in its own line as well as better qualified to assimilate and modify such schemes as von hartmanns philosophy of the unconsciousa philosophy by the way quite intolerant of a merely mechanical evolution235 here was not the retrenchment of an extravagant assertion but the expansion of one which was faltering and inadequate the traditional statement did not need paring down so as to pass the meshes of a new and exacting criticism it was itself a net meant to surround and enclose experience and we must increase its size and close its mesh to hold newly disclosed facts of life the world which had seemed a fixed picture or model gained first perspective and then solidity and movement we had a glimpse of organic history and christian thought became more living and more assured as it met the larger view of life however unsatisfactory the new attitude might be to our critics to christians the reform was positive what was discarded was a limitation a negation the movement was essentially conservative even actually reconstructive for the language disused was a language inconsistent with the definitions of orthodoxy it set bounds to the infinite and by implication withdrew from the creative rule all such processes as could be brought within the descriptions of research it ascribed fixity and finality to that creature in which an apostle taught us to recognise the birthstruggles of an unexhausted progress it tended to banish mystery from the world we see and to confine it to a remote first age in the reformed the restored language of religion creation became again not a link in a rational series to complete a circle of the sciences but the mysterious and permanent relation between the infinite and the finite between the moving changes we know in part and the power after the fashion of that observation unknown which is itself unmoved all motions source236 with regard to man it is hardly necessary even were it possible to illustrate the application of this bolder faith when the record of his high extraction fell under dispute we were driven to a contemplation of the whole of his life rather than of a part and that part out of sight we remembered again out of aristotle that the result of a process interprets its beginnings we were obliged to read the title of such dignity as we may claim in results and still more in aspirations some men still measure the value of great present facts in lifereason and virtue and sacrificeby what a selfdisparaged reason can collect of the meaner rudiments of these noble gifts mr balfour has admirably displayed the discrepancy in this view between the alleged origin and the alleged authority of reason such an argument ought to be used not to discredit the confident reason but to illuminate and dignify its dark beginnings and to show that at every step in the long course of growth a power was at work which is not included in any term or in all the terms of the series i submit that the more men know of actual christian teaching its fidelity to the past and its sincerity in face of discovery the more certainly they will judge that the stimulus of the doctrine of evolution has produced in the long run vigour as well as flexibility in the doctrine of creation and of man i pass from evolution in general to natural selection the character in religious language which i have for short called mechanical was not absent in the argument from design as stated before darwin it seemed to have reference to a world conceived as fixed it pointed not to the plastic capacity and energy of living matter but to the fixed adaptation of this and that organ to an unchanging place or function mr hobhouse has given us the valuable phrase a niche of organic opportunity such a phrase would have borne a different sense in nonevolutionary thought in that thought the opportunity was an opportunity for the creative power and design appeared in the preparation of the organism to fit the niche the idea of the niche and its occupant growing together from simpler to more complex mutual adjustment was unwelcome to this teleology if the adaptation was traced to the influence through competition of the environment the old teleology lost an illustration and a proof for the cogency of the proof in every instance depended upon the absence of explanation where the process of adaptation was discerned the evidence of purpose or design was weak it was strong only when the natural antecedents were not discovered strongest when they could be declared undiscoverable paleys favourite word is contrivance and for him contrivance is most certain where production is most obscure he points out the physiological advantage of the valvulae conniventes to man and the advantage for teleology of the fact that they cannot have been formed by action and pressure what is not due to pressure may be attributed to design and when a mechanical process more subtle than pressure was suggested the case for design was so far weakened the cumulative proof from the multitude of instances began to disappear when in selection a natural sequence was suggested in which all the adaptations might be reached by the motive power of life and especially when as in darwins teaching there was full recognition of the reactions of life to the stimulus of circumstance the organism fits the niche said the teleologist because the creator formed it so as to fit the organism fits the niche said the naturalist because unless it fitted it could not exist it was fitted to survive said the theologian it survives because it fits said the selectionist the two forms of statement are not incompatible but the new statement by provision of an ideally universal explanation of process was hostile to a doctrine of purpose which relied upon evidences always exceptional however numerous science persistently presses on to find the universal machinery of adaptation in this planet and whether this be found in selection or in directeffect or in vital reactions resulting in large changes or in a combination of these and other factors it must always be opposed to the conception of a divine power here and there but not everywhere active for science the divine must be constant operative everywhere and in every quality and power in environment and in organism in stimulus and in reaction in variation and in struggle in hereditary equilibrium and in the unstable state of species equally present on both sides of every strain in all pressures and in all resistances in short in the general wonder of life and the world and this is exactly what the divine power must be for religious faith the point i wish once more to make is that the necessary readjustment of teleology so as to make it depend upon the contemplation of the whole instead of a part is advantageous quite as much to theology as to science for the older view failed in courage here again our theism was not sufficiently theistic where results seemed inevitable it dared not claim them as godgiven in the argument from design it spoke not of god in the sense of theology but of a contriver immensely not infinitely wise and good working within a world the scene rather than the ever dependent outcome of his wisdom working in such emergencies and opportunities as occurred by forces not altogether within his control towards an end beyond himself it gave us instead of the awful reverence due to the cause of all substance and form all love and wisdom a dangerously detached appreciation of an ingenuity and benevolence meritorious in aim and often surprisingly successful in contrivance the old teleology was more useful to science than to religion and the designnaturalists ought to be gratefully remembered by biologists their search for evidences led them to an eager study of adaptations and of minute forms a study such as we have now an incentive to in the theory of natural selection one hardly meets with the same ardour in microscopical research until we come to modern workers but the argument from design was never of great importance to faith still to rid it of this character was worth all the stress and anxiety of the gallant old war if darwin had done nothing else for us we are today deeply in his debt for this the world is not less venerable to us now not less eloquent of the causing mind rather much more eloquent and sacred but our wonder is not that the underjaw of the swine works under the ground or in any or all of those particular adaptations which paley collected with so much skill but that a purpose transcending though resembling our own purposes is everywhere manifest that what we live in is a whole mutually sustaining eventful and beautiful where the dead forces feed the energies of life and life sustains a stranger existence able in some real measure to contemplate the whole of which mechanically considered it is a minor product and a rare ingredient here again the change was altogether positive it was not the escape of a vessel in a storm with loss of spars and rigging not a shortening of sail to save the masts and make a port of refuge it was rather the emergence from narrow channels to an open sea we had propelled the great ship finding purchase here and there for slow and uncertain movement now in deep water we spread large canvas to a favouring breeze the scattered traces of design might be forgotten or obliterated but the broad impression of order became plainer when seen at due distance and in sufficient range of effect and the evidence of love and wisdom in the universe could be trusted more securely for the loss of the particular calculation of their machinery many other topics of faith are affected by modern biology in some of these we have learnt at present only a wise caution a wise uncertainty we stand before the newly unfolded spectacle of suffering silenced with faith not scientifically reassured but still holding fast certain other clues of conviction in many important topics we are at a loss but in others and among them those i have mentioned we have passed beyond this negative state and find faith positively strengthened and more fully expressed we have gained also a language and a habit of thought more fit for the great and dark problems that remain less liable to damaging conflicts equipped for more rapid assimilation of knowledge and by this change biology itself is a gainer for relieved of fruitless encounters with popular religion it may advance with surer aim along the path of really scientific lifestudy which was reopened for modern men by the publication of the origin of species charles darwin regretted that in following science he had not done more direct good237 to his fellowcreatures he has in fact

theory could not fail to exert a considerable influence on the studies connected with the history of civilised man the speculations which are known as philosophy of history as well as the sciences of anthropology ethnography and sociology sciences which though they stand on their own feet are for the historian auxiliary have been deeply affected by these principles historiographers indeed have with few exceptions made little attempt to apply them but the growth of historical study in the nineteenth century has been determined and characterised by the same general principle which has underlain the simultaneous developments of the study of nature namely the genetic idea the historical conception of nature which has produced the history of the solar system the story of the earth the genealogies of telluric organisms and has revolutionised natural science belongs to the same order of thought as the conception of human history as a continuous genetic causal processa conception which has revolutionised historical research and made it scientific before proceeding to consider the application of evolutional principles it will be pertinent to notice the rise of this new view 2 with the greeks and romans history had been either a descriptive record or had been written in practical interests the most eminent of the ancient historians were pragmatical that is they regarded history as an instructress in statesmanship or in the art of war or in morals their records reached back such a short way their experience was so brief that they never attained to the conception of continuous process or realised the significance of time and they never viewed the history of human societies as a phenomenon to be investigated for its own sake in the middle ages there was still less chance of the emergence of the ideas of progress and development such notions were excluded by the fundamental doctrines of the dominant religion which bounded and bound mens minds as the course of history was held to be determined from hour to hour by the arbitrary will of an extra cosmic person there could be no selfcontained causal development only a dispensation imposed from without and as it was believed that the world was within no great distance from the end of this dispensation there was no motive to take much interest in understanding the temporal which was to be only temporary the intellectual movements of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries prepared the way for a new conception but it did not emerge immediately the historians of the renaissance period simply reverted to the ancient pragmatical view for machiavelli exactly as for thucydides and polybius the use of studying history was instruction in the art of politics the renaissance itself was the appearance of a new culture different from anything that had gone before but at the time men were not conscious of this they saw clearly that the traditions of classical antiquity had been lost for a long period and they were seeking to revive them but otherwise they did not perceive that the world had moved and that their own spirit culture and conditions were entirely unlike those of the thirteenth century it was hardly till the seventeenth century that the presence of a new age as different from the middle ages as from the ages of greece and rome was fully realised it was then that the triple division of ancient medieval and modern was first applied to the history of western civilisation whatever objections may be urged against this division which has now become almost a category of thought it marks a most significant advance in mans view of his own past he has become conscious of the immense changes in civilisation which have come about slowly in the course of time and history confronts him with a new aspect he has to explain how those changes have been produced how the transformations were effected the appearance of this problem was almost simultaneous with the rise of rationalism and the great historians and thinkers of the eighteenth century such as montesquieu voltaire gibbon attempted to explain the movement of civilisation by purely natural causes these brilliant writers prepared the way for the genetic history of the following century but in the spirit of the aufklrung that eighteenthcentury enlightenment to which they belonged they were concerned to judge all phenomena before the tribunal of reason and the apotheosis of reason tended to foster a certain superior a priori attitude which was not favourable to objective treatment and was incompatible with a historical sense moreover the traditions of pragmatical historiography had by no means disappeared 3 in the first quarter of the nineteenth century the meaning of genetic history was fully realised genetic perhaps is as good a word as can be found for the conception which in this century was applied to so many branches of knowledge in the spheres both of nature and of mind it does not commit us to the doctrine proper of evolution nor yet to any teleological hypothesis such as is implied in progress for history it meant that the present condition of the human race is simply and strictly the result of a causal series or set of causal seriesa continuous succession of changes where each state arises causally out of the preceding and that the business of historians is to trace this genetic process to explain each change and ultimately to grasp the complete development of the life of humanity three influential writers who appeared at this stage and helped to initiate a new period of research may specially be mentioned ranke in 1824 definitely repudiated the pragmatical view which ascribes to history the duties of an instructress and with no less decision renounced the function assumed by the historians of the aufklrung to judge the past it was his business he said merely to show how things really happened niebuhr was already working in the same spirit and did more than any other writer to establish the principle that historical transactions must be related to the ideas and conditions of their age savigny about the same time founded the historical school of law he sought to show that law was not the creation of an enlightened will but grew out of custom and was developed by a series of adaptations and rejections thus applying the conception of evolution he helped to diffuse the notion that all the institutions of a society or a nation are as closely interconnected as the parts of a living organism 4 the conception of the history of man as a causal development meant the elevation of historical inquiry to the dignity of a science just as the study of bees cannot become scientific so long as the students interest in them is only to procure honey or to derive moral lessons from the labours of the little busy bee so the history of human societies cannot become the object of pure scientific investigation so long as man estimates its value in pragmatical scales nor can it become a science until it is conceived as lying entirely within a sphere in which the law of cause and effect has unreserved and unrestricted dominion on the other hand once history is envisaged as a causal process which contains within itself the explanation of the development of man from his primitive state to the point which he has reached such a process necessarily becomes the object of scientific investigation and the interest in it is scientific curiosity at the same time the instruments were sharpened and refined here wolf a philologist with historical instinct was a pioneer his prolegomena to homer 1795 announced new modes of attack historical investigation was soon transformed by the elaboration of new methods 5 progress involves a judgment of value which is not involved in the conception of history as a genetic process it is also an idea distinct from that of evolution nevertheless it is closely related to the ideas which revolutionised history at the beginning of the last century it swam into mens ken simultaneously and it helped effectively to establish the notion of history as a continuous process and to emphasise the significance of time passing over earlier anticipations i may point to a discours of turgot 1750 where history is presented as a process in which the total mass of the human race marches continually though sometimes slowly to an ever increasing perfection that is a clear statement of the conception which turgots friend condorcet elaborated in the famous work published in 1795 esquisse dun tableau historique des progrs de lesprit humain this work first treated with explicit fulness the idea to which a leading role was to fall in the ideology of the nineteenth century condorcets book reflects the triumphs of the tiers tat whose growing importance had also inspired turgot it was the political changes in the eighteenth century which led to the doctrine emphatically formulated by condorcet that the masses are the most important element in the historical process i dwell on this because though condorcet had no idea of evolution the predominant importance of the masses was the assumption which made it possible to apply evolutional principles to history and it enabled condorcet himself to maintain that the history of civilisation a progress still far from being complete was a development conditioned by general laws 6 the assimilation of society to an organism which was a governing notion in the school of savigny and the conception of progress combined to produce the idea of an organic development in which the historian has to determine the central principle or leading character this is illustrated by the apotheosis of democracy in tocquevilles dmocratie en amrique where the theory is maintained that the gradual and progressive development of equality is at once the past and the future of the history of men the same two principles are combined in the doctrine of spencer who held that society is an organism though he also contemplated its being what he calls a superorganic aggregate238 that social evolution is a progressive change from militarism to industrialism 7 the idea of development assumed another form in the speculations of german idealism hegel conceived the successive periods of history as corresponding to the ascending phases or ideas in the selfevolution of his absolute being his lectures on the philosophy of history were published in 1837 after his death his philosophy had a considerable effect direct and indirect on the treatment of history by historians and although he was superficial and unscientific himself in dealing with historical phenomena he contributed much towards making the idea of historical development familiar ranke was influenced if not by hegel himself at least by the idealistic philosophies of which hegels was the greatest he was inclined to conceive the stages in the process of history as marked by incarnations as it were of ideas and sometimes speaks as if the ideas were independent forces with hands and feet but while hegel determined his ideas by a priori logic ranke obtained his by inductionby a strict investigation of the phenomena so that he was scientific in his method and work and was influenced by hegelian prepossessions only in the kind of significance which he was disposed to ascribe to his results it is to be noted that the theory of hegel implied a judgment of value the movement was a progress towards perfection 8 in france comte approached the subject from a different side and exercised outside germany a far wider influence than hegel the 4th volume of his cours de philosophie positive which appeared in 1839 created sociology and treated history as a part of this new science namely as social dynamics comte sought the key for unfolding historical development in what he called the socialpsychological point of view and he worked out the two ideas which had been enunciated by condorcet that the historians attention should be directed not as hitherto principally to eminent individuals but to the collective behaviour of the masses as being the most important element in the process and that as in nature so in history there are general laws necessary and constant which condition the development the two points are intimately connected for it is only when the masses are moved into the foreground that regularity uniformity and law can be conceived as applicable to determine the socialpsychological laws which have controlled the development is according to comte the task of sociologists and historians 9 the hypothesis of general laws operative in history was carried further in a book which appeared in england twenty years later and exercised an influence in europe far beyond its intrinsic merit buckles history of civilisation in england 185761 buckle owed much to comte and followed him or rather outdid him in regarding intellect as the most important factor conditioning the upward development of man so that progress according to him consisted in the victory of the intellectual over the moral laws 10 the tendency of comte and buckle to assimilate history to the sciences of nature by reducing it to general laws derived stimulus and plausibility from the vista offered by the study of statistics in which the belgian quetelet whose book sur lhomme appeared in 1835 discerned endless possibilities the astonishing uniformities which statistical inquiry disclosed led to the belief that it was only a question of collecting a sufficient amount of statistical material to enable us to predict how a given social group will act in a particular case bourdeau a disciple of this school looks forward to the time when historical science will become entirely quantitative the actions of prominent individuals which are generally considered to have altered or determined the course of things are obviously not amenable to statistical computation or explicable by general laws thinkers like buckle sought to minimise their importance or explain them away 11 these indications may suffice to show that the new efforts to interpret history which marked the first half of the nineteenth century were governed by conceptions closely related to those which were current in the field of natural science and which resulted in the doctrine of evolution the genetic principle progressive development general laws the significance of time the conception of society as an organic aggregate the metaphysical theory of history as the selfevolution of spiritall these ideas show that historical inquiry had been advancing independently on somewhat parallel lines to the sciences of nature it was necessary to bring this out in order to appreciate the influence of darwinism 12 in the course of the dozen years which elapsed between the appearances of the origin of species observe that the first volume of buckles work was published just two years before and of the descent of man 1871 the hypothesis of lamarck that man is the codescendant with other species of some lower extinct form was admitted to have been raised to the rank of an established fact by most thinkers whose brains were not working under the constraint of theological authority one important effect of the discovery of this fact i am not speaking now of the darwinian explanation was to assign to history a definite place in the coordinated whole of knowledge and relate it more closely to other sciences it had indeed a defined logical place in systems such as hegels and comtes but darwinism certified its standing convincingly and without more ado the prevailing doctrine that man was created ex abrupto had placed history in an isolated position disconnected with the sciences of nature anthropology which deals with the animal anthropos now comes into line with zoology and brings it into relation with history239 mans condition at the present day is the result of a series of transformations going back to the most primitive phase of society which is the ideal unattainable beginning of history but that beginning had emerged without any breach of continuity from a development which carries us back to a quadrimane ancestor still further back according to darwins conjecture to a marine animal of the ascidian type and then through remoter periods to the lowest form of organism it is essential in this theory that though links have been lost there was no break in the gradual development and this conception of a continuous progress in the evolution of life resulting in the appearance of uncivilised anthropos helped to reinforce and increase a belief in the conception of the history of civilised anthropos as itself also a continuous progressive development 13 thus the diffusion of the darwinian theory of the origin of man by emphasising the idea of continuity and breaking down the barriers between the human and animal kingdoms has had an important effect in establishing the position of history among the sciences which deal with telluric development the perspective of history is merged in a larger perspective of development as one of the objects of biology is to find the exact steps in the genealogy of man from the lowest organic form so the scope of history is to determine the stages in the unique causal series from the most rudimentary to the present state of human civilisation it is to be observed that the interest in historical research implied by this conception need not be that of comte in the positive philosophy history is part of sociology the interest in it is to discover the sociological laws in the view of which i have just spoken history is permitted to be an end in itself the reconstruction of the genetic process is an independent interest for the purpose of the reconstruction sociology as well as physical geography biology psychology is necessary the sociologist and the historian play into each others hands but the object of the former is to establish generalisations the aim of the latter is to trace in detail a singular causal sequence 14 the success of the evolutional theory helped to discredit the assumption or at least the invocation of transcendent causes philosophically of course it is compatible with theism but historians have for the most part desisted from invoking the naive conception of a god in history to explain historical movements a historian may be a theist but so far as his work is concerned this particular belief is otiose otherwise indeed as was remarked above history could not be a science for with a deus ex machina who can be brought on the stage to solve difficulties scientific treatment is a farce the transcendent element had appeared in a more subtle form through the influence of german philosophy i noticed how ranke is prone to refer to ideas as if they were transcendent existences manifesting themselves in the successive movements of history it is intelligible to speak of certain ideas as controlling in a given periodfor instance the idea of nationality but from the scientific point of view such ideas have no existence outside the minds of individuals and are purely psychical forces and a historical idea if it does not exist in this form is merely a way of expressing a synthesis of the historian himself 15 from the more general influence of darwinism on the place of history in the system of human knowledge we may turn to the influence of the principles and methods by which darwin explained development it had been recognised even by ancient writers such as aristotle and polybius that physical circumstances geography climate were factors conditioning the character and history of a race or society in the sixteenth century bodin emphasised these factors and many subsequent writers took them into account the investigations of darwin which brought them into the foreground naturally promoted attempts to discover in them the chief key to the growth of civilisation comte had expressly denounced the notion that the biological methods of lamarck could be applied to social man buckle had taken account of natural influences but had relegated them to a secondary plane compared with psychological factors but the darwinian theory made it tempting to explain the development of civilisation in terms of adaptation to environment struggle for existence natural selection survival of the fittest etc240 the operation of these principles cannot be denied man is still an animal subject to zoological as well as mechanical laws the dark influence of heredity continues to be effective and psychical development had begun in lower organic formsperhaps with life itself the organic and the social struggles for existence are manifestations of the same principle environment and climatic influence must be called in to explain not only the differentiation of the great racial sections of humanity but also the varieties within these subspecies and it may be the assimilation of distinct varieties ritters anthropogeography has opened a useful line of research but on the other hand it is urged that in explaining the course of history these principles do not take us very far and that it is chiefly for the primitive ultraprehistoric period that they can account for human development it may be said that so far as concerns the actions and movements of men which are the subject of recorded history physical environment has ceased to act mechanically and in order to affect their actions must affect their wills first and that this psychical character of the causal relations substantially alters the problem the development of human societies it may be argued derives a completely new character from the dominance of the conscious psychical element creating as it does new conditions inventions social institutions etc which limit and counteract the operation of natural selection and control and modify the influence of physical environment most thinkers agree now that the chief clews to the growth of civilisation must be sought in the psychological sphere imitation for instance is a principle which is probably more significant for the explanation of human development than natural selection darwin himself was conscious that his principles had only a very restricted application in this sphere as is evident from his cautious and tentative remarks in the 5th chapter of his descent of man he applied natural selection to the growth of the intellectual faculties and of the fundamental social instincts and also to the differentiation of the great races or subspecies caucasian african etc which differ in anthropological character241 16 but if it is admitted that the governing factors which concern the student of social development are of the psychical order the preliminary success of natural science in explaining organic evolution by general principles encouraged sociologists to hope that social evolution could be explained on general principles also the idea of condorcet buckle and others that history could be assimilated to the natural sciences was powerfully reinforced and the notion that the actual historical process and every social movement involved in it can be accounted for by sociological generalisations socalled laws is still entertained by many in one form or another dissentients from this view do not deny that the generalisations at which the sociologist arrives by the comparative method by the analysis of social factors and by psychological deduction may be an aid to the historian but they deny that such uniformities are laws or contain an explanation of the phenomena they can point to the element of chance coincidence this element must have played a part in the events of organic evolution but it has probably in a larger measure helped to determine events in social evolution the collision of two unconnected sequences may be fraught with great results the sudden death of a leader or a marriage without issue to take simple cases has again and again led to permanent political consequences more emphasis is laid on the decisive actions of individuals which cannot be reduced under generalisations and which deflect the course of events if the significance of the individual will had been exaggerated to the neglect of the collective activity of the social aggregate before condorcet his doctrine tended to eliminate as unimportant the roles of prominent men and by means of this elimination it was possible to found sociology but it may be urged that it is patent on the face of history that its course has constantly been shaped and modified by the wills of individuals242 which are by no means always the expression of the collective will and that the appearance of such personalities at the given moments is not a necessary outcome of the conditions and cannot be deduced nor is there any proof that if such and such an individual had not been born some one else would have arisen to do what he did in some cases there is no reason to think that what happened need ever have come to pass in other cases it seems evident that the actual change was inevitable but in default of the man who initiated and guided it it might have been postponed and postponed or not might have borne a different cachet i may illustrate by an instance which has just come under my notice modern painting was founded by giotto and the italian expedition of charles viii near the close of the sixteenth century introduced into france the fashion of imitating italian painters but for giotto and charles viii french painting might have been very different it may be said that if giotto had not appeared some other great imitator would have played a role analogous to his and that without charles viii there would have been the commerce with italy which in the long run would have sufficed to place france in relation with italian artists but the equivalent of giotto might have been deferred for a century and probably would have been different and commercial relations would have required ages to produce the rayonnement imitatif of italian art in france which the expedition of the royal adventurer provoked in a few years243 instances furnished by political history are simply endless can we conjecture how events would have moved if the son of philip of macedon had been an incompetent the aggressive action of prussia which astonished europe in 1740 determined the subsequent history of germany but that action was anything but inevitable it depended entirely on the personality of frederick the great hence it may be argued that the action of individual wills is a determining and disturbing factor too significant and effective to allow history to be grasped by sociological formulae the types and general forms of development which the sociologist attempts to disengage can only assist the historian in understanding the actual course of events it is in the special domains of economic history and culturgeschichte which have come to the front in modern times that generalisation is most fruitful but even in these it may be contended that it furnishes only partial explanations 17 the truth is that darwinism itself offers the best illustration of the insufficiency of general laws to account for historical development the part played by coincidence and the part played by individualslimited by and related to general social conditionsrender it impossible to deduce the course of the past history of man or to predict the future but it is just the same with organic development darwin or any other zoologist could not deduce the actual course of evolution from general principles given an organism and its environment he could not show that it must evolve into a more complex organism of a definite predetermined type knowing what it has evolved into he could attempt to discover and assign the determining causes general principles do not account for a particular sequence they embody necessary conditions but there is a chapter of accidents too it is the same in the case of history 18 among the evolutional attempts to subsume the course of history under general syntheses perhaps the most important is that of lamprecht whose kulturhistorische attempt to discover and assign the determining causes german history exhibits the indirect influence of the comtist school it is based upon psychology which in his views holds among the sciences of mind geisteswissenschaften the same place that of a grundwissenschaft which mechanics holds among the sciences of nature history by the same comparison corresponds to biology and according to him it can only become scientific if it is reduced to general concepts begriffe historical movements and events are of a psychical character and lamprecht conceives a given phase of civilisation as a collective psychical condition seelischer gesamtzustand controlling the period a diapason which penetrates all psychical phenomena and thereby all historical events of the time244 he has worked out a series of such phases ages of changing psychical diapason in his deutsche geschichte with the aim of showing that all the feelings and actions of each age can be explained by the diapason and has attempted to prove that these diapasons are exhibited in other social developments and are consequently not singular but typical he maintains further that these ages succeed each other in a definite order the principle being that the collective psychical development begins with the homogeneity of all the individual members of a society and through heightened psychical activity advances in the form of a continually increasing differentiation of the individuals this is akin to the spencerian formula this process evolving psychical freedom from psychical constraint exhibits a series of psychical phenomena which define successive periods of civilisation the process depends on two simple principles that no idea can disappear without leaving behind it an effect or influence and that all psychical life whether in a person or a society means change the acquisition of new mental contents it follows that the new have to come to terms with the old and this leads to a synthesis which determines the character of a new age hence the ages of civilisation are defined as the highest concepts for subsuming without exception all psychical phenomena of the development of human societies that is of all historical events245 lamprecht deduces the idea of a special historical science which might be called historical ethnology dealing with the ages of civilisation and bearing the same relation to descriptive or narrative history as ethnology to ethnography such a science obviously corresponds to comtes social dynamics and the comparative method on which comte laid so much emphasis is the principal instrument of lamprecht 19 i have dwelt on the fundamental ideas of lamprecht because they are not yet widely known in england and because his system is the ablest product of the sociological school of historians it carries the more weight as its author himself is a historical specialist and his historical syntheses deserve the most careful consideration but there is much in the process of development which on such assumptions is not explained especially the initiative of individuals historical development does not proceed in a right line without the choice of diverging again and again several roads are open to it of which it chooses onewhy on lamprechts method we may be able to assign the conditions which limit the psychical activity of men at a particular stage of evolution but within those limits the individual has so many options such a wide room for moving that the definition of those conditions the psychical diapasons is only part of the explanation of the particular development the heel of achilles in all historical speculations of this class has been the role of the individual the increasing prominence of economic history has tended to encourage the view that history can be explained in terms of general concepts or types marx and his school based their theory of human development on the conditions of production by which according to them all social movements and historical changes are entirely controlled the leading part which economic factors play in lamprechts system is significant illustrating the fact that economic changes admit most readily this kind of treatment because they have been less subject to direction or interference by individual pioneers perhaps it may be thought that the conception of social environment essentially psychical on which lamprechts psychical diapasons depend is the most valuable and fertile conception that the historian owes to the suggestion of the science of biologythe conception of all particular historical actions and movements as 1 related to and conditioned by the social environment and 2 gradually bringing about a transformation of that environment but no given transformation can be proved to be necessary predetermined and types of development do not represent laws their meaning and value lie in the help they may give to the historian in investigating a certain period of civilisation to enable him to discover the interrelations among the diverse features which it presents they are as some one has said an instrument of heuretic method 20 the man engaged in special historical researcheswhich have been pursued unremittingly for a century past according to scientific methods of investigating evidence initiated by wolf niebuhr rankehave for the most part worked on the assumptions of genetic history or at least followed in the footsteps of those who fully grasped the genetic point of view but their aim has been to collect and sift evidence and determine particular facts comparatively few have given serious thought to the lines of research and the speculations which have been considered in this paper they have been reasonably shy of compromising their work by applying theories which are still much debated and immature but historiography cannot permanently evade the questions raised by these theories one may venture to say that no historical change or transformation will be fully understood until it is explained how social environment acted on the individual components of the society both immediately and by heredity and how the individuals reacted upon their environment the problem is psychical but it is analogous to the main problem of the biologist footnotes footnote 238 a society presents suggestive analogies with an organism but it certainly is not an organism and sociologists who draw inferences from the assumption of its organic nature must fall into error a vital organism and a society are radically distinguished by the fact that the individual components of the former namely the cells are morphologically as well as functionally differentiated whereas the individuals which compose a society are morphologically homogeneous and only functionally differentiated the resemblances and the differences are worked out in e de majewskis striking book la science de la civilisation paris 1908 footnote 239 it is to be observed that history is not only different in scope but not coextensive with anthropology in time for it deals only with the development of man in societies whereas anthropology includes in its definition the protoanthropic period when anthropos was still nonsocial whether he lived in herds like the chimpanzee or alone like the male ourangoutang it has been well shown by majewski that congregationsherds flocks packs cof animals are not societies the characteristic of a society is differentiation of function bee hives ant hills may be called quasisocieties but in their case the classes which perform distinct functions are morphologically different footnote 240 recently o seeck has applied these principles to the decline of graecoroman civilisation in his untergang der antiken welt 2 vols berlin 1895 1901 footnote 241 darwinian formulae may be suggestive by way of analogy for instance it is characteristic of social advance that a multitude of inventions schemes and plans are framed which are never carried out similar to or designed for the same end as an invention or plan which is actually adopted because it has chanced to suit better the particular conditions of the hour just as the works accomplished by an individual statesman artist or savant are usually only a residue of the numerous projects conceived by his brain this process in which so much abortive production occurs is analogous to elimination by natural selection footnote 242 we can ignore here the metaphysical question of freewill and determinism for the character of the individuals brain depends in any case on antenatal accidents and coincidences

professor of social philosophy in the university of toulouse and deputyprofessor at the sorbonne paris how has our conception of social phenomena and of their history been affected by darwins conception of nature and the laws of its transformation to what extent and in what particular respects have the discoveries and hypotheses of the author of the origin of species aided the efforts of those who have sought to construct a science of society to such a question it is certainly not easy to give any brief or precise answer we find traces of darwinism almost everywhere sociological systems differing widely from each other have laid claim to its authority while on the other hand its influence has often made itself felt only in combination with other influences the darwinian thread is worked into a hundred patterns along with other threads to deal with the problem we must it seems first of all distinguish the more general conclusions in regard to the evolution of living beings which are the outcome of darwinism from the particular explanations it offers of the ways and means by which that evolution is effected that is to say we must as far as possible estimate separately the influence of darwin as an evolutionist and darwin as a selectionist the nineteenth century said cournot has witnessed a mighty effort to rintgrer lhomme dans la nature from divers quarters there has been a methodical reaction against the persistent dualism of the cartesian tradition which was itself the unconscious heir of the christian tradition even the philosophy of the eighteenth century materialistic as were for the most part the tendencies of its leaders seemed to revere man as a being apart concerning whom laws might be formulated priori to bring him down from his pedestal there was needed the marked predominance of positive researches wherein no account was taken of the pride of man there can be no doubt that darwin has done much to familiarise us with this attitude take for instance the first part of the descent of man it is an accumulation of typical facts all tending to diminish the distance between us and our brothers the lower animals one might say that the naturalist had here taken as his motto whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted homologous structures the survival in man of certain organs of animals the rudiments in the animal of certain human faculties a multitude of facts of this sort led darwin to the conclusion that there is no ground for supposing that the king of the universe is exempt from universal laws thus belief in the imperium in imperio has been as it were whittled away by the progress of the naturalistic spirit itself continually strengthened by the conquests of the natural sciences the tendency may indeed drag the social sciences into overstrained analogies such for instance as the assimilation of societies to organisms but it will at least have had the merit of helping sociology to shake off the preconception that the groups formed by men are artificial and that history is completely at the mercy of chance some years before the appearance of the origin of species august comte had pointed out the importance as regards the unification of positive knowledge of the conviction that the social world the last refuge of spiritualism is itself subject to determinism it cannot be doubted that the movement of thought which darwins discoveries promoted contributed to the spread of this conviction by breaking down the traditional barrier which cut man off from nature but nature according to modern naturalists is no immutable thing it is rather perpetual movement continual progression their discoveries batter a breach directly into the aristotelian notion of species they refuse to see in the animal world a collection of immutable types distinct from all eternity and corresponding as cuvier said to so many particular thoughts of the creator darwin especially congratulated himself upon having been able to deal this doctrine the coup de grce immutability is he says his chief enemy and he is concerned to showtherein following up lyells workthat everything in the organic world as in the inorganic is explained by insensible but incessant transformations nature makes no leapsnature knows no gaps these two dicta form as it were the two landmarks between which darwins idea of transformation is worked out that is to say the development of darwinism is calculated to further the application of the philosophy of becoming to the study of human institutions the progress of the natural sciences thus brings unexpected reinforcements to the revolution which the progress of historical discipline had begun the first attempt to constitute an actual science of social phenomenathat namely of the economistshad resulted in laws which were called natural and which were believed to be eternal and universal valid for all times and all places but this perpetuality brother as knies said of the immutability of the old zoology did not long hold out against the everswelling tide of the historical movement knowledge of the transformations that had taken place in language of the early phases of the family of religion of property had all favoured the revival of the heraclitean view greek panta rei as to the categories of political economy it was soon to be recognised as by lasalle that they too are only historical the philosophy of history moreover gave expression under various forms to the same tendency hegel declares that all that is real is rational but at the same time he shows that all that is real is ephemeral and that for history there is nothing fixed beneath the sun it is this sense of universal evolution that darwin came with fresh authority to enlarge it was in the name of biological facts themselves that he taught us to see only slow metamorphoses in the history of institutions and to be always on the outlook for survivals side by side with rudimentary forms anyone who reads primitive culture by tylora writer closely connected with darwinwill be able to estimate the services which these cardinal ideas were to render to the social sciences when the age of comparative research had succeeded to that of priori construction let us note moreover that the philosophy of becoming in passing through the darwinian biology became as it were filtered it got rid of those traces of finalism which under different forms it had preserved through all the systems of german romanticism even in herbert spencer it has been plausibly argued one can detect something of that sort of mystic confidence in forces spontaneously directing life which forms the very essence of those systems but darwins observations were precisely calculated to render such an hypothesis futile at first people may have failed to see this and we call to mind the ponderous sarcasms of flourens when he objected to the theory of natural selection that it attributed to nature a power of free choice nature endowed with will that was the final error of last century but the nineteenth no longer deals in personifications246 in fact darwin himself put his readers on their guard against the metaphors he was obliged to use the processes by which he explains the survival of the fittest are far from affording any indication of the design of some transcendent breeder nor if we look closely do they even imply immanent effort in the animal the sorting out can be brought about mechanically simply by the action of the environment in this connection huxley could with good reason maintain that darwins originality consisted in showing how harmonies which hitherto had been taken to imply the agency of intelligence and will could be explained without any such intervention so when later on objective sociology declares that even when social phenomena are in question all finalist preconceptions must be distrusted if a science is to be constituted it is to darwin that its thanks are due he had long been clearing paths for it which lay well away from the old familiar road trodden by so many theories of evolution this antifinalist doctrine when fully worked out was moreover calculated to aid in the needful dissociation of two notions that of evolution and that of progress in application to society these had long been confounded and as a consequence the general idea seemed to be that only one type of evolution was here possible do we not detect such a view in comtes sociology and perhaps even in herbert spencers whoever indeed assumes an end for evolution is naturally inclined to think that only one road leads to that end but those whose minds the darwinian theory has enlightened are aware that the transformations of living beings depend primarily upon their conditions and that it is these conditions which are the agents of selection from among individual variations hence it immediately follows that transformations are not necessarily improvements here darwins thought hesitated logically his theory proves as ray lankester pointed out that the struggle for existence may have as its outcome degeneration as well as amelioration evolution may be regressive as well as progressive then tooand this is especially to be borne in mindeach species takes its good where it finds it seeks its own path and survives as best it can apply this notion to society and you arrive at the theory of multilinear evolution divergencies will no longer surprise you you will be forewarned not to apply to all civilisations the same measure of progress and you will recognise that types of evolution may differ just as social species themselves differ have we not here one of the conceptions which mark off sociology proper from the old philosophy of history but if we are to estimate the influence of darwinism upon sociological conceptions we must not dwell only upon the way in which darwin impressed the general notion of evolution upon the minds of thinkers we must go into details we must consider the influence of the particular theories by which he explained the mechanism of this evolution the name of the author of the origin of species has been especially attached as everyone knows to the doctrines of natural selection and of struggle for existence completed by the notion of individual variation these doctrines were turned to account by very different schools of social philosophy pessimistic and optimistic aristocratic and democratic individualistic and socialistic systems were to war with each other for years by casting scraps of darwinism at each others heads it was the spectacle of human contrivance that suggested to darwin his conception of natural selection it was in studying the methods of pigeon breeders that he divined the processes by which nature in the absence of design obtains analogous results in the differentiation of types as soon as the importance of artificial selection in the transformation of species of animals was understood reflection naturally turned to the human species and the question arose how far do men observe in connection with themselves those laws of which they make practical application in the case of animals here we come upon one of the ideas which guided the researches of gallon darwins cousin the author of inquiries into human faculty and its development247 has often expressed his surprise that considering all the precautions taken for example in the breeding of horses none whatever are taken in the breeding of the human species it seems to be forgotten that the species suffers when the fittest are not able to perpetuate their type ritchie in his darwinism and politics248 reminds us of darwins remark that the institution of the peerage might be defended on the ground that peers owing to the prestige they enjoy are enabled to select as wives the most beautiful and charming women out of the lower ranks249 but says galton it is as often as not heiresses that they pick out and birth statistics seem to show that these are either less robust or less fecund than others the truth is that considerations continue to preside over marriage which are entirely foreign to the improvement of type much as this is a condition of general progress hence the importance of completing odins and de candolles statistics which are designed to show how characters are incorporated in organisms how they are transmitted how lost and according to what law eugenic elements depart from the mean or return to it but thinkers do not always content themselves with undertaking merely the minute researches which the idea of selection suggests they are eager to defend this or that thesis in the name of this idea certain social anthropologists have recast the conception of the process of civilisation and have affirmed that social selection generally works against the trend of natural selection vacher de lapougefollowing up an observation by broca on the pointenumerates the various institutions or customs such as the celibacy of priests and military conscription which cause elimination or sterilisation of the bearers of certain superior qualities intellectual or physical in a more general way he attacks the democratic movement a movement as p bourget says which is antiphysical and contrary to the natural laws of progress though it has been inspired by the dreams of that most visionary of all centuries the eighteenth250 the equality which levels down and mixes justly condemned he holds by the comte de gobineau prevents the aristocracy of the blond dolichocephales from holding the position and playing the part which in the interests of all should belong to them otto ammon in his natural selection in man and in the social order and its natural bases251 defended analogous doctrines in germany setting the curve representing frequency of talent over against that of income he attempted to show that all democratic measures which aim at promoting the rise in the social scale of the talented are useless if not dangerous that they only increase the panmixia to the great detriment of the species and of society among the aristocratic theories which darwinism has thus inspired we must reckon that of nietzsche it is well known that in order to complete his philosophy he added biological studies to his philological and more than once in his remarks upon the wille zur macht he definitely alludes to darwin though it must be confessed that it is generally in order to proclaim the insufficiency of the processes by which darwin seeks to explain the genesis of species nevertheless nietzsches mind is completely possessed by an ideal of selection he too has a horror of panmixia the naturalists conception of the fittest is joined by him to that of the hero of romance to furnish a basis for his doctrine of the superman let us hasten to add moreover that at the very moment when support was being sought in the theory of selection for the various forms of the aristocratic doctrine those same forms were being battered down on another side by means of that very theory attention was drawn to the fact that by virtue of the laws which darwin himself had discovered isolation leads to etiolation there is a risk that the privilege which withdraws the privileged elements of society from competition will cause them to degenerate in fact jacoby in his studies in selection in connexion with heredity in man252 concludes that sterility mental debility premature death and finally the extinction of the stock were not specially and exclusively the fate of sovereign dynasties all privileged classes all families in exclusively elevated positions share the fate of reigning families although in a minor degree and in direct proportion to the loftiness of their social standing from the mass of human beings spring individuals families races which tend to raise themselves above the common level painfully they climb the rugged heights attain the summits of power of wealth of intelligence of talent and then no sooner are they there than they topple down and disappear in gulfs of mental and physical degeneracy the demographical researches of hansen253 following up and completing dumonts tended indeed to show that urban as well as feudal aristocracies burgher classes as well as noble castes were liable to become effete hence it might well be concluded that the democratic movement operating as it does to break down class barriers was promoting instead of impeding human selection so we see that according to the point of view very different conclusions have been drawn from the application of the darwinian idea of selection to human society darwins other central idea closely bound up with this that namely of the struggle for existence also has been diversely utilised but discussion has chiefly centered upon its signification and while some endeavour to extend its application to everything we find others trying to limit its range the conception of a struggle for existence has in the present day been taken up into the social sciences from natural science and adopted but originally it descended from social science to natural darwins law is as he himself said only malthus law generalised and extended to the animal world a growing disproportion between the supply of food and the number of the living is the fatal order whence arises the necessity of universal struggle a struggle which to the great advantage of the species allows only the best equipped individuals to survive nature is regarded by huxley as an immense arena where all living beings are gladiators254 such a generalisation was well adapted to feed the stream of pessimistic thought and it furnished to the apologists of war in particular new arguments weighted with all the authority which in these days attaches to scientific deliverances if people no longer say as bonald did and moltke after him that war is a providential fact they yet lay stress on the point that it is a natural fact to the peace party dragomirovs objection is urged that its attempts are contrary to the fundamental laws of nature and that no sea wall can hold against breakers that come with such gathered force but in yet another quarter darwinism was represented as opposed to philanthropic intervention the defenders of the orthodox political economy found in it support for their tenets since in the organic world universal struggle is the condition of progress it seemed obvious that free competition must be allowed to reign unchecked in the economic world attempts to curb it were in the highest degree imprudent the spirit of liberalism here seemed in conformity with the trend of nature in this respect at least contemporary naturalism offspring of the discoveries of the nineteenth century brought reinforcements to the individualist doctrine begotten of the speculations of the eighteenth but only it appeared to turn mankind away for ever from humanitarian dreams would those whom such conclusions repelled be content to oppose to natures imperatives only the protests of the heart there were some who declared like brunetire that the laws in question valid though they might be for the animal kingdom were not applicable to the human and so a return was made to the classic dualism this indeed seems to be the line that huxley took when for instance he opposed to the cosmic process an ethical process which was its reverse but the number of thinkers whom this antithesis does not satisfy grows daily although the pessimism which claims authorisation from darwins doctrines is repugnant to them they still are unable to accept the dualism which leaves a gulf between man and nature and their endeavour is to link the two by showing that while darwins laws obtain in both kingdoms the conditions of their application are not the same their forms and consequently their results vary with the varying mediums in which the struggle of living beings takes place with the means these beings have at disposal with the ends even which they propose to themselves here we have the explanation of the fact that among determined opponents of war partisans of the struggle for existence can be found there are disciples of darwin in the peace party novicow for example admits the combat universel of which le dantec255 speaks but he remarks that at different stages of evolution at different stages of life the same weapons are not necessarily employed struggles of brute force armed hand to hand conflicts may have been a necessity in the early phases of human societies nowadays although competition may remain inevitable and indispensable it can assume milder forms economic rivalries struggles between intellectual influences suffice to stimulate progress the processes which these admit are in the actual state of civilisation the only ones which attain their end without waste the only ones logical from one end to the other of the ladder of life struggle is the order of the day but more and more as the higher rungs are reached it takes on characters which are proportionately more humane reflections of this kind permit the introduction into the economic order of limitations to the doctrine of laisser faire laisser passer this appeals it is said to the example of nature where creatures left to themselves struggle without truce and without mercy but the fact is forgotten that upon industrial battlefields the conditions are different the competitors here are not left simply to their natural energies they are variously handicapped a rich store of artificial resources exists in which some participate and others do not the sides then are unequal and as a consequence the result of the struggle is falsified in the animal world said de laveleye256 criticising spencer the fate of each creature is determined by its individual qualities whereas in civilised societies a man may obtain the highest position and the most beautiful wife because he is rich and wellborn although he may be ugly idle or improvident and then it is he who will perpetuate the species the wealthy man ill constituted incapable sickly enjoys his riches and establishes his stock under the protection of the laws haycraft in england and jentsch in germany have strongly emphasised these anomalies which nevertheless are the rule that is to say that even from a darwinian point of view all social reforms can readily be justified which aim at diminishing as wallace said inequalities at the start but we can go further still whence comes the idea that all measures inspired by the sentiment of solidarity are contrary to natures trend observe her carefully and she will not give lessons only in individualism side by side with the struggle for existence do we not find in operation what lanessan calls association for existence long ago espinas had drawn attention to societies of animals temporary or permanent and to the kind of morality that arose in them since then naturalists have often insisted upon the importance of various forms of symbiosis kropotkin in mutual aid has chosen to enumerate many examples of altruism furnished by animals to mankind geddes and thomson went so far as to maintain that each of the greater steps of progress is in fact associated with an increased measure of subordination of individual competition to reproductive or social ends and of interspecific competition to cooperative association257 experience shows according to geddes that the types which are fittest to surmount great obstacles are not so much those who engage in the fiercest competitive struggle for existence as those who contrive to temper it from all these observations there resulted along with a limitation of darwinian pessimism some encouragement for the aspirations of the collectivists and darwin himself would doubtless have subscribed to these rectifications he never insisted like his rival wallace upon the necessity of the solitary struggle of creatures in a state of nature each for himself and against all on the contrary in the descent of man he pointed out the serviceableness of the social instincts and corroborated bagehots statements when the latter applying laws of physics to politics showed the great advantage societies derived from intercourse and communion again the theory of sexual evolution which makes the evolution of types depend increasingly upon preferences judgments mental factors surely offers something to qualify what seems hard and brutal in the theory of natural selection but as often happens with disciples the darwinians had outdarwined darwin the extravagances of social darwinism provoked a useful reaction and thus people were led to seek even in the animal kingdom for facts of solidarity which would serve to justify humane effort on quite another line however an attempt has been made to connect socialist tendencies with darwinian principles marx and darwin have been confronted and writers have undertaken to show that the work of the german philosopher fell readily into line with that of the english naturalist and was a development of it such has been the endeavour of ferri in italy and of woltmann in germany not to mention others the founders of scientific socialism had moreover themselves thought of this reconciliation they make more than one allusion to darwin in works which appeared after 1859 and sometimes they use his theory to define by contrast their own ideal they remark that the capitalist system by giving free course to individual competition ends indeed in a bellum omnium contra omnes and they make it clear that darwinism thus understood is as repugnant to them as to dhring but it is at the scientific and not at the moral point of view that they place themselves when they connect their economic history with darwins work thanks to this unifying hypothesis they claim to have constructedas marx does in his preface to das kapitala veritable natural history of social evolution engels speaks in praise of his friend marx as having discovered the true mainspring of history hidden under the veil of idealism and sentimentalism and as having proclaimed in the primum vivere the inevitableness of the struggle for existence marx himself in das kapital indicated another analogy when he dwelt upon the importance of a general technology for the explanation of this psychologya history of tools which would be to social organs what darwinism is to the organs of animal species and the very importance they attach to tools to apparatus to machines abundantly proves that neither marx nor engels were likely to forget the special characters which mark off the human world from the animal the former always remains to a great extent an artificial world inventions change the face of its institutions new modes of production revolutionise not only modes of government but modes even of collective thought therefore it is that the evolution of society is controlled by laws special to it of which the spectacle of nature offers no suggestion if however even in this special sphere it can still be urged that the evolution of the material conditions of society is in accord with darwins theory it is because the influence of the methods of production is itself to be explained by the incessant strife of the various classes with each other so that in the end marx like darwin finds the source of all progress is in struggle both are grandsons of heraclitusgreek polemos patr pantn it sometimes happens in these days that the doctrine of revolutionary socialism is contrasted as rude and healthy with what may seem to be the enervating tendency of solidarist philanthropy the apologists of the doctrine then pride themselves above all upon their faithfulness to darwinian principles so far we have been mainly concerned to show the use that social philosophies have made of the darwinian laws for practical purposes in order to orientate society towards their ideals each school tries to show that the authority of natural science is on its side but even in the most objective of theories those which systematically make abstraction of all political tendencies in order to study the social reality in itself traces of darwinism are readily to be found let us take for example durkheims theory of division of labour258 the conclusions he derives from it are that whenever professional specialisation causes multiplication of distinct branches of activity we get organic solidarityimplying differencessubstituted for mechanical solidarity based upon likenesses the umbilical cord as marx said which connects the individual consciousness with the collective consciousness is cut the personality becomes more and more emancipated but on what does this phenomenon so big with consequences itself depend the author goes to social morphology for the answer it is he says the growing density of population which brings with it this increasing differentiation of activities but again why because the greater density in thrusting men up against each other augments the intensity of their competition for the means of existence and for the problems which society thus has to face differentiation of functions presents itself as the gentlest solution here one sees that the writer borrows directly from darwin competition is at its maximum between similars darwin had declared different species not laying claim to the same food could more easily coexist here lay the explanation of the fact that upon the same oak hundreds of different insects might be found other things being equal the same applies to society he who finds some unadopted specialty possesses a means of his own for getting a living it is by this division of their manifold tasks that men contrive not to crush each other here we obviously have a darwinian law serving as intermediary in the explanation of that progress of division of labour which itself explains so much in the social evolution and we might take another example at the other end of the series of sociological systems g tarde is a sociologist with the most pronounced antinaturalistic views he has attempted to show that all application of the laws of natural science to society is misleading in his opposition universelle he has directly combatted all forms of sociological darwinism according to him the idea that the evolution of society can be traced on the same plan as the evolution of species is chimerical social evolution is at the mercy of all kinds of inventions which by virtue of the laws of imitation modify through individual to individual through neighbourhood to neighbourhood the general state of those beliefs and desires which are the only quantities whose variation matters to the sociologist but it may be rejoined that however psychical the forces may be they are none the less subject to darwinian laws they compete with each other they struggle for the mastery of minds between types of ideas as between organic forms selection operates and though it may be that these types are ushered into the arena by unexpected discoveries we yet recognise in the psychological accidents which tarde places at the base of everything near relatives of those small accidental variations upon which darwin builds thus accepting tardes own representations it is quite possible to express in darwinian terms with the necessary transpositions one of the most idealistic sociologies that have ever been constructed these few examples suffice they enable us to estimate the extent of the field of influence of darwinism it affects sociology not only through the agency of its advocates but through that of its opponents the questions to which it has given rise have proved no less fruitful than the solutions it has suggested in short few doctrines in the history of social philosophy will have produced on their passage a finer crop of ideas footnotes footnote 246 p flourens examen du livre de m darwin sur lorigine des espces
