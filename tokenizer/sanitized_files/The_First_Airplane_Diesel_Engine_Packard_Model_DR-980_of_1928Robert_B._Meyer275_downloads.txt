of its introduction in 1928 airplane diesel engines were being tested in england by rollsroyce in france by panhard in germany by junkers in italy by fiat and in the united states by guiberson packard had demonstrated to the world the remarkable economy and safety of the airplane diesel engine and the response was immediate and favorable the novelty and performance of the packard diesel assured it a large and attentive audience wherever it was exhibited yet in spite of its performance record the engine was doomed to failure by reason of its design and it was further handicapped by having been rushed into production before it could be thoroughly tested history the official beginning of the packard diesel engine can be traced to a license agreement dated august 18 1927 between alvan macauley president of the packard motor car company of detroit michigan and dipl ing hermann i a dorner a diesel engine inventor of hanover germany1 before the agreement was drawn up capt lionel m woolson chief aeronautical engineer for packard tested an aircooled and a watercooled diesel that dorner had designed and built in germany2 both engines attained the then high revolutions per minute of 2000 and proved efficient and durable they demonstrated the practicability of dorners patented solid type of fuel injection which formed the basis of the packard diesels design3 using elements from dorners engines woolson and dorner designed the packard diesel with the help of packard engineers and dorners assistant adolph widmann woolson was responsible for the weightsaving features and dorner for the combustion system the historic first flight took place on september 19 1928 at the packard proving grounds in utica michigan just a year and a month from the day dorner agreed to join the packard team woolson and walter e lees packards chief test pilot used a stinson sm1dx detroiter the flight was so successful and later tests were so encouraging that packard built a 650000 plant during the first half of 1929 solely for the production of its diesel engine the factory was designed to employ more than 600 men and 500 engines a month were to have been manufactured by july 19294 illustration

the engines first crosscountry flight was accomplished on may 13 1929 when lees flew the stinson sm1dx detroiter from detroit michigan to norfolk virginia carrying woolson to the annual field day of the national advisory committee for aeronautics at langley field the 700mile trip was flown in 612 hours and the cost of the fuel consumed was 468 had the airplane been powered with a comparable gasoline engine the fuel cost would have been about 5 times as great5 on march 9 1930 using the same airplane and engine lees and woolson flew from detroit michigan to miami florida a distance of 1100 miles in 10 hours and 15 minutes with a fuel cost of 850 the production engine slightly refined from the original received the first approved type certificate issued for any diesel aircraft engine on march 6 1930 the department of commerce granted certificate no 43 after the packard company had ground and flighttested this type of engine for approximately 338000 hp hr or about 1500 hr of

over jacksonville florida this event was so important that it was the basis of the following editorial published in the july 1931 issue of aviation7 which summarizes so well the progress made by the diesel engine over a 3year period and the hope held for its future a record crosses the atlanticthe diesel engine took its first step toward acceptance as a powerplant for heavierthanair craft when in the summer of 1928 a dieselpowered machine first flew the second step was made at the 1930 detroit show when the engine went on commercial sale the third was accomplished last month when a plane with a compressionignition engine using furnace oil as a fuel circled over the beaches around jacksonville for 84 hours and inscribed its performance upon the books as a worlds recordthe longest flight ever made without intermediate refueling with the passing of the refuelingduration excitement and with the apparent decision to allow that record to stand permanently at its present level trials for straight time in the air without replenishment of supplies begin to regain a proper degree of appreciation no other record unless it be some of those for speed with substantial dead loads is of such importance as the nonstop distance and duration marks no other has such bearing upon precisely those qualities of aerodynamic efficiency fuel economy and reliability of airplane and powerplant that most affect commercial usefulness it is more than three years since the duration record left american shores and it has been more than doubled in that time its return is very welcome it is doubly welcome for being made with a fundamentally new type of engine the diesel principle is not a commercial monopoly it is open to anyone already two different designs in america and one or two in europe have been in the air for certain purposes at least it seems reasonable to expect that its special advantages will bring it into widespread use every practical demonstration of the progress of the diesel toward realizing its theoretical possibilities in the air as it has realized them on the land and at sea is a bit of progress toward better and more economical commercial flying and so benefits the whole industry the fourth and next main element in the demonstration will be provided when diesels go into regular service on some wellknown transport line as standard equipment and the accumulation of data on performance under normal service conditions begins we believe that that will happen before the end of 1932 many men from dr rudolf diesel to walter lees and frederic brossy have had direct or indirect hands in the making of this record the greatest of all contributions was that of lionel m woolson who created the engine and flew with it in every test and brought it through its early troubles to the point of readiness for the commercial market the flight that lasted four days and three nights is his memorial quite as much as is the bronze plaque unveiled last april in the detroit show hangar illustration figure 6stinson sm1dx detroiter this airplane powered with original packard dr980 diesel engine made the worlds first dieselpowered flight on september 19

the formal presentation was made at the white house march 31 1932 by president hoover on behalf of the national aeronautic association alvan macauley president of the packard motor car company accepted the trophy saying we do not claim mr president that we have reached the final development even though our diesel aircraft engine is an accomplished fact and we have the pioneers joy of knowing that we have successfully accomplished what had not been done before8 the amazing early success of the packard diesel is illustrated by the following chronological summary 1927license

february 1932 smithsonian photo a49674 the engine did not fail for the above mentioned reasons capt woolsons death was indeed unfortunate but there were others connected with the project who carried on his work for three years after he passed away the big depression was also unfortunate but it did not stop aeronautical engine development it was a time when such an engine would have been most welcome if it had been produced in large enough numbers to bring the price down to compare favorably pricewise with gas engines of the same horsepower class10 the packard diesel failed because it was not a good engine it was an ingenious engine and two of the several features it pioneered the use of magnesium and of a dynamically balanced crankshaft survive in modern reciprocating engine designs in addition when it was first introduced no other engine could match it for economical fuel consumption and fuel safety it also had other less important advantages but its disadvantages outweighed all these advantages as will be seen description specifications the following specifications are for the production engine and its prototypes known as the model dr98011 type 4stroke cycle diesel cylinders

diesel engine compared with those of a 4stroke cycle gasoline engine are illustrated in figure 21 illustration brief analysis of action in a fourcycle gasoline engine mixture of air and gasoline enters cylinder from carburetor mixture is compressed into smaller volume by piston moving upward an electric spark ignites the compressed mixture causing it to explode combustion heat increases the cylinder pressure forcing piston downward momentum carries piston upward which pushes burnt gases out through the exhaust valve similar action in the packarddiesel aircraft engine atmospheric air only enters cylinder through single valve air is so greatly compressed by upward moving piston that it reaches temperature of 1000 f just before piston is at dead center fuel oil is sprayed into cylinder and spontaneously ignited power of this explosion is passed to crankshaft in conventional manner piston forces out burnt gases through same single valve which is cooled by inrush of new air as cycle repeats figure 21operating cycles smithsonian photo a48846 although the size weight and general arrangement of the packard diesel did not differ radically from conventional gasoline engines of a similar type there were definite differences caused by the diesel cycle in the words of capt woolson12 as this engine operates on an entirely different principle than the gasoline engines used heretofore in aircraft it is desirable before launching into a mechanical description to consider first in a general way the principles of operation of the diesel cycle as opposed to the otto cycle principle on which nearly all gasoline engines operate the real point of departure between the two systems of operation is the ignition system involved in the gasoline engine an electric spark is depended upon to fire a combustible mixture of gasoline vapor and air which mixture ratio must be maintained within rather narrow limits to be fired by this method in the diesel engine air alone is introduced into the cylinders instead of a mixture of air and fuel as in the gasoline engine and this air is compressed into much smaller space than is possible when using a mixture of gasoline and air which would spontaneously and prematurely detonate if compressed to this degree the temperature of the air in the cylinder at the end of the compression stroke of a diesel engine operating with a compression ratio of about 161 is approximately 1000 degrees fahr which is far above the spontaneousignition temperature of the fuel used accordingly when the fuel is injected in a highly atomized condition at some time previous to the piston reaching the end of its stroke the fuel burns as it comes in contact with the highly heated air and the greatly increased pressures resulting from the tremendous increase in temperature brought about by this combustion acting on the pistons drive the engine as in the case of the gasoline engine summing up the differences between the diesel and gasoline engines start with the fact that the gasoline engine requires a complicated electrical ignition system in order to fire the combustible mixture whereas the diesel engine generates its own heat to start combustion by means of highly compressed air this brings about the necessity for injecting the fuel in a wellatomized condition at the time that combustion is desired and the quantities of fuel injected at this time control the amount of heat generated that is an infinitesimally small quantity of fuel will be burned just as efficiently in the diesel engine as a full charge of fuel whereas in the gasoline engine the mixture ratio must be kept reasonably constant and if the supply of fuel is to be cut down for throttling purposes the supply of air must be correspondingly reduced it is this requirement in a gasoline engine that necessitates an accurate and sensitive fuelandair metering device known as the carburetor the fact that the air supply of a diesel engine is compressed and its temperature raised to such a high degree permits the use of liquid fuels with a high ignition temperature these fuels correspond more nearly to the crude petroleum oil as it issues from the wells and this fact accounts for the much lower cost of diesel fuel as compared to the highly refined gasoline needed for aircraft engines weightsaving features in order to be successful in aviation use the modern lightweight diesel of the time had to have its weight reduced from 25 lbhp to 25 lbhp this required unusual design and construction methods as follows crankcase it weighed only 34 lb because of three factors magnesium alloy was used extensively in its construction thus saving weight as compared with aluminum alloy which was the conventional material at this time it was a single casting this saved weight because heavy flanges nuts and bolts were dispensed with the cylinders instead of being bolted to the crankcase as was normal practice were held in position by two circular hoops of alloy steel passing over the cylinder flanges they were tightened to such an extent that at no time did the cylinders transfer any tension loads to the crankcase this type of fastening actually strengthened the crankcase in contrast to the usual method for this reason it could be built lighter the hoops did not always function well the first job i ever did on the towle was to patch the holes in the top and bottom of the hull when a cylinder blew off during runup and nearly beheaded the pilot13 illustration figure 22rear view of engine with rear crankcase cover removed showing

illustration figure 27propeller hub and vibration damper us navy test 1931 smithsonian photo a48325a crankshaft since this engine developed the high maximum cylinder pressure of 1500 psi it was necessary to protect the crankshaft from the resulting heavy stresses without such protection the crankshaft would be too large and heavy for practical aeronautical applications although the maximum cylinder pressures were 10 times as great as the average ones they were of short duration the method of protecting the crankshaft took full advantage of this fact it consisted of having the counterweights flexibly mounted instead of being rigidly bolted as was common practice the counterweights were pivoted on the crank cheeks powerful compression springs absorbed the maximum impulses by permitting the counterweights to lag slightly yet forced them to travel precisely with the crank cheeks at all other times propeller hub the propeller is of course subject to the same stresses as the crankshaft instead of being rigidly bolted to the shaft as was common practice it was further protected from excessive acceleration forces by being mounted in a rubbercushioned hub this permitted the use of a lighter propeller and hub valves a further weight saving resulted from the use of a single valve for each cylinder instead of two as in the case of conventional gasoline aircraft engines a diesel engine designed in this manner loses less efficiency than a gasoline one because only air is drawn in during the intake stroke in addition to the weight saving brought about by having fewer parts in the valve mechanism there was an additional advantage since the cylinder heads could be made considerably lighter illustration figure 28cylinder disassembly showing valve and fuel injector us navy test 1931 smithsonian photo a48324d diesel cycle features although woolson designed the ingenious weightsaving features dorner was responsible for the engines diesel cycle which employed the solid type of fuel injection in order to understand dorners contribution a brief description of the type of diesel injection pioneered by dr rudolf diesel is necessary his system injected the fuel into the cylinder head with a blast of air supplied by a special air reservoir at a pressure of 1000 psi or more known as the air blast type of injection it produced good turbulence with the fuel and air thoroughly mixed before being ignited such mixing increases engine efficiency but it involves the provision of bulky and costly aircompressing apparatus which can absorb more than 5 percent of the engines power naturally the compressor also adds considerably to the engines weight in contrast to this a solid type of fuel injection may be employed to eliminate the complications of the air blast system it consists of injecting only fuel at a pressure of 1000 psi or more air is admitted by intake stroke as with a gasoline engine turbulence is induced by designing the combustion chamber and piston so as to give a whirling motion to the air during the intake stroke the following quotation from dorner now becomes readily understandable since 1922 my invention consisted in eliminating the highly complicated compressor and in injecting directly such a highly diffused fuel spray so that a quick first ignition could be depended upon by means of rotating the air column around the cylinder axis fresh air was constantly led along the fuel spray to achieve completely sootless burningup in 1930 i sold my usa patents to packard14 valve ports the inlet port which was also the exhaust port was arranged tangentially to the cylinder this design imparted a very rapid whirling motion to the incoming air thereby aiding the combustion process engine efficiency and rpm were both increased fuel injector pumps a combination fuel pump and nozzle was provided for each cylinder in contrast to the usual system of having a multiple pump unit remotely placed with regard to the nozzles the former system was adopted after frequent fuelline failures were experienced due to the engines vibration woolson stated that his system prevented pressure waves which interfered with the correct timing of the fuel injection from forming in the tubing leigh m griffith vice president of emsco aero writing in the september 1930 sae journal stated regarding the superiority claim for the simple combination of fuel pump and injection valve into one unit without connecting piping the author entirely overlooks the fact that the elasticity of a pipe and its contained fuel can be important aids in securing that extremely abrupt beginning and ending of injection which is so desirable illustration figure 29fuelinjector disassembly us navy test 1931 smithsonian photo a48323c a major advantage obtained from combining the fuel pump and injection valve is the ability of an engine so equipped to burn a wide variety of fuels the elimination of the abovementioned type of highpressure tubing reduces the possibility of a vapor lock occurring thereby permitting more volatile fuels to be burned this increases the range of hydrocarbon fuels the engine can utilize it could run on any type of hydrocarbon from gasoline to melted butter15 another reason for combining the fuel pump and injection valve is given by p e biggar in diesel engines published in 1936 by the macmillan company of canada ltd toronto in the dorner pump for example the stroke of the plunger is changed by using a levertype lifter and moving the pushrod along the lever to vary its movement unfortunately in all arrangements of this sort the plunger comes to a reluctant and weary stop as the roller of the lifter rounds the nose of the cam when the movement does finally end the injection does not necessarily stop as the compressed fuel in the injection pipe is still left to dribble miserably into the combustion chamber to minimize this defect the designer has placed the pump and injector together in a single unit

injector cam lowerfuelinjector cam used for starting us navy test 1931 smithsonian photo a48325 starting system on november 1 1961 c h wiegman vice president of engineering of the lycoming division of avco corporation wrote to the museum in part as follows early in the development it became quite evident that cold starting was a problem this was finally worked out by packard through the use of glow plugs and speeding up the injectors during the cranking period it had been felt that during the slow cranking process we were not vaporizing the fuel through the nozzles and that if we could speed up the injection pumps during this period of cranking a better vaporization could be obtained our tests showed that we were right and that the engine could be started quite easily at minus 10 f through the use of glow plugs the method used for speeding up the injection pumps was accomplished by utilizing a crankshaft cam during the cranking period the starter would shift the running cam out of position allowing the crankshaft cam to take over after the engine fired the starter was disengaged and the running injector pump cam would assume its original position the starting cam would be run at engine speed during cranking and the running cam at 18 reverse engine speed during engine operation the shifting was accomplished by a pininslot and spring arrangement to change the indexing of the cams to starting position and return an eclipse electric starter with an oversized flywheel was used this was powered by a doublesized battery development air shutters the first engines had no provision for throttling the intake air this allowed the engine to run on its own lubricating oil when the throttle was in idle position as a result the engine idled too fast thereby causing either excessive taxiing speeds or rapid brake wear this inability to idle slowly also caused high landing speeds since the propeller did not turn slowly enough to act as an airbrake figure 1 shows the first model note that the tubular air intakes on top of the cylinders have no valves figure 32 shows a later model note the butterfly valves in the ushaped air intakes here they are shown fully opened when the throttle was placed in idle position these valves automatically closed and prevented air from flowing past them air could then only enter from the back of the intakes since less air could flow into the cylinders the force of their explosions was reduced which in turn lowered the idling revolutions per minute figure 28 shows a cylinder from a more advanced model note the circular opening between the air intake and the intakeexhaust housing a barrel type of valve fitted into this opening one of these valves can be seen just below and to the left of the cylinder when the throttle was placed in idle position this valve rotated to a position which cut off almost all of the airflow into its cylinder this increased the vacuum formed toward the end of the intake stroke thereby causing more resistance which reduced the idling rpm to that of a gasoline engine16 illustration figure 32front left view of engine from packard motor car co 50hour test 1930 showing butterfly valve type

clamp between two of the cylinders on the first engine figure 19 shows a later model without any bolts holding down the cylinders pistons the pistons used in the 1929 engine had one compression ring and one oil scraper ring above the piston pin and one oil scraper ring below it there were three grooves two above the piston pin and one below it17 pistons used in 1930 had two compression rings one oil scraper ring above the piston pin and one oil scraper ring below it there were four grooves three above the piston pin and one below it18 the 1931 pistons had one compression ring above the piston pin and one compression ring and four oil scraper rings below it there were four grooves one above the piston pin and three below it19 illustration figure 34modified pistons after endurance run us navy test 1931 smithsonian photo a48325d combustion chamber in 1931 the contour of the cylinder head was changed slightly this improved the combustion efficiency to the extent that the stroke of the fuel pumps could be decreased about 15 percent the specific fuel consumption then decreased about 10 percent in addition the compression ratio was reduced from 161 to 14120 these changes were designed to eliminate smoke from the exhaust at cruising speed and to reduce it at wideopen throttle valves a twovalvepercylinder model was built but not put into production it featured more horsepower 300 a higher rate of revolutions per minute 2000 and a better specific fuel consumption about 35 lbhphr21 capt woolson designed the production model with a single large valve for each cylinder this was done in order to shorten the development period for it is easier to design a single valve which serves both the intake and exhaust functions than one valve for each function not only are there fewer parts but more important there are no heatdissipating problems although the single valve is heated when it releases the exhaust gases it is immediately cooled by the incoming air of the next cycle this cooling advantage is not shared by a valve which only passes exhaust gases22 cylinder head ribs were added to increase its rigidity compare fig 32 with fig 33 engine size a 400hp model was developed in 1930 it was not put into production23 comments comments of aeronautical engineers these comments appeared in aviation for february 15 1930 just a month before the packard diesel received its approvedtype certificate they were in answer to the question what is your opinion of the probable early future of the compression ignition type of engine in aircraft powerplants most of the engineers were enthusiastic about the diesel engines future in aviation however neither george j mead nor c fayette taylor shared their colleagues opinions meads prophesy was accurate except for his discounting the diesels role in lighterthanair craft taylor was correct in implying that there was a future for the diesel in powering airships george j mead vice president and technical director pratt whitney aircraft company compared with the present otto cycle engine the diesel powerplant weight including fuel for a longdistance flight would apparently be less it is doubtful whether there would be any saving if the orthodox engine were operated on a more suitable fuel inherently the diesel engine must stand higher pressures and therefore is heavier per horsepower a partial solution of this difficulty is the twocycle operation which seems almost a requirement if the diesel cycle is to be considered at all for aircraft for any normal commercial operation in the united states there seems to be little or no improvement to be had from the diesel after all it is not entirely a question of fuel cost but payloads carried for a given horsepower it seemed at one time as though the diesel was particularly desirable for zeppelin work now that blau gas has been introduced which obviates the need of valving precious lifting gas the diesel cycle seems much less interesting for this purpose there may be a reduction in fire hazard and radio interference with the diesel cycle but it is doubtful whether it will be used in view of these considerations alone c fayette taylor professor of aeronautical engineering massachusetts institute of technology i believe that the compression ignition engine will continue to remain in the experimental stage during the year 1930 i should expect its first really practical installation to be in lighterthanair craft p b taylor acting chief engineer wright aeronautical corporation i believe the compression ignition engine is probably the type which will eventually supersede the present electric ignition units this development will come slowly and will not be a solid injection engine henry m mullinnix former chief of powerplant section navy bureau of aeronautics the advantages of compressionignition including reduced fire hazard more efficient cycle elimination of electrical apparatus and hence of radio interference elimination of carburetion problems and other benefits less evident would seem to outweigh the difficulties encountered in metering and injecting minute quantities of fuel at the proper instant although the diesel engine suffers upon comparison with the otto cycle engine in flexibility there seems to be a definite field for employment of diesels and a gradual extension of their use may be predicted john h geisse chief engineer comet engine corporation i am firmly convinced that the diesel engine in the future will not only maintain the advantages of diesel engines as they are now known but will also be lighter in pounds per horsepower than the present otto engines lt cdr c g mccord us navy naval aircraft factory the use of compression ignition in due time appears to be assured but increase in weights above those of present otto cycle engines to insure reliability must be expected l m woolson aeronautical engineer packard motor car company there is no question that the compression ignition aircraft engine will in time offer severe competition to the gasoline engine there are however many basic problems to be solved for the solution of which there exists no precedent n n tilley chief engineer kinner airplane and motor corp considerable development of the compression ignition type of engine for aircraft will be required before it is commonly available it is believed that the weight per horsepower must be equal to or less than that of the present type of engines in order to interest the public since rapid takeoff rate of climb and speed are desired rather than low fuel consumption or high mileage most flights are of few hours duration it is believed that flights must be of over five or six hours duration in order to show any advantage of diesel engines with low fuel consumption if appreciably heavier than present engines also the difference between otto cycle and diesel becomes slight as the compression ratios come closer together comments of flight crews the preceding comments were made by engineers thinking primarily of the commercial possibilities of the diesel following are comments by flight crewmembers about the operating characteristics of the packard diesel the former were largely optimistic most of them were only familiar with the aeronautical diesel as a design project and therefore did not have the practical experience necessary to understand all of its limitations the latter were pessimistic as they knew firsthand various shortcomings of the engine which only became apparent when it was operated clarence d chamberlin pioneer pilot my only experience with the packard diesel was in a lockheed vega which i owned back about 1932 the wright j5 had been replaced with the 225 hp packard diesel my main complaint was the excessive fumes when i would come home at night my wife would greet me with you have been flying that oil burner again it was so bad that passengers clothing would smell like a smoky oil stove for hours after a flight looking backward it is my guess that the diesel would have had only a limited period of acceptance even if all mistakes had been avoided it is easier and cheaper to get performance with lighter and more powerful engines and longer runways than by refining the airplane fuel economy of an engine has ceased to be the deciding factor higher utilization of a high speed jet at least in part offsets the inefficient use of fuel the only time the diesel had a chance was from the middle 20s perhaps on thru ww2 for certain things due to gasoline shortage to sum it up the thing that licked them worst was the use of a single valve for inlet and exhaust making it impossible to collect and keep the fumes out of the fuselage24 ruth nichols prominent aviatrix i was flying chamberlins dieselpowered lockheed in which a month before i had made an official altitude record for both men and women in aircraft powered by an engine of that type the record i believe still holds it was a rugged dependable plane whose experimental oilburning engine nevertheless had a number of bugs for one thing it was constantly blowing out glowplugs used for warming the fuel mixture and when that happened long white plumes of smoke would stream out giving spectators the impression that the ship was on fire for another the vibration was so bad that out of 10 standard instruments on the plane 7 were broken from the jarring before my return the diesel fuel also produced a strong odor in the cockpit the fumes so permeating my luggage and clothes that my public appearances during the tour always were highly and not very agreeably aromatic having a strong stomach i soon became accustomed to the fumes but another pilot who ferried the plane between cities for me on one occasion was almost overcome on arrival he said i wouldnt fly that oil burner another mile25 illustration figure 35ford 11at1 trimotor 1930 with 3 packard 225hp dr980 diesel engines right side view of right engine nacelle smithsonian photo a48311 richard totten26 airplane mechanic the ford trimotor was the poorest of the lot it was inherently noisy and slow and with the packards installed it was on the point of being underpowered it was almost impossible to synchronize the three engines and the beat was almost unbearable it was not flown much but it made a fine conversation piece standing on the airport apron the waco taperwing developed the unnerving habit of breaking flying and landing wires from the vibration and most of the time sat on the hangar floor with its wings drooping like a sick pigeon in flight the open cockpit filled with exhaust smoke and unburned fuel and the pilot would land after an hours flight looking like an indianapolis 500 mile race driver the stinson detroiter the bellanca pacemaker and the buhlverville airsedan were the most successful ships and were the most used the airsedan in which woolson was killed was his favorite ship and the one i believe that was the most flown the towle ta3 amphibian flew beautifully but not for long it never got a chance to do much as it was a victim of the depression the towle was powered by 2 packard diesels on loan from the packard motor car company it was built of corrugated aluminum exactly like the ford trimotor as a matter of fact towle had been employed by ford until ford cancelled airplane building towle got his airplane built at the hangar on grosse isle in detroit and ran out of money during the flight testing program he now looked for money to continue with and found a backer in the person of one doctor adams a widely advertised painless dentist of detroit adams wanted a quicker return on his money than the average backer and he insisted that towle put the airplane in service so it could start earning some money at this time the amphibian was beginning to become popular for intercity flying especially around the great lakes region as all of the major cities were located on the waterfront what was more natural than an airline flying passengers right into the downtown area of a city thompson was doing it between detroit and cleveland marquette was doing it between detroit and milwaukee so adams applied for permission to operate an airplane between detroit and cleveland and other cities on the lakes in those days it was necessary to prove an airplanes reliability by flying a certain number of trips over the proposed route with a simulated payload this payload was supposed to consist of sand bags but usually consisted of any mechanic or pilot who happened to be loose at the moment and who had nerve enough to go along mechanics were easier to load and unload than sand bags the towle was in the middle of the qualification flights and the publicity began to appear about the new airline much newsprint was devoted to the fact that the towle was powered by the new packard diesel engine and this of course made it the only safe airline since all its competitors were using the oldfashioned dangerous gasoline on the last payload trip of the towle the pilot asked me if i wanted to go along and of course i was delighted i neglected to mention that i had been hired by the adams airline as a mechanic because of my experience in repairing the corrugated skin of the ford trimotor owned by my employer the knowles flying service the mere fact that i did many repairs to the airframe did not preclude me from getting my share of the engine work too and since i was already familiar with the packard diesel i was quickly hired by dr adams the last flight was indeed the last flight we took off from the detroit city airport and when we crossed the detroit river the pilot decided to land at the solvay coal company docks and fuel up for the opening of the airline the next day the solvay coal company was the only place in detroit where diesel fuel was obtainable at the time and all of the diesel powered yachts got fuel there the pilot was not too experienced in the operation of amphibians and he put the wheels down as we approached the river when we hit the water the airplane went over on its back and sunk to the bottom it came up to the surface again and we all climbed out onto the keel and waited for rescue a police boat came over and took us to the dock the police sent us to the hospital and then went back and towed the airplane over to the shipyard next door to solvay while we were at the hospital the crane man hooked onto the towle and lifted it out of the water and gently set it down on the dock he was only trying to help but he inadvertently set it down on its back instead of its wheels that was the end of the adams airline the packard company took back their engines i helped remove them the next day we dismantled the airplane and trucked it back to the airport where it sat in a state of neglect for some time the pilot was fired i lost my job and towle lost his airplane analysis advantages a packard diesel advertisement which appeared in aero digest for june 1930 stated that this engine had three major advantages over its gasoline rivals greater reliability because of extreme simplicity of design greater economy because of lower fuel cost plus lower fuel consumption permitting greater payloads with longer range of flight and greater safety because of removal of the fire hazard through the use of firesafe fuel and absence of electrical ignition equipment these were the engines principal advantages others are analyzed here by the author in order of their importance at low altitudes the diesel uses an excess of air to eliminate a smoking exhaust consequently at high altitudes where the air is less dense the diesel is still able to maintain much of its power in contrast the carburetored gasoline engine is sensitive to the fuelair ratio and thus has no surplus air available at higher altitudes a malfunctioning carburetor could cause a gasoline engine to cease operating but an inoperative fuel injector would cause the packard diesel to lose one ninth of its power since each cylinder had its own independently operating injector in practice however because of the excessive vibration the engine was generally shut off immediately after a cylinder cut out27 shielding was unnecessary because the diesel had no electrical ignition system carburetor icing was an impossibility because there was no carburetor any excess lubricating oil in a diesel engines cylinder is consumed cleanly to produce power by contrast such oil in a gasoline engines cylinder is only partly burned as a result carbon deposits form that eventually cause malfunctioning of the spark plugs valves and combustion chambers this advantage accrued to the diesel because it utilized an excess of air and in addition its cylinder walls were hotter the engine was very cleanrunning from the standpoint of oil leakage this was a safety factor since it eliminated the possibility of a fire starting on the outside surfaces of the engine and in addition it saved the time and money that was normally spent cleaning engines28 since the diesel utilized its heat of combustion more efficiently than the gasoline engine its cooling fin area could be reduced by 35 percent this permitted better streamlining having less cooling fin area it warmed up more rapidly than a gasoline engine illustration the packarddiesel aircraft engine firesafe fuel furnaces in many a home burn similar oil a lighted match cannot ignite or explode it saturated cloth can burn only like a wick and the oil itself will quench this fire but only when property atomized the spray may be ignited graphic proof of fuel safety in the packarddiesel aircraft engine figure 36advertisement emphasizing the advantages of firesafe fuel smithsonian photo a48848 due to the greater simplicity it was more practical to build a large diesel than a large gasoline engine large airplanes would therefore need fewer engines if diesel powered smaller fuel tanks could be used because of the greater fuel economy of the diesel and also because of the high specific gravity of fuel oil as compared to gasoline furthermore these smaller tanks could be placed in more convenient locations not having a carburetor the engine could not backfire further reducing the fire hazard the exhaust note was lower because of the diesels higher expansion ratio the absence of an ignition system permitted the diesel to operate in the heaviest types of precipitation such conditions might cause the ignition system of a gasoline engine to malfunction the packard diesel was flown at times without exhaust stacks or manifolds this was practical from a safety standpoint because of the diesels lower exhaust temperature due to its higher expansion ratio elimination of these parts reduced the weight and cost of the engine installation finally the engine was ideal for aerobatics since the injectors unlike carburetors would work equally well whether right side up or upside down an advantage peculiar to the packard among aeronautical diesels was its light weight the english beardmore tornado iii weighed 69 lbhp and the german junkers sl1 fo4 weighed 31 lbhp while the packard weighed but 23 lbhp in fairness to the beardmore it was the only one of the three engines designed for airship use and part of its heaviness was due to the special requirements of lighterthanair craft a contemporary and comparable american gasoline engine the lycoming r680 weighed 22 lbhp to have designed a diesel aircraft engine as light as a gasoline one was a remarkable achievement disadvantages there are four main reasons why the packard diesel was not successful first the packard motor car company put the engine into production a brief three years after it was created the only successful airplane diesel the german junkers jumo was in development more than three times as long 19121929 the following tests indicate that the packard diesel was not ready for production and hence was unreliable packard motor car company 50hour test feb 1518 1930 this test was identical to the standard army 50hour test which was used for the granting of the approved type certificate the engine tested was numbered 100 and was the first to be made with production tools approximately half a dozen engines had been handmade previously it had to be stopped three times twice due to failure of the fuel pump plunger springs and once due to the loosening of the oil connection ring these failures were attributed to manufacturing discrepancies in addition 4 out of a total of 103 valve springs broke29 us navy 50hour test jan 22 1931 to march 15 1931 the engine used in the navy test was numbered 120 apparently only 20 production engines had been built during the preceding 12 months dorner in a letter of march 3 1962 states that the total number of packard diesels produced was approximately 25 the engine had to be stopped three times twice due to valvespring collar failures and once due to a valve head breaking because of these failures this test was not completed the following significant quotations have been extracted from the test the engine is not recommended for service use flight tests until the durability of the engine is improved be limited to a determination of the critical engine speeds and to short hops in seaplanes it is believed that this size engine should be made suitable for service use before this type in a larger class is attempted this latter statement probably refers to the 400hp model a year had passed between the making of engine 100 and 120 yet the reliability had not improved although unreliability was the immediate cause of failure there were two design defects which would have doomed the engine even if it had been reliable all the packard diesels were of the 4stroke cycle unblown type yet the most successful airplane diesels were of the 2stroke cycle blown type30 the advantages of the latter type for aeronautical use are that it is of a more compact engine of lower weight and greater efficiency31 the engine was therefore built around the wrong cycle the packard diesel of 1928 was designed to compete with the wright j5 whirlwind which powered lindberghs spirit of st louis in 192732 the specifications were within two percent of each other the diesel engines fuel consumption was far less although its price was considerably higher packard diesel wright j5 dr980 whirlwind diameter in 451116 45 horsepower 225 225 weight lb 510 510 weighthorsepower ratio 226 226 fuel consumption lb per hphr at 040 060 cruising cost 4025 3000 the advantages of lower fuel cost and greater cruising range offered by the diesel engine would be relatively unimportant to a private pilot flying for pleasure but would be vital to the commercial operator using airplanes powered by engines having several times the horsepower of the packard diesel its size moreover was too small for the technology of fuel injectors33 the packard company realized that the production engine was too small34 in 1930 a 400hp version was built but was not put into production probably because of the unreliability of the 225hp model the fourth principal reason why the engine failed is explained by the following quotation from the propulsion of aircraft by m j b davy published in 1936 by his majestys stationery office london although the development and adoption for transport purposes of the relatively highspeed compression ignition engine has been rapid during the last few years there has been no corresponding advance in its adoption for aircraft propulsion a reason for this is the recent great advance in takeoff power in the petrol gasoline engine due to the introduction of 87 octane fuel which permits higher compression ratios and the strong probability of 100 octane fuels in the near future still further increasing this power the need for increased takeoff power results from the higher wing loading necessitated by the modern demand for commercial aircraft with higher cruising speeds with reasonable power expenditure production of the packard diesel ceased in 1933 during that same year the pratt whitney aircraft company and the wright aeronautical corporation specified 87octane fuel for certain of their engines less than 10 years later octane ratings had increased to over 100 putting the diesel at a further disadvantage35 although the above disadvantages sealed the packard diesels fate there were other minor reasons for its failure the packard diesel had the highest maximum cylinder pressure up to 1500 psi at peak rpm of any proven contemporary aircraft diesel engine leigh m griffith vice president and general manager emsco aero engine company had this to say about the packard diesels high maximum cylinder pressure in the september 1930 sae journal the designers considered it necessary to adopt unusual but admittedly clever expedients to counteract the great torque irregularity caused by the excessive maximum pressure the adoption of the lower pressure of 800 lbs would have eliminated the necessity for the pivoted springmounted counterweights and the shockabsorbing rubber propellerdrive the use of such high pressures is in reality the quick and easy way to secure highspeed operation and can be justified only from this standpoint although the resulting increased difficulty in keeping the engine light enough was a strong offsetting factor36 insofar as the engine life was concerned it is true that 1500psi peak pressures were observed but the engine was so developed to withstand these pressures one of the most severe problems connected with the development of this engine was the piston ring sealing special compression rings were made with no gaps and further work in this respect could have been used to advantage had the engine been kept in production37 it is significant that in 1930 the packard diesel had a compression ratio of 161 whereas in 1931 it has been reduced to 141 this was probably done to reduce vibration and the problem of pistonring sealing38 the exhaust products had an unpleasant odor which was particularly objectionable during taxiing professor c fayette taylor writing in the january 1931 issue of aviation remarked about this fault one is inclined to question whether the disagreeable escaping of exhaust gas from the intake ports can be overcome while still retaining the obvious advantages in weight and simplicity of the single valve the engine exhaust deposited a black oily film in fact some airplanes fitted with the packard diesel engine were painted black so that soot deposits from the exhaust would not be noticed39 since the passengers and pilots compartments were generally located behind the engines and were not airtight damage to clothing resulted this fault could have been eliminated by the use of separate valves for the intake and exhaust systems it was not possible to start the engine when the temperature dropped much below 32 f unless glow plugs were used these sparkpluglike devices which were only used for starting had resistance windings which glowed continuously when turned on the additional heat glow plugs provided made starting an easy matter in the coldest weather however they complicated the design of an engine noted for its simplicity and they used so much electricity that only a long flight would allow the generator to fully recharge the battery h r ricardo writing in the june 4 1930 issue of the aeroplane said referring to the very fine achievement of the packard company of america in producing a small radial aircooled heavyoil engine a petrol engine of similar design and with the same margin of safety would weigh less than 112 lbs per hp the important point made is that a gasoline engine designed along the same lines as the packard diesel would weigh considerably less but would then suffer from the packards reduced structural safety factor it is significant that as the packard developed it became heavier40 like other diesels the packard cost more to build than a comparable gasoline engine because of the type of construction required for the diesels higher maximum cylinder pressures and the difficulty of machining the fuel injectors having fuel injectors the engine was more sensitive to dirt in the fuel system than a carburetorequipped gasoline engine41 the fuel injectors were a crude and deficient mechanism subject to rapid wear and often these injectors caused smoking exhausts and high fuel consumptions42 in the event of battery or starter failure a comparable gasoline engine could be started by swinging the propeller because of the engines high compression it would have been impossible to have handstarted a packard diesel this way in a letter to the air museum january 15 1962 dorner commented during my first demonstration of highspeed diesel engines in 1926 in california and later in detroit i learned from capt woolson that the large transport airlines were controlled by oil companies which were not interested in supplying two different kinds of aircraft fuel and in savings of fuel the may issue of aero digest had a fullpage illustrated advertisement titled announcing national distribution for texaco aerodiesel fuel although distribution was limited the american oil industry did not prevent the airplane diesel from becoming a success in the civil market however it is significant that the advertisement was placed by frank hawks of the texas company largely as a gesture of friendship to woolson43 the situation in the military market was different however as testified by this quotation from the same letter the military administration having paid all of the expenses for the testing period to that date 1931 came after the tests to the conclusion that the advantages of the diesel as compared to its disadvantages did not justify the great risk to procure and distribute two different kinds of fuel in case of war two accidents which received wide publicity and no doubt did considerable harm to the entire project occurred to packard dieselpowered airplanes the following quotation is from the herald tribune for april 23 1930 attica new yorklosing their bearings in a blinding snowstorm and mistaking the side of a snowcovered hill for a suitable landing place three men one of them capt lionel m woolson aeronautical engineer for the packard motor company and adapter of the diesel engine to airplanes were killed here today illustration figure 37interior of bellanca showing parker d cramer pilot left and oliver l paquette radio operator just before taking off from detroit michigan on july 28 1931 smithsonian photo a202 the second of these accidents is described in the september 1931 issue of us air services columbus wanted to sail west beyond the limits set by the learned navigators of his time and in much the same consuming fashion parker d cramer wanted to show his generation and posterity that a subarctic air route to europe via canada greenland iceland norway and denmark was feasible on july 27 without any preliminary announcement cramer left detroit in a dieselengined bellanca and following the course he took with bert hassel three years ago he flew first to cochrane on hudson bay his next stop was great whales and then wakeham bay from there he flew to pangnirtum baffin land and across the hudson straits to holsteinborg greenland he crossed the icecap at a point farther north than the routes that have been discussed heretofore but almost on the most direct or great circle route from detroit to copenhagen he was accompanied by oliver paquette radio operator they were on their way more than a week before they were discovered to iceland to the faroe islands to the shetlands they were taxiing across the little harbor of lerwick shetland islands when a messenger from the bank waved a yellow paper it was a warning of gales on the coast east to copenhagen cramer apparently thought it was an enthusiastic bon voyage and after circling the town flew away a swedish radio station reported a faint hello hello hello in english but the plane was not seen again as the result of a personal conversation with his brother william a cramer in 1964 the author learned that the fuselage and floats of the airplane were found six weeks later since there was no indication of a heavy impact not a single glass dial on the instrument panel was broken a successful landing must have been made several weeks later a package was found wrapped in a torn oilskin containing instruments maps and a personal letter all substantiating the evidence that the landing was successful it can only be surmised that there was engine failure probably due to a clogged oil filter44 once before during the trip a forced landing had been made due to engine malfunctioning and a successful takeoff was accomplished in spite of a moderately rough sea this time however storm conditions probably made the takeoff impossible as a final summary of the authors analysis of the packard diesel engine it must be emphasized that although the engine burned a much cheaper and safer fuel more efficiently than any of its gasoline rivals it was too unreliable to compete with them even if it had been reliable it was too small to be useful to the large transport operators to whom its fuel economy would have appealed in addition this mechanism operated on the wrong cycle 4stroke rather than the lighter more compact and more efficient blown 2stroke cycle lastly it was doomed by the advent of high octane gasolines first used while it was still in the development stage these new fuels reduced the diesels advantage resulting from low fuel consumption and in addition gave the gasoline engine a definite advantage from the standpoint of performance the packard diesel was a daring design but for the reasons analyzed in this chapter it could not meet this competition and therefore failed to survive appendix 1 agreement between hermann i a dorner and packard motor car company this agreement made this 18th day of august 1927 by and between hermann dorner of hanover

handle work from aviation march 2 1929 vol 26 no 10 detroit michindications that the diesel type airplane engine recently developed by capt l m woolson chief aeronautical engineer of the packard motor car co will become a commercial reality and possibly a revolutionary factor in airplane engine design is seen here in the announcement of the concern that it will begin construction immediately of a 650000 plant to produce the engines in large quantity for the commercial market the new plant according to the announcement by hugh j ferry treasurer of the packard firm will be completed and in operation within five weeks between 600 and 700 men will be employed and according to expectations production will be carried on at the rate of about 500 diesel engines per month by july the packard diesel was announced first in october following experiments covering several years the original engine was placed in a stinsondetroiter which was flown successfully by captain woolson and walter lees packard pilot since that time captain woolson has built four of the engines all of 200 hp capacity developing 1 hp for every 2 lb of weight the diesel installed on the stinsondetroiter it was said now has had 200 hr flying time and gives not the slightest indication that it will need an overhauling for some time the other three engines have been tested on the block in the companys research plant it is claimed by the builders that the packard diesel will produce a saving of about 20 per cent in fuel consumption as compared with engines using gasoline it is claimed further that the diesel will prove far more reliable in construction than any airplane engine yet developed evidence of this it was pointed out is seen in the performance of the initial diesel details not announced although neither mr ferry nor captain woolson would disclose any technical details as to the engines construction in making it applicable to airplane use the secret of its success was reported to be an especially designed pumping device creating high compression necessary for diesel firing since announcement of the engine the packard factory has been literally a mecca for engineers from many parts of the world wishing to see the engine the crown prince of spain in detroit last fall was given a flight in the diesel powered stinson none of the construction secrets however have been divulged it was said the packard announcement set at rest rumors that the company planned construction of a plant costing several million dollars as well as reports that the company was going into the production of airplanes our efforts mr ferry said will be confined to the engine or power plant end of the aircraft industry we will continue to build the watercooled type we have been producing for years the new diesel plant will be primarily an assembly plant although some machine work will be done there the bulk of the machine work however will be done in the present packard machine shops although no approximation of selling price on the new diesel was divulged it was intimated that the engine will retail at a price competitive with or slightly under the price of present gasoline consuming aircooled engines of that horsepower range captain woolson will have complete charge of the diesel plant it was announced 3 effect of oxygen boosting on power and weight from p h schweitzer and e r klinge oxygenboosting of diesel engines for takeoff the pennsylvania state college bulletin april 1 1941 vol 35 no 14 p 25 practical conclusions airplanes require about one third more power during the takeoff than in flight in dieselengined airplanes the size of the engine could be reduced by 25 percent by feeding oxygen into the intake air during the takeoff applying the results of the experiments to a transport plane fig 31 shows the possible weight saving with various oxygen boosts the curves are based on 6000 cruising horsepower and an estimated engine weight of 2 lb per hp for the takeoff 8000 hp are necessary to supply the additional 2000 hp 200 lb of oxygen are fed into the intake air during the takeoff the volume of 200 lb of liquid oxygen is approximately 20 gal standard liquid air containers of 55 litre capacity weigh 75 lb therefore the weight of the oxygen and container is 350 lb while the possible saving in engine weight is 4000 lb the weight per takeoff horsepower is thereby reduced from 2 to 154 lb the calculation is shown in table 1 illustration figure 38effect of oxygen boost on power and weight cruising horsepower 6000 takeoff horsepower 8000 oxygen addition may be used for starting diesel engines the raising of the oxygen concentration from the normal 21 per cent to 45 per cent was found to be equivalent to a raise of approximately 10 cetane numbers as far as starting is concerned five per cent increase in oxygen concentration eliminated exhaust smoke completely table 1 normal horsepower 6000 takeoff horsepower 8000 normal fuel consumption 04 lb per

this it also increases somewhat the amount of fresh air introduced into the cylinders woolson invented a 2stroke cycle blown engine the patent was issued in 1932 patent 1853714 with rights assigned to the packard motor car company woolson himself died in 1930 31 a 2stroke cycle engine completes 360 of crankshaft rotation in what it takes a 4stroke cycle engine 720 to accomplish a 3cylinder twostroke cycle engine therefore has the same capacity to do work as a 6cylinder fourstroke cycle engine for this reason the former type of engine is both more compact and lighter than the latter type the above advantages plus the increased efficiency of the blown 2cycle diesel are discussed in flightthe aeronautical engineer supplement december 26 1940 vol 19 no 11 pp 545 and 552 32 packard

national air museum it is possible that the engine failed because the fuel injectors became clogged he notes that the airplane refueled at several fishing ports and therefore must have used diesel oil set aside for fishing boats this oil was generally quite dirty as a result it was routine for the fishermen to have to clean engine oil filters frequently enroute the oil filters of the packard diesel

any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the united states us laws alone swamp our small staff please check the project gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks online payments and credit card donations to donate please visit wwwgutenbergorgdonate section 5 general information about project gutenberg electronic works professor michael s hart was the originator of the project gutenberg concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone for forty years he produced and distributed project gutenberg ebooks with only a loose network of volunteer support project gutenberg ebooks are often created from several printed editions all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the us unless a copyright notice is included thus we do not necessarily keep ebooks in compliance with any particular paper edition most people start at our website which has the main pg search facility wwwgutenbergorg this website includes information about project gutenberg including how to make donations to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation how to help produce our new ebooks and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new ebooks
