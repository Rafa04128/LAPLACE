excursions in the byways of thought were undertaken at different times and on different occasions consequently the reader may be able to detect in them inequalities of treatment he may feel that i have lingered too long in some byways and hurried too rapidly through others taking as it were but a general view of the road in the latter case whilst examining everything that could be seen in the former with perhaps undue care as a matter of fact how ever all these excursions have been undertaken with one and the same object in view that namely of understanding aright and appreciating at their true worth some of the more curious byways along which human thought has travelled it is easy for the superficial thinker to dismiss much of the thought of the past and indeed of the present as mere superstition not worth the trouble of investigation but it is not scientific there is a reason for every belief even the most fantastic and it should be our object to discover this reason how far if at all the reason in any case justifies us in holding a similar belief is of course another question some of the beliefs i have dealt with i have treated at greater length than others because it seems to me that the truths of which they are the imagesvague and distorted in many cases though they beare truths which we have either forgotten nowadays or are in danger of forgetting we moderns may indeed learn something from the thought of the past even in its most fantastic aspects in one excursion at least namely the essay on the cambridge platonists i have ventured to deal with a higher

phenomenathat to which the name animism has been given in this stage of mental development all the various forces of nature are personified the rushing torrent the devastating fire the wind rustling the forest leavesin the mind of the animistic savage all these are personalities spirits like himself but animated by motives more or less antagonistic to him i suppose that no possible exception could be taken to the statement that modern science renders animism impossible but let us inquire in exactly what sense this is true it is not true that science robs natural phenomena of their spiritual significance the mistake is often made of supposing that science explains or endeavours to explain phenomena but that is the business of philosophy the task science attempts is the simpler one of the correlation of natural phenomena and in this effort leaves the ultimate problems of metaphysics untouched a universe however whose phenomena are not only capable of some degree of correlation but present the extraordinary degree of harmony and unity which science makes manifest in nature cannot be as in animism the product of a vast number of incoordinated and antagonistic wills but must either be the product of one will or not the product of will at all the latter alternative means that the cosmos is inexplicable which not only mans growing experience but the fact that man and the universe form essentially a unity forbid us to believe the term anthropomorphic is too easily applied to philosophical systems as if it constituted a criticism of their validity for if it be true as all must admit that the unknown can only be explained in terms of the known then the universe must either be explained in terms of manie in terms of will or desireor remain incomprehensible that is to say a philosophy must either be anthropomorphic or no philosophy at all thus a metaphysical scrutiny of the results of modern science leads us to a belief in god but man felt the need of unity and crude animism though a step in the right direction failed to satisfy his thought long before the days of modern science the spirits of animism however were not discarded but were modified coordinated and worked into a system as servants of the most high polytheism may mark a stage in this process or perhaps it was a result of mental degeneracy what i may term systematised as distinguished from crude animism persisted throughout the middle ages the work of systematisation had already been accomplished to a large extent by the neoplatonists and whoever were responsible for the kabala it is true that these main sources of magical or animistic philosophy remained hidden during the greater part of the middle ages but at about their close the youthful and enthusiastic cornelius agrippa 148615351 slaked his thirst thereat and produced his own attempt at the systematisation of magical belief in the famous three books of occult philosophy but the waters of magical philosophy reached the mediaeval mind through various devious channels traditional on the one hand and literary on the other and of the latter the works of pseudodionysius2 whose immense influence upon mediaeval thought has sometimes been neglected must certainly be noted 1 the story of his life has been admirably told by henry morley 2 vols 1856 2 these writings were first heard of in the early part of the sixth century and were probably the work of a syrian monk of that date who fathered them on to dionysius the areopagite as a pious fraud see dean inges christian mysticism 1899 pp 104122 and vaughans hours with the mystics 7th ed 1895 vol i pp 111124 the books have been translated into english by the rev john parker 2 vols18971899 who believes in the genuineness of their alleged authorship the most obvious example of a mediaeval animistic belief is that in elementalsthe spirits which personify the primordial forces of nature and are symbolised by the four elements immanent in which they were supposed to exist and through which they were held to manifest their powers and astrology it must be remembered is essentially a systematised animism the stars to the ancients were not material bodies like the earth but spiritual beings plato 427347 bc speaks of them as gods mediaeval thought did not regard them in quite this way but for those who believed in astrology and few i think did not the stars were still symbols of spiritual forces operative on man evidences of the wide extent of astrological belief in those days are abundant many instances of which we shall doubtless encounter in our excursions it has been said that the theological and philosophical atmosphere of the middle ages was scholastic not mystical no doubt mysticism as a mode of life aiming at the realisation of the presence of god is as distinct from scholasticism as empiricism is from rationalism or toughminded philosophy to use james happy phrase is from tenderminded but no philosophy can be absolutely and purely deductive it must start from certain empirically determined facts a man might be an extreme empiricist in religion ie a mystic and yet might attempt to deduce all other forms of knowledge from the results of his religious experiences never caring to gather experience in any other realm hence the breach between mysticism and scholasticism is not really so wide as may appear at first sight indeed scholasticism officially recognised three branches of theology of which the mystical was one i think that mysticism and scholasticism both had a profound influence on the mediaeval mind sometimes acting as opposing forces sometimes operating harmoniously with one another as professor windelband puts it we no longer onesidedly characterise the philosophy of the middle ages as scholasticism but rather place mysticism beside it as of equal rank and even as being the more fruitful and promising movement1 1 professor wilhelm windelband phd presentday mysticism the quest vol iv 1913 p 205 alchemy with its four aristotelian or scholastic elements and its three mystical principlessulphur mercury saltmust be cited as the outstanding product of the combined influence of mysticism and scholasticism of mysticism which postulated the unity of the cosmos and hence taught that everything natural is the expressive image and type of some supernatural reality of scholasticism which taught men to rely upon deduction and to restrict experimentation to the smallest possible limits the mind naturally proceeds from the known or from what is supposed to be known to the unknown indeed as i have already indicated it must so proceed if truth is to be gained now what did the men of the middle ages regard as falling into the category of the known why surely the truths of revealed religion whether accepted upon authority or upon the evidence of their own experience the realm of spiritual and moral reality there they felt they were on firm ground nature was a realm unknown but they had analogy to guide or rather misguide them nevertheless if as we know it misguided this was not i think because the mystical doctrine of the correspondence between the spiritual and the natural is unsound but because these ancient seekers into natures secrets knew so little and so frequently misapplied what they did know so alchemical philosophy arose and became systematised with its wonderful endeavour to perfect the base metals by the philosophers stonethe concentrated essence of natureas mans soul is perfected through the lifegiving power of jesus christ i want in conclusion to these brief introductory remarks to say a few words concerning phallicism in connection with my topic for some tenderminded1 and to my thought obscure reason the subject is tabooed even the british museum does not include works on phallicism in its catalogue and special permission has to be obtained to consult them yet the subject is of vast importance as concerns the origin and development of religion and philosophy and the extent of phallic worship may be gathered from the widespread occurrence of obelisks and similar objects amongst ancient relics our own maypole dances may be instanced as one survival of the ancient worship of the male generative principle 1 i here use the term with the extended meaning mr h g wells has given to it see the new machiavelli what could be more easy to understand than that when man first questioned as to the creation of the earth he should suppose it to have been generated by some process analogous to that which he saw held in the case of man how else could he account for its origin if knowledge must proceed from the known to the unknown no one questions at all that the worship of the human generative organs as symbols of the dual generative principle of nature degenerated into orgies of the most frightful character but the view of nature which thus degenerated is not i think an altogether unsound one and very interesting remnants of it are to be found in mediaeval philosophy these remnants are very marked in alchemy the metals as i have suggested are there regarded as types of man hence they are produced from seed through the combination of male and female principlesmercury and sulphur which on the spiritual plane are intelligence and love the same is true of that stone which is perfect man as bernard of trevisan 14061490 wrote in the fifteenth century this stone then is compounded of a body and spirit or of a volatile and fixed substance and that is therefore done because nothing in the world can be generated and brought to light without these two substances to wit a male and female from whence it appeareth that although these two substances are not of one and the same species yet one stone doth thence arise and although they appear and are said to be two substances yet in truth it is but one to wit argentvive1 no doubt this sounds fantastic but with all their seeming intellectual follies these old thinkers were no fools the fact of sex is the most fundamental fact of the universe and is a spiritual and physical as well as a physiological fact i shall deal with the subject as concerns the speculations of the alchemists in some detail in a later excursion 1 bernard earl of trevisan a treatise of the philosophers stone 1683 see collectanea chymica a collection of ten several treatises in chemistry 1684 p 91 ii pythagoras and his philosophy it is a matter for enduring regret that so little is known to us concerning pythagoras what little we do know serves but to enhance for us the interest of the man and his philosophy to make him in many ways the most attractive of greek thinkers and basing our estimate on the extent of his influence on the thought of succeeding ages we recognise in him one of the worlds masterminds pythagoras was born about 582 bc at samos one of the grecian isles in his youth he came in contact with thalesthe father of geometry as he is well calledand though he did not become a member of thales school his contact with the latter no doubt helped to turn his mind towards the study of geometry this interest found the right ground for its development in egypt which he visited when still young egypt is generally regarded as the birthplace of geometry the subject having it is supposed been forced on the minds of the egyptians by the necessity of fixing the boundaries of lands against the annual overflowing of the nile but the egyptians were what is called an essentially practical people and their geometrical knowledge did not extend beyond a few empirical rules useful for fixing these boundaries and in constructing their temples striking evidence of this fact is supplied by the ahmes papyrus compiled some little time before 1700 bc from an older work dating from about 3400 bc1 a papyrus which almost certainly represents the highest mathematical knowledge reached by the egyptians of that day geometry is treated very superficially and as of subsidiary interest to arithmetic there is no ordered series of reasoned geometrical propositions givennothing indeed beyond isolated rules and of these some are wanting in accuracy 1 see august eisenlohr ein mathematisches handbuch der alten aegypter 1877 j gow a short history of greek mathematics 1884 and v e johnson egyptian science from the monuments and ancient books 1891 one geometrical fact known to the egyptians was that if a triangle be constructed having its sides 3 4 and 5 units long respectively then the angle opposite the longest side is exactly a right angle and the egyptian builders used this rule for constructing walls perpendicular to each other employing a cord graduated in the required manner the greek mind was not however satisfied with the bald statement of mere factsit cared little for practical applications but sought above all for the underlying reason of everything nowadays we are beginning to realise that the results achieved by this type of mind the general laws of natures behaviour formulated by its endeavours are frequently of immense practical importanceof far more importance than the mere rulesofthumb beyond which socalled practical minds never advance the classic example of the utility of seemingly useless knowledge is afforded by sir william hamiltons discovery or rather invention of quarternions but no better example of the utilitarian triumph of the theoretical over the socalled practical mind can be adduced than that afforded by pythagoras given this rule for constructing a right angle about whose reason the egyptian who used it never bothered himself and the mind of pythagoras searching for its full significance made that gigantic geometrical discovery which is to this day known as the theorem of pythagorasthe law that in every rightangled triangle the square on the side opposite the right angle is equal in area to the sum of the squares on the other two sides1 the importance of this discovery can hardly be overestimated it is of fundamental importance in most branches of geometry and the basis of the whole of trigonometrythe special branch of geometry that deals with the practical mensuration of triangles euclid devoted the whole of the first book of his elements of geometry to establishing the truth of this theorem how pythagoras demonstrated it we unfortunately do not know 1 fig 3 affords an interesting practical demonstration of the truth of this theorem if the reader will copy this figure cut out the squares on the two shorter sides of the triangle and divide them along the lines ad be ef he will find that the five pieces so obtained can be made exactly to fit the square on the longest side as shown by the dotted lines the size and shape of the triangle abc so long as it has a right angle at c is immaterial the lines ad be are obtained by continuing the sides of the square on the side ab ie the side opposite the right angle and ef is drawn at right angles to be after absorbing what knowledge was to be gained in egypt pythagoras journeyed to babylon where he probably came into contact with even greater traditions and more potent influences and sources of knowledge than in egypt for there is reason for believing that the ancient chaldeans were the builders of the pyramids and in many ways the intellectual superiors of the egyptians at last after having travelled still further east probably as far as india pythagoras returned to his birthplace to teach the men of his native land the knowledge he had gained but croesus was tyrant over samos and so oppressive was his rule that none had leisure in which to learn not a student came to pythagoras until in despair so the story runs he offered to pay an artisan if he would but learn geometry the man accepted and later when pythagoras pretended inability any longer to continue the payments he offered so fascinating did he find the subject to pay his teacher instead if the lessons might only be continued pythagoras no doubt was much gratified at this and the motto he adopted for his great brotherhood of which we shall make the acquaintance in a moment was in all likelihood based on this event it ran honour a figure and a step before a figure and a tribolus or as a freer translation renders it a figure and a step onward not a figure and a florin at all events as mr frankland remarks the motto is a lasting witness to a very singular devotion to knowledge for its own sake1 1 w b frankland ma the story of euclid 1902 p 33 but pythagoras needed a greater audience than one man however enthusiastic a pupil he might be and he left samos for southern italy the rich inhabitants of whose cities had both the leisure and inclination to study delphi farfamed for its oracles was visited en route and pythagoras after a sojourn at tarentum settled at croton where he gathered about him a great band of pupils mainly young people of the aristocratic class by consent of the senate of croton he formed out of these a great philosophical brotherhood whose members lived apart from the ordinary people forming as it were a separate community they were bound to pythagoras by the closest ties of admiration and reverence and for years after his death discoveries made by pythagoreans were invariably attributed to the master a fact which makes it very difficult exactly to gauge the extent of pythagoras own knowledge and achievements the regime of the brotherhood or pythagorean order was a strict one entailing high thinking and low living at all times a restricted diet the exact nature of which is in dispute was observed by all members and long periods of silence as conducive to deep thinking were imposed on novices women were admitted to the order and pythagoras asceticism did not prohibit romance for we read that one of his fair pupils won her way to his heart and declaring her affection for him found it reciprocated and became his wife schure writes by his marriage with theano pythagoras affixed the seal of realization to his work the union and fusion of the two lives was complete one day when the masters wife was asked what length of time elapsed before a woman could become pure after intercourse with a man she replied if it is with her husband she is pure all the time if with another man she is never pure many women adds the writer would smilingly remark that to give such a reply one must be the wife of pythagoras and love him as theano did and they would be in the right for it is not marriage that sanctifies love it is love which justifies marriage1 1 edouard schure pythagoras and the delphic mysteries trans by f rothwell ba 1906 pp 164 and 165 pythagoras was not merely a mathematician he was first and foremost a philosopher whose philosophy found in number the basis of all things because number for him alone possessed stability of relationship as i have remarked on a former occasion the theory that the cosmos has its origin and explanation in number is one for which it is not difficult to account if we take into consideration the nature of the times in which it was formulated the greek of the period looking upon nature beheld no picture of harmony uniformity and fundamental unity the outer world appeared to him rather as a discordant chaos the mere sport and plaything of the gods the theory of the uniformity of naturethat nature is ever like to herselfthe very essence of the modern scientific spirit had yet to be born of years of unwearied labour and unceasing delving into natures innermost secrets only in mathematicsin the properties of geometrical figures and of numberswas the reign of law the principle of harmony perceivable even at this present day when the marvellous has become commonplace that property of rightangled triangles already discussed comes to the mind as a remarkable and notable fact it must have seemed a stupendous marvel to its discoverer to whom it appears the regular alternation of the odd and even numbers a fact so obvious to us that we are inclined to attach no importance to it seemed itself to be something wonderful here in geometry and arithmetic here was order and harmony unsurpassed and unsurpassable what wonder then that pythagoras concluded that the solution of the mighty riddle of the universe was contained in the mysteries of geometry what wonder that he read mystic meanings into the laws of arithmetic and believed number to be the explanation and origin of all that is1 1 a mathematical theory of spirit 1912 pp 6465 no doubt the pythagorean theory suffers from a defect similar to that of the kabalistic doctrine which starting from the fact that all words are composed of letters representing the primary sounds of language maintained that all the things represented by these words were created by god by means of the twentytwo letters of the hebrew alphabet but at the same time the pythagorean theory certainly embodies a considerable element of truth modern science demonstrates nothing more clearly than the importance of numerical relationships indeed the history of science shows us the gradual transformation of crude facts of experience into increasingly exact generalisations by the application to them of mathematics the enormous advances that have been made in recent years in physics and chemistry are very largely due to mathematical methods of interpreting and coordinating facts experimentally revealed whereby further experiments have been suggested the results of which have themselves been mathematically interpreted both physics and chemistry especially the former are now highly mathematical in the biological sciences and especially in psychology it is true that mathematical methods are as yet not so largely employed but these sciences are far less highly developed far less exact and systematic that is to say far less scientific at present than is either physics or chemistry however the application of statistical methods promises good results and there are not wanting generalisations already arrived at which are expressible mathematically webers law in psychology and the law concerning the arrangement of the leaves about the stems of plants in biology may be instanced as cases in point1 1 quoted from a lecture by the present writer on the law of correspondences mathematically considered delivered before the theological and philosophical society on 26th april 1912 and published in morning light vol xxxv 1912 p 434 et seq the pythagorean doctrine of the cosmos in its most reasonable form however is confronted with one great difficulty which it seems incapable of overcoming namely that of continuity modern science with its atomic theories of matter and electricity does indeed show us that the apparent continuity of material things is spurious that all material things consist of discrete particles and are hence measurable in numerical terms but modern science is also obliged to postulate an ether behind these atoms an ether which is wholly continuous and hence transcends the domain of number1 it is true that in quite recent times a certain school of thought has argued that the ether is also atomic in constitutionthat all things indeed have a grained structure even forces being made up of a large number of quantums or indivisible units of force but this view has not gained general acceptance and it seems to necessitate the postulation of an ether beyond the ether filling the interspaces between its atoms to obviate the difficulty of conceiving of action at a distance 1 cf chap iii on nature as the embodiment of number of my a mathematical theory of spirit to which reference has already been made according to bergson lifethe reality that can only be lived not understoodis absolutely continuous ie not amenable to numerical treatment it is because life is absolutely continuous that we cannot he says understand it for reason acts discontinuously grasping only so to speak a cinematographic view of life made up of an immense number of instantaneous glimpses all that passes between the glimpses is lost and so the true whole reason can never synthesise from that which it possesses on the other hand one might also argueextending in a way the teaching of the physical sciences of the period between the postulation of daltons atomic theory and the discovery of the significance of the ether of spacethat reality is essentially discontinuous our idea that it is continuous being a mere illusion arising from the coarseness of our senses that might provide a complete vindication of the pythagorean view but a better vindication if not of that theory at any rate of pythagoras philosophical attitude is forthcoming i think in the fact that modern mathematics has transcended the shackles of number and has enlarged her kingdom so as to include quantities other than numerical pythagoras had he been born in these latter centuries would surely have rejoiced in this enlargement whereby the continuous as well as the discontinuous is brought if not under the rule of number under the rule of mathematics indeed pythagoras foremost achievement in mathematics i have already mentioned another notable piece of work in the same department was the discovery of a method of constructing a parallelogram having a side equal to a given line an angle equal to a given angle and its area equal to that of a given triangle pythagoras is said to have celebrated this discovery by the sacrifice of a whole ox the problem appears in the first book of euclids elements of geometry as proposition 44 in fact many of the propositions of euclids first second fourth and sixth books were worked out by pythagoras and the pythagoreans but curiously enough they seem greatly to have neglected the geometry of the circle the symmetrical solids were regarded by pythagoras and by the greek thinkers after him as of the greatest importance to be perfectly symmetrical or regular a solid must have an equal number of faces meeting at each of its angles and these faces must be equal regular polygons ie figures whose sides and angles are all equal pythagoras perhaps may be credited with the great discovery that there are only five such solids these are as follows the tetrahedron having four equilateral triangles as faces the cube having six squares as faces the octahedron having eight equilateral triangles as faces the dodecahedron having twelve regular pentagons or fivesided figures as faces the icosahedron having twenty equilateral triangles as faces1 1 if the reader will copy figs 4 to 8 on cardboard or stiff paper bend each along the dotted lines so as to form a solid fastening together the free edges with gummed paper he will be in possession of models of the five solids in question now the greeks believed the world to be composed of four elementsearth air fire waterand to the greek mind the conclusion was inevitable2a that the shapes of the particles of the elements were those of the regular solids earthparticles were cubical the cube being the regular solid possessed of greatest stability fireparticles were tetrahedral the tetrahedron being the simplest and hence lightest solid waterparticles were icosahedral for exactly the reverse reason whilst airparticles as intermediate between the two latter were octahedral the dodecahedron was to these ancient mathematicians the most mysterious of the solids it was by far the most difficult to construct the accurate drawing of the regular pentagon necessitating a rather elaborate application of pythagoras great theorem1 hence the conclusion as plato put it that this the regular dodecahedron the deity employed in tracing the plan of the universe2b hence also the high esteem in which the pentagon was held by the pythagoreans by producing each side of this latter figure the fivepointed star fig 9 known as the pentagram is obtained this was adopted by the pythagoreans as the badge of their society and for many ages was held as a symbol possessed of magic powers the mediaeval magicians made use of it in their evocations and as a talisman it was held in the highest esteem 2a cf plato the timaeus sese xxviiixxx 1 in reference to this matter frankland remarks in those early days the innermost secrets of nature lay in the lap of geometry and the extraordinary inference follows that euclids elements which are devoted to the investigation of the regular solids are therefore in reality and at bottom an attempt to solve the universe euclid in fact made this goal of the pythagoreans the aim of his elementsop cit p 35 2b op cit se xxix music played an important part in the curriculum of the pythagorean brotherhood and the important discovery that the relations between the notes of musical scales can be expressed by means of numbers is a pythagorean one it must have seemed to its discovereras in a sense it indeed isa striking confirmation of the numerical theory of the cosmos the pythagoreans held that the positions of the heavenly bodies were governed by similar numerical relations and that in consequence their motion was productive of celestial music this concept of the harmony of the spheres is among the most celebrated of the pythagorean doctrines and has found ready acceptance in many mysticallyspeculative minds look how the floor of heaven says lorenzo in shakespeares the merchant of venice look how the floor of heaven is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold theres not the smallest orb which thou beholds but in his motion like an angel sings still quiring to the youngeyed cherubins such harmony is in immortal souls but whilst this muddy vesture of decay doth grossly close it in we cannot hear it1 1 act v scene i or as kingsley writes in one of his letters when i walk the fields i am oppressed every now and then with an innate feeling that everything i see has a meaning if i could but understand it and this feeling of being surrounded with truths which i cannot grasp amounts to an indescribable awe sometimes everything seems to be full of gods reflex if we could but see it oh how i have prayed to have the mystery unfolded at least hereafter to see if but for a moment the whole harmony of the great system to hear once the music which the whole universe makes as it performs his bidding1 in this connection may be mentioned the very significant fact that the pythagoreans did not consider the earth in accordance with current opinion to be a stationary body but believed that it and the other planets revolved about a central point or fire as they called it 1 charles kingsley his letters and memories of his life edited by his wife 1883 p 28 as concerns pythagoras ethical teaching judging from the socalled golden verses attributed to him and no doubt written by one of his disciples2 this would appear to be in some respects similar to that of the stoics who came later but free from the materialism of the stoic doctrines due regard for oneself is blended with regard for the gods and for other men the atmosphere of the whole being at once rational and austere one versethou shalt likewise know according to justice that the nature of this universe is in all things alike3is of particular interest as showing pythagoras belief in that principle of analogythat what is below is as that which is above what is above is as that which is belowwhich held so dominant a sway over the minds of ancient and mediaeval philosophers leading themin spite i suggest of its fundamental truthinto so many fantastic errors as we shall see in future excursions metempsychosis was another of the pythagorean tenets a fact which is interesting in view of the modern revival of this doctrine pythagoras no doubt derived it from the east apparently introducing it for the first time to western thought 2 it seems probable though not certain that pythagoras wrote nothing himself but taught always by the oral method 3 cf the remarks of hierocles on this verse in his commentary such in brief were the outstanding doctrines of the pythagorean brotherhood their teachings included as we have seen what may justly be called scientific discoveries of the first importance as well as doctrines which though we may feel compelledperhaps rightlyto regard them as fantastic now had an immense influence on the thought of succeeding ages especially on greek philosophy as represented by plato and the neoplatonists and the more speculative mindsthe occult philosophers shall i sayof the latter mediaeval period and succeeding centuries the brotherhood however was not destined to continue its days in peace as i have indicated it was a philosophical not a political association but naturally pythagoras philosophy included political doctrines at any rate the brotherhood acquired a considerable share in the government of croton a fact which was greatly resented by the members of the democratic party who feared the loss of their rights and urged thereto it is said by a rejected applicant for membership of the order the mob made an onslaught on the brotherhoods place of assembly and burnt it to the ground one account has it that pythagoras himself died in the conflagration a sacrifice to the mad fury of the mob according to another accountand we like to believe that this is the true onehe escaped to tarentum from which he was banished to find an asylum in metapontum where he lived his last years in peace the pythagorean order was broken up but the bonds of brotherhood still existed between its members one of them who had fallen upon sickness and poverty was kindly taken in by an innkeeper before dying he traced a few mysterious signs the pentagram no doubt on the door of the inn and said to the host do not be uneasy one of my brothers will pay my debts a year afterwards as a stranger was passing by this inn he saw the signs and said to the host i am a pythagorean one of my brothers died here tell me what i owe you on his account1 1 edouard schure op cit p 174 in endeavouring to estimate the worth of pythagoras discoveries and teaching mr frankland writes with reference to his achievements in geometry even after making a considerable allowance for his pupils share the masters geometrical work calls for much admiration and it cannot be far wrong to suppose that it was pythagoras wont to insist upon proofs and so to secure that rigour which gives to mathematics its honourable position amongst the sciences

few tasks at once so instructive and so fascinating as the tracing of the development of the human mind as manifested in the evolution of scientific and philosophical theories and this is perhaps especially true when as in the case of medicine this evolution has followed paths so tortuous intersected by so many fantastic byways that one is not infrequently doubtful as to the true road the history of medicine is at once the history of human wisdom and the history of human credulity and folly and the romantic element to use the expression in its popular acceptation thus introduced whilst making the subject more entertaining by no means detracts from its importance considered psychologically to whom the honour of having first invented medicines is due is unknown the origins of pharmacy being lost in the twilight of myth osiris and isis bacchus apollo father of the famous physician aesculapius and chiron the centaur tutor of the latter are among the many mythological personages who have been accredited with the invention of physic it is certain that the art of compounding medicines is extraordinarily ancient there is a papyrus in the british museum containing medical prescriptions which was written about 1200 bc and the famous ebers papyrus which is devoted to medical matters is reckoned to date from about the year 1550 bc it is interesting to note that in the prescriptions given in this latter papyrus as seems to have been the case throughout the history of medicine the principle that the efficacy of a medicine is in proportion to its nastiness appears to have been the main idea indeed many old medicines contained ingredients of the most disgusting nature imaginable a mediaeval remedy known as oil of puppies made by cutting up two newlyborn puppies and boiling them with one pound of live earthworms may be cited as a comparatively pleasant example of the remedies used in the days when all sorts of excreta were prescribed as medicines1 1 see the late mr a c woottons excellent work chronicles of pharmacy 2 vols 1910 to which i gladly acknowledge my indebtedness presumably the oldest theory concerning the causation of disease is that which attributes all the ills of mankind to the malignant operations of evil spirits a theory which someone has rather fancifully suggested is not so erroneous after all if we may be allowed to apply the term evil spirits to the microbes of modern bacteriology remnants of this theory which doesshall i sayconceal a transcendental truth that is in its original form still survive to the present day in various superstitious customs whose absurdity does not need emphasising for example the use of red flannel by oldfashioned folk with which to tie up sore throatsred having once been supposed to be a colour very angatonistic to evil spirits so much so that at one time red cloth hung in the patients room was much employed as a cure for smallpox medicine and magic have always been closely associated indeed the greatest name in the history of pharmacy is also what is probably the greatest name in the history of magicthe reference of course being to paracelsus 14931541 until paracelsus partly by his vigorous invective and partly by his remarkable cures of various diseases demolished the old school of medicine no one dared contest the authority of galen 130circa 205 and avicenna 9801037 galens theory of disease was largely based upon that of the four humours in manbile blood phlegm and black bilewhich were regarded as related to but not identical with the four elementsfire air water and earthbeing supposed to have characters similar to these thus to bile as to fire were attributed the properties of hotness and dryness to blood and air those of hotness and moistness to phlegm and water those of coldness and moistness and finally black bile like earth was said to be cold and dry galen supposed that an alteration in the due proportion of these humours gives rise to disease though he did not consider this to be its only cause thus cancer it was thought might result from an excess of black bile and rheumatism from an excess of phlegm drugs galen argued are of efficiency in the curing of disease according as they possess one or more of these socalled fundamental properties hotness dryness coldness and moistness whereby it was considered that an excess of any humour might be counteracted moreover it was further assumed that four degrees of each property exist and that only those drugs are of use in curing a disease which contain the necessary property or properties in the degree proportionate to that in which the opposite humour or humours are in excess in the patients system paracelsus views were based upon his theory undoubtedly true in a sense that man is a microcosm a world in miniature1 now all things material taught paracelsus contain the three principles termed in alchemistic phraseology salt sulphur and mercury this is true therefore of man the healthy body he argued is a sort of chemical compound in which these three principles are harmoniously blended as in the macrocosm in due proportion whilst disease is due to a preponderance of one principle fevers for example being the result of an excess of sulphur ie the fiery principle etc paracelsus although his theory was not so different from that of galen whose views he denounced was thus led to seek for chemical remedies containing these principles in varying proportions he was not content with medicinal herbs and minerals in their crude state but attempted to extract their effective essences indeed he maintained that the preparation of new and better drugs is the chief business of chemistry 1 see the note on the paracelsian doctrine of the microcosm below this theory of disease and of the efficacy of drugs was complicated by many fantastic additions1 thus there is the archaeus a sort of benevolent demon supposed by paracelsus to look after all the unconscious functions of the bodily organism who has to be taken into account paracelsus also held the doctrine of signatures according to which the medicinal value of plants and minerals is indicated by their external form or by some sign impressed upon them by the operation of the stars a very old example of this belief is to be found in the use of mandrake whose roots resemble the human form by the hebrews and greeks as a cure for sterility or to give an instance which is still accredited by some the use of eyebright euphrasia officinalis l a plant with a black pupillike spot in its corolla for complaints of the eyes2 allied to this doctrine are such beliefs once held as that the lungs of foxes are good for bronchial troubles or that the heart of a lion will endow one with courage as cornelius agrippa put it it is well known amongst physicians that brain helps the brain and lungs the lungs3 1 the question of paracelsus pharmacy is further complicated by the fact that this eccentric genius coined many new words without regard to the principles of etymology as names for his medicines and often used the same term to stand for quite different bodies some of his disciples maintained that he must not always be understood in a literal sense in which probably there is an element of truth see for instance a golden and blessed casket of natures marvels by benedictus figulus trans by a e waite 1893 2 see dr alfred c haddons magic and fetishism 1906 p 15 3 henry cornelius agrippa occult philosophy bk i chap xv whiteheads edition chicago 1898 p 72 in modern times homoeopathyaccording to which a drug is a cure if administered in small doses for that disease whose symptoms it produces if given in large doses to a healthy personseems to bear some resemblance to these old medical theories concerning the curing of like by like that the system of hahnemann 17551843 the founder of homoeopathy is free from error could be scarcely maintained but certain recent discoveries in connection with serumtherapy appear to indicate that the last word has not yet been said on the subject and the formula like cures like may still have another lease of life to run to return to paracelsus however it may be thought that his views were not so great an advance on those of galen but whether or not this be the case his union of chemistry and medicine was of immense benefit to each science and marked a new era in pharmacy even if his theories were highly fantastic it was he who freed medicine from the shackles of traditionalism and rendered progress in medical science possible i must not conclude these brief notes without some reference to the medical theory of the medicinal efficacy of words the ebers papyrus already mentioned gives various formulas which must be pronounced when preparing and when administering a drug and there is a draught used by the eastern jews as a cure for bronchial complaints prepared by writing certain words on a plate washing them off with wine and adding three grains of a citron which has been used at the tabernacle festival but enough for our present excursion we must hie us back to the modern world with its alkaloids serums and antitoxinsanother day we will perhaps wander again down the bypaths of medicinal magic note on the paracelsian doctrine of the microcosm mans nature writes cornelius agrippa is the most complete image of the whole universe1 this theory especially connected with the name of paracelsus is worthy of more than passing reference but as the consideration of it leads us from medicine to metaphysics i have thought it preferable to deal with the subject in a note 1 h c agrippa occult philosophy bk i chap xxxiii whiteheads edition p 111 man taught the old mystical philosophers is threefold in nature consisting of spirit soul and body the paracelsian mercury sulphur and salt were the mineral analogues of these as to the spirit writes valentine weigel 15331588 a disciple of paracelsus we are of god move in god and live in god and are nourished of god hence god is in us and we are in god god hath put and placed himself in us and we are put and placed in god as to the soul we are from the firmament and stars we live and move therein and are nourished thereof hence the firmament with its astralic virtues and operations is in us and we in it the firmament is put and placed in us and we are put and placed in the firmament as to the body we are of the elements we move and live therein and are nourished of themhence the elements are in us and we in them the elements by the slime are put and placed in us and we are put and placed in them1 or to quote from paracelsus himself in his hermetic astronomy he writes god took the body out of which he built up man from those things which he created from nothingness into something hence man is now a microcosm or a little world because he is an extract from all the stars and planets of the whole firmament from the earth and the elements and so he is their quintessence but between the macrocosm and the microcosm this difference occurs that the form image species and substance of man are diverse therefrom in man the earth is flesh the water is blood fire is the heat thereof and air is the balsam these properties have not been changed but only the substance of the body so man is man not a world yet made from the world made in the likeness not of the world but of god yet man comprises in himself all the qualities of the world his body is from the world and therefore must be fed and nourished by that world from which he has sprung he has been taken from the earth and from the elements and therefore must be nourished by these now man is not only flesh and blood but there is within the intellect which does not like the complexion come from the elements but from the stars and the condition of the stars is this that all the wisdom intelligence industry of the animal and all the arts peculiar to man are contained in them from the stars man has these same things and that is called the light of nature in fact it is whatever man has found by the light of nature such then is the condition of man that out of the great universe he needs both elements and stars seeing that he himself is constituted in that way1b 1 valentine weigel astrology theologised the spiritual hermeneutics of astrology and holy writ ed by anna bonus kingsford 1886 p 59 1b the hermetic and alchemical writings of paracelsus ed by a e waite 1894 vol ii pp 289291 it is not difficult to discern a certain truth in all this making allowances for modes of thought which are not those of the present day the swedish philosopher swedenborg 16881772 reaffirmed the theory in later years but as he points out2 the reason that man is a microcosm lies deeper than in the facts that his body is of the elements of this earth and is nourished thereby according to this profound thinker form spiritually understood is the expression of use the uses of things being indicated by their forms now the human form is the highest of all forms because it subserves the highest of all uses hence both the world of matter and the world of spirit are in the human form because there is a correspondence in use between man and the cosmos we may therefore call man as to his body a microcosm or little world as to his soul a microuranos or little heaven or we may speak of the macrocosm or great world as the grand man and we may say that the soul of this grand man the selfexistent substantial and efficient cause of all things at once immanent within yet transcending all things is god 2 see especially his divine love and wisdom sese 251 and 319 iv superstitions concerning birds amongst the most remarkable of natural occurrences must be included many of the phenomena connected with the behaviour of birds undoubtedly numerous species of birds are susceptible to atmospheric changes of an electrical and barometric nature too slight to be observed by mans unaided senses thus only is to be explained the phenomenon of migration and also the many other peculiarities in the behaviour of birds whereby approaching changes in the weather may be foretold probably also this fact has much to do with the extraordinary homing instinct of pigeons but of course in the days when meteorological science had yet to be born no such explanation as this could be known the ancients observed that birds by their migrations or by other peculiarities in their behaviour prognosticated coming changes in the seasons of the year and other changes connected with the weather such as storms etc they saw too in the homing instincts of pigeons an apparent exhibition of intelligence exceeding that of man what more natural then for them to attribute foresight to birds and to suppose that all sorts of coming events other than those of an atmospheric nature might be foretold by careful observation of their flight and song augurythat is the art of divination by observing the behaviour of birdswas extensively cultivated by the etrurians and romans1 it is still used i believe by the natives of samoa the romans had an official college of augurs the members of which were originally three patricians about 300 bc the number of patrician augurs was increased by one and five plebeian augurs were added later the number was again increased to fifteen the object of augury was not so much to foretell the future as to indicate what line of action should be followed in any given circumstances by the nation the augurs were consulted on all matters of importance and the position of augur was thus one of great consequence in what appears to be the oldest method the augur arrayed in a special costume and carrying a staff with which to mark out the visible heavens into houses proceeded to an elevated piece of ground where a sacrifice was made and a prayer repeated then gazing towards the sky he waited until a bird appeared the point in the heavens where it first made its appearance was carefully noted also the manner and direction of its flight and the point where it was lost sight of from these particulars an augury was derived but in order to be of effect it had to be confirmed by a further one 1 this is not quite an accurate definition as auguries were also obtained from other animals and from celestial phenomena eg lightning etc auguries were also drawn from the notes of birds birds being divided by the augurs into two classes i oscines those which give omens by their note and ii alites those which afford presages by their flight1 another method of augury was performed by the feeding of chickens specially kept for this purpose this was done just before sunrise by the pullarius or feeder strict silence being observed if the birds manifested no desire for their food the omen was of a most direful nature on the other hand if from the greediness of the chickens the grain fell from their beaks and rebounded from the ground the augury was most favourable this latter augury was known as tripudium solistimum any fraud practiced by the pullarius writes the rev edward smedley reverted to his own head of this we have a memorable instance in the great battle between papirius cursor and the samnites in the year of rome 459 so anxious were the troops for battle that the pullarius dared to announce to the consul a tripudium solistimum although the chickens refused to eat papirius unhesitatingly gave the signal for fight when his son having discovered the false augury hastened to communicate it to his father do thy part well was his reply and let the deceit of the augur fall on himself the tripudium has been announced to me and no omen could be better for the roman army and people as the troops advanced a javelin thrown at random struck the pullatius dead the hand of heaven is in the battle cried papirius the guilty is punished and he advanced and conquered1b a coincidence of this sort if it really occurred would very greatly strengthen the popular belief in auguries 1 pliny natural history bk x chap xxii bostock and rileys trans vol ii 1855 p 495 1b rev edward smedley ma the occult sciences encyclopaedia metropolitana ed by elihu rich 1855 p 144 the cock has always been reckoned a bird possessed of magic power at its crowing we are told all unquiet spirits who roam the earth depart to their dismal abodes and the orgies of the witches sabbath terminate a cock is the favourite sacrifice offered to evil spirits in ceylon and elsewhere alectromancy2 was an ancient and peculiarly senseless method of divination so called in which a cock was employed the bird had to be young and quite white its feet were cut off and crammed down its throat with a piece of parchment on which were written certain hebrew words the cock after the repetition of a prayer by the operator was placed in a circle divided into parts corresponding to the letters of the alphabet in each of which a grain of wheat was placed a certain psalm was recited and then the letters were noted from which the cock picked up the grains a fresh grain being put down for each one picked up these letters properly arranged were said to give the answer to the inquiry for which divination was made i am not sure what one was supposed to do if as seems likely the cock refused to act in the required manner 2 cf arthur edward waite the occult sciences 1891 pp 124 and 125 the owl was reckoned a bird of evil omen with the romans who derived this opinion from the etrurians along with much else of their socalled science of augury it was particularly dreaded if seen in a city or indeed anywhere by day pliny caius plinius secundus ad 61before 115 informs us that on one occasion a horned owl entered the very sanctuary of the capitol in consequence of which rome was purified on the nones of march in that year1 1 pliny natural history bk x chap xvi bostock and rileys trans vol ii 1855 p 492 the folklore of the british isles abounds with quaint beliefs and stories concerning birds there is a charming welsh legend concerning the robin which the rev t f t dyer quotes from notes and queriesfar far away is a land of woe darkness spirits of evil and fire day by day does this little bird bear in his bill a drop of water to quench the flame so near the burning stream does he fly that his dear little feathers are scorched and hence he is named brourhuddyn breastburnt to serve little children the robin dares approach the infernal pit no good child will hurt the devoted benefactor of man the robin returns from the land of fire and therefore he feels the cold of winter far more than his brother birds he shivers in the brumal blast hungry he chirps before your door2 2 t f thiselton dyer ma english folklore 1878 pp 65 and 66 another legend accounts for the robins red breast by supposing this bird to have tried to pluck a thorn from the crown encircling the brow of the crucified christ in order to alleviate his sufferings no doubt it is on account of these legends that it is considered a crime which will be punished with great misfortune to kill a robin in some places the same prohibition extends to the wren which is popularly believed to be the wife of the robin in other parts however the wren is or at least was cruelly hunted on certain days in the isle of man the wrenhunt took place on christmas eve and st stephens day and is accounted for by a legend concerning an evil fairy who lured many men to destruction but had to assume the form of a wren to escape punishment at the hands of an ingenious knighterrant for several centuries there was prevalent over the whole of civilised europe a most extraordinary superstition concerning the small arctic bird resembling but not so large as the common wild goose known as the barnacle or bernicle goose max mueller1 has suggested that this word was really derived from hibernicula the name thus referring to ireland where the birds were caught but common opinion associated the barnacle goose with the shellfish known as the barnacle which is found on timber exposed to the sea supposing that the former was generated out of the latter thus in one old medical writer we find there are founde in the north parts of scotland and the ilands adjacent called orchades orkney islands certain trees whereon doe growe certaine shell fishes of a white colour tending to russet wherein are conteined little liuing creatures which shells in time of maturitie doe open and out of them grow those little living things which falling into the water doe become foules whom we call barnakles but the other that do fall vpon the land perish and come to nothing this much by the writings of others and also from the mouths of the people of those parts1b 1 see f max muellers lectures on the science of language 1885 where a very full account of the tradition concerning the origin of the barnacle goose will be found 1b john gerarde the herball or generall historie of plantes 1597 1391 the writer however who was a wellknown surgeon and botanist of his day adds that he had personally examined certain shellfish from lancashire and on opening the shells had observed within birds in various stages of development no doubt he was deceived by some purely superficial resemblancesfor example the feet of the barnacle fish resemble somewhat the feathers of a bird he gives an imaginative illustration of the barnacle fowl escaping from its shell which is reproduced in fig 12 turning now from superstitions concerning actual birds to legends of those that are purely mythical passing reference must be made to the roc a bird existing in arabian legend which we meet in the arabian nights and which is chiefly remarkable for its size and strength the phoenix perhaps is of more interest of that famous bird of arabia pliny writes as follows prefixing his description of it with the cautious remark i am not quite sure that its existence is not all a fable it is said that there is only one in existence in the whole world and that that one has not been seen very often we are told that this bird is of the size of an eagle and has a brilliant golden plumage around the neck while the rest of the body is of a purple colour except the tail which is azure with long feathers intermingled of a roseate hue the throat is adorned with a crest and the head with a tuft of feathers the first roman who described this bird was the senator manilius he tells us that no person has ever seen this bird eat that in arabia it is looked upon as sacred to the sun that it lives five hundred and forty years that when it becomes old it builds a nest of cassia and sprigs of incense which it fills with perfumes and then lays its body down upon them to die that from its bones and marrow there springs at first a sort of small worm which in time changes into a little bird that the first thing that it does is to perform the obsequies of its predecessor and to carry the nest entire to the city of the sun near panchaia and there deposit it upon the altar of that divinity the same manilius states also that the revolution of the great year is completed with the life of this bird and that then a new cycle comes round again with the same characteristics as the former one in the seasons and the appearance of the stars this bird was brought to rome in the censorship of the emperor claudius and was exposed to public view this fact is attested by the public annals but there is no one that doubts that it was a fictitious phoenix only1 1 pliny natural history bk x chap ii bostock and rileys trans vol ii 1855 pp 479481 the description of the plumage etc of this bird applies fairly well as cuvier has pointed out2 to the golden pheasant and a specimen of the latter may have been the fictitious phoenix referred to above that this bird should have been credited with the extraordinary and wholly fabulous properties related by pliny and others is not however easy to understand the phoenix was frequently used to illustrate the doctrine of the immortality of the soul eg in clements first epistle to the corinthians and it is not impossible that originally it was nothing more than a symbol of immortality which in time became to be believed in as a really existing bird the fact however that there was supposed to be only one phoenix and also that the length of each of its lives coincided with what the ancients termed a great year may indicate that the phoenix was a symbol of cosmological periodicity on the other hand some ancient writers eg tacitus ad 55120 explicitly refer to the phoenix as a symbol of the sun and in the minds of the ancients the sun was closely connected with the idea of immortality certainly the accounts of the gorgeous colours of the plumage of the phoenix might well be descriptions of the rising sun it appears moreover that the egyptian hieroglyphic benu glyph which is a figure of a heron or crane and thus akin to the phoenix was employed to designate the rising sun 2 see cuviers the animal kingdom griffiths trans vol viii 1829 p 23 there are some curious jewish legends to account for the supposed immortality of the phoenix according to one it was the sole animal that refused to eat of the forbidden tree when tempted by eve according to another its immortality was conferred on it by noah because of its considerate behaviour in the ark the phoenix not clamouring for food like the other animals1 1 the existence of such fables as these shows how grossly the real meanings of the sacred writings have been misunderstood there is a celebrated bird in chinese tradition the fung hwang which some sinologues identify with the phoenix of the west2 according to a commentator on the rh ya this felicitous and perfect bird has a cocks head a snakes neck a swallows beak a tortoises back is of five different colours and more than six feet high 2 mr chas gould ba to whose book mythical monsters 1886 i am very largely indebted for my account of this bird and from which i have culled extracts from the chinese is not of this opinion certainly the fact that we read of fung hwangs in the plural whilst tradition asserts that there is only one phoenix seems to point to a difference in origin another account that in the lun yu tseh shwai shing tells us that its head resembles heaven its eye the sun its back the moon its wings the wind its foot the ground and its tail the woof furthermore its mouth contains commands its heart is conformable to regulations its ear is thoroughly acute in hearing its tongue utters sincerity its colour is luminous its comb resembles uprightness its spur is sharp and curved its voice is sonorous and its belly is the treasure of literature like the dragon tortoise and unicorn it was considered to be a spiritual creature but unlike the western phoenix more than one fung hwang was as i have pointed out believed to exist the birds were not always to be seen but according to chinese records they made their appearance during the reigns of certain sovereigns the fung hwang is regarded by the chinese as an omen of great happiness and prosperity and its likeness is embroidered on the robes of empresses to ensure success probably if the bird is not to be regarded as purely mythological and symbolic in origin we have in the stories of it no more than exaggerated accounts of some species of pheasant japanese literature contains similar stories of other fabulous birdforms mention may be made of the griffin and the harpy the former was a creature half eagle half lion popularly supposed to be the progeny of the union of these two latter it is described in the socalled voiage and travaile of sir john maundeville in the following terms1 sum men seyn that thei ben the body upward as an egle and benethe as a lyoun and treuly thei seyn sothe that thei ben of that schapp but o griffoun hathe the

of the griffin was its watchfulness its chief function being thought to be that of guarding secret treasure this characteristic no doubt accounts for its frequent use in heraldry as a supporter to the arms it was sacred to apollo the sungod whose chariot was according to early sculptures drawn by griffins pliny who speaks of it as a bird having long ears and a hooked beak regarded it as fabulous 1

other geographers it is probable that the name john de mandeville should be regarded as a pseudonym concealing the identity of jean de bourgogne a physician at liege mentioned under the name of joannes ad barbam in the vulgate latin version of the travels note in british museum catalogue the work which was first published in french during the latter part of the fourteenth century achieved an immense popularity the marvels that it relates being readily received by the credulous folk of that and many a succeeding day the harpies ie snatchers in greek mythology are creatures like vultures as to their bodies but with the faces of women and armed with sharp claws of monsters all most monstrous this no greater wrath god sends mongst men it comes from depth of pitchy hell and virgins face but womb like gulf unsatiate hath her hands are griping claws her colour pale and fell1 1 quoted from vergil by john guillim in his a display of heraldry sixth edition 1724 p 271 we meet with the harpies in the story of phineus a son of agenor king of thrace at the bidding of his jealous wife idaea daughter of dardanus phineus put out the sight of his children by his former wife cleopatra daughter of boreas to punish this cruelty the gods caused him to become blind and the harpies were sent continually to harass and affright him and to snatch away his food or defile it by their presence they were afterwards driven away by his brothersinlaw zetes and calais it has been suggested that originally the harpies were nothing more than personifications of the swift stormwinds and few of the old naturalists credulous as they were regarded them as real creatures though this cannot be said of all some other fabulous birdforms are to be met with in greek and arabian mythologies etc but they are not of any particular interest and it is time for us to conclude our present excursion and to seek for other byways v the powder of sympathy a curious medical superstition out of the superstitions of the past the science of the present has gradually evolved in the middle ages what by courtesy we may term medical science was as we have seen little better than a heterogeneous collection of superstitions and although various reforms were instituted with the passing of time superstition still continued for long to play a prominent part in medical practice one of the most curious of these old medical or perhaps i should say surgical superstitions was that relating to the powder of sympathy a remedy chiefly remembered in connection with the name of sir kenelm digby 16031665 though he was probably not the first to employ it the powder itself which was used as a cure for wounds was in fact nothing else than common vitriol1 though an improved and more elegant form if one may so describe it was composed of vitriol desiccated by the suns rays mixed with gum tragacanth it was in the application of the powder that the remedy was peculiar it was not as one might expect applied to the wound itself but any article that might have blood from the wound upon it was either sprinkled with the powder or else placed in a basin of water in which the powder had been dissolved and maintained at a temperate heat meanwhile the wound was kept clean and cool 1 green vitriol ferrous sulphate heptahydrate a compound of iron sulphur and oxygen crystallised with seven molecules of water represented by the formula feso47h2o on exposure to the air it loses water and is gradually converted into basic ferric sulphate for long green vitriol was confused with blue vitriol which generally occurs as an impurity in crude green vitriol blue vitriol is copper sulphate pentahydrate cuso45h2o sir kenelm digby appears to have delivered a discourse dealing with the famous powder before a learned assembly at montpellier in france at least a work purporting to be a translation of such a discourse was published in 16581 and further editions appeared in 1660 and 1664 kenelm was a son of the sir everard digby 15781606 who was executed for his share in the gunpowder plot in spite of this fact however james i appears to have regarded him with favour he was a man of romantic temperament possessed of charming manners considerable learning and even greater credulity his contemporaries seem to have differed in their opinions concerning him evelyn 16201706 the diarist after inspecting his chemical laboratory rather harshly speaks of him as an errant mountebank elsewhere he well refers to him as a teller of strange thingsthis was on the occasion of digbys relating a story of a lady who had such an aversion to roses that one laid on her cheek produced a blister 1 a late discourse by sir kenelm digby ktc touching the cure of wounds by the powder of sympathyrendered out of french into english by r white gent 1658 this is entitled the second edition but appears to have been the first to return to the late discourse after some preliminary remarks sir kenelm records a cure which he claims to have effected by means of the powder it appears that james howell 15941666 afterwards historiographer royal to charles ii had in the attempt to separate two friends engaged in a duel received two serious wounds in the hand to proceed in the writers own wordsit was my chance to be lodged hard by him and four or five days after as i was making myself ready he mr howell came to my house and prayed me to view his wounds for i understand said he that you have extraordinary remedies upon such occasions and my surgeons apprehend some fear that it may grow to a gangrene and so the hand must be cut off i asked him then for any thing that had the blood upon it so he presently sent for his garter wherewith his hand was first bound and having called for a bason of water as if i would wash my hands i took an handfull of powder of vitrol which i had in my study and presently dissolved it as soon as the bloody garter was brought me i put it within the bason observing in the interim what mr howel did who stood talking with a gentleman in the corner of my chamber not regarding at all what i was doing but he started suddenly as if he had found some strange alteration in himself i asked him what he ailed i know not what ailes me but i find that i feel no more pain methinks that a pleasing kind of freshnesse as it were a wet cold napkin did spread over my hand which hath taken away the inflammation that tormented me before i replied since that you feel already so good an effect of my medicament i advise you to cast away all your plaisters onely keep the wound clean and in a moderate temper twixt heat and cold this was presently reported to the duke of buckingham and a little after to the king james i who were both very curious to know the issue of the businesse which was that after dinner i took the garter out of the water and put it to dry before a great fire it was scarce dry but mr howels servant came running and told me that his master felt as much burning as ever he had done if not more for the heat was such as if his hand were betwixt coales of fire i answered that although that had happened at present yet he should find ease in a short time for i knew the reason of this new accident and i would provide accordingly for his master should be free from that inflammation it may be before he could possibly return unto him but in case he found no ease i wished him to come presently back again if not he might forbear coming thereupon he went and at the instant i did put again the garter into the water thereupon he found his master without any pain at all to be brief there was no sense of pain afterward but within five or six dayes the wounds were cicatrized and entirely healed1 1 ibid pp 711 sir kenelm proceeds in this discourse to relate that he obtained the secret of the powder from a carmelite who had learnt it in the east sir kenelm says that he told it only to king james and his celebrated physician sir theodore mayerne 15731655 the latter disclosed it to the duke of mayerne whose surgeon sold the secret to various persons until ultimately as sir kenelm remarks it became known to every country barber however digbys real connection with the powder has been questioned in an appendix to dr nathanael highmores 16131685 the history of generation published in 1651 entitled a discourse of the cure of wounds by sympathy the powder is referred to as sir gilbert talbots powder nor does it appear to have been digby who brought the claims of the sympathetic powder before the notice of the then recentlyformed royal society although he was a by no means inactive member of the society highmore however in the appendix to the work referred to above does refer to digbys reputed cure of howells wounds already mentioned and after the publication of digbys discourse the powder became generally known as sir kenelm digbys sympathetic powder as such it is referred to in an advertisement appended to wit and drollery 1661 by the bookseller nathanael brook1 1 this advertisement is as follows these are to give notice that sir kenelme digbies sympathetical powder prepard by promethean fire curing all green wounds that come within the compass of a remedy and likewise the toothache infallibly in a very short time is to be had at mr nathanael brooks at the angel in cornhil the belief in cure by sympathy however is much older than digbys or talbots sympathetic powder paracelsus described an ointment consisting essentially of the moss on the skull of a man who had died a violent death combined with boars and bears fat burnt worms dried boars brain red sandalwood and mummy which was used to cure wounds in a similar manner being applied to the weapon with which the hurt had been inflicted with reference to this ointment readers will probably recall the passage in scotts lay of the last minstrel canto 3 stanza 23 respecting the magical cure of william of deloraines wound by the ladye of branksome she drew the splinter from the wound and with a charm she stanchd the blood she bade the gash be cleansd and bound no longer by his couch she stood but she had taen the broken lance and washed it from the clotted gore and salved the splinter oer and oer william of deloraine in trance wheneer she turned it round and round twisted as if she galld his wound then to her maidens she did say that he should be whole man and sound within the course of a night and day full long she toild for she did rue mishap to friend so stout and true francis bacon 15611626 writes of sympathetic cures as followsit is constantly received and avouched that the anointing of the weapon that maketh the wound wil heale the wound it selfe in this experiment upon the relation of men of credit though my selfe as yet am not fully inclined to beleeve it you shal note the points following first the ointment is made of divers ingredients whereof the strangest and hardest to come by are the mosse upon the skull of a dead man vnburied and the fats of a boare and a beare killed in the act of generation these two last i could easily suspect to be prescribed as a starting hole that if the experiment proved not it mought be pretended that the beasts were not killed in due time for as for the mosse it is certain there is great quantity of it in ireland upon slain bodies laid on heaps vnburied the other ingredients are the bloudstone in powder and some other things which seeme to have a vertue to stanch bloud as also the mosse hath secondly the same kind of ointment applied to the hurt it selfe worketh not the effect but onely applied to the weapon fourthly it may be applied to the weapon though the party hurt be at a great distance fifthly it seemeth the imagination of the party to be cured is not needfull to concurre for it may be done without the knowledge of the party wounded and thus much hath been tried that the ointment for experiments sake hath been wiped off the weapon without the knowledge of the party hurt and presently the party hurt hath been in great rage of paine till the weapon was reannointed sixthly it is affirmed that if you cannot get the weapon yet if you put an instrument of iron or wood resembling the weapon into the wound whereby it bleedeth the annointing of that instrument will serve and work the effect this i doubt should be a device to keep this strange forme of cure in request and use because many times you cannot come by the weapon it selve seventhly the wound be at first washed clean with white wine or the parties own water and then bound up close in fine linen and no more dressing renewed till it be whole1 1 francis bacon sylva sylvarum or a natural history published after the authors death the sixt edition 1651 p 217 owing to the demand for making this ointment quite a considerable trade was done in skulls from ireland upon which moss had grown owing to their exposure to the atmosphere high prices being obtained for fine specimens the idea underlying the belief in the efficacy of sympathetic remedies namely that by acting on part of a thing or on a symbol of it one thereby acts magically on the whole or the thing symbolised is the rootidea of all magic and is of extreme antiquity digby and others however tried to give a natural explanation to the supposed efficacy of the powder they argued that particles of the blood would ascend from the bloody cloth or weapon only coming to rest when they had reached their natural home in the wound from which they had originally issued these particles would carry with them the more volatile part of the vitriol which would effect a cure more readily than when combined with the grosser part of the vitriol in the days when there was hardly any knowledge of chemistry and physics this theory no doubt bore every semblance of truth in passing however it is interesting to note that digbys discourse called forth a reply from j f helvetius or schwettzer 16251709 physician to the prince of orange who afterwards became celebrated as an alchemist who had achieved the magnum opus1 1 see my alchemy ancient and modern 1911 sese 6367 writing of the sympathetic powder professor de morgan wittily argues that it must have been quite efficacious he says the directions were to keep the wound clean and cool and to take care of diet rubbing the salve on the knife or sword if we remember the dreadful notions upon drugs which prevailed both as to quantity and quality we shall readily see that any way of not dressing the wound would have been useful if the physicians had taken the hint had been careful of diet etc and had poured the little barrels of medicine down the throat of a practicable doll they would have had their magical cures as well as the surgeons2 as dr pettigrew has pointed out3 nature exhibits very remarkable powers in effecting the healing of wounds by adhesion when her processes are not impeded in fact many cases have been recorded in which noses ears and fingers severed from the body have been rejoined thereto merely by washing the parts placing them in close continuity and allowing the natural powers of the body to effect the healing moreover in spite of bacons remarks on this point the effect of the imagination of the patient who was usually not ignorant that a sympathetic cure was to be attempted must be taken into account for without going to the excesses of christian science in this respect the fact must be recognised that the state of the mind exercises a powerful effect on the natural forces of the body and a firm faith is undoubtedly helpful in effecting the cure of any sort of ill 2 professor augustus de morgan a budget of paradoxes 1872 p 66 3 thomas joseph pettigrew frs on superstitions connected

this arabic word is itself probably derived from the greek telesma in its late meaning of a religious mystery or consecrated object the term is often employed to designate amulets in general but correctly speaking it has a more restricted and special significance a talisman may be defined briefly as an astrological or other symbol expressive of the influence and power of one of the planets engraved on a sympathetic stone or metal or inscribed on specially prepared parchment under the auspices of this planet before proceeding to an account of the preparation of talismans proper it will not be out of place to notice some of the more interesting and curious of other amulets all sorts of substances have been employed as charms sometimes of a very unpleasant nature such as dried toads generally however amulets consist of stones herbs or passages from sacred writings written on paper this latter class are sometimes called characts as an example of which may be mentioned the jewish phylacteries every precious stone was supposed to exercise its own peculiar virtue for instance amber was regarded as a good remedy for throat troubles and agate was thought to preserve from snakebites elihu rich1 gives a very full list of stones and their supposed virtues each sign of the zodiac was supposed to have its own particular stone2 as shown in the annexed table and hence the

bloodstone is frequently assigned either to aries or scorpio owing to its symbolical connection with mars and the opal to cancer which in astrology is the constellation of the moon confusion is rendered still worse by the fact that the ancients whilst in some cases using the same names as ourselves applied them to different stones thus their hyacinth is our sapphire whilst their sapphire is our lapis lazuli certain herbs culled at favourable conjunctions of the planets and worn as amulets were held to be very efficacious against various diseases precious stones and metals were also taken internally for the same purposeremedies which in certain cases must have proved exceedingly harmful one theory put forward for the supposed medical value of amulets was the doctrine of effluvia this theory supposes the amulets to give off vapours or effluvia which penetrate into the body and effect a cure it is of course true that certain herbs etc might under the heat of the body give off such effluvia but the theory on the whole is manifestly absurd the doctrine of signatures which we have already encountered in our excursions1 may also be mentioned in this connection as a complementary and equally untenable hypothesis according to elihu rich2 the following were the commonest egyptian amulets 1 those inscribed with the figure of serapis used to preserve against evils inflicted by earth 2 figure of canopus against evil by water 3 figure of a hawk against evil from the air 4 figure of an asp against evil by fire paracelsus believed there to be much occult virtue in an alloy of the seven chief metals which he called electrum certain definite proportions of these metals had to be taken and each was to be added during a favourable conjunction of the planets from this electrum he supposed that valuable amulets and magic mirrors could be prepared 1 see medicine and magic 2 op cit p 343 a curious and ancient amulet for the cure of various diseases particularly the ague was a triangle formed of the letters of the word abracadabra the usual form was that shown in fig 19 and that shown in fig 20 was also known the origin of this magical word is lost in obscurity the belief in the horn as a powerful amulet especially prevalent in italy where is it the custom of the common people to make the sign of the mano cornuto to avoid the consequence of the dreaded jettatore or evil eye can be traced to the fact that the horn was the symbol of the goddess of the moon probably the belief in the powers of the horseshoe had a similar origin indeed it seems likely that not only this but most other amulets like talismans properas will appear belowwere originally designed as appeals to gods and other powerful spiritual beings abracadabra abracadabra abracadabr bracadabra

attention however to the art of preparing talismans proper i may remark at the outset that it was necessary for the talisman to be prepared by ones own selfa task by no means easy as a rule indeed the right mental attitude of the occultist was insisted upon as essential to the operation as to the various signs to be engraver on the talismans various authorities differ though there are certain points connected with the art of talismanic magic on which they all agree it so happened that the ancients were acquainted with seven metals and seven planets including the sun and moon as planets and the days of the week are also seven it was concluded therefore that there was some occult connection between the planets metals and days of the week each of the seven days of the week was supposed to be under the auspices of the spirits of one of the planets so also was the generation in the womb of nature of each of the seven chief metals in the following table are shown these particulars in detail planet symbol day of metal colour sun sunday gold gold or yellow moon monday silver silver or white mars tuesday iron red mercury wednesday 1mercury mixed colours or purple jupiter thursday tin violet or blue venus friday copper turquoise or green saturn saturday lead black 1 used in the form of a solid amalgam for talismans consequently the metal of which a talisman was to be made and also the time of its preparation had to be chosen with due regard to the planet under which it was to be prepared1 the power of such a talisman was thought to be due to the genie of this planeta talisman was in fact a silent evocation of an astral spirit examples of the belief that a genie can be bound up in an amulet in some way are afforded by the story of aladdins lamp and ring and other stories in the thousand and one nights sometimes the talismanic signs were engraved on precious stones sometimes they were inscribed on parchment in both cases the same principle held good the nature of the stone chosen or the colour of the ink employed being that in correspondence with the planet under whose auspices the talisman was prepared 1 in this connection a rather surprising discovery made by mr w gornold see his a manual of occultism 1911 pp 7 and 8 must be mentioned the ancient chaldeans appear invariably to have enumerated the planets in the following order saturn jupiter mars sun venus mercury moonwhich order was adopted by the mediaeval astrologers let us commence with the sun in the above sequence and write down every third planet we then have sun sunday moon monday mars tuesday mercury wednesday jupiter thursday venus friday saturn saturday that is to say we have the planets in the order in which they were supposed to rule over the days of the week this is perhaps not so surprising because it seems probable that each day being first divided into twentyfour hours it was assumed that the planets ruled for one hour in turn in the order first mentioned above each day was then named after the planet which ruled during its first hour it will be found that if we start with the sun and write down every twentyfourth planet the result is exactly the same as if we write down every third but mr old points out further doing so by means of a diagram which seems to be rather cumbersome that if we start with saturn in the first place and write down every fifth planet and then for each planet substitute the metal over which it was supposed to rule we then have these metals arranged in descending order of atomic weights thus saturn lead 207 mercury mercury 200 sun gold 197 jupiter tin 119 moon silver 108 venus copper 64 mars iron 56 similarly we can starting from any one of these orders pass to the other two the fact is a very surprising one because the ancients could not possibly have been acquainted with the atomic weights of the metals and it is important to note the order of the densities of these metals which might possibly have been known to them is by no means the same as the order of their atomic weights whether the fact indicates a real relationship between the planets and the metals or whether there is some other explanation i am not prepared to say certainly some explanation is needed to say that the fact is mere coincidence is unsatisfactory seeing that the odds against not merely this but any such regularity occurring by chanceas calculated by the mathematical theory of probabilityare 119 to 1 all the instruments employed in the art had to be specially prepared and consecrated special robes had to be worn perfumes and incense burnt and invocations conjurations etc recited all of which depended on the planet ruling the operation a description of a few typical talismans in detail will not here be out of place in the key of solomon the king translated by s l m mathers 18891 are described five six or seven talismans for each planet each of these was supposed to have its own peculiar virtues and many of them are stated to be of use in the evocation of spirits the majority of them consist of a central design encircled by a verse of hebrew scripture the central designs are of a varied character generally geometrical figures and hebrew letters or words or magical characters five of these talismans are here portrayed the first three described differing from the above the translations of the hebrew verses etc given below are due to mr mathers 1 the clavicula salomonis or key of solomon the king consists mainly of an elaborate ritual for the evocation of the various planetary spirits in which process the use of talismans or pentacles plays a prominent part it is claimed to be a work of white magic but inasmuch as it like other old books making the same claim gives descriptions of a pentacle for causing ruin destruction and death and another for causing earthquakesto give only two examplesthe distinction between black and white magic which we shall no doubt encounter again in later excursions appears to be somewhat arbitrary regarding the authorship of the work mr mathers translator and editor of the first printed copy of the book says i see no reason to doubt the tradition which assigns the authorship of the key to king solomon if this view be accepted however it is abundantly evident that the key as it stands at present in which we find s john quoted and mention made of ss peter and paul must have received some considerable alterations and additions at the hands of later editors but even if we are compelled to assign the clavicula salomonis in its present form to the fourteenth or fifteenth century we must i think allow that it was based upon traditions of the past and of course the possibility remains that it might have been based upon some earlier work with regard to the antiquity of the planetary sigils mr mathers notes that among the gnostic talismans in the british museum there is a ring of copper with the sigils of venus which are exactly the same as those given by mediaeval writers on magic in spite of the absurdity of its claims viewed in the light of modern knowledge the clavicula salomonis exercised a considerable influence in the past and is to be regarded as one of the chief sources of mediaeval ceremonial magic historically speaking therefore it is a book of no little importance the first pentacle of the sunthe countenance of shaddai the almighty at whose aspect all creatures obey and the angelic spirits do reverence on bended knees about the face is the name el shaddai around is written in latin behold his face and form by whom all things were made and whom all creatures obey see fig 21 the fifth pentacle of marswrite thou this pentacle upon virgin parchment or paper because it is terrible unto the demons and at its sight and aspect they will obey thee for they cannot resist its presence the design is a scorpion1 around which the word hvl is repeated the hebrew versicle is from psalm xci 13 thou shalt go upon the lion and adder the young lion and the dragon shalt thou tread under thy feet see fig 22 1 in astrology the zodiacal sign of the scorpion is the night house of the planet mars the third pentacle of the moonthis being duly borne with thee when upon a journey if it be properly made serveth against all attacks by night and against every kind of danger and peril by water the design consists of a hand and sleeved forearm this occurs on three other moon talismans together with the hebrew names aub and vevaphel the versicle is from psalm xl 13 be pleased o ihvh to deliver me o ihvh make haste to help me see fig 23 the third pentacle of venusthis if it be only shown unto any person serveth to attract love its angel monachiel should be invoked in the day and hour of venus at one oclock or at eight the design consists of two triangles joined at their apices with the following namesihvh adonai ruach achides aegalmiel monachiel and degaliel the versicle is from genesis i 28 and the elohim blessed them and the elohim said unto them be ye fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it see fig 24 the third pentacle of mercurythis serves to invoke the spirits subject unto mercury and especially those who are written in this pentacle the design consists of crossed lines and magical characters of mercury around are the names of the angels kokaviel ghedoriah savaniah and chokmahiel see fig 25 cornelius agrippa in his three books of occult philosophy describes another interesting system of talismans francis barretts magus or celestial intelligencer a wellknown occult work published in the first year of the nineteenth century i may mention copies agrippas system of talismans without acknowledgment almost word for word to each of the planets is assigned a magic square or table ie a square composed of numbers so arranged that the sum of each row or column is always the same for example the table for mars is as follows 11 24 7 20 3 4 12 25 8 16 17 5 13 21 9 10 18 1 14 22 23 6 19 2 15 it will be noticed that every number from 1 up to the highest possible occurs once and that no number occurs twice it will also be seen that the sum of each row and of each column is always 65 similar squares can be constructed containing any square number of figures and it is indeed by no means surprising that the remarkable properties of such magic squares before these were explained mathematically gave rise to the belief that they had some occult significance and virtue from the magic squares can be obtained certain numbers which are said to be the numbers of the planets their orderliness we are told reflects the order of the heavens and from a consideration of them the magical properties of the planets which they represent can be arrived at for example in the above table the number of rows of numbers is 5 the total number of numbers in the table is the square of this number namely 25 which is also the greatest number in the table the sum of any row or column is 65 and finally the sum of all the numbers is the product of the number of rows namely 5 and the sum of any row namely 65 ie 325 these numbers namely 5 25 65 and 325 are the numbers of mars sets of numbers for the other planets are obtained in exactly the same manner1 1 readers acquainted with mathematics will notice that if n is the number of rows in such a magic square the other numbers derived as above will be n2s 12nn2s 1 and 12n2sn2s 1 this can readily be proved by the laws of arithmetical progressions rather similar but more complicated and less uniform magic squares are attributed to paracelsus now to each planet is assigned an intelligence or good spirit and an evil spirit or demon and the names of these spirits are related to certain of the numbers of the planets the other numbers are also connected with holy and magical hebrew names agrippa and barrett copying him gives the following table of names answering to the numbers of mars 5 he the letter of the holy name hb 25 hb 65 adonai hb 325 graphiel the intelligence of mars hb 325 barzabel the spirit of mars hb similar tables are given for the other planets the numbers can be derived from the names by regarding the hebrew letters of which they are composed as numbers in which case hb aleph to hb teth represent the units 1 to 9 in order hb jod to hb tzade the tens 10 to 90 in order hb koph to hb tau the hundreds 100 to 400 whilst the hundreds 500 to 900 are represented by special terminal forms of certain of the hebrew letters2 it is evident that no little wasted ingenuity must have been employed in working all this out 2 it may be noticed that this makes hb equal to 326 one unit too much possibly an alelph should be omitted each planet has its own seal or signature as well as the signature of its intelligence and the signature of its demon these signatures were supposed to represent the characters of the planets intelligences and demons respectively the signature of mars is shown in fig 26 that of its intelligence in fig 27 and that of its demon in fig 28 these various details were inscribed on the talismans each of which was supposed to confer its own peculiar benefitsas follows on one side must be engraved the proper magic table and the astrological sign of the planet together with the highest planetary number the sacred names corresponding to the planet and the name of the intelligence of the planet but not the name of its demon on the other side must be engraved the seals of the planet and of its intelligence and also the astrological sign barrett says regarding the demons1 it is to be understood that the intelligences are the presiding good angels that are set over the planets but that the spirits or daemons with their names seals or characters are never inscribed upon any talisman except to execute any evil effect and that they are subject to the intelligences or good spirits and again when the spirits and their characters are used it will be more conducive to the effect to add some divine name appropriate to that effect which we desire evil talismans can also be prepared we are informed by using a metal antagonistic to the signs engraved thereon the complete talisman of mars is shown in fig 29 1 francis barrett the magus or celestial intelligencer 1801 bk i p 146 alphonse louis constant1 a famous french occultist of the nineteenth century who wrote under the name of eliphas levi describes yet another system of talismans he says the pentagram must be always engraved on one side of the talisman with a circle for the sun a crescent for the moon a winged caduceus for mercury a sword for mars a g for venus a crown for jupiter and a scythe for saturn the other side of the talisman should bear the sign of solomon that is the sixpointed star formed by two interlaced triangles in the centre there should be placed a human figure for the sun talismans a cup for those of the moon a dogs head for those of jupiter a lion for those of mars a doves for those of venus a bulls or goats for those of saturn the names of the seven angels should be added either in hebrew arabic or magic characters similar to those of the alphabets of trimethius the two triangles of solomon may be replaced by the double cross of ezekiels wheels this being found on a great number of ancient pentacles all objects of this nature whether in metals or in precious stones should be carefully wrapped in silk satchels of a colour analogous to the spirit of the planet perfumed with the perfumes of the corresponding day and preserved from all impure looks and touches2 1 for a biographical and critical account of this extraordinary personage and his views see mr a e waites the mysteries of magic a digest of the writings of eliphas levi 1897 2 op cit p 201 eliphas levi following pythagoras and many of the mediaeval magicians regarded the pentagram or fivepointed star as an extremely powerful pentacle according to him if with one horn in the ascendant it is the sign of the microcosmman with two horns in the ascendant however it is the sign of the devil the accursed goat of mendes and an instrument of black magic we can indeed trace some faint likeness between the pentagram and the outline form of a man or of a goats head according to whether it has one or two horns in the ascendant respectively which resemblances may account for this idea fig 30 shows the pentagram embellished with other symbols according to eliphas levi whilst fig 31 shows his embellished form of the sixpointed star or seal of solomon this he says is the sign of the macrocosmos but is less powerful than the pentagram the microcosmic sign thus contradicting pythagoras who as we have seen regarded the pentagram as the sign of the macrocosm eliphas levi asserts that he attempted the evocation of the spirit of apollonius of tyana in london on 24th july 1854 by the aid of a pentagram and other magical apparatus and ritual apparently with success if we may believe his word but he sensibly suggests that probably the apparition which appeared was due to the effect of the ceremonies on his own imagination and comes to the conclusion that such magical experiments are injurious to health1 1 op cit pp 446450 magical rings were prepared on the same principle as were talismans says cornelius agrippa the manner of making these kinds of magical rings is this viz when any star ascends fortunately with the fortunate aspect or conjunction of the moon we must take a stone and herb that is under that star and make a ring of the metal that is suitable to this star and in it fasten the stone putting the herb or root under itnot omitting the inscriptions of images names and characters as also the proper suffumigations1 solomons ring was supposed to have been possessed of remarkable occult virtue says josephus c ad 37100 god also enabled him solomon to learn that skill which expels demons which is a science useful and sanative to men he composed such incantations also by which distempers are alleviated and he left behind him the manner of using exorcisms by which they drive away demons so that they never return and this method of cure is of great force unto this day for i have seen a certain man of my own country whose name was eleazar releasing people that were demoniacal in the presence of vespasian and his sons and his captains and the whole multitude of his soldiers the manner of the cure was this he put a ring that had under the seal a root of one of those sorts mentioned by solomon to the nostrils of the demoniac after which he drew out the demon through his nostrils and when the man fell down immediately he abjured him to return unto him no more making still mention of solomon and reciting the incantations which he composed2 1 h c agrippa occult philosophy bk i chap xlvii whiteheads edition pp 141 and 142 2 flavius josephus the antiquities of the jews trans by w whiston bk viii chap ii se 5 45 to 47 enough has been said already to indicate the general nature of talismanic magic no one could maintain otherwise than that much of it is pure nonsense but the subject should not therefore be dismissed as valueless or lacking significance it is past belief that amulets and talismans should have been believed in for so long unless they appeared to be productive of some of the desired results though these may have been due to forces quite other than those which were supposed to be operative indeed it may be said that there has been no widely held superstition which does not embody some truth like some small specks of gold hidden in an uninviting mass of quartz as the poet blake put it everything possible to be believd is an image of truth1 and the attempt may here be made to extract the gold of truth from the quartz of superstition concerning talismanic magic for this purpose the various theories regarding the supposed efficacy of talismans must be examined 1 proverbs of hell the marriage of heaven and hell two of these theories have already been noted but the doctrine of effluvia admittedly applied only to a certain class of amulets and i think need not be seriously considered the astralspirit theory as it may be called in its ancient form at any rate is equally untenable today the discoveries of new planets and new metals seem destructive of the belief that there can be any occult connection between planets metals and the days of the week although the curious fact discovered by mr old to which i have referred footnote p 63 assuredly demands an explanation and a certain validity may perhaps be allowed to astrological symbolism as concerns the belief in the existence of what may be called although the term is not a very happy one discarnate spirits however the matter in view of the modern investigation of spiritistic and other abnormal psychical phenomena stands in a different position there can indeed be little doubt that very many of the phenomena observed at spiritistic seances come under the category of deliberate fraud and an even larger number perhaps can be explained on the theory of the subconscious self i think however that the evidence goes to show that there is a residuum of phenomena which can only be explained by the operation in some way of discarnate intelligences1 psychical research may be said to have supplied the modern world with the evidence of the existence of discarnate personalities and of their operation on the material plane which the ancient world lacked but so far as our present subject is concerned all the evidence obtainable goes to show that the phenomena in question only take place in the presence of what is called a mediuma person of peculiar nervous or psychical organisation that this is the case moreover appears to be the general belief of spiritists on the subject in the sense then in which a talisman connotes a material object of such a nature that by its aid the powers of discarnate intelligences may become operative on material things we might apply the term talisman to the nervous system of a medium but then that would be the only talisman consequently even if one is prepared to admit the whole of modern spiritistic theory nothing is thereby gained towards a belief in talismans and no light is shed upon the subject 1 the publications of the society for psychical research and frederick myers monumental work on human personality and its survival of bodily death should be specially consulted i have attempted a brief discussion of modern spiritualism and psychical research in my matter spirit and the cosmos 1910 chap ii another theory concerning talismans which commended itself to many of the old occult philosophers paracelsus for instance is what may be called the occult force theory this theory assumes the existence of an occult mental force a force capable of being exerted by the human will apart from its usual mode of operation by means of the body it was believed to be possible to concentrate this mental energy and infuse it into some suitable medium with the production of a talisman which was thus regarded as a sort of accumulator for mental energy the theory seems a fantastic one to modern thought though in view of the many startling phenomena brought to light by psychical research it is not advisable to be too positive regarding the limitations of the powers of the human mind however i think we shall find the element of truth in the otherwise absurd belief in talismans by means of what may be called not altogether fancifully perhaps a transcendental interpretation of this occult force theory i suggest that is that when a believer makes a talisman the transference of the occult energy is ideal not actual that the power believed to reside in the talisman itself is the power due to the reflex action of the believers mind the power of what transcendentalists call the imagination cannot be denied for example no one can deny that a man with a firm conviction that such a success will be achieved by him or such a danger avoided will be far more likely to gain his desire other conditions being equal than one of a pessimistic turn of mind the mere conviction itself is a factor in success or a factor in failure according to its nature and it seems likely that herein will be found a true explanation of the effects believed to be due to the power of the talisman on the other hand however we must beware of the exaggerations into which certain schools of thought have fallen in their estimates of the powers of the imagination these exaggerations are particularly marked in the views which are held by many nowadays with regard to faithhealing although the christian scientists get out of the difficultyat least to their own satisfactionby ascribing their alleged cures to the power of the divine mind and not to the power of the individual mind of course the real question involved in this transcendental theory of talismans as i may perhaps call it is that of the operation of incarnate spirit on the plane of matter this operation takes place only through the medium of the nervous system and it has been suggested1 to avoid any violation of the law of the conservation of energy that it is effected not by the transference as is sometimes supposed of energy from the spiritual to the material plane but merely by means of directive control over the expenditure of energy derived by the body from purely physical sources eg the latent chemical energy bound up in the food eaten and the oxygen breathed 1 cf sir oliver lodge life and matter 1907 especially chap ix and w hibbert fic life and energy 1904 i am not sure that this theory really avoids the difficulty which it is intended to obviate1 but it is at least an interesting one and at any rate there may be modes in which the body under the directive control of the spirit may expend energy derived from the material plane of which we know little or nothing we have the testimony of many eminent authorities2 to the phenomenon of the movement of physical objects without contact at spiritistic seances it seems to me that the introduction of discarnate intelligences to explain this phenomenon is somewhat gratuitousthe psychic phenomena which yield evidence of the survival of human personality after bodily death are of a different character for if we suppose this particular phenomenon to be due to discarnate spirits we must in view of what has been said concerning mediums conclude that the movements in question are not produced by these spirits directly but through and by means of the nervous system of the medium present evidently therefore the means for the production of the phenomenon reside in the human nervous system or at any rate in the peculiar nervous system of mediums and all that is lacking is intelligence or initiative to use these means this intelligence or initiative can surely be as well supplied by the subconsciousness as by a discarnate intelligence consequently it does not seem unreasonable to suppose that equally remarkable phenomena may have been produced by the aid of talismans in the days when these were believed in and may be produced today if one has sufficient faiththat is to say produced by man when in the peculiar condition of mind brought about by the intense belief in the power of a talisman and here it should be noted that the term talisman may be applied to any object or doctrine that is believed to possess peculiar power or efficacy in this fact i think is to be found the peculiar danger of erroneous doctrines which promise extraordinary benefits here and now on the material plane to such as believe in them remarkable results may follow an intense belief in such doctrines which whilst having no connection whatever with their accuracy being proportional only to the intensity with which they are held cannot do otherwise than confirm the believer in the validity of his beliefs though these may be in every way highly fantastic and erroneous both the roman catholic therefore and the buddhist may admit many of the marvels attributed to the relics of each others saints though in denying that these marvels prove the accuracy of each others religious doctrines each should remember that the same is true of his own 1 the subject is rather too technical to deal with here i have discussed it elsewhere see thermodynamical objections to the mechanical theory of life the chemical news vol cxii pp 271 et seq 3rd december 1915 2 for instance the wellknown physicist sir w f barrett frs late professor of experimental physics in the royal college of science for ireland see his on the threshold of a new world of thought 1908 se 10 in illustration of the real power of the imagination i may instance the maori superstition of the taboo according to the maories anyone who touches a tabooed object will assuredly die the tabooed object being a sort of antitalisman professor frazer1 says cases have been known of maories dying of sheer fright on learning that they had unwittingly eaten the remains of a chiefs dinner or handled something that belonged to him since such objects were ipso facto tabooed he gives the following case on good authority a woman having partaken of some fine peaches from a basket was told that they had come from a tabooed place immediately the basket dropped from her hands and she cried out in agony that the atua or godhead of the chief whose divinity had been thus profaned would kill her that happened in the afternoon and next day by twelve oclock she was dead for us the power of the taboo does not exist for the maori who implicitly believes in it it is a very potent reality but this power of the taboo resides not in external objects but in his own mind 1 professor j g frazer dcl psyches task 1909 p 7 dr haddon2 quotes a similar but still more remarkable story of a young congo negro which very strikingly shows the power of the imagination the young negro being on a journey lodged at a friends house the latter got a wild hen for his breakfast and the young man asked if it were a wild hen his host answered no then he fell on heartily and afterwards proceeded on his journey after four years these two met together again and his old friend asked him if he would eat a wild hen to which he answered that it was tabooed to him hereat the host began immediately to laugh inquiring of him what made him refuse it now when he had eaten one at his table about four years ago at the hearing of this the negro immediately fell atrembling and suffered himself to be so far possessed with the effects of imagination that he died in less than twentyfour hours after 2 alfred c haddon scd frs magic and fetishism 1906 p 56 there are of course many stories about amulets etc which cannot be thus explained for example elihu rich gives the following in 1568 we are told transl of salverte p 196 that the prince of orange condemned a spanish prisoner to be shot at juliers the soldiers tied him to a tree and fired but he was invulnerable they then stripped him to see what armour he wore but they found only an amulet bearing the figure of a lamb the agnus dei we presume this was taken from him and he was then killed by the first shot de baros relates that the portuguese in like manner vainly attempted to destroy a malay so long as he wore a bracelet containing a bone set in gold which rendered him proof against their swords a similar marvel is related in the travels of the veracious marco polo in an attempt of kublai khan to make a conquest of the island of zipangu a jealousy arose between the two commanders of the expedition which led to an order for putting the whole garrison to the sword in obedience to this order the heads of all were cut off excepting of eight persons who by the efficacy of a diabolical charm consisting of a jewel or amulet introduced into the right arm between the skin and the flesh were rendered secure from the effects of iron either to kill or wound upon this discovery being made they were beaten with a heavy wooden club and presently died 1 i think however that these and many similar stories must be taken cum grano salis in conclusion mention must be made of a very interesting and suggestive philosophical doctrinethe law of correspondencesdue in its explicit form to the swedish philosopher who was both scientist and mystic emanuel swedenborg to deal in any way adequately with this important topic is totally impossible within the confines of the present discussion2 but to put the matter as briefly as possible it may be said that swedenborg maintains and the conclusion i think is valid that all causation is from the spiritual world physical causation being but secondary or apparentthat is to say a mere reflection as it were of the true process he argues from this thereby supplying a philosophical basis for the unanimous belief of the naturemystics that every natural object is the symbol because the creation of an idea or spiritual verity in its widest sense thus there are symbols which are inherent in the nature of things and symbols which are not the former are genuine the latter merely artificial writing from the transcendental point of view eliphas levi says ceremonies vestments perfumes characters and figures beingnecessary to enlist the imagination in the education of the will the success of magical works depends upon the faithful observance of all the rites which are in no sense fantastic or arbitrary having been transmitted to us by antiquity and permanently subsisting by the essential laws of analogical realisation and of the correspondence which inevitably connects ideas and forms1b some scepticism perhaps may be permitted as to the validity of the latter part of this statement and the former may be qualified by the proviso that such things are only of value in the right education of the will if they are indeed genuine and not merely artificial symbols but the writer as i think will be admitted has grasped the essential point and to conclude our excursion as we began it with a definition i will say that the power of the talisman is the power of the mind or imagination brought into activity by means of a suitable symbol 1 elihu rich the occult sciences p 346 2 i may refer the reader to my a mathematical theory of spirit 1912 chap i for a more adequate statement 1b eliphas levi transcendental magic its doctrine and ritual trans by a e waite 1896 p 234 vii ceremonial magic in theory and practice the word magic if one may be permitted to say so is itself almost magicalmagical in its power to conjure up visions in the human mind for some these are of bloody rites pacts with the powers of darkness and the lascivious orgies of the saturnalia or witches sabbath in other minds it has pleasanter associations serving to transport them from the world of fact to the fairyland of fancy where the purse of fortunatus the lamp and ring of aladdin fairies gnomes jinn and innumerable other strange beings flit across the scene in a marvellous kaleidoscope of everchanging wonders to the study of the magical beliefs of the past cannot be denied the interest and fascination which the marvellous and wonderful ever has for so many minds many of whom perhaps cannot resist the temptation of thinking that there may be some element of truth in these wonderful stories but the study has a greater claim to our attention for as i have intimated already magic represents a phase in the development of human thought and the magic of the past was the womb from which sprang the science of the present unlike its parent though it be what then is magic according to the dictionary definitionand this will serve us for the presentit is the pretended art of producing marvellous results by the aid of spiritual beings or arcane spiritual forces magic therefore is the practical complement of animism wherever man has really believed in the existence of a spiritual world there do we find attempts to enter into communication with that worlds inhabitants and to utilise its forcesprofessor leuba1 and others distinguish between propitiative behaviour towards the beings of the spiritual world as marking the religious attitude and coercive behaviour towards these beings as characteristic of the magical attitude but one form of behaviour merges by insensible degrees into the other and the distinction though a useful one may for our present purpose be neglected 1 james h leuba the psychological origin and the nature of religion 1909 chap ii animism the conception of spirit everywhere as mr edward clodd2 neatly calls it and perhaps mans earliest view of natural phenomena persisted in a modified form as i have pointed out in some characteristics of mediaeval thought throughout the middle ages a belief in magic persisted likewise in the writings of the greek philosophers of the neoplatonic school in that curious body of esoteric jewish lore known as the kabala and in the works of later occult philosophers such as agrippa and paracelsus we find magic or rather the theory upon which magic as an art was based presented in its most philosophical form if there is anything of value for modern thought in the theory of magic here is it to be found and it is i think indeed to be found absurd and fantastic though the practices based upon this philosophy or which this philosophy was thought to substantiate most certainly are i shall here endeavour to give a sketch of certain of the outstanding doctrines of magical philosophy some details concerning the art of magic more especially as practiced in the middle ages in europe and finally an attempt to extract from the former what i consider to be of real worth we have already wandered down many of the byways of magical belief and indeed the word magic may be made to cover almost every superstition of the past to what we have already gained on previous excursions the present i hope will add what we need in order to take a synthetic view of the whole subject 2 edward clodd animism the seed of religion 1905 p 26 in the first place something must be said concerning what is called the doctrine of emanations a theory of prime importance in neoplatonic and kabalistic ontology according to this theory everything in the universe owes its existence and virtue to an emanation from god which divine emanation is supposed to descend step by step so to speak through the hierarchies of angels and the stars down to the things of earth that which is nearer to the source containing more of the divine nature than that which is relatively distant as cornelius agrippa expresses it for god in the first place is the end and beginning of all virtues he gives the seal of the ideas to his servants the intelligences who as faithful officers sign all things intrusted to them with an ideal virtue the heavens and stars as instruments disposing the matter in the mean while for the receiving of those forms which reside in divine majesty as saith plato in timeus and to be conveyed by stars and the giver of forms distributes them by the ministry of his intelligences which he hath set as rulers and controllers over his works to whom such a power is intrusted to things committed to them that so all virtues of stones herbs metals and all other things may come from the intelligences the governors the form therefore and virtue of things comes first from the ideas then from the ruling and governing intelligences then from the aspects of the heavens disposing and lastly from the tempers of the elements disposed answering the influences of the heavens by which the elements themselves are ordered or disposed these kinds of operations therefore are performed in these inferior things by express forms and in the heavens by disposing virtues in intelligences by mediating rules in the original cause by ideas and exemplary forms all which must of necessity agree in the execution of the effect and virtue of every thing there is therefore a wonderful virtue and operation in every herb and stone but greater in a star beyond which even from the governing intelligences everything receiveth and obtains many things for itself especially from the supreme cause with whom all things do mutually and exactly correspond agreeing in an harmonious consent as it were in hymns always praising the highest maker of all things there is therefore no other cause of the necessity of effects than the connection of all things with the first cause and their correspondency with those divine patterns and eternal ideas whence every thing hath its determinate and particular place in the exemplary world from whence it lives and receives its original being and every virtue of herbs stones metals animals words and speeches and all things that are of god is placed there1 as compared with the ex nihilo creationism of orthodox theology this theory is as light is to darkness of course there is much in cornelius agrippas statement of it which is inacceptable to modern thought but these are matters of form merely and do not affect the doctrine fundamentally for instance as a nexus between spirit and matter agrippa places the stars modern thought prefers the ether the theory of emanations may be and was as a matter of fact made the justification of superstitious practices of the grossest absurdity but on the other hand it may be made the basis of a lofty system of transcendental philosophy as for instance that of emanuel swedenborg whose ontology resembles in some respects that of the neoplatonists agrippa uses the theory to explain all the marvels which his age accredited marvels which we know had for the most part no existence outside of mans imagination i suggest on the contrary that the theory is really needed to explain the commonplace since in the last analysis every bit of experience every phenomenon be it ever so ordinaryindeed the very fact of experience itselfis most truly marvellous and magical explicable only in terms of spirit as eliphas levi well says in one of his flashes of insight the supernatural is only the natural in an extraordinary grade or it is the exalted natural a miracle is a phenomenon which strikes the multitude because it is unexpected the astonishing is that which astonishes miracles are effects which surprise those who are ignorant of their causes or assign them causes w hich are not in proportion to such effects1b but i am anticipating the sequel 1 h c agrippa occult philosophy bk i chap xiii whiteheads edition pp 6768 1b eliphas levi transcendental magic its doctrine and ritual trans by a e waite 1896 p 192 the doctrine of emanations makes the universe one vast harmonious whole between whose various parts there is an exact analogy correspondence or sympathetic relation nature the productive principle says iamblichos 3rd4th century the neoplatonist in her peculiar way makes a likeness of invisible principles through symbols in visible forms2 the belief that seemingly similar things sympathetically affect one another and that a similar relation holds good between different things which have been intimately connected with one another as parts within a whole is a very ancient one most primitive peoples are very careful to destroy all their nailcuttings and hairclippings since they believe that a witch gaining possession of these might work them harm for a similar reason they refuse to reveal their real names which they regard as part of themselves and adopt nicknames for common use the belief that a witch can torment an enemy by making an image of his person in clay or wax correctly naming it and mutilating it with pins or in the case of a waxen image melting it by fire is a very ancient one and was held throughout and beyond the middle ages the sympathetic powder of sir kenelm digby we have already noticed as well as other instances of the belief in sympathy and examples of similar superstitions might be multiplied almost indefinitely such are generally grouped under the term sympathetic magic but inasmuch as all magical practices assume that by acting on part of a thing or a symbolic representation of it one acts magically on the whole or on the thing symbolised the expression may in its broadest sense be said to involve the whole of magic 2 iamblichos theurgia or the egyptian mysteries trans by dr alex wilder new york 1911 p 239 the names of the divine being angels and devils the planets of the solar system including sun and moon and the days of the week birds and beasts colours herbs and precious stonesall according to oldtime occult philosophy are connected by the sympathetic relation believed to run through all creation the knowledge of which was essential to the magician as well also the chief portions of the human body for man as we have seen was believed to be a microcosma universe in miniature i have dealt with this matter and exhibited some of the supposed correspondences in the belief in talismans some further particulars are shown in the annexed table for which i am mainly indebted to agrippa but as in the case of the zodiacal gems already dealt with the old authorities by no means agree as to the majority of the planetary correspondences table of occult

philosophy chap x in many cases these supposed correspondences are based as will be obvious to the reader upon purely trivial resemblances and in any case whatever may be saidand i think a great deal may be saidin favour of the theory of symbology there is little that may be adduced to support the old occultists application of it so essential a part does the use of symbols play in all magical operations that we may i think modify the definition of magic adopted at the outset and define magic as an attempt to employ the powers of the spiritual world for the production of marvellous results by the aid of symbols it has on the other hand been questioned whether the appeal to the spiritworld is an essential element in magic but a close examination of magical practices always reveals at the root a belief in spiritual powers as the operating causes the belief in talismans at first sight seems to have little to do with that in a supernatural realm but as we have seen the talisman was always a silent invocation of the powers of some spiritual being with which it was symbolically connected and whose sign was engraved thereon and as dr t witton davies well remarks with regard to sympathetic magic even this could not at the start be anything other than a symbolic prayer to the spirit or spirits having authority in these matters in so far as no spirit is thought of it is a mere survival and not magic at all1 1 dr t witton davies magic divination and demonology among the hebrews and their neighbours 1898 p 17 what i regard as the two essentials of magical practices namely the use of symbols and the appeal to the supernatural realm are most obvious in what is called ceremonial magic mediaeval ceremonial magic was subdivided into three chief brancheswhite magic black magic and necromancy white magic was concerned with the evocations of angels spiritual beings supposed to be essentially superior to mankind concerning which i shall give some further details laterand the spirits of the elementswhich were as i have mentioned in some characteristics of mediaeval thought personifications of the primeval forces of nature as there were supposed to be four elements fire air water and earth so there were supposed to be four classes of elementals or spirits of the elements namely salamanders sylphs undines and gnomes inhabiting these elements respectively and deriving their characters therefrom concerning these curious beings the inquisitive reader may gain some information from a quaint little book by the abbe de montfaucon de villars entitled the count of gabalis or conferences about secret sciences 1670 translated into english and published in 1680 which has recently been reprinted the elementals we learn therefrom were unlike other supernatural beings thought to be mortal they could however be rendered immortal by means of sexual intercourse with men or women as the case might be and it was we are told to the noble end of endowing them with this great gift that the sages devoted themselves goety or black magic was concerned with the evocation of demons and devilsspirits supposed to be superior to man in certain powers but utterly depraved sorcery may be distinguished from witchcraft inasmuch as the sorcerer attempted to command evil spirits by the aid of charms etc whereas the witch or wizard was supposed to have made a pact with the evil one though both terms have been rather loosely used sorcery being sometimes employed as a synonym for necromancy necromancy was concerned with the evocation of the spirits of the dead etymologically the term stands for the art of foretelling events by means of such evocations though it is frequently employed in the wider sense it would be unnecessary and tedious to give any detailed account of the methods employed in these magical arts beyond some general remarks mr a e waite gives full particulars of the various rituals in his book of ceremonial magic 1911 to which the curious reader may be referred the following will in brief terms convey a general idea of a magical evocation choosing a time when there is a favourable conjunction of the planets the magician armed with the implements of magical art after much prayer and fasting betakes himself to a suitable spot alone or perhaps accompanied by two trusty companions all the articles he intends to employ the vestments the magic sword and lamp the talismans the book of spirits etc have been specially prepared and consecrated if he is about to invoke a martial spirit the magicians vestment will be of a red colour the talismans in virtue of which he may have power over the spirit will be of iron the day chosen a tuesday and the incense and perfumes employed of a nature analogous to mars in a similar manner all the articles employed and the rites performed must in some way be symbolical of the spirit with which converse is desired having arrived at the spot the magician first of all traces the magic circle within which we are told no evil spirit can enter he then commences the magic rite involving various prayers and conjurations a medley of meaningless words and in the case of the black art a sacrifice the spirit summoned then appears at least so we are told and after granting the magicians request is licensed to departa matter we are admonished of great importance the question naturally arises what were the results obtained by these magical arts how far if at all was the magician rewarded by the attainment of his desires we have asked a similar question regarding the belief in talismans and the reply which we there gained undoubtedly applies in the present case as well modern psychical research as i have already pointed out is supplying us with further evidence for the survival of human personality after bodily death than the innate conviction humanity in general seems to have in this belief and the many reasons which idealistic philosophy advances in favour of it the question of the reality of the phenomenon of materialisation that is the bodily appearance of a discarnate spirit such as is vouched for by spiritists and which is what it appears was aimed at in necromancy though why the discarnate should be better informed as to the future than the incarnate i cannot suppose must be regarded as sub judice1 many cases of fraud in connection with the alleged production of this phenomenon have been detected in recent times but inasmuch as the last word has not yet been said on the subject we must allow the possibility that necromancy in the past may have been sometimes successful but as to the existence of the angels and devils of magical beliefas well one might add of those of orthodox faithnothing can be adduced in evidence of this either from the results of psychical research or on a priori grounds 1 the late sir william crookes experimental researches in the phenomena of spiritualism contains evidence in favour of the reality of this phenomenon very difficult to gainsay pseudodionysius classified the angels into three hierarchies each subdivided into three orders as under first hierarchyseraphim cherubim and thrones second hierarchydominions powers and authorities or virtues third hierarchyprincipalities archangels and angels and this classification was adopted by agrippa and others pseudodionysius explains the names of these orders as follows the holy designation of the seraphim denotes either that they are kindling or burning and that of the cherubim a fulness of knowledge or stream of wisdom the appellation of the most exalted and preeminent thrones denotes their manifest exaltation above every grovelling inferiority and their supermundane tendency towards higher things and their invariable and firmlyfixed settlement around the veritable highest with the whole force of their powers the explanatory name of the holy lordships dominions denotes a certain unslavish elevation superior to every kind of cringing slavery indomitable to every subserviency and elevated above every dissimularity ever aspiring to the true lordship and source of lordship the appellation of the holy powers denotes a certain courageous and unflinching virility vigorously conducted to the divine imitation not forsaking the godlike movement through its own unmanliness but unflinchingly looking to the superessential and powerfulmaking power and becoming a powerlike image of this as far as is attainablethe appellation of the holy authorities denotes the beautiful and unconfused good order with regard to divine receptions and the discipline of the supermundane and intellectual authority conducted indomitably with good order towards divine things and the appellation of the heavenly principalities manifests their princely and leading function after the divine example1 there is a certain grandeur in these views and if we may be permitted to understand by the orders of the hierarchy discrete degrees to use swedenborgs term of spiritual realitystages in spiritual involutionwe may see in them a certain truth as well as i said all virtue power and knowledge which man has from god was believed to descend to him by way of these angelical hierarchies step by step and thus it was thought that those of the lowest hierarchy alone were sent from heaven to man it was such beings that white magic pretended to evoke but the practical occultists when they did not make them altogether fatuous attributed to these angels characters not distinguishable from those of the devils the description of the angels in the heptemeron or magical elements2 falsely at may be taken as fairly characteristic of michael and the other spirits of sunday he writes their nature is to procure gold gemmes carbuncles riches to cause one to obtain favour and benevolence to dissolve the enmities of men to raise men to honors to carry or take away infirmities of gabriel and the other spirits of monday he says their nature is to give silver to convey things from place to place to make horses swift and to disclose the secrets of persons both present and future of samael and the other spirits of tuesday he says their nature is to cause wars mortality death and combustions and to give two thousand souldiers at a time to bring death infirmities or health and so on for raphael sachiel anael cassiel and their colleagues1b 1

alleged authors death was translated into english by robert turner and published in 1655 in a volume containing the spurious fourth book of occult philosophy attributed to cornelius agrippa and other magical works it is from this edition that i quote 1b op cit pp 90 92 and 94 concerning the evil planetary spirits the spurious fourth book of occult philosophy attributed to cornelius agrippa informs us that the spirits of saturn appear for the most part with a tall lean and slender body with an angry countenance having four faces one in the hinder part of the head one on the former part of the head and on each side nosed or beaked there likewise appeareth a face on each knee of a black shining colour their motion is the moving of the wince with a kinde of earthquake their signe is white earth whiter than any snow the writer adds that their particular forms are a king having a beard riding on a dragon an old man with a beard an old woman leaning on a staffe a hog a dragon an owl a black garment a hooke or sickle a junipertree concerning the spirits of jupiter he says that they appear with a body sanguine and cholerick of a middle stature with a horrible fearful motion but with a milde countenance a gentle speech and of the colour of iron the motion of them is flashings of lightning and thunder their signe is there will appear men about the circle who shall seem to be devoured of lions their particular forms being a king with a sword drawn riding on a stag a man wearing a mitre in long rayment a maid with a laurelcrown adorned with flowers a bull a stag a peacock an azure garment a sword a boxtree as to the martian spirits we learn that they appear in a tall body cholerick a filthy countenance of colour brown swarthy or red having horns like harts horns and griphins claws bellowing like wilde bulls their motion is like fire burning their signe thunder and lightning about the circle their particular shapes are a king armed riding upon a wolf a man armed a woman holding a buckler on her thigh a heegoat a horse a stag a red garment wool a cheeslip1 1 op cit pp 4345 the rest are described in equally fantastic terms i do not think i shall be accused of being unduly sceptical if i say that such beings as these could not have been evoked by any magical rites because such beings do not and did not exist save in the magicians own imagination the proviso however is important for inasmuch as these fantastic beings did exist in the imagination of the credulous therein they may indeed have been evoked the whole of magic ritual was well devised to produce hallucination a firm faith in the ritual employed and a strong effort of will to bring about the desired result were usually insisted upon as essential to the success of the operation2 a period of fasting prior to the experiment was also frequently prescribed as necessary which by weakening the body must have been conducive to hallucination furthermore abstention from the gratification of the sexual appetite was stipulated in certain cases and this no doubt had a similar effect especially as concerns magical evocations directed to the satisfaction of the sexual impulse add to these factors the details of the ritual itself the nocturnal conditions under which it was carried out and particularly the suffumigations employed which most frequently were of a narcotic nature and it is not difficult to believe that almost any type of hallucination may have occurred such as we have seen was eliphas levis view of ceremonial magic and whatever may be said as concerns his own experiment therein for one would have thought that the essential element of faith was lacking in this case it is undoubtedly the true view as concerns the ceremonial magic of the past as this author well says witchcraft properly socalled that is ceremonial operation with intent to bewitch acts only on the operator and serves to fix and confirm his will by formulating it with persistence and labour the two conditions which make volition efficacious1b 2 magical axiom in the circle of its action every word creates that which it affirms direct consequence he who affirms the devil creates or makes the devil conditions of success in infernal evocations 1 invincible obstinacy 2 a conscience at once hardened to crime and most subject to remorse and fear 3 affected or natural ignorance 4 blind faith in all that is incredible 5 a completely false idea of god eliphas levi op cit pp 297 and 298 1b eliphas levi op cit pp 130 and 131 emanuel swedenborg in one place writes magic is nothing but the perversion of order it is especially the abuse of correspondences2 a study of the ceremonial magic of the middle ages and the following century or two certainly justifies swedenborg in writing of magic as something evil the distinction rigid enough in theory between white and black legitimate and illegitimate magic was as i have indicated extremely indefinite in practice as mr a e waite justly remarks much that passed current in the west as white ie permissible magic was only a disguised goeticism and many of the resplendent angels invoked with divine rites reveal their cloven hoofs it is not too much to say that a large majority of past psychological experiments were conducted to establish communication with demons and that for unlawful purposes the popular conceptions concerning the diabolical spheres which have been all accredited by magic may have been gross exaggerations of fact concerning rudimentary and perverse intelligences but the wilful viciousness of the communicants is substantially untouched thereby1b 2 emanuel swedenborg arcana caelestia se 6692 1b arthur edward waite the occult sciences 1891 p 51 these psychological experiments were not save perhaps in rare cases carried out in the spirit of modern psychical research with the high aim of the man of science it was indeed far otherwise selfish motives were at the root of most of them and apart from what may be termed medicinal magic it was for the satisfaction of greed lust revenge that men and women had recourse to magical arts the history of goeticism and witchcraft is one of the most horrible of all histories the grimoires witnesses to the superstitious folly of the past are full of disgusting absurd and even criminal rites for the satisfaction of unlawful desires and passions the church was certainly justified in attempting to put down the practice of magic but the means adopted in this design and the results to which they led were even more abominable than witchcraft itself the methods of detecting witches and the tortures to which suspected persons were subjected to force them to confess to imaginary crimes employed in socalled civilised england and scotland and also in america to say nothing of countries in which the holy inquisition held undisputed sway are almost too horrible to describe for details the reader may be referred to sir walter scotts letters on demonology and witchcraft 1830 and as concerns america cotton mathers the wonders of the invisible world 1692 the credulous church and the credulous people were terribly afraid of the power of witchcraft and as always fear destroyed their mental balance and made them totally disregard the demands of justice the result may be well illustrated by what almost inevitably happens when a country goes to war for war as the hon bertrand russell has well shown is fears offspring fear of the enemy causes the military party to persecute in an insensate manner without the least regard to justice all those of their fellowmen whom they consider are not heart and soul with them in their cause similarly the church relentlessly persecuted its supposed enemies of whom it was so afraid no doubt some of the poor wretches that were tortured and killed on the charge of witchcraft really believed themselves to have made a pact with the devil and were thus morally depraved though generally speaking they were no more responsible for their actions than any other madmen but the majority of the persons persecuted as witches and wizards were innocent even of this however it would i think be unwise to disregard the existence of another side to the question of the validity and ethical value of magic and to use the word only to stand for something essentially evil swedenborg we may note in the course of a long passage from the work from which i have already quoted says that by magic is signified the science of spiritual things1 his position appears to be that there is a genuine magic or science of spiritual things and a false magic that science perverted a view of the matter which i propose here to adopt the word magic itself is derived from the greek magos the wise man of the east and hence the strict etymological meaning of the term is the wisdom or science of the magi and it is i think significant that we are told and i see no reason to doubt the truth of it that the magi were among the first to worship the newborn christ2 1 op cit se 5223 2 see the gospel according to matthew chap ii verses 1 to 12 if there be an abuse of correspondences or symbols there surely must also be a use to which the word magic is not inapplicable as such religious ritual and especially the sacraments of the christian church will no doubt occur to the minds of those who regard these symbols as efficacious though they would probably hesitate to apply the term magical to them but in using this term as applying thereto i do not wish to suggest that any such rites or ceremonies possess or can possess any causal efficacy in the moral evolution of the soul the will alone in virtue of the power vouchsafed to it by the source of all power can achieve this but i do think that the soul may be assisted by ritual harmoniously related to the states of mind which it is desired to induce no doubt there is a danger of religious ritual especially when its meaning is lost being engaged in for its own sake it is then mere superstition1 and in view of the danger of this degeneracy many robust minds such as the members of the society of friends prefer to dispense with its aid altogether when ritual is associated with erroneous doctrines the results are even more disastrous as i have indicated in the belief in talismans but when ritual is allied with and based upon as adequately symbolising the high teaching of genuine religion it may be and in fact is found very helpful by many people as such its efficacy seems to me to be altogether magical in the best sense of that word 1 as eliphas levi well says superstition is the sign surviving the thought it is the dead body of a religious rite op cit p 150 but indeed i think a still wider application of the word magic is possible all experience is magic says novalis 17721801 and only magically explicable2a and again it is only because of the feebleness of our perceptions and activity that we do not perceive ourselves to be in a fairy world no doubt it will be objected that the common experiences of daily life are natural whereas magic postulates the supernatural if as is frequently done we use the term natural as relating exclusively to the physical realm then indeed we may well speak of magic as supernatural because its aims are psychical on the other hand the term natural is sometimes employed as referring to the whole realm of order and in this sense one can use the word magic as descriptive of nature herself when viewed in the light of an idealistic philosophy such as that of swedenborg in which all causation is seen to be essentially spiritual the things of this world being envisaged as symbols of ideas or spiritual verities and thus physical causation regarded as an appearance produced in virtue of the magical noncausal efficacy of symbols1 says cornelius agrippa every day some natural thing is drawn by art and some divine thing is drawn by nature which the egyptians seeing called nature a magicianess ie the very magical power itself in the attracting of like by like and of suitable things by suitable2 2a novalis schriften ed by ludwig tieck and fr schlegel 1805 vol ii p 195 1 for a discussion of the essentially magical character of inductive reasoning see my the magic of experience 1915 2 op cit bk i chap xxxvii p 119 i would suggest in conclusion that there is nothing really opposed to the spirit of modern science in the thesis that all experience is magic and only magically explicable science does not pretend to reveal the fundamental or underlying cause of phenomena does not pretend to answer the final why this is rather the business of philosophy though in thus distinguishing between science and philosophy i am far from insinuating that philosophy should be otherwise than scientific we often hear religious but nonscientific men complain because scientific and perhaps equally as religious men do not in their books ascribe the production of natural phenomena to the divine power but if they were so to do they would be transcending their business as scientists in every science certain simple facts of experience are taken for granted it is the business of the scientist to reduce other and more complex facts of experience to terms of these data not to explain these data themselves thus the physicist attempts to reduce other related phenomena of greater complexity to terms of simple force and motion but what are force and motion why does force produce or result in motion are questions which lie beyond the scope of physics in order to answer these questions if indeed this be possible we must first inquire how and why do these ideas of force and motion arise in our minds these problems land us in the psychical or spiritual world and the term magic at once becomes significant if says thomas carlyle we have led thee into the true land of dreams and thou lookest even for moments into the region of the wonderful and seest and feelest that thy daily life is girt with wonder and based on wonder and thy very blankets and breeches are miraclesthen art thou profited beyond moneys worth1 1 thomas carlyle sartor resartus bk iii chap ix viii architectural symbolism i was once rash enough to suggest in an essay on symbolism in art1 that a true work of art is at once realistic imaginative and symbolical and that its aim is to make manifest the spiritual significance of the natural objects dealt with i trust that those artists no doubt many who disagree with me will forgive mea man of sciencefor having ventured to express any opinion whatever on the subject but at any rate if the suggestions in question are accepted then a criterion for distinguishing between art and craft is at once available for we may say that whilst craft aims at producing works which are physically useful art aims at producing works which are spiritually useful architecture from this point of view is a combination of craft and art it may indeed be said that the modern architecture which creates our dwellinghouses factories and even to a large extent our places of worship is pure craft unmixed with art on the other hand it might be argued that such works of architecture are not always devoid of decoration and that decorative art even though the decorative artist is unconscious of this fact is based upon rules and employs symbols which have a deep significance the truly artistic element in architecture however is more clearly manifest if we turn our gaze to the past one thinks at once of course of the pyramids and sphinx of egypt and the rich and varied symbolism of design and decoration of antique structures to be found in persia and elsewhere in the east it is highly probable that the egyptian pyramids were employed for astronomical purposes and thus subserved physical utility but it seems no less likely that their shape was suggested by a belief in some system of geometrical symbolism and was intended to embody certain of their philosophical or religious doctrines 1 published in the occult review for august 1912 vol xvi pp 98 to 102 the mediaeval cathedrals and churches of europe admirably exhibit this combination of art with craft craft was needed to design and construct permanent buildings to protect worshippers from the inclemency of the weather art was employed not only to decorate such buildings but it dictated to craft many points in connection with their design the builders of the mediaeval churches endeavoured so to construct their works that these might as a whole and in their various parts embody the truths as they believed them of the christian religion thus the cruciform shape of churches their orientation etc the practical value of symbolism in church architecture is obvious as mr f e hulme remarks the sculptured fonts or stainedglass windows in the churches of the middle ages were full of teaching to a congregation of whom the greater part could not read to whom therefore one great avenue of knowledge was closed the ignorant are especially impressed by pictorial teaching and grasp its meaning far more readily than they can follow a written description or a spoken discourse1 1 f edward hulme fls fsa the history principles and practice of symbolism in christian art 1909 p 2 the subject of symbolism in church architecture is an extensive one involving many side issues in these excursions we shall consider only one aspect of it namely the symbolic use of animal forms in english church architecture as mr collins who has written in recent years an interesting work on this topic of much use to archaeologists as a book of data2a points out the great sources of animal symbolism were the famous physiologus and other natural history books of the middle ages generally called bestiaries and the bible mystically understood the modern tendency is somewhat unsympathetic towards any attempt to interpret the bible symbolically and certainly some of the interpretations that have been forced upon it in the name of symbolism are crude and fantastic enough but in the belief of the mystics culminating in the elaborate system of correspondences of swedenborg that every natural object every event in the history of the human race and every word of the bible has a symbolic and spiritual significance there is i think a fundamental truth we must however as i have suggested already distinguish between true and forced symbolism the early christians employed the fish as a symbol of christ because the greek word for fish icqus is obtained by notariqon1 from the phrase gr ihsous cristos qeou uios swthrjesus christ the son of god the saviour of course the obvious use of such a symbol was its entire unintelligibility to those who had not yet been instructed in the mysteries of the christian faith since in the days of persecution some degree of secrecy was necessary but the symbol has significance only in the greek language and that of an entirely arbitrary nature there is nothing in the nature of the fish apart from its name in greek which renders it suitable to be used as a symbol of christ contrast this pseudosymbol however with that of the good shepherd the lamb of god fig 34 or the lion of judah here we have what may be regarded as true symbols something of whose meanings are clear to the smallest degree of spiritual sight even though the second of them has frequently been badly misinterpreted 2a arthur h collins ma symbolism of animals and birds represented in english church architecture 1913 1 a kabalistic process by which a word is formed by taking the initial letters of a sentence or phrase it was a belief in the spiritual or moral significance of nature similar to that of the mystical expositors of the bible that inspired the mediaeval naturalists the bestiaries almost invariably conclude the account of each animal with the moral that might be drawn from its behaviour the interpretations are frequently very farfetched and as the writers were more interested in the morals than in the facts of natural history themselves the supposed facts from which they drew their morals were frequently very far from being of the nature of facts sometimes the product of this inaccuracy is grotesque as shown by the following quotation the elephants are in an absurd way typical of adam and eve who ate of the forbidden fruit and also have the dragon for their enemy it was supposed that the elephant used to sleep by leaning against a tree the hunters would come by night and cut the trunk through down he would come roaring helplessly none of his friends would be able to help him until a small elephant should come and lever him up with his trunk this small elephant was symbolic of jesus christ who came in great humility to rescue the human race which had fallen through a tree 1 1 a h collins symbolism of animals etc pp 41 and 42 in some cases though the symbolism is based upon quite erroneous notions concerning natural history and is so far fantastic it is not devoid of charm the use of the pelican to symbolise the saviour is a case in point legend tells us that when other food is unobtainable the pelican thrusts its bill into its breast whence the red colour of the bill and feeds its young with its lifeblood were this only a fact the symbol would be most appropriate there is another and far less charming form of the legend though more in accord with current perversions of christian doctrine according to which the pelican uses its blood to revive its young after having slain them through anger aroused by the great provocation which they are supposed to give it for an example of the use of the pelican in church architecture see fig 36 mention must also be made of the purely fabulous animals of the bestiaries such as the basilisk centaur dragon griffin hydra mantichora unicorn phoenix etc the centaur fig 39 was a beast half man half horse it typified the flesh or carnal mind of man and the legend of the perpetual war between the centaur and a certain tribe of simple savages who were said to live in trees in india symbolised the combat between the flesh and the spirit1 1 a h collins symbolism of animals etc pp 150 and 153 with bow and arrow in its hands the centaur forms the astrological sign sagittarius or the archer an interesting example of this sign occurring in church architecture is to be found on the western doorway of portchester churcha most beautiful piece of norman architecture this sign of the zodiac writes the rev canon vaughan ma a former vicar of portchester was the badge of king stephen and its presence on the west front of portchester church seems to indicate what was often the case elsewhere that the elaborate norman carving was not carried out until after the completion of the building2 the facts however that this sagittarius is accompanied on the other side of the doorway by a couple of fishes which form the astrological sign pisces or the fishes and that these two signs are what are termed in astrological phraseology the houses of the planet jupiter the major fortune suggest that the architect responsible for the design influenced by the astrological notions of his day may have put the signs there in order to attract jupiters beneficent influence or he may have had the sagittarius carved for the reason canon vaughan suggests and then remembering how good a sign it was astrologically had the pisces added to complete the effect1b 2 rev canon vaughan ma a short history of portchester castle p 14 1b two other possible explanations of the pisces have been suggested by the rev a headley in his ms book written in 1888 when he was vicar of portchester he writes i have discovered an interesting proof that it the church was finished in stephens reign namely the figure of sagittarius in the western doorway stephen adopted this as his badge for the double reason that it formed part of the arms of the city of blois and that the sun was in sagittarius in december when he came to the throne i therefore conclude that this badge was placed where it is to mark the completion of the church there is another sign of the zodiac in the archway apparently pisces this may have been chosen to mark the month in which the church was finished or simply on account of its nearness to the sea at one time i fancied it might refer to march the month in which lady day occurred thus referring to the patron saint st mary as the sun leaves pisces just before lady day this does not explain it possibly in the old calendar it might do so this is a matter for further research i have to thank the rev h lawrence fry present vicar of portchester for this quotation and the rev a headley for permission to utilise it the phoenix and griffin we have encountered already in our excursions the latter we are told inhabits desert places in india where it can find nothing for its young to eat it flies away to other regions to seek food and is sufficiently strong to carry off an ox thus it symbolises the devil who is ever anxious to carry away our souls to the deserts of hell fig 37 illustrates an example of the use of this symbolic beast in church architecture the mantichora is described by pliny whose statements were unquestioningly accepted by the mediaeval naturalists on the authority of ctesias fl 400 bc as having a triple row of teeth which fit into each other like those of a comb the face and ears of a man and azure eyes is the colour of blood has the body of the lion and a tail ending in a sting like that of the scorpion its voice resembles the union of the sound of the flute and the trumpet it is of excessive swiftness and is particularly fond of human flesh1 1 pliny natural history bk viii chap xxx bostock and rileys trans vol ii 1855 p 280 concerning the unicorn in an eighteenthcentury work on natural history we read that this is a beast which though doubted of by many writers yet is by others thus described he has but one horn and that an exceedingly rich one growing out of the middle of his forehead his head resembles an harts his feet an elephants his tail a boars and the rest of his body an horses the horn is about a foot and half in length his voice is like the lowing of an ox his mane and hair are of a yellowish colour his horn is as hard as iron and as rough as any file twisted or curled like a flaming sword very straight sharp and every where black excepting the point great virtues are attributed to it in expelling of poison and curing of several diseases he is not a beast of prey2 the method of capturing the animal believed in by mediaeval writers was a curious one the following is a literal translation from the bestiary of philippe de thaun 12th century 2 thomas boreman a description of three hundred animals 1730 p 6 monosceros is an animal which has one horn on its head therefore it is so named it has the form of a goat it is caught by means of a virgin now hear in what manner when a man intends to hunt it and to take and ensnare it he goes to the forest where is its repair there he places a virgin with her breast uncovered and by its smell the monosceros perceives it then it comes to the virgin and kisses her breast falls asleep on her lap and so comes to its death the man arrives immediately and kills it in its sleep or takes it alive and does as he likes with it it signifies much i will not omit to tell it you monosceros is greek it means one horn in french a beast of such a description signifies jesus christ one god he is and shall be and was and will continue so he placed himself in the virgin and took flesh for mans sake and for virginity to show chastity to a virgin he appeared and a virgin conceived him a virgin she is and will be and will remain always now hear briefly the signification this animal in truth signifies god know that the virgin signifies st mary by her breast we understand similarly holy church and then by the kiss it ought to signify that a man when he sleeps is in semblance of death god slept as man who suffered death on the cross and his destruction was our redemption and his labour our repose thus god deceived the devil by a proper semblance soul and body were one so was god and man and this is the signification of an animal of that description1 1 popular treatises on science written during the middle ages in anglosaxon anglonorman and english ed by thomas wright historical society of science 1841 pp 8182 this being the current belief concerning the symbolism of the unicorn in the middle ages it is not surprising to find this animal utilised in church architecture for an example see fig 35 the belief in the existence of these fabulous beasts may very probably have been due to the materialising of what were originally nothing more than mere arbitrary symbols as i have already suggested of the phoenix1 thus the account of the mantichora may as bostock has suggested very well be a description of certain hieroglyphic figures examples of which are still to be found in the ruins of assyrian and persian cities this explanation seems on the whole more likely than the alternative hypothesis that such beliefs were due to malobservation though that no doubt helped in their formation 1 superstitions concerning birds it may be questioned however whether the architects and preachers of the middle ages altogether believed in the strange fables of the bestiaries as mr collins says in reply to this question probably they were credulous enough but on the whole we may say that the truth of the story was just what they did not trouble about any more than some clergymen are particular about the absolute truth of the stories they tell children from the pulpit the application the lesson is the thing with their desire to interpret nature spiritually we ought i think to sympathise but there was one truth they had yet to learn namely that in order to interpret nature spiritually it is necessary first to understand her aright in her literal sense ix the quest of the philosophers stone the need of unity is a primary need of human thought behind the varied multiplicity of the world of phenomena primitive man as i have indicated on a preceding excursion begins to seek more or less consciously for that unity which alone is real and this statement not only applies to the first dim gropings of the primitive human mind but sums up almost the whole of science and philosophy for almost all science and philosophy is explicitly or implicitly a search for unity for one law or one love one matter or one spirit that which is the aim of the search may indeed be expressed under widely different terms but it is always conceived to be the unity in which all multiplicity is resolved whether it be thought of as one final law of necessity which all things obey and of which all the various other laws of nature are so many special and limited applications or as one final love for which all things are created and to which all things aspire as one matter of which all bodies are but varying forms or as one spirit which is the life of all things and of which all things are so many manifestations every scientist and philosopher is a merchant seeking for goodly pearls willing to sell every pearl that he has if he may secure the one pearl beyond price because he knows that in that one pearl all others are included this search for unity in multiplicity however is not confined to the acknowledged scientist and philosopher more or less unconsciously everyone is engaged in this quest harmony and unity are the very fundamental laws of the human mind itself and in a sense all mental activity is the endeavour to bring about a state of harmony and unity in the mind no two ideas that are contradictory of one another and are perceived to be of this nature can permanently exist in any sane mans mind it is true that many people try to keep certain portions of their mental life in watertight compartments thus some try to keep their religious convictions and their business ideas or their religious faith and their scientific knowledge separate from another oneand it seems often succeed remarkably well in so doing but ultimately the arbitrary mental walls they have erected will break down by the force of their own ideas contradictory ideas from different compartments will then present themselves to consciousness at the same moment of time and the result of the perception of their contradictory nature will be mental anguish and turmoil persisting until one set of ideas is conquered and overcome by the other and harmony and unity are restored it is true of all of us then that we seek for unityunity in mind and life some seek it in science and a life of knowledge some seek it in religion and a life of faith some seek it in human love and find it in the life of service to their fellows some seek it in pleasure and the gratification of the senses demands some seek it in the harmonious development of all the facets of their being many the methods right and wrong many the terms under which the one is conceived true and falsein a sense to use the phraseology of a bygone system of philosophy we are all consciously or unconsciously following paths that lead thither or paths that lead away seekers in the quest of the philosophers stone let us in these excursions in the byways of thought consider for a while the form that the quest of fundamental unity took in the hands of those curious mediaeval philosophers half mystics half experimentalists in natural thingsthat are known by the name of alchemists the common opinion concerning alchemy is that it was a pseudoscience or pseudoart flourishing during the dark ages and having for its aim the conversion of common metals into silver and gold by means of a most marvellous and wholly fabulous agent called the philosophers stone that its devotees were half knaves half fools whose views concerning nature were entirely erroneous and whose objects were entirely mercenary this opinion is not absolutely destitute of truth as a science alchemy involved many fantastic errors and in the course of its history it certainly proved attractive to both knaves and fools but if this opinion involves some element of truth it involves a far greater proportion of error amongst the alchemists are numbered some of the greatest intellects of the middle agesroger bacon c 12141294 for example who might almost be called the father of experimental science and whether or not the desire for material wealth was a secondary object the true aim of the genuine alchemist was a much nobler one than this as one of them exclaims with true scientific fervour would to god all men might become adepts in our artfor then gold the great idol of mankind would lose its value and we should prize it only for its scientific teaching1 moreover recent developments in physical and chemical science seem to indicate that the alchemists were not so utterly wrong in their concept of nature as has formerly been supposedthat whilst they certainly erred in both their methods and their interpretations of individual phenomena they did intuitively grasp certain fundamental facts concerning the universe ofthe very greatest importance 1 eirenaeus philalethes an open entrance to the closed palace of the king see the hermetic museum restored and enlarged ed by a e waite 1893 vol ii p 178 suppose however that the theories of the alchemists are entirely erroneous from beginning to end and are nowhere relieved by the merest glimmer of truth still they were believed to be true and this belief had an important influence upon human thought many men of science have i am afraid been too prone to regard the mystical views of the alchemists as unintelligible but whatever their theories may be to us these theories were certainly very real to them it is preposterous to maintain that the writings of the alchemists are without meaning even though their views are altogether false and the more false their views are believed to be the more necessary does it become to explain why they should have gained such universal credit here we have problems into which scientific inquiry is not only legitimate but i think very desirableapart altogether from the question of the truth or falsity of alchemy as a science or its utility as an art what exactly was the system of beliefs grouped under the term alchemy and what was its aim why were the beliefs held what was their precise influence upon human thought and culture it was in order to elucidate problems of this sort as well as to determine what elements of truth if any there are in the theories of the alchemists that the alchemical society was founded in 1912 mainly through my own efforts and those of my confreres and for the first time something like justice was being done to the memory of the alchemists when the societys activities were stayed by that greatest calamity of history the european war some students of the writings of the alchemists have advanced a very curious and interesting theory as to the aims of the alchemists which may be termed the transcendental theory according to this theory the alchemists were concerned only with the mystical processes affecting the soul of man and their chemical references are only to be understood symbolically in my opinion however this view of the subject is rendered untenable by the lives of the alchemists themselves for as mr waite has very fully pointed out in his lives of alchemystical philosophers 1888 the lives of the alchemists show them to have been mainly concerned with chemical and physical processes and indeed to their labours we owe many valuable discoveries of a chemical nature but the fact that such a theory should ever have been formulated and should not be altogether lacking in consistency may serve to direct our attention to the close connection between alchemy and mysticism if we wish to understand the origin and aims of alchemy we must endeavour to recreate the atmosphere of the middle ages and to look at the subject from the point of view of the alchemists themselves now this atmosphere was as i have indicated in a previous essay surcharged with mystical theology and mystical philosophy alchemy so to speak was generated and throve in a dim religious light we cannot open a book by any one of the better sort of alchemists without noticing how closely their theology and their chemistry are interwoven and what a remarkably religious view they take of their subject thus one alchemist writes in the first place let every devout and godfearing chemist and student of this art consider that this arcanum should be regarded not only as a truly great but as a most holy art seeing that it typifies and shadows out the highest heavenly good therefore if any man desire to reach this great and unspeakable mystery he must remember that it is obtained not by the might of man but by the grace of god and that not our will or desire but only the mercy of the most high can bestow it upon us for this reason you must first of all cleanse your heart lift it up to him alone and ask of him this gift in true earnest and undoubting prayer he alone can give and bestow it1 whilst another alchemist declares i am firmly persuaded that any unbeliever who got truly to know this art would straightway confess the truth of our blessed religion and believe in the trinity and in our lord jesus christ2 1 the sophic hydrolith or water stone of the wise see the hermetic museum vol i pp 74 and 75 2 peter bonus the new pearl of great price trans by a e waite 1894 p 275 now what i suggest is that the alchemists constructed their chemical theories for the main part by means of a priori reasoning and that the premises from which they started were i the truth of mystical theology especially the doctrine of the souls regeneration and ii the truth of mystical philosophy which asserts that the objects of nature are symbols of spiritual verities there is i think abundant evidence to show that alchemy was a more or less deliberate attempt to apply according to the principles of analogy the doctrines of religious mysticism to chemical and physical phenomena some of this evidence i shall attempt to put forward in this essay in the first place however i propose to say a few words more in description of the theological and philosophical doctrines which so greatly influenced the alchemists and which i believe they borrowed for their attempted explanations of chemical and physical phenomena this system of doctrine i have termed mysticisma word which is unfortunately equivocal and has been used to denote various systems of religious and philosophical thought from the noblest to the most degraded i have therefore further to define my usage of the term by mystical theology i mean that system of religious thought which emphasises the unity between creator and creature though not necessarily to the extent of becoming pantheistic man mystical theology asserts has sprung from god but has fallen away from him through selflove within man however is the seed of divine grace whereby if he will follow the narrow road of selfrenunciation he may be regenerated born anew becoming transformed into the likeness of god and ultimately indissolubly united to god in love god is at once the creator and the restorer of mans soul he is the origin as well as the end of all existence and he is also the way to that end in christian mysticism christ is the pattern towards which the mystic strives christ also is the means towards the attainment of this end by mystical philosophy i mean that system of philosophical thought which emphasises the unity of the cosmos asserting that god and the spiritual may be perceived immanent in the things of this world because all things natural are symbols and emblems of spiritual verities as one of the golden verses attributed to pythagoras which i have quoted in a previous essay puts it the nature of this universe is in all things alike commenting upon which hierocles writing in the fifth or sixth century remarks that nature in forming this universe after the divine measure and proportion made it in all things conformable and like to itself analogically in different manners of all the different species diffused throughout the whole it made as it were an image of the divine beauty imparting variously to the copy the perfections of the original1 we have however already encountered so many instances of this belief that no more need be said here concerning it 1 commentary of hierocles on the golden verses of pythagoras trans by n rowe 1906 pp 101 and 102 in fine as dean inge well says religious mysticism may be defined as the attempt to realise the presence of the living god in the soul and in nature or more generally as the attempt to realise in thought and feeling the immanence of the temporal in the eternal and of the eternal in the temporal2 2 william ralph inge ma christian mysticism the bampton lectures 1899 p 5 now doctrines such as these were not only very prevalent during the middle ages when alchemy so greatly flourished but are of great antiquity and were undoubtedly believed in by the learned class in egypt and elsewhere in the east in those remote days when as some think alchemy originated though the evidence as will i hope become plain as we proceed points to a later and postchristian origin for the central theorem of alchemy so far as we can judge from their writings the more important alchemists were convinced of the truth of these doctrines and it was with such beliefs in mind that they commenced their investigations of physical and chemical phenomena indeed if we may judge by the esteem in which the hermetic maxim what is above is as that which is below what is below is as that which is above to accomplish the miracles of the one thing was held by every alchemist we are justified in asserting that the mystical theory of the spiritual significance of naturea theory with which as we have seen is closely connected the neoplatonic and kabalistic doctrine that all things emanate in series from the divine source of all beingwas at the very heart of alchemy as writes one alchemist the sages have been taught of god that this natural world is only an image and material copy of a heavenly and spiritual pattern that the very existence of this world is based upon the reality of its celestial archetype and that god has created it in imitation of the spiritual and invisible universe in order that men might be the better enabled to comprehend his heavenly teaching and the wonders of his absolute and ineffable power and wisdom thus the sage sees heaven reflected in nature as in a mirror and he pursues this art not for the sake of gold or silver but for the love of the knowledge which it reveals he jealously conceals it from the sinner and the scornful lest the mysteries of heaven should be laid bare to the vulgar gaze1 1 michael sendivogius the new chemical light pt ii concerning sulphur see the hermetic museum vol ii p 138 the alchemists i hold convinced of the truth of this view of nature ie that principles true of one plane of being are true also of all other planes adopted analogy as their guide in dealing with the facts of chemistry and physics known to them they endeavoured to explain these facts by an application to them of the principles of mystical theology their chief aim being to prove the truth of these principles as applied to the facts of the natural realm and by studying natural phenomena to become instructed in spiritual truth they did not proceed by the sure but slow method of modern science ie the method of induction which questions experience at every step in the construction of a theory but they boldly allowed their imaginations to leap ahead and to formulate a complete theory of the cosmos on the strength of but few facts this led them into many fantastic errors but i would not venture to deny them an intuitive perception of certain fundamental truths concerning the constitution of the cosmos even if they distorted these truths and dressed them in a fantastic garb now as i hope to make plain in the course of this excursion the alchemists regarded the discovery of the philosophers stone and the transmutation of base metals into gold as the consummation of the proof of the doctrines of mystical theology as applied to chemical phenomena and it was as such that they so ardently sought to achieve the magnum opus as this transmutation was called of course it would be useless to deny that many accepting the truth of the great alchemical theorem sought for the philosophers stone because of what was claimed for it in the way of material benefits but as i have already indicated with the nobler alchemists this was not the case and the desire for wealth if present at all was merely a secondary object the idea expressed in daltons atomic hypothesis 1802 and universally held during the nineteenth century that the material world is made up of a certain limited number of elements unalterable in quantity subject in themselves to no change or development and inconvertible one into another is quite alien to the views of the alchemists the alchemists conceived the universe to be a unity they believed that all material bodies had been developed from one seed their elements are merely different forms of one matter and therefore convertible one into another they were thoroughgoing evolutionists with regard to the things of the material world and their theory concerning the evolution of the metals was i believe the direct outcome of a metallurgical application of the mystical doctrine of the souls development and regeneration the metals they taught all spring from the same seed in natures womb but are not all equally matured and perfect for as they say although nature always intends to produce only gold various impurities impede the process in the metals the alchemists saw symbols of man in the various stages of his spiritual development gold the most beautiful as well as the most untarnishable metal keeping its beauty permanently unaffected by sulphur most acids and fireindeed purified by such treatmentgold to the alchemist was the symbol of regenerate man and therefore he called it a noble metal silver was also termed noble but it was regarded as less mature than gold for although it is undoubtedly beautiful and withstands the action of fire it is corroded by nitric acid and is blackened by sulphur it was therefore considered to be analogous to the regenerate man at a lower stage of his development possibly we shall not be far wrong in using swedenborgs terms celestial to describe the man of gold spiritual to designate him of silver lead on the other hand the alchemists regarded as a very immature and impure metal heavy and dull corroded by sulphur and nitric acid and converted into a calx by the action of firelead to the alchemists was a symbol of man in a sinful and unregenerate condition the alchemists assumed the existence of three principles in the metals their obvious reason for so doing being the mystical threefold division of man into body soul ie affections and will and spirit ie intelligence though the principle corresponding to body was a comparatively late introduction in alchemical philosophy this latter fact however is no argument against my thesis because of course i do not maintain that the alchemists started out with their chemical philosophy ready made but gradually worked it out by incorporating in it further doctrines drawn from mystical theology the three principles just referred to were called mercury sulphur and salt and they must be distinguished from the common bodies so designated though the alchemists themselves seem often guilty of confusing them mercury is the metallic principle par excellence conferring on metals their brightness and fusibility and corresponding to the spirit or intelligence in man1 sulphur the principle of combustion and colour is the analogue of the soul many alchemists postulated two sulphurs in the metals an inward and an outward1b the outward sulphur was thought to be the chief cause of metallic impurity and the reason why all known metals save gold and silver were acted on by fire the inward sulphur on the other hand was regarded as essential to the development of the metals pure mercury we are told matured by a pure inward sulphur yields pure gold here again it is evident that the alchemists borrowed their theories from mystical theology for clearly inward sulphur is nothing else than the equivalent to love of god outward sulphur to love of self intelligence mercury matured by love to god inward sulphur exactly expresses the spiritual state of the regenerate man according to mystical theology there is no reason other than their belief in analogy why the alchemists should have held such views concerning the metals salt the principle of solidity and resistance to fire corresponding to the body in man plays a comparatively unimportant part in alchemical theory as does its prototype in mystical theology 1 the identification of the god mercury with thoth the egyptian god of learning is worth noticing in this connection 1b pseudogeber whose writings were highly esteemed for instance see r russels translation of his works 1678 p 160 now as i have pointed out already the central theorem of mystical theology is in christian terminology that of the regeneration of the soul by the spirit of christ the corresponding process in alchemy is that of the transmutation of the base metals into silver and gold by the agency of the philosophers stone merely to remove the evil sulphur of the base metals thought the alchemists though necessary is not sufficient to transmute them into noble metals a maturing process is essential similar to that which they supposed was effected in natures womb mystical theology teaches that the powers and life of the soul are not inherent in it but are given by the free grace of god neither according to the alchemists are the powers and life of nature in herself but in that immanent spirit the soul of the world that animates her as writes the famous alchemist who adopted the pleasing pseudonym of basil valentine c 1600 the power of growth is imparted not by the earth but by the lifegiving spirit that is in it if the earth were deserted by this spirit it would be dead and no longer able to afford nourishment to anything for its sulphur or richness would lack the quickening spirit without which there can be neither life nor growth1a to perfect the metals therefore the alchemists argued from analogy with mystical theology which teaches that men can be regenerated only by the power of christ within the soul that it is necessary to subject them to the action of this worldspirit this one essence underlying all the varied powers of nature this one thing from which all things were produced by adaption and which is the cause of all perfection throughout the whole world2a this writes one alchemist is the spirit of truth which the world cannot comprehend without the interposition of the holy ghost or without the instruction of those who know it the same is of a mysterious nature wondrous strength boundless power by avicenna this spirit is named the soul of the world for as the soul moves all the limbs of the body so also does this spirit move all bodies and as the soul is in all the limbs of the body so also is this spirit in all elementary created things it is sought by many and found by few it is beheld from afar and found near for it exists in every thing in every place and at all times it has the powers of all creatures its action is found in all elements and the qualities of all things are therein even in the highest perfection it heals all dead and living bodies without other medicine converts all metallic bodies into gold and there is nothing like unto it under heaven1b it was this spirit concentrated in all its potency in a suitable material form which the alchemists sought under the name of the philosophers stone now mystical theology teaches that the spirit of christ by which alone the soul of man can be tinctured and transmuted into the likeness of god is goodness itself consequently the alchemists argued that the philosophers stone must be so to speak gold itself or the very essence of gold it was to them as christ is of the souls perfection at once the pattern and the means of metallic perfection the philosophers stone declares eirenaeus philalethes nat c 1623 is a certain heavenly spiritual penetrative and fixed substance which brings all metals to the perfection of gold or silver according to the quality of the medicine and that by natural methods which yet in their effects transcend nature know then that it is called a stone not because it is like a stone but only because by virtue of its fixed nature it resists the action of fire as successfully as any stone in species it is gold more pure than the purest it is fixed and incombustible like a stone ie it contains no outward sulphur but only inward fixed sulphur but its appearance is that of a very fine powder impalpable to the touch sweet to the taste fragrant to the smell in potency a most penetrative spirit apparently dry and yet unctuous and easily capable of tingeing a plate of metal if we say that its nature is spiritual it would be no more than the truth if we described it as corporeal the expression would be equally correct for it is subtle penetrative glorified spiritual gold it is the noblest of all created things after the rational soul and has virtue to repair all defects both in animal and metallic bodies by restoring them to the most exact and perfect temper wherefore is it

prima of which it is compounded is spoken of as a despised substance reckoned to be of no value thus according to one curious alchemistic work this matter so precious by the excellent gifts wherewith nature has enriched it is truly mean with regard to the substances from whence it derives its original their price is not above the ability of the poor ten pence is more than sufficient to purchase the matter of the stone the matter therefore is mean considering the foundation of the art because it costs very little it is no less mean if one considers exteriourly that which gives it perfection since in that regard it costs nothing at all in as much as all the world has it in its power so that it is a constant truth that the stone is a thing mean in one sense but that in another it is most precious and that there are none but fools that despise it by a just judgment of god1 and jacob boehme 15751624 writes the philosophers stone is a very dark disesteemed stone of a grey colour but therein lieth the highest tincture2 in these passages there is probably some reference to the ubiquity of the spirit of the world already referred to in a former quotation but this fact is not in itself sufficient to account for them i suggest that their origin is to be found in the religious doctrine that gods grace the spirit of christ that is the means of the transmutation of mans soul into spiritual gold is free to all that it is at once the meanest and the most precious thing in the whole universe indeed i think it quite probable that the alchemists who penned the abovequoted passages had in mind the words of isaiah he was despised and we esteemed him not and if further evidence is required that the alchemists believed in a correspondence between christthe stone which the builders rejectedand the philosophers stone reference may be made to the alchemical work called the sophic hydrolith or water stone of the wise a tract included in the hermetic museum in which this supposed correspondence is explicitly asserted and dealt with in some detail 1 a discourse between eudoxus and pyrophilus upon the ancient war of the knights see the hermetical triumph or the victorious philosophical stone 1723 pp 101 and 102 2 jacob boehme epistles trans by j e 1649 reprinted 1886 ep iv se iii apart from the alchemists belief in the analogy between natural and spiritual things it is i think incredible that any such theories of the metals and the possibility of their transmutation or regeneration by such an extraordinary agent as the philosophers stone would have occurred to the ancient investigators of natures secrets when they had started to formulate these theories facts1 were discovered which appeared to support them but it is i suggest practically impossible to suppose that any or all of these facts would in themselves have been sufficient to give rise to such wonderfully fantastic theories as these it is only from the standpoint of the theory that alchemy was a direct offspring of mysticism that its origin seems to be capable of explanation 1 one of those facts amongst many others that appeared to confirm the alchemical doctrines was the ease with which iron could apparently be transmuted into copper it was early observed that iron vessels placed in contact with a solution of blue vitriol became converted at least so far as their surfaces were concerned into copper this we now know to be due to the fact that the copper originally contained in the vitriol is thrown out of solution whilst the iron takes its place and we know also that no more copper can be obtained in this way from the blue vitriol than is actually used up in preparing it and further that all the iron which is apparently converted into copper can be got out of the residual solution by appropriate methods if such be desired so that the facts really support daltons theory rather than the alchemical doctrines but to the alchemist it looked like a real transmutation of iron into copper confirmation of his fond belief that iron and other base metals could be transmuted into silver and gold by the aid of the great arcanum of nature in all the alchemical doctrines mystical connections are evident and mystical origins can generally be traced i shall content myself here with giving a couple of further examples consider in the first place the alchemical doctrine of purification by putrefaction that the metals must die before they can be resurrected and truly live that through death alone are they purifiedin the more prosaic language of modern chemistry death becomes oxidation and rebirth becomes reduction in many alchemical books there are to be found pictorial symbols of the putrefaction and death of metals and their new birth in the state of silver or gold or as the stone itself together with descriptions of these processes the alchemists sought to kill or destroy the body or outward form of the metals in the hope that they might get at and utilise the living essence they believed to be immanent within as paracelsus put it nothing of true value is located in the body of a substance but in the virtue the less there is of body the more in proportion is the virtue it seems to me quite obvious that in such ideas as these we have the application to metallurgy of the mystic doctrine of selfrenunciationthat the soul must die to self before it can live to god that the body must be sacrificed to the spirit and the individual will bowed down utterly to the one divine will before it can become one therewith in the second place consider the directions as to the colours that must be obtained in the preparation of the philosophers stone if a successful issue to the great work is desired such directions are frequently given in considerable detail in alchemical works and without asserting any exact uniformity i think that i may state that practically all the alchemists agree that three great colourstages are necessaryi an inky blackness which is termed the crows head and is indicative of putrefaction ii a white colour indicating that the stone is now capable of converting base metals into silver this passes through orange into iii a red colour which shows that the stone is now perfect and will transmute base metals into gold now what was the reason for the belief in these three colourstages and for their occurrence in the above order i suggest that no alchemist actually obtained these colours in this order in his chemical experiments and that we must look for a speculative origin for the belief in them we have i think only to turn to religious mysticism for this origin for the exponents of religious mysticism unanimously agree to a threefold division of the life of the mystic the first stage is called the dark night of the soul wherein it seems as if the soul were deserted by god although he is very near it is the time of trial when self is sacrificed as a duty and not as a delight afterwards however comes the morning light of a new intelligence which marks the commencement of that stage of the souls upward progress that is called the illuminative life all the mental powers are now concentrated on god and the struggle is transferred from without to the inner man good works being now done as it were spontaneously the disciple in this stage not only does unselfish deeds but does them from unselfish motives being guided by the light of divine truth the third stage which is the consummation of the process is termed the contemplative life it is barely describable the disciple is wrapped about with the divine love and is united thereby with his divine source it is the life of love as the illuminative life is that of wisdom i suggest that the alchemists believing in this threefold division of the regenerative process argued that there must be three similar stages in the preparation of the stone which was the pattern of all metallic perfection and that they derived their beliefs concerning the colours and other peculiarities of each stage in the supposed chemical process from the characteristics of each stage in the psychological process according to mystical theology moreover in the course of the latter process many flitting thoughts and affections arise and deeds are halfwittingly done which are not of the souls true character and in entire agreement with this we read of the alchemical process in the highly esteemed canons of despagnet besides these decretory signs ie the black white orange and red colours which firmly inhere in the matter and shew its essential mutations almost infinite colours appear and shew themselves in vapours as the rainbow in the clouds which quickly pass away and are expelled by those that succeed more affecting the air than the earth the operator must have a gentle care of them because they are not permanent and proceed not from the intrinsic disposition of the matter but from the fire painting and fashioning everything after its pleasure or casually by heat in slight moisture1 that despagnet is arguing not so much from actual chemical experiments as from analogy with psychological processes in man is i think evident 1 jean despagnet hermetic arcanum canon 65 see collectanea hermetica ed by w wynn westcott vol i 1893 pp 28 and 29 as well as a metallic the alchemists believed in a physiological application of the fundamental doctrines of mysticism their physiology was analogically connected with their metallurgy the same principles holding good in each case paracelsus as we have seen taught that man is a microcosm a world in miniature his spirit the divine spark within is from god his soul is from the stars extracted from the spirit of the world and his body is from the earth extracted from the elements of which all things material are made this view of man was shared by many other alchemists the philosophers stone therefore or rather a solution of it in alcohol was also regarded as the elixir of life which thought the alchemists would not endow man with physical immortality as is sometimes supposed but restore him again to the flower of youth regenerating him physiologically failing this of course they regarded gold in a potable form as the next most powerful medicinea belief which probably led to injurious effects in some cases such are the facts from which i think we are justified in concluding as i have said that the alchemists constructed their chemical theories for the main part by means of a priori reasoning and that the premises from which they started were i the truth of mystical theology especially the doctrine of the souls regeneration and ii the truth of mystical philosophy which asserts that the objects of nature are symbols of spiritual verities1 1 in the following excursion we will wander again in the alchemical bypaths of thought and certain objections to this view of the origin and nature of alchemy will be dealt with and i hope satisfactorily answered it seems to follow ex hypothesi that every alchemical work ought to permit of two interpretations one physical the other transcendental but i would not venture to assert this because as i think many of the lesser alchemists knew little of the origin of their theories nor realised their significance they were concerned merely with these theories in their strictly metallurgical applications and any transcendental meaning we can extract from their works was not intended by the writers themselves however many alchemists i conceive especially the better sort realised more or less clearly the dual nature of their subject and their books are to some extent intended to permit of a double interpretation although the emphasis is laid upon the physical and chemical application of mystical doctrine and there are a few writers who adopted alchemical terminology on the principle that if the language of theology is competent to describe chemical processes then conversely the language of alchemy must be competent to describe psychological processes this is certainly and entirely true of jacob boehme and to some extent also i think of henry khunrath 15601605 and thomas vaughan 16221666 as may be easily understood many of the alchemists led most romantic lives often running the risk of torture and death at the hands of avaricious princes who believed them to be in possession of the philosophers stone and adopted such pleasant methods of extorting or at least of trying to extort their secrets a brief sketch which i quote from my alchemy ancient and modern 1911 se 54 of the lives of alexander sethon and michael sendivogius will serve as an example the date and birthplace of alexander sethon a scottish alchemist do not appear to have been recorded but michael sendivogius was probably born in moravia about 1566 sethon we are told was in possession of the archsecrets of alchemy he visited holland in 1602 proceeded after a time to italy and passed through basle to germany meanwhile he is said to have performed many transmutations ultimately arriving at dresden however he fell into the clutches of the young elector christian ii who in order to extort his secret cast him into prison and put him to the torture but without avail now it so happened that sendivogius who was in quest of the philosophers stone was staying at dresden and hearing of sethons imprisonment obtained permission to visit him sendivogius offered to effect sethons escape in return for assistance in his alchemistic pursuits to which arrangement the scottish alchemist willingly agreed after some considerable outlay of money in bribery sendivogiuss plan of escape was successfully carried out and sethon found himself a free man but he refused to betray the high secrets of hermetic philosophy to his rescuer however before his death which occurred shortly afterwards he presented him with an ounce of the transmutative powder sendivogius soon used up this powder we are told in effecting transmutations and cures and being fond of expensive living he married sethons widow in the hope that she was in the possession of the transmutative secret in this however he was disappointed she knew nothing of the matter but she had the manuscript of an alchemistic work written by her late husband shortly afterwards sendivogius printed at prague a book entitled the new chemical light under the name of cosmopolita which is said to have been this work of sethons but which sendivogius claimed for his own by the insertion of his name on the title page in the form of an anagram the tract on sulphur which was printed at the end of the book in later editions however is said to have been the genuine work of the moravian whilst his powder lasted sendivogius travelled about performing we are told many transmutations he was twice imprisoned in order to extort the secrets of alchemy from him on one occasion escaping and on the other occasion obtaining his release from the emperor rudolph afterwards he appears to have degenerated into an impostor but this is said to have been a finesse to hide his true character as an alchemistic adept he died in 1646 however all the alchemists were not of the apparent character of sendivogiusmany of them leading holy and serviceable lives the alchemistphysician j b van helmont 15771644 who was a man of extraordinary benevolence going about treating the sick poor freely may be particularly mentioned he too claimed to have performed the transmutation of base metal into gold as did also helvetius whom we have already met physician to the prince of orange with a wonderful preparation given to him by a stranger the testimony of these two latter men is very difficult either to explain or to explain away but i cannot deal with this question here but must refer the reader to a paper on the subject by mr gaston de mengel and the discussion thereon published in vol i of the journal of the alchemical society in conclusion i will venture one remark dealing with a matter outside of the present inquiry alchemy ended its days in failure and fraud charlatans and fools were attracted to it by purely mercenary objects who knew nothing of the high aims of the genuine alchemists and scientific men looked elsewhere for solutions of natures problems why did alchemy fail was it because its fundamental theorems were erroneous i think not i consider the failure of the alchemical theory of nature to be due rather to the misapplication of these fundamental concepts to the erroneous use of a priori methods of reasoning to a lack of a sufficiently wide knowledge of natural phenomena to which to apply these concepts to a lack of adequate apparatus with which to investigate such phenomena experimentally and to a lack of mathematical organons of thought with which to interpret such experimental results had they been obtained as for the basic concepts of alchemy themselves such as the fundamental unity of the cosmos and the evolution of the elements in a word the applicability of the principles of mysticism to natural phenomena these seem to me to contain a very valuable element of trutha statement which i think modern scientific research justifies me in makingthough the alchemists distorted this truth and expressed it in a fantastic form i think indeed that in the modern theories of energy and the allpervading ether the etheric and electrical origin and nature of matter and the evolution of the elements we may witness the triumphs of mysticism as applied to the interpretation of nature whether or not we shall ever transmute lead into gold i believe there is a very true sense in which we may say that alchemy purified by its death has been proved true whilst the materialistic view of nature has been proved false x the phallic element in alchemical doctrine the problem of alchemy presents many aspects to our view but to my mind the most fundamental of these is psychological or perhaps i should say epistemological it has been said that the proper study of mankind is man and to study man we must study the beliefs of man now so long as we neglect great tracts of such beliefs because they have been or appear to have been superseded so long will our study be incomplete and ineffectual and this let me add is no mere excuse for the study of alchemy no mere afterthought put forward in justification of a predilection but a plain statement of fact that renders this study an imperative need there are other questions of interestof very great interestconcerning alchemy questions for instance as to the scope and validity of its doctrines but we ought not to allow their fascination and promise to distract our attention from the fundamental problem whose solution is essential to their elucidation in the preceding essay on the quest of the philosophers stone which was written from the standpoint i have sketched in the foregoing words my thesis was that the alchemists constructed their chemical theories for the main part by means of a priori reasoning and that the premises from which they started were i the truth of mystical theology especially the doctrine of the souls regeneration and ii the truth of mystical philosophy which asserts that the objects of nature are symbols of spiritual verities now i wish to treat my present thesis which is concerned with a further source from which the alchemists derived certain of their views and modes of expression by means of a priori reasoning in connection with and in a sense as complementary to my former thesis i propose in the first place therefore briefly to deal with certain possible objections to this view of alchemy it has for instance been maintained1 that the assimilation of alchemical doctrines concerning the metals to those of mysticism concerning the soul was an event late in the history of alchemy and was undertaken in the interests of the latter doctrines now we know that certain mystics of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries did borrow from the alchemists much of their terminology with which to discourse of spiritual mysteriesjacob boehme henry khunrath and perhaps thomas vaughan may be mentioned as the most prominent cases in point but how was this possible if it were not as i have suggested the repayment in a sense of a sort of philological debt transmutation was an admirable vehicle of language for describing the souls regeneration just because the doctrine of transmutation was the result of an attempt to apply the doctrine of regeneration in the sphere of metallurgy and similar remarks hold of the other prominent doctrines of alchemy 1 see for example mr a e waites paper the canon of criticism in respect of alchemical literature the journal of the alchemical society vol i 1913 pp 1730 the wonderful fabric of alchemical doctrine was not woven in a day and as it passed from loom to loom from byzantium to syria from syria to arabia from arabia to spain and latin europe so its pattern changed but it was always woven a priori in the belief that that which is below is as that which is above in its final form i think it is distinctly christian in the turba philosophorum the oldest known work of latin alchemya work which claiming to be of greek origin whilst not that is certainly greek in spiritwe frequently come across statements of a decidedly mystical character the regimen we read is greater than is perceived by reason except through divine inspiration1 copper it is insisted upon again and again has a soul as well as a body and the art we are told is to be defined as the liquefaction of the body and the separation of the soul from the body seeing that copper like a man has a soul and a body2 moreover other doctrines are here propounded which although not so obviously of a mystical character have been traced to mystical sources in the preceding excursion there is for instance the doctrine of purification by means of putrefaction this process being likened to that of the resurrection of man these things being done we read god will restore unto it the matter operated on both the soul and the spirit thereof and the weakness being taken away that matter will be made strong and after corruption will be improved even as a man becomes stronger after resurrection and younger than he was in this world1b the three stages in the alchemical workblack white and redcorresponding to and as i maintain based on the three stages in the life of the mystic are also more than once mentioned cook them the king and his wife therefore until they become black then white afterwards red and finally until a tingeing venom is produced2b 1 the turba philosophorum or assembly of the sages trans by a e waite 1896 p 128 2 ibid p 193 cf pp 102 and 152 1b the turba philosophorum or assembly of the sages trans by a e waite p 101 cf pp 27 and 197 2b ibid p 98 cf p 29 in view of these quotations the alliance shall i say between alchemy and mysticism cannot be asserted to be of late origin and we shall find similar statements if we go further back in time to give but one example among the earliest authorities writes mr waite the book of crates says that copper like man has a spirit soul and body the term copper being symbolical and applying to a stage in the alchemical work but nowhere in the turba do we meet with the concept of the philosophers stone as the medicine of the metals a concept characteristic of latin alchemy and to quote mr waite again it does not appear that the conception of the philosophers stone as a medicine of metals and of men was familiar to greek alchemy3 3 ibid p 71 all this seems to me very strongly to support my view of the origin of alchemy which requires a specifically christian mysticism only for this specific concept of the philosophers stone in its fullyfledged form at any rate the development of alchemical doctrine can be seen to have proceeded concomitantly with the development of mystical philosophy and theology those who are not prepared here to see effect and cause may be asked not only to formulate some other hypothesis in explanation of the origin of alchemy but also to explain this fact of concomitant development from the standpoint of the transcendental theory of alchemy it has been urged that the language of mystical theology seemed to be hardly so suitable to the exposition as i maintain or concealment of chemical theories as the language of a definite and generally credited branch of science was suited to the expression of a veiled and symbolical process such as the regeneration of man1 but such a statement is only possible with respect to the latest days of alchemy when there was a science of chemistry definite and generally credited the science of chemistry it must be remembered had no growth separate from alchemy but evolved therefrom of the days before this evolution had been accomplished it would be in closer accord with the facts to say that theology including the doctrine of mans regeneration was in the position of a definite and generally credited branch of science whereas chemical phenomena were veiled in deepest mystery and tinged with the dangers appertaining to magic as concerns the origin of alchemy therefore the argument as to suitability of language appears to support my own theory it being open to assume that after formulationthat is in alchemys latter dayschemical nomenclature and theories were employed by certain writers to veil heterodox religious doctrine 1 philip s wellby ma in the journal of the alchemical society vol ii 1914 p 104 another recent writer on the subject my friend the late mr abdulali has remarked that he thought that in the mind of the alchemist at least there was something more than analogy between metallic and psychic transformations and that the whole subject might well be assigned to the doctrinal category of ineffable and transcendent oneness this oneness comprehended allsoul and body spirit and matter mystic visions and waking lifeand the sharp metaphysical distinction between the mental and the nonmental realms so prominent during the history of philosophy was not regarded by these early investigators in the sphere of nature there was the sentiment perhaps only dimly experienced that not only the law but the substance of the universe was one that mind was everywhere in contact with its own kindred and that metallic transmutation would somehow so to speak signalise and seal a hidden transmutation of the soul1 1 sijil abdulali in the journal of the alchemical society vol ii 1914 p 102 i am to a large extent in agreement with this view mr abdulali quarrels with the term analogy and if it is held to imply any merely superficial resemblance it certainly is not adequate to my own needs though i know not what other word to use swedenborgs term correspondence would be better for my purpose as standing for an essential connection between spirit and matter arising out of the causal relationship of the one to the other but if swedenborg believed that matter and spirit were most intimately related he nevertheless had a very precise idea of their distinctness which he formulated in his doctrine of degreesa very exact metaphysical doctrine indeed the alchemists on the other hand had no such clear ideas on the subject it would be even more absurd to attribute to them a cartesian dualism to their ways of thinking it was by no means impossible to grasp the spiritual essences of things by what we should now call chemical manipulations for them a gas was still a ghost and air a spirit one could quote pages in support of this but i will content myself with a few words from the turbathe antiquity of the book makes it of value and anyway it is near at hand permanent water whatever that may be being pounded with the body we are told by the will of god it turns that body into spirit and in another place we read that the philosophers have said except ye turn bodies into notbodies and incorporeal things into bodies ye have not yet discovered the rule of operation1a no one who could write like this and believe it could hold matter and spirit as altogether distinct but it is equally obvious that the injunction to convert body into spirit is meaningless if spirit and body are held to be identical i have been criticised for crediting the alchemists with the philosophic acumen of hegel1b but that is just what i think one ought to avoid doing at the same time however it is extremely difficult to give a precise account of views which are very far from being precise themselves but i think it may be said without fear of error that the alchemist who could say as above so below ipso facto recognised both a very close connection between spirit and matter and a distinction between them moreover the division thus implied corresponded on the whole to that between the realms of the known or what was thought to be known and the unknown the church whether christian or prechristian had very precise comparatively speaking doctrine concerning the souls origin duties and destiny backed up by tremendous authority and speculative philosophy had advanced very far by the time plato began to concern himself with its problems nature on the other hand was a mysterious world of magical happenings and there was nothing deserving of the name of natural science until alchemy was becoming decadent it is not surprising therefore that the alchemiststhese men who wished to probe natures hidden mysteriesshould reason from above to below indeed unless they had started de novoas babes knowing nothingthere was no other course open to them and that they did adopt the obvious course is all that my former thesis amounts to in passing it is interesting to note that a sixteenthcentury alchemist who had exceptional opportunities and leisure to study the works of the old masters of alchemy seems to have come to a similar conclusion as to the nature of their reasoning he writes the sages after having conceived in their minds a divine idea of the relations of the whole universe selected from among the rest a certain substance from which they sought to elicit the elements to separate and purify them and then again put them together in a manner suggested by a keen and profound observation of nature1c 1a op cit pp 65 and 110 cf p 154 1b vide a rather frivolous review of my alchemy ancient and modern in the outlook for 14th january 1911 1c edward kelly the humid path

to elucidate this point some further considerations are necessary touching the general nature of knowledge now facts may be roughly classed according to their obviousness and frequency of occurrence into four groups there are first of all facts which are so obvious to put it paradoxically that they escape notice and these facts are the commonest and most frequent in their occurrence i think it is mr chesterton who has said that looking at a forest one cannot see the trees because of the forest and in the innocence of father brown he has a good story the invisible man illustrating the point in which a man renders himself invisible by dressing up in a postmans uniform at any rate we know that when a phenomenon becomes persistent it tends to escape observation thus continuous motion can only be appreciated with reference to a stationary body and a noise continually repeated becomes at last inaudible the tendency of oftenrepeated actions to become habitual and at last automatic that is to say carried out without consciousness is a closely related phenomenon we can understand therefore why a knowledge of the existence of the atmosphere as distinct from the wind came late in the history of primitive man as also many other curious gaps in his knowledge in the second group we may put those facts which are common that is of frequent occurrence and are classed as obvious such facts are accepted at facevalue by the primitive mind and are used as the basis of explanation of facts in the two remaining groups namely those facts which though common are apt to escape the attention owing to their inconspicuousness and those which are of infrequent occurrence when the mind takes the trouble to observe a fact of the third group or is confronted by one of the fourth it feels a sense of surprise such facts wear an air of strangeness and the mind can only rest satisfied when it has shown them to itself as in some way cases of the second group of facts or at least brought them into relation therewith that is what the mindat least the primitive mindmeans by explanation it is obvious we say commencing an argument thereby proclaiming our intention to bring that which is at first in the category of the notobvious into the category of the obvious it remains for a more sceptical type of minda later product of human evolutionto question obvious facts to explain them either as in science by establishing deeper and more farreaching correlations between phenomena or in philosophy by seeking for the source and purpose of such facts or better still by both methods of the second class of factsthose common and obvious facts which the primitive mind accepts at facevalue and uses as the basis of its explanations of such things as seem to it to stand in need of explanationone could hardly find a better instance than sex the universality of sex and the intermittent character of its phenomena are both responsible for this indeed the attitude of mind i have referred to is not restricted to primitive man how many people today for instance just accept sex as a fact pleasant or unpleasant according to their predilections never querying or feeling the need to query its why and wherefore it is by no means surprising that when man first felt the need of satisfying himself as to the origin of the universe he should have done so by a theory founded on what he knew of his own generation indeed as i queried on a former occasion what other source of explanation was open to him of what other form of origin was he aware seeing nature springing to life at the kiss of the sun what more natural than that she should be regarded as the divine mother who bears fruits because impregnated by the sungod it is not difficult to understand therefore why primitive man paid divine honours to the organs of sex in man and woman or to such things as he considered symbolical of themthat is to say to understand the extensiveness of those religions which are grouped under the term phallicism nor to my mind is the symbol of sex a wholly inadequate one under which to conceive of the origin of things and as i have said before that phallicism usually appears to have degenerated into immorality of a very pronounced type is to be deplored but an immoral view of human relations is by no means a necessary corollary to a sexual theory of the universe1 1 the reverence as well as the worship paid to the phallus in early and primitive days had nothing in it which partook of indecency all ideas connected with it were of a reverential and religious kind the indecent ideas attached to the representation of the phallus were though it seems a paradox to say so the results of a more advanced civilization verging towards its decline as we have evidence at rome and pompeii to the primitive man the reproductive force which pervades all nature was the most mysterious of all manifestations the visible physical powers of naturethe sun the sky the stormnaturally claimed his reverence but to him the generative power was the most mysterious of all powers in the vegetable world the live seed placed in the ground and hence germinating sprouting up and becoming a beautiful and umbrageous tree was a mystery in the animal world as the cause of all life by which all beings came into existence this power was a mystery in the view of primitive man generation was the action of the deity itself it was the mode in which he brought all things into existence the sun the moon the stars the world man were generated by him to the productive power man was deeply indebted for to it he owed the harvests and the flocks which supported his life hence it naturally became an object of reverence and worship primitive man wants some object to worship for an abstract idea is beyond his comprehension hence a visible representation of the generative deity was made with the organs contributing to generation most prominent and hence the organ itself became a symbol of the powerh m westropp primitive symbolism as illustrated in phallic worship or the reproductive principle 1885 pp 47 48 and 57 end of long footnote the aruntas of australia i believe when discovered by europeans had not yet observed the connection between sexual intercourse and birth they believed that conception was occasioned by the woman passing near a churingaa peculiarly shaped piece of wood or stone in which a spiritchild was concealed which entered into her but archaeological research having established the fact that phallicism has at one time or another been common to nearly all races it seems probable that the arunta tribe represents a deviation from the normal line of mental evolution at any rate an isolated phenomenon such as this cannot be held to controvert the view that regards phallicism as in this normal line nor was the attitude of mind that not only accepts sex at facevalue as an obvious fact but uses the concept of it to explain other facts a merely transitory one we may indeed not difficultly trace it throughout the history of alchemy giving rise to what i may term the phallic element in alchemical doctrine in aiming to establish this i may be thought to be endeavouring to establish a counterthesis to that of the preceding essay on alchemy but in virtue of the alchemists belief in the mystical unity of all things in the analogical or correspondential relationship of all parts of the universe to each other the mystical and the phallic views of the origin of alchemy are complementary not antagonistic indeed the assumption that the metals are the symbols of man almost necessitates the working out of physiological as well as mystical analogies and these two series of analogies are themselves connected because the principle as above so below was held to be true of man himself we might therefore expect to find a more or less complete harmony between the two series of symbols though as a matter of fact contradictions will be encountered when we come to consider points of detail the undoubtable antiquity of the phallic element in alchemical doctrine precludes the idea that this element was an adventitious one that it was in any sense an afterthought notwithstanding however the evidence as will i hope become apparent as we proceed indicates that mystical ideas played a much more fundamental part in the genesis of alchemical doctrine than purely phallic onesmystical interpretations fit alchemical processes and theories far better than do sexual interpretations in fact sex has to be interpreted somewhat mystically in order to work out the analogies fully and satisfactorily as concerns greek alchemy i shall content myself with a passage from a work on the sacred art attributed to olympiodorus sixth century ad followed by some quotations from and references to the turba in the former work it is stated on the authority of horus that the proper end of the whole art is to obtain the semen of the male secretly seeing that all things are male and female hence we read further horus says in a certain place join the male and the female and you will find that which is sought as a fact without this process of reunion nothing can succeed for nature charms nature etc the turba insistently commands those who would succeed in the art to conjoin the male with the female1 and in one place the male is said to be lead and the female orpiment2 we also find the alchemical work symbolised by the growth of the embryo in the womb know we are told that out of the elect things nothing becomes useful without conjunction and regimen because sperma is generated out of blood and desire for the man mingling with the woman the sperm is nourished by the humour of the womb and by the moistening blood and by heat and when forty nights have elapsed the sperm is formed god has constituted that heat and blood for the nourishment of the sperm until the foetus is brought forth so long as it is little it is nourished with milk and in proportion as the vital heat is maintained the bones are strengthened thus it behoves you also to act in this art3 1 vide pp 60 92 96 97 134 135 and elsewhere in mr waites translation 2 ibid p 57 3 ibid pp 179181 second recension cf pp 103104 the use of the mystical symbols of death putrefaction and resurrection or rebirth to represent the consummation of the alchemical work and that of the phallic symbols of the conjunction of the sexes and the development of the foetus both of which we have found in the turba are current throughout the course of latin alchemy in the chymical marriage of christian rosencreutz that extraordinary document of what is called rosicrucianisma symbolic romance of considerable ability whoever its author was1an attempt is made to weld the two sets of symbolsthe one of marriage the other of death and resurrection unto gloryinto one allegorical narrative and it is to this fusion of seemingly disparate concepts that much of its fantasticality is due yet the concepts are not really disparate for not only is the second birth like unto the first and not only is the resurrection unto glory described as the bridal feast of the lamb but marriage is in a manner a form of death and rebirth to justify this in a crude sense i might say that from the male standpoint at least it is a giving of the lifesubstance to the beloved that life may be born anew and increase but in a deeper sense it is or rather should be as an ideal a mutual sacrifice of self for each others gooda death of the self that it may arise with an enriched personality 1 see mr waites the real history of the rosicrucians 1887 for translation and discussion as to origin and significance the work was first published in german at strassburg in 1616 it is when we come to an examination of the ideas at the root of and associated with the alchemical concept of principles that we find some difficulty in harmonising the two series of symbolsthe mystical and the phallic in one place in the turba we are directed to take quicksilver in which is the male potency or strength2a and this concept of mercury as male is quite in accord with the mystical origin i have assigned in the preceding excursion to the doctrine of the alchemical principles i have shown i think that salt sulphur and mercury are the analogues ex hypothesi of the body soul affection and volition and spirit intelligence or understanding in man and the affections are invariably regarded as especially feminine the understanding as especially masculine but it seems that the more common opinion amongst latin alchemists at any rate was that sulphur was male and mercury female writes bernard of trevisan for the matter suffereth and the form acteth assimulating the matter to itself and according to this manner the matter naturally thirsteth after a form as a woman desireth an husband and a vile thing a precious one and an impure a pure one so also argentvive coveteth a sulphur as that which should make perfect which is imperfect so also a body freely desireth a spirit whereby it may at length arrive at its perfection1b at the same time however mercury was regarded as containing in itself both male and female potenciesit was the product of male and female and thus the seed of all the metals nothing in the world can be generated to repeat a quotation from bernard without these two substances to wit a male and female from whence it appeareth that although these two substances are not of one and the same species yet one stone doth thence arise and although they appear and are said to be two substances yet in truth it is but one to wit argentvive but of this argentvive a certain part is fixed and digested masculine hot dry and secretly informing but the other which is the female is volatile crude cold and moyst2b edward kelly 15551595 who is valuable because he summarises authoritative opinion says somewhat the same thing though in clearer words the active elements these are water and fire may be called male while the passive elements earth and air represent the female principle only two elements water and earth are visible and earth is called the hidingplace of fire water the abode of air in these two elements we have the broad law of limitation which divides the male from the female the first matter of minerals is a kind of viscous water mingled with pure and impure earth of this viscous water and fusible earth or sulphur is composed that which is called quicksilver the first matter of the metals metals are nothing but mercury digested by different degrees of heat1c there is one difference however between these two writers inasmuch as bernard says that the male and female abide together in closed natures the female truly as it were earth and water the male as air and fire mercury for him arises from the two former elements sulphur from the two latter2c and the difference is important as showing beyond question the a priori nature of alchemical reasoning the idea at the back of the alchemists minds was undoubtedly that of the ardour of the male in the act of coition and the alleged or perhaps i should say apparent passivity of the female consequently sulphur the fiery principle of combustion and such elements as were reckoned to be active were denominated male whilst mercury the principle acted on by sulphur and such elements as were reckoned to be passive were denominated female as to the question of origin i do not think that the palm can be denied to the mystical as distinguished from the phallic theory and in its final form the doctrine of principles is incapable of a sexual interpretation mystically understood man is capable of analysis into two principlessince body may be neglected as unimportant a false view i think by the way or soul and spirit may be united under one heador into three whereas the postulation of three principles on a sexual basis is impossible joannes isaacus hollandus fifteenth century is the earliest author in whose works i have observed explicit mention of three principles though he refers to them in a manner seeming to indicate that the doctrine was no new one in his day i have only read one little tract of his there is nothing sexual in it and the authors mental character may be judged from his remarks concerning the three flying spiritstaste smell and colour these he writes are the life soule and quintessence of every thing neither can these three spirits be one without the other as the father the son and the holy ghost are one yet three persons and one is not without the other1d 2a mr waites translation p 79 1b bernard earl of trevisan a treatise of the philosophers stone 1683 see collectanea chymica a collection of ten several

element or principle as male or female they meant what they said as i have already intimated to the extent at least of firmly believing that seed was produced by the two metallic sexes by their union metals were thought to be produced in the womb of the earth and mines were shut in order that by the birth and growth of new metal the impoverished veins might be replenished in this way too was the magnum opus the generation of the philosophers stonein species gold but purer than the purestto be accomplished to conjoin that which nature supplied to foster the growth and development of that which was thereby produced such was the task of the alchemist for there are vegetables says bernard of trevisan in his answer to thomas of bononia but sensitives more especially which for the most part beget their like by the seeds of the male and female for the most part concurring and conmixt by copulation which work of nature the philosophick art imitates in the generation of gold1 1 op cit p 216 mercury as i have said was commonly regarded as the seed of the metals or as especially the female seed there being two seeds one the male according to bernard more ripe perfect and active the other the female more immature and in a sort passive2 our philosophick art he says in another place following a description of the generation of man is like this procreation of man for as in mercury of which gold is by nature generated in mineral vessels a natural conjunction 2 ibid p 217 cf p 236 is made of both the seeds male and female so by our artifice an artificial and like conjunction is made of agents and patients1 all teaching says kelly that changes mercury is false and vain for this is the original sperm of metals and its moisture must not be dried up for otherwise it will not dissolve2 and quotes arnold ob c 1310 to a similar effect3 one wonders how far the fact that human and animal seed is fluid influenced the alchemists in their choice of mercury the only metal liquid at ordinary temperatures as the seed of the metals there are indeed other good reasons for this choice but that this idea played some part in it and at least was present at the back of the alchemists minds i have little doubt the most philosophic account of metallic seed is that perhaps of the mysterious adept eirenaeus philalethes who distinguishes between it and mercury in a rather interesting manner he writes seed is the means of generic propagation given to all perfect things here below it is the perfection of each body and anybody that has no seed must be regarded as imperfect hence there can be no doubt that there is such a thing as metallic seed all metallic seed is the seed of gold for gold is the intention of nature in regard to all metals if the base metals are not gold it is only through some accidental hindrance they areall potentially gold but of course this seed of gold is most easily obtainable from wellmatured gold itself remember that i am now speaking of metallic seed and not of mercury the seed of metals is hidden out of sight still more completely than that of animals nevertheless it is within the compass of our art to extract it the seed of animals and vegetables is something separate and may be cut out or otherwise separately exhibited but metallic seed is diffused throughout the metal and contained in all its smallest parts neither can it be discerned from its body its extraction is therefore a task which may well tax the ingenuity of the most experienced philosopher the virtues of the whole metal have to be intensified so as to convert it into the sperm of our seed which by circulation receives the virtues of superiors and inferiors then next becomes wholly form or heavenly virtue which can communicate this to others related to it by homogeneity of matter the place in which the seed resides isapproximately speakingwater for to speak properly and exactly the seed is the smallest part of the metal and is invisible but as this invisible presence is diffused throughout the water of its kind and exerts its virtue therein nothing being visible to the eye but water we are left to conclude from rational induction that this inward agent which is properly speaking the seed is really there hence we call the whole of the water seed just as we call the whole of the grain seed though the germ of life is only a smallest particle of the grain1b 1 the answer of bernardus trevisanus etc op cit p 218 2 op cit p 22 3 ibid p 16 1b eirenaeus philalethes the metamorphosis of metals see the hermetic museum vol ii pp 238240 to say that philalethes seed resembles the modern electron is perhaps to draw a rather fanciful analogy since the electron is a very precise idea the result of the mathematical interpretation of the results of exact experimentation but though it would be absurd to speak of this concept of the one seed of all metals as an anticipation of the electron to apply the expression metallic seed to the electron now that the concept of it has been reached does not seem so absurd according to philalethes the extraction of the seed is a very difficult process accomplishable however by the aid of mercurythe water homogeneous therewith mercury again is the form of the seed thereby obtained he writes when the sperm hidden in the body of gold is brought out by means of our art it appears under the form of mercury whence it is exalted into the quintessence which is first white and then by means of continuous coction becomes red and again there is a womb into which the gold if placed therein will of its own accord emit its seed until it is debilitated and dies and by its death is renewed into a most glorious king who thenceforward receives power to deliver all his brethren from the fear of death1 1 eirenaeus philalethes the metamorphosis of metals see the hermetic museum vol ii pp 241 and 244 the fifteenthcentury alchemist thomas norton was peculiar in his views inasmuch as he denied that metals have seed he writes nature never multiplies anything except in either one or the other of these two ways either by decay which we call putrefaction or in the case of animate creatures by propagation in the case of metals there can be no propagation though our stone exhibits something like it nothing can be multiplied by inward action unless it belong to the vegetable kingdom or the family of sensitive creatures but the metals are elementary objects and possess neither seed nor sensation1 1 thomas norton the ordinal of alchemy see the hermetic museum vol ii pp 15 and 16 his theory of the origin of the metals is astral rather than phallic the only efficient cause of metals he says is the mineral virtue which is not found in every kind of earth but only in certain places and chosen mines into which the celestial sphere pours its rays in a straight direction year by year and according to the arrangement of the metallic substance in these places this or that metal is gradually formed2 2 ibid pp 15 and 16 in view of the astrological symbolism of these metals that gold should be masculine silver feminine does not surprise us because the idea of the masculinity of the sun and the femininity of the moon is a bit of phallicism that still remains with us it was by the marriage of gold and silver that very many alchemists considered that the magnum opus was to be achieved writes bernard of trevisan the subject of this admired science alchemy is sol and luna or rather male and female the male is hot and dry the female cold and moyst the aim of the work he tells us is the extraction of the spirit of gold which alone can enter into bodies and tinge them both sol and luna are absolutely necessary and whoevershall think that a tincture can be made without these two bodyes he proceedeth to the practice like one that is blind1 1 bernard earl of trevisan a treatise etc op cit pp 83 and 87 kelly has teaching to the same effect the mercury of the philosophers being for him the menstruum or medium wherein the copulation of gold with silver is to be accomplished mercury in fact seems to have been everything and to have been capable of effecting everything in the eyes of the alchemists concerning gold and silver kelly writes only one metal viz gold is absolutely perfect and mature hence it is called the perfect male body silver is less bounded by aqueous immaturity than the rest of the metals though it may indeed be regarded as to a certain extent impure still its water is already covered with the congealing vesture of its earth and it thus tends to perfection this condition is the reason why silver is everywhere called by the sages the perfect female body and later he writes in short our whole magistery consists in the union of the male and female or active and passive elements through the mediation of our metallic water and a proper degree of heat now the male and female are two metallic bodies and this i will again prove by irrefragable quotations from the sages some of the quotations will be given avicenna purify husband and wife separately in order that they may unite more intimately for if you do not purify them they cannot love each other by conjunction of the two natures you get a clear and lucid nature which when it ascends becomes bright and serviceable senior i the sun am hot and dry and thou the moon are cold and moist when we are wedded together in a closed chamber i will gently steal away thy soul rosinus when the sun my brother for the love of me silver pours his sperm ie his solar fatness into the chamber ie my lunar body namely when we become one in a strong and complete complexion and union the child of our wedded love will be born rosary the ferment of the sun is the sperm of the man the ferment of the moon the sperm of the woman of both we get a chaste union and a true generation aristotle take your beloved son and wed him to his sister his white sister in equal marriage and give them the cup of love for it is a food which prompts to union 1a kelly of course accepts the traditional authorship of the works from which he quotes though in many cases such authorship is doubtful to say the least the alchemical works ascribed to aristotle 384322 bc for instance are beyond question forgeries indeed the symbol of a union between brother and sister here quoted could hardly be held as acceptable to greek thought to which incest was the most abominable and unforgiveable sin it seems likelier that it originated with the egyptians to whom such unions were tolerable in fact the symbol is often met with in latin alchemy michael maier 15681622 also says conjunge fratrem cum sorore et propina illis poculum amoris the words forming a motto to a picture of a man and woman clasped in each others arms to whom an older man offers a goblet this symbolic picture occurs in his atalanta fugiens hoc est emblemata nova de secretis naturae chymica etc oppenheim 1617 this work is an exceedingly curious one it consists of a number of carefully executed pictures each accompanied by a motto a verse of poetry set to music with a prose text many of the pictures are phallic in conception and practically all of them are anthropomorphic not only the primary function of sex but especially its secondary one of lactation is made use of the most curious of these emblematic pictures perhaps is one symbolising the conjunction of gold and silver it shows on the right a man and woman representing the sun and moon in the act of coition standing up to the thighs in a lake on the left on a hill above the lake a woman with the moon as halo gives birth to a child a boy is coming out of the water towards her the verse informs us that the bath glows red at the conception of the boy the air at his birth we learn also that there is a stone and yet there is not which is the noble gift of god if god grants it fortunate will be he who shall receive it1 1a edward kelly the stone of the philosophers op cit pp 13 14 33 35 36 3840 and 47 1 op cit p 145 concerning the nature of gold there is a discussion in the answer of bernardus trevisanus to the epistle of thomas of bononia with which i shall close my consideration of the present aspect of the subject its interest for us lies in the arguments which are used and held to be valid besides you say that gold as most think is nothing else than quicksilver coagulated naturally by the force of sulphur yet so that nothing of the sulphur which generated the gold doth remain in the substance of the gold as in an humane embryo when it is conceived in the womb there remains nothing of the fathers seed according to aristotles opinion but the seed of the man doth only coagulate the menstrual blood of the woman in the same manner you say that after quicksilver is so coagulated the form of gold is perfected in it by virtue of the heavenly bodies and especially of the sun1 bernard however decides against this view holding that gold contains both mercury and sulphur for we must not imagine according to their mistake who say that the male agent himself approaches the female in the coagulation and departs afterwards because as is known in every generation the conception is active and passive both the active and the passive that is all the four elements must always abide together otherwise there would be no mixture and the hope of generating an offspring would be extinguished2 1 op cit pp 206 and 207 2 ibid pp 212 and 213 in conclusion i wish to say something of the role of sex in spiritual alchemy but in doing this i am venturing outside the original field of inquiry of this essay and making a by no means necessary addition to my thesis and i am anxious that what follows should be understood as such so that no confusion as to the issues may arise in the great alchemical collection of j j manget there is a curious work originally published in 1677 entitled mutus liber which consists entirely of plates without letterpress its interest for us in our present concern is that the alchemist from the commencement of the work until its achievement is shown working in conjunction with a woman we are reminded of nicolas flamel 13301418 who is reputed to have achieved the magnum opus together with his wife pernelle as well as of the many other women workers in the art of whom we read it would be of interest in this connection to know exactly what association of ideas was present in the mind of michael maier when he commanded the alchemist perform a work of women on the molten white lead that is cook1a and illustrated his behest with a picture of a pregnant woman watching a fire over which is suspended a cauldron and on which are three jars there is a cat in the background and a tub containing two fish in the foreground the whole forming a very curious collection of emblems mr waite who has dealt with some of these matters luminously though briefly says the evidences with which we have been dealing concern solely the physical work of alchemy and there is nothing of its mystical aspects the mutus liber is undoubtedly on the literal side of metallic transmutation the memorials of nicholas flamel are also on that side etc he adds however that it is on record that an unknown master testified to his possession of the mystery but he added that he had not proceeded to the work because he had failed to meet with an elect woman who was necessary thereto and proceeds to say i suppose that the statement will awaken in most minds only a vague sense of wonder and i can merely indicate in a few general words that which i see behind it those hermetic texts which bear a spiritual interpretation and are as if a record of spiritual experience present like the literature of physical alchemy the following aspects of symbolism a the marriage of sun and moon b of a mystical king and queen c an union between natures which are one at the root but diverse in manifestation d a transmutation which follows this union and an abiding glory therein it is ever a conjunction between male and female in a mystical sense it is ever the bringing together by art of things separated by an imperfect order of things it is ever the perfection of natures by means of this conjunction but if the mystical work of alchemy is an inward work in consciousness then the union between male and female is an union in consciousness and if we remember the traditions of a state when male and female had not as yet been divided it may dawn upon us that the higher alchemy was a practice for the return into this ineffable mode of being the traditional doctrine is set forth in the zohar and it is found in writers like jacob boehme it is intimated in the early chapters of genesis and according to an apocryphal saying of christ the kingdom of heaven will be manifested when two shall be as one or when that state has been once again attained in the light of this construction we can understand why the mystical adept went in search of a wise woman with whom the work could be performed but few there be that find her and he confessed to his own failure the part of woman in the physical practice of alchemy is like a reflection at a distance of this more exalted process and there is evidence that those who worked in metals and sought for a material elixir knew that there were other and greater aspects of the hermetic mystery1b 1a michael mater atalanta fugiens 1617 p 97 1b a e waite woman and the hermetic mystery the occult review june 1912 vol xv pp 325 and 326 so far mr waite whose impressive words i have quoted at some length and he has given us a fuller account of the theory as found in the zohar in his valuable work on the secret doctrine in israel 1913 the zohar regards marriage and the performance of the sexual function in marriage as of supreme importance and this not merely because marriage symbolises a divine union unless that expression is held to include all that logically follows from the fact but because as it seems the sexual act in marriage may in fact become a ritual of transcendental magic at least three varieties of opinion can be traced from the view of sex we have under consideration as to the nature of the perfect man and hence of the most adequate symbol for transmutation according to one and this appears to have been jacob boehmes view the perfect man is conceived of as nonsexual the male and female elements united in him having as it were neutralised each other according to another he is pictured as a hermaphroditic being a concept we frequently come across in alchemical literature it plays a prominent part in maiers book atalanta fugiens to which reference has already been made maiers hermaphrodite has two heads one male one female but only one body one pair of arms and one pair of legs the two sexual organs which are placed side by side are delineated in the illustrations with considerable care showing the importance maier attached to the idea this concept seems to me not only crude but unnatural and repellent but it may be said of both the opinions i have mentioned that they confuse between union and identity it is the old mistake with respect to a lesser goal of those who hope for absorption in the divine nature and consequent loss of personality it seems to be forgotten that a certain degree of distinction is necessary to the joy of union distinction and separation it should be remembered have different connotations if the supreme joy is that of selfsacrifice then the self must be such that it can be continually sacrificed else the joy is a purely transitory one or rather is destroyed at the moment of its consummation hence though sacrificed the self must still remain itself the third view of perfection to which these remarks naturally lead is that which sees it typified in marriage the mysticphilosopher swedenborg has some exceedingly suggestive things to say on the matter in his extraordinary work on conjugial love which curiously enough seem largely to have escaped the notice of students of these high mysteries swedenborgs heaven is a sexual heaven because for him sex is primarily a spiritual fact and only secondarily and because of what it is primarily a physical fact and salvation is hardly possible according to him apart from a genuine marriage whether achieved here or hereafter man and woman are considered as complementary beings and it is only through the union of one man with one woman that the perfect angel results the altruistic tendency of such a theory as contrasted with the egotism of one in which perfection is regarded as obtainable by each personality of itself alone is a point worth emphasising as to the nature of this union it is to use swedenborgs own terms a conjunction of the will of the wife with the understanding of the man and reciprocally of the understanding of the man with the will of the wife it is thus a manifestation of that fundamental marriage between the good and the true which is at the root of all existence and it is because of this fundamental marriage that all men and women are born into the desire to complete themselves by conjunction the symbol of sexual intercourse is a legitimate one to use in speaking of this heavenly union indeed we may describe the highest bliss attainable by the soul or conceivable by the mind as a spiritual orgasm into conjugal love are collected says swedenborg all the blessednesses blissfulnesses delightsomenesses pleasantnesses and pleasures which could possibly be conferred upon man by the lord the creator1 in another place he writes married partners in heaven enjoy similar intercourse with each other as in the world but more delightful and blessed yet without prolification for which or in place of which they have spiritual prolification which is that of love and wisdom the reason he adds why the intercourse then is more delightful and blessed is that when conjugial love becomes of the spirit it becomes more interior and pure and consequently more perceptible and every delightsomeness grows according to the perception and grows even until its blessedness is discernible in its delightsomeness1b such love however he says is rarely to be found on earth 1 emanuel swedenborg the delights of wisdom relating to conjugial love trans by a h searle 1891 se 68 1b emanuel swedenborg op cit se 51 a learned japanese speaks with approval of idealism as a dream where sensuousness and spirituality find themselves to be blood brothers or sisters2 it is a statement which involves either the grossest and most dangerous error or the profoundest truth according to the understanding of it woman is a road whereby man travels either to god or the devil the problem of sex is a far deeper problem than appears at first sight involving mysteries both the direst and most holy it is by no means a fantastic hypothesis that the inmost mystery of what a certain school of mystics calls the secret tradition was a sexual one at any rate the fact that some of those at least to whom alchemy connoted a mystical process were alive to the profound spiritual significance of sex renders of double interest what they have to intimate of the achievement of the magnum opus in man 2 yone noguchi the spirit of japanese art 1915 p 37 xi roger bacon an appreciation it has been said that a prophet is not without honour save in his own country thereto might be added and in his own time for whilst there is continuity in time there is also evolution and england of today for instance is not the same country as england of the middle ages in his own day roger bacon was accounted a magician whose heretical views called for suppression by the church and for many a long day afterwards was he mainly remembered as a coworker in the black art with friar bungay who together with him constructed by the aid of the devil and diabolical rites a brazen head which should possess the power of speechthe experiment only failing through the negligence of an assistant1 such was roger bacon in the memory of the later middle ages and many succeeding years he was the typical alchemist where that term carries with it the depth of disrepute though indeed alchemy was for him but one and that not the greatest of many interests 1 the story of course is entirely fictitious for further particulars see sir j e sandys essay on roger bacon in english literature in roger bacon essays 1914 referred to below ilchester in somerset claims the honour of being the place of roger bacons birth which interesting and important event occurred probably in 1214 young bacon studied theology philosophy and what then passed under the name of science first at oxford then the centre of liberal thought and afterwards at paris in the rigid orthodoxy of whose professors he found more to criticise than to admire whilst at oxford he joined the franciscan order and at paris he is said though this is probably an error to have graduated as doctor of theology during 12501256 we find him back in england no doubt engaged in study and teaching about the latter year however he is said to have been banishedon a charge of holding heterodox views and indulging in magical practicesto paris where he was kept in close confinement and forbidden to write mr little1 however believes this to be an error based on a misreading of a passage in one of bacons works and that roger was not imprisoned but stricken with sickness at any rate it is not improbable that some restrictions as to his writing were placed on him by his superiors of the franciscan order in 1266 bacon received a letter from pope clement asking him to send his holiness his works in writing without delay this letter came as a most pleasant surprise to bacon but he had nothing of importance written and in great haste and excitement therefore he composed three works explicating his philosophy the opus majus the opus minus and the opus tertium which were completed and dispatched to the pope by the end of the following year this as mr rowbottom remarks is surely one of the literary feats of history perhaps only surpassed by swedenborg when he wrote six theological and philosophical treatises in one year1b 1 see his contribution on roger bacons life and works to roger bacon essays 1b b r rowbottom roger bacon the journal of the alchemical society vol ii 1914 p 77 the works appear to have been well received we next find bacon at oxford writing his compendium studii philosophiae in which work he indulged in some by no means unjust criticisms of the clergy for which he fell under the condemnation of his order and was imprisoned in 1277 on a charge of teaching suspected novelties in those days any knowledge of natural phenomena beyond that of the quasiscience of the times was regarded as magic and no doubt some of roger bacons suspected novelties were of this nature his recognition of the value of the writings of nonchristian moralists was no doubt another suspected novelty appeals for his release directed to the pope proved fruitless being frustrated by jerome dascoli general of the franciscan order who shortly afterwards succeeded to the holy see under the title of nicholas iv the latter died in 1292 whereupon raymond gaufredi who had been elected general of the franciscan order and who it is thought was well disposed towards bacon because of certain alchemical secrets the latter had revealed to him ordered his release bacon returned to oxford where he wrote his last work the compendium studii theologiae he died either in this year or in 12941 1 for further details concerning bacons life emile charles roger bacon sa vie ses ouvrages ses doctrines 1861 j h bridges the life work of roger bacon an introduction to the opus majus edited by h g jones 1914 and mr a g littles essay in roger bacon essays may be consulted it was not until the publication by dr samuel jebb in 1733 of the greater part of bacons opus majus nearly four and a half centuries after his death that anything like his rightful position in the history of philosophy began to be assigned to him but let his spirit be no longer troubled if it were ever troubled by neglect or slander for the world and first and foremost his own country has paid him due honour his septcentenary was duly celebrated in 1914 at his alma mater oxford his statue has there been raised as a memorial to his greatness and savants have meted out praise to him in no grudging tones2 indeed a voice has here and there been heard depreciating his betterknown namesake francis3 so that the later luminary should not standing in the way obscure the light of the earlier though for my part i would suggest that one need not be so oneeyed as to fail to see both lights at once 2 see roger bacon essays contributed by various writers on the occasion of the commemoration of the seventh centenary of his birth collected and edited by a g little 1914 also sir j e sandys roger bacon from the proceedings of the british association vol vi 1914 3 for example that of ernst duhring see an article entitled the two bacons translated from his kritische geschichte der philosophie in the open court for august 1914 to those who like to observe coincidences it may be of interest that the septcentenary of the discoverer of gunpowder should have coincided with the outbreak of the greatest war under which the world has yet groaned even though gunpowder is no longer employed as a military propellant bacons reference to gunpowder occurs in his epistola de secretis operibus artis et naturae et de nullitate magiae hamburg 1618 a little tract written against magic in which he endeavours to show and succeeds very well in the first eight chapters that nature and art can perform far more extraordinary feats than are claimed by the workers in the black art the last three chapters are written in an alchemical jargon of which even one versed in the symbolic language of alchemy can make no sense they are evidently cryptogramic and probably deal with the preparation and purification of saltpetre which had only recently been discovered as a distinct body1 in chapter xi there is reference to an explosive body which can only be gunpowder by means of it says bacon you may if you know the trick produce a bright flash and a thundering noise he mentions two of the ingredients saltpetre and sulphur but conceals the third ie charcoal under an anagram claims have indeed been put forth for the greek arab hindu and chinese origins of gunpowder but a close examination of the original ancient accounts purporting to contain references to gunpowder shows that only incendiary and not explosive bodies are really dealt with but whilst roger bacon knew of the explosive property of a mixture in right proportions of sulphur charcoal and pure saltpetre which he no doubt accidentally hit upon whilst experimenting with the lastnamed body he was unaware of its projective power that discovery so detrimental to the happiness of man ever since was in all probability due to berthold schwarz about 1330 1 for an attempted explanation of this cryptogram and evidence that bacon was the discoverer of gunpowder see lieutcol h w l himes gunpowder and ammunition their origin and progress 1904 roger bacon has been credited1 with many other discoveries in the work already referred to he allows his imagination freely to speculate as to the wonders that might be accomplished by a scientific utilisation of natures forcesmarvellous things with lenses in bringing distant objects near and so forth carriages propelled by mechanical means flying machinesbut in no case is the word discovery in any sense applicable for not even in the case of the telescope does bacon describe means by which his speculations might be realised 1 for instance by mr m m p muir see his contribution on roger bacon his relations to alchemy and chemistry to roger bacon essays on the other hand roger bacon has often been maligned for his beliefs in astrology and alchemy but as the late dr bridges who was quite sceptical of the claims of both pointed out not to have believed in them in bacons day would have been rather an evidence of mental weakness than otherwise what relevant facts were known supported alchemical and astrological hypotheses astrology dr bridges writes conformed to the first law of comtes philosophia prima as being the best hypothesis of which ascertained phenomena admitted1 and in his alchemical speculations bacon was much in advance of his contemporaries and stated problems which are amongst those of modern chemistry 1 op cit p84 roger bacons greatness does not lie in the fact that he discovered gunpowder nor in the further fact that his speculations have been validated by other men his greatness lies in his secure grip of scientific method as a combination of mathematical reasoning and experiment men before him had experimented but none seemed to have realised the importance of the experimental method nor was he of course by any means the first mathematicianthere was a long line of greek and arabian mathematicians behind him men whose knowledge of the science was in many cases much greater than hisor the most learned mathematician of his day but none realised the importance of mathematics as an organon of scientific research as he did and he was assuredly the priest who joined mathematics to experiment in the bonds of sacred matrimony we must not indeed look for precise rules of inductive reasoning in the works of this pioneer writer on scientific method nor do we find really satisfactory rules of induction even in the works of francis bacon moreover the latter despised mathematics and it was not until in quite recent years that the scientific world came to realise that rogers method is the more fruitfulwitness the modern revolution in chemistry produced by the adoption of mathematical methods roger bacon it may be said was many centuries in advance of his time but it is equally true that he was the child of his time this may account for his defects judged by modern standards he owed not a little to his contemporaries for his knowledge and high estimate of philosophy he was largely indebted to his oxford master grosseteste c 11751253 whilst peter peregrinus his friend at paris fostered his love of experiment and the arab mathematicians whose works he knew inclined his mind to mathematical studies he was violently opposed to the scholastic views current in paris at his time and attacked great thinkers like thomas aquinas c 12251274 and albertus magnus 11931280 as well as obscurantists such as alexander of hales ob 1245 but he himself was a scholastic philosopher though of no servile type taking part in scholastic arguments if he declared that he would have all the works of aristotle burned it was not because he hated the peripatetics philosophythough he could criticise as well as appreciate at timesbut because of the rottenness of the translations that were then used it seems commonplace now but it was a truly wonderful thing then roger bacon believed in accuracy and was by no means destitute of literary ethics he believed in correct translation correct quotation and the acknowledgment of the sources of ones quotationsunheardof things almost in those days but even he was not free from all the vices of his age in spite of his insistence upon experimental verification of the conclusions of deductive reasoning in one place at least he adopts a view concerning lenses from another writer of which the simplest attempt at such verification would have revealed the falsity for such lapses however we can make allowances another and undeniable claim to greatness rests on roger bacons broadmindedness he could actually value at their true worth the moral philosophies of nonchristian writersseneca c 5 bcad 65 and al ghazzali 10581111 for instance but if he was catholic in the original meaning of that term he was also catholic in its restricted sense he was no heretic the pope for him was the vicar of christ whom he wished to see reign over the whole world not by force of arms but by the assimilation of all that was worthy in that world to his mindand here he was certainly a child of his age in its best sense perhapsall other sciences were handmaidens to theology queen of them all all were to be subservient to her aims the church he called catholic was to embrace in her arms all that was worthy in the works of profane writerstrue prophets of god he held in so far as writing worthily they unconsciously bore testimony to the truth of christianityand all that nature might yield by patient experiment and speculation guided by mathematics some minds see in this a defect in his system which limited his aims and outlook others see it as the unifying principle giving coherence to the whole at any rate the church as we have seen regarded his views as dangerous and restrained his pen for at least a considerable portion of his life roger bacon may seem egotistic in argument but his mind was humble to learn he was not superstitious but he would listen to common folk who worked with their hands to astrologers and even magicians denying nothing which seemed to him to have some evidence in experience if he denied much of magical belief it was because he found it lacking in such evidence he often went astray in his views he sometimes failed to apply his own method and that method was in any case primitive and crude but it was the right method in embryo at least and roger bacon in spite of tremendous opposition greater than that under which any man of science may now suffer persisted in that method to the end calling upon his contemporaries to adopt it as the only one which results in right knowledge across the centuriesor rather across the gulf that divides this world from the nextlet us salute this great and noble spirit xii the cambridge platonists there is an opinion unfortunately very common that religious mysticism is a product of the emotional temperament and is diametrically opposed to the spirit of rationalism no doubt this opinion is not without some element of justification and one could quote the works of not a few religious mystics to the effect that selfsurrender to god implies not merely a giving up of will but also of reason but that this teaching is not an essential element in mysticism that it is indeed rather its perversion there is adequate evidence to demonstrate swedenborg is i suppose the outstanding instance of an intellectual mystic but the essential unity of mysticism and rationalism is almost as forcibly made evident in the case of the cambridge platonists that little band of latitude men as their contemporaries called them constitutes one of the finest schools of philosophy that england has produced yet their works are rarely read i am afraid save by specialists possibly however if it were more commonly known what a wealth of sound philosophy and true spiritual teaching they contain the case would be otherwise the cambridge platonistsbenjamin whichcote john smith nathanael culverwel ralph cudworth and henry more are the more outstanding nameswere educated as puritans but they clearly realised the fundamental error of puritanism which tended to make a mans eternal salvation depend upon the accuracy and extent of his beliefs nor could they approve of the exaggerated import given by the high church party to matters of church polity the term cambridge platonists is perhaps less appropriate than that of latitudinarians which latter name emphasises their broadmindedness even if it carries with it something of disapproval for although they owed much to ptato and perhaps more to plotinus c ad 203262 they were christians first and platonists afterwards and with the exception perhaps of more they took nothing from these philosophers which was not conformable to the scriptures benjamin whichcote was born in 1609 at whichcote hall in the parish of stoke shropshire in 1626 he entered emmanuel college cambridge then regarded as the chief puritan college of the university here his college tutor was anthony tuckney 15991670 a man of rare character combining learning wit and piety between whichcote and tuckney there grew up a firm friendship founded on mutual affection and esteem but tuckney was unable to agree with all whichcotes broadminded views concerning reason and authority and in later years this gave rise to a controversy between them in which tuckney sought to controvert whichcotes opinions it was however carried on without acrimony and did not destroy their friendship whichcote became ma and was elected a fellow of his college in 1633 having obtained his ba four years previously he was ordained by john williams in 1636 and received the important appointment of sunday afternoon lecturer at trinity church his lectures which he gave with the object of turning mens minds from polemics to the great moral and spiritual realities at the basis of the christian religion from mere formal discussions to a true searching into the reason of things were well attended and highly appreciated and he held the appointment for twenty years in 1634 he became college tutor at emmanuel he possessed all the characteristics that go to make up an efficient and wellbeloved tutor and his personal influence was such as to inspire all his pupils amongst whom were both john smith and nathanael culverwel who considerably amplified his philosophical and religious doctrines in 1640 he became bd and nine years after was created dd the college living of north cadbury in somerset was presented to him in 1643 and shortly afterwards he married in the next year however he was recalled to cambridge and installed as provost of kings college in place of the ejected dr samuel collins but it was greatly against his wish that he received the appointment and he only consented to do so on the condition that part of his stipend should be paid to collinsan act which gives us a good insight into the character of the man in 1650 he resigned north cadbury and the living was presented to cudworth see below and towards the end of this year he was elected vicechancellor of the university in succession to tuckney it was during his vicechancellorship that he preached the sermon that gave rise to the controversy with the latter about this time also he was presented with the living of milton in cambridgeshire at the restoration he was ejected from the provostship but having complied with the act of uniformity he was in 1662 appointed to the cure of st annes blackfriars this church being destroyed in the great fire whichcote retired to milton where he showed great kindness to the poor but some years later he returned to london having received the vicarage of st lawrence jewry his friends at cambridge however still saw him on occasional visits and it was on one such visit to cudworth in 1683 that he caught the cold which caused his death john smith was born at achurch near oundle in 1618 he entered emmanuel college in 1636 became ba in 1640 and proceeded to ma in 1644 in which year he was appointed a fellow of queens college here he lectured on arithmetic with considerable success he was noted for his great learning especially in theology and oriental languages as well as for his justness uprightness and humility he died of consumption in 1652 nathanael culverwel was probably born about the same year as smith he entered emmanuel college in 1633 gained his ba in 1636 and became ma in 1640 soon afterwards he was elected a fellow of his college he died about 1651 beyond these scant details nothing is known of his life he was a man of very great erudition as his posthumous treatise on the light of nature makes evident henry more was born at grantham in 1614 from his earliest days he was interested in theological problems and his precociousness in this respect appears to have brought down on him the wrath of an uncle his early education was conducted at eton in 1631 he entered christs college cambridge graduated ba in 1635 and received his ma in 1639 in the latter year he was elected a fellow of christs and received holy orders he lived a very retired life refusing all preferment though many valuable and honourable appointments were offered to him indeed he rarely left christs except to visit his heroine pupil lady conway whose country seat ragley was in warwickshire lady conway ob 1679 appears to be remembered only for the fact that dying whilst her husband was away her physician f m van helmont 16181699 son of the famous alchemist j b van helmont whom we have met already on these excursions preserved her body in spirits of wine so that he could have the pleasure of beholding it on his return she seems to have been a woman of considerable learning though not free from fantastic ideas her ultimate conversion to quakerism was a severe blow to more who whilst admiring the holy lives of the friends regarded them as enthusiasts more died in 1687 mores earliest works were in verse and exhibit fine feeling the following lines quoted from a poem on charitie and humilitie are full of charm and well exhibit mores character farre have i clambred in my mind but nought so great as love i find deepsearching wit mountmoving might are nought compard to that great spright life of delight and

annexed divers philosophical poems and hymns edited by m f howard 1911 pp 250 and 251 later he took to prose and it must be confessed that he wrote too much and frequently descended to polemics for example his controversy with the alchemist thomas vaughan in which both combatants freely used abuse although in his main views more is thoroughly characteristic of the school to which he belonged many of his less important opinions are more or less peculiar to himself the relation between mores and descartes 15961650 theories as to the nature of spirit is interesting when more first read descartes works he was favourably impressed with his views though without entirely agreeing with him on all points but later the difference became accentuated descartes regarded extension as the chief characteristic of matter and asserted that spirit was extraspatial to more this seemed like denying the existence of spirit which he regarded as extended and he postulated divisibility and impenetrability as the chief characteristics of matter in order however to get over some of the inherent difficulties of this view he put forward the suggestion that spirit is extended in four dimensions thus its apparent ie threedimensional extension can change whilst its true ie fourdimensional extension remains constant just as the surface of a piece of metal can be increased by hammering it out without increasing the volume of the metal here i think we have a not wholly inadequate symbol of the truth but it remained for berkeley 16851753 to show position by demonstrating that since space and extension are perceptions of the mind and thus exist only in the mind as ideas space exists in spirit not spirit in space more was a keen believer in witchcraft and eagerly investigated all cases of these and like marvels that came under his notice in this he was largely influenced by joseph glanvil 16361680 whose book on witchcraft the wellknown saducismus triumphatus more largely contributed to and probably edited more was wholly unsuited for psychical research free from guile himself he was too inclined to judge others to be of this nature also but his common sense and critical attitude towards enthusiasm saved him no doubt from many falls into the mire of fantasy as principal tulloch has pointed out whilst more is the most interesting personality amongst the cambridge platonists his works are the least interesting of those of his school they are dull and scholastic and mores retired existence prevented him from grasping in their fulness some of the more acute problems of life his attempt to harmonise catastrophes with providence on the ground that the evil of certain parts may be necessary for the good of the whole just as dark colours as well as bright are essential to the beauty of a picturea theory which is practically the same as that of modern absolutism1is a case in point no doubt this harmony may be accomplished but in another key 1 cf bernard bosanquet lld dcl the principle of individuality and value 1912 ralph cudworth was born at aller in somersetshire in 1617 he entered emmanuel college in 1632 three years afterwards gained his ba and became ma in 1639 in the latter year he was elected a fellow of his college later he obtained the bd degree in 1645 he was appointed master of clare hall in place of the ejected dr pashe and was elected regius professor of hebrew on 31st march 1647 he preached a sermon of remarkable eloquence and power before the house of commons which admirably expresses the attitude of his school as concerns the nature of true religion i shall refer to it again later in 1650 cudworth was presented with the college living of north cadbury which whichcote had resigned and was made dd in the following year in 1654 he was elected master of christs college with an improvement in his financial position there having been some difficulty in obtaining his stipend at clare hall in this year he married in 1662 bishop sheldon presented him with the rectory of ashwell in hertfordshire he died in 1688 he was a pious man of fine intellect but his character was marred by a certain suspiciousness which caused him wrongfully to accuse more in 1665 of attempting to forestall him in writing a work on ethics which should demonstrate that the principles of christian morality are not based on any arbitrary decrees of god but are inherent in the nature and reason of things cudworths great workor at least the first part which alone was completedthe intellectual system of the world appeared in 1678 in it cudworth deals with atheism on the ground of reason demonstrating its irrationality the book is remarkable for the fairness and fulness with which cudworth states the arguments in favour of atheism so much for the lives and individual characteristics of the cambridge platonists what were the great principles that animated both their lives and their philosophy these i think were two first the essential unity of religion and morality second the essential unity of revelation and reason with clearer perception of ethical truth than either puritan or high churchman the cambridge platonists saw that true christianity is neither a matter of mere belief nor consists in the mere performance of good works but is rather a matter of character to them christianity connoted regeneration religion says whichcote is the frame and temper of our minds and the rule of our lives and again heaven is first a temper and then a place1 to the man of heavenly temper they taught the performance of good works would be no irksome matter imposed merely by a sense of duty but would be done spontaneously as a delight to drudge in religion may very well be necessary as an initial stage but it is not its perfection 1 my quotations from whichcote and smith are taken from the selection of their discourses edited by e t campagnac ma 1901 in his sermon before the house of commons cudworth well exposes the error of those who made the mere holding of certain beliefs the essential element in christianity there are many passages i should like to quote from this eloquent discourse but the following must suffice we must not judge of our knowing of christ by our skill in books and papers but by our keeping of his commandments he is the best christian whose heart beats with the truest pulse towards heaven not he whose head spinneth out the finest cobwebs he that endeavours really to mortifie his lusts and to comply with that truth in his life which his conscience is convinced of is neerer a christian though he never heard of christ then he that believes all the vulgar articles of the christian faith and plainly denyeth christ in his life the great mysterie of the gospel it doth not lie only in christ without us though we must know also what he hath done for us but the very pith and kernel of it consists in christ inwardly formed in our hearts nothing is truly ours but what lives in our spirits salvation it self cannot save us as long as it is onely without us no more then health can cure us and make us sound when it is not within us but somewhere at distance from us no more than arts and sciences whilst they lie onely in books and papers without us can make us learned1 1 ralph cudworth bd a sermon preached before the honourable house of commons at westminster mar 31 1647 1st edn pp 3 14 42 and 43 the cambridge platonists were not ascetics their moral doctrine was one of temperance their sound wisdom on this point is well evident in the following passage from whichcote what can be alledged for intemperance since nature is content with very few things why should any one overdo in this kind a man is better in health and strength if he be temperate we enjoy ourselves more in a sober and temperate use of ourselves2 2 benjamin whichcote the venerable nature and transcendant benefit of christian religion op cit p 40 the other great principle animating their philosophy was as i have said the essential unity of reason and revelation to those who argued that selfsurrender implied a giving up of reason they replied that to go against reason is to go against god it is the self same thing to do that which the reason of the case doth require and that which god himself doth appoint reason is the divine governor of mans life it is the very voice of god3 reason conscience and the scriptures these taught the cambridge platonists testify of one another and are the true guides which alone a man should follow all other authority they repudiated but true reason is not merely sensuous and the only way whereby it may be gained is by the purification of the self from the desires that draw it away from the source of all reason god writes more reserves his choicest secrets for the purest minds adding his conviction that true holiness is the only safe entrance into divine knowledge or as smith who speaks of a good life as the prolepsis and fundamental principle of divine science puts it if knowledge be not attended with humility and a deep sense of selfpenury and selfemptiness we may easily fall short of that true knowledge of god which we seem to aspire after1b right reason however they taught is the product of the sight of the soul the true mystic vision 3 benjamin whichcote moral and religious aphorisms op cit p 67 1b john smith a discourse concerning the true way or method of attaining to divine knowledge op cit pp 80 and 96 in what respects it may be asked in conclusion is the philosophy of the cambridge platonists open to criticism they lacked perhaps a sufficiently clear concept of the church as a unity and although they clearly realised that nature is a symbol which it is the function of reason to interpret spiritually they failed i think to appreciate the value of symbols thus they have little to teach with respect to the sacraments of the church though indeed the highest view perhaps is that which regards every act as potentially a sacrament and whilst admiring his morality they criticised boehme as an enthusiast but although he spoke in a very different language spiritually he had much in common with them compared with what is of positive value in their philosophy however the defects of the cambridge platonists are but comparatively slight i commend their works to lovers of spiritual wisdom end of the project
