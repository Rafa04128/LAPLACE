either in design or execution in the science of farm buildings he claims no better knowledge than a long practical observation has given him the thoughts herein submitted for the consideration of those interested in the subject of farm buildings are the result of that observation added to his experience in the use of such buildings and a conviction of the inconveniences attending many of those

work owes its appearance to the absence of any cheap and popular book on the subject of rural architecture exclusively intended for the farming or agricultural interest of the united states why it is that nothing of the kind has been heretofore attempted for the chief benefit of so large and important a class of our community as our farmers comprise is not easy to say unless it be that they themselves have indicated but little wish for instruction in a branch of domestic economy which is in reality one of great importance not only to their domestic enjoyment but their pecuniary welfare it is too perhaps among the category of neglects and in the lack of fidelity to their own interests which pervades the agricultural community of this country beyond those of any other professionfor we insist that agriculture in its true and extended sense is as much a profession as any other pursuit whatever to the reality of such neglects they have but of late awaked and indeed are now far too slowly wheeling into line for more active progress in the knowledge pertaining to their own advancement as an accessory to their labors in such advancement the present work is intended it is an opinion far too prevalent among those engaged in the more active occupations of our peoplefortified indeed in such opinion by the too frequent example of the farmer himselfthat everything connected with agriculture and agricultural life is of a rustic and uncouth character that it is a profession in which ignorance as they understand the term is entirely consistent and one with which no aspirations of a high or an elevated character should or at least need be connected it is a reflection upon the integrity of the great agricultural interest of the country that any such opinion should prevail and discreditable to that interest that its condition or example should for a moment justify or even tolerate it without going into any extended course of remark we shall find ample reason for the indifference which has prevailed among our rural population on the subject of their own domestic architecture in the absence of familiar and practical works on the subject by such as have given any considerable degree of thought to it and what little thought has been devoted to this branch of building has been incidentally rather than directly thrown off by those professionally engaged in the finer architectural studies appertaining to luxury and taste instead of the everyday wants of a strictly agricultural population and of consequence understanding but imperfectly the wants and conveniences of the farm house in its connection with the everyday labors and necessities of farm life it is not intended in these remarks to depreciate the efforts of those who have attempted to instruct our farmers in this interesting branch of agricultural economy we owe them a debt of gratitude for what they have accomplished in the introduction of their designs to our notice and when it is remarked that they are insufficient for the purposes intended it may be also taken as an admission of our own neglect that we have so far disregarded the subject ourselves as to force upon others the duty of essaying to instruct us in a work of which we ourselves should long ago have been the masters why should a farmer because he is a farmer only occupy an uncouth outlandish house any more than a professional man a merchant or a mechanic is it because he himself is so uncouth and outlandish in his thoughts and manners that he deserves no better is it because his occupation is degrading his intellect ignorant his position in life low and his associations debasing surely not yet in many of the plans and designs got up for his accommodation in the books and publications of the day all due convenience to say nothing of the respectability or the elegance of domestic life is as entirely disregarded as if such qualities had no connection with the farmer or his occupation we hold that although many of the practical operations of the farm may be rough laborious and untidy yet they are not and need not be inconsistent with the knowledge and practice of neatness order and even elegance and refinement within doors and that the due accommodation of the various things appertaining to farm stock farm labor and farm life should have a tendency to elevate the social position the associations thoughts and entire condition of the farmer as the man himselfno matter what his occupationbe lodged and fed so influenced in a degree will be his practice in the daily duties of his life a squalid miserable tenement with which they who inhabit it are content can lead to no elevation of character no improvement in condition either social or moral of its occupants but the family comfortably and tidily although humbly provided in their habitation and domestic arrangements have usually a corresponding character in their personal relations a log cabin evenand i speak of this primitive american structure with profound affection and regard as the shelter from which we have achieved the most of our prodigious and rapid agricultural conquestsmay be so constructed as to speak an air of neatness intelligence and even refinement in those who inhabit it admitting then without further argument that well conditioned household accommodations are as important to the farmer even to the indulgence of luxury itself when it can be afforded as for those who occupy other and more active pursuits it is quite important that he be equally well instructed in the art of planning and arranging these accommodations and in designing also the various other structures which are necessary to his wants in their fullest extent as a question of economy both in saving and accumulating good and sufficient buildings are of the first consequence in a pecuniary light and when to this are added other considerations touching our social enjoyment our advancement in temporal condition our associations our position and influence in life and not least the decided item of national good taste which the introduction of good buildings throughout our extended agricultural country will give we find abundant cause for effort in improvement it is not intended in our remarks to convey the impression that we americans as a people are destitute of comfortable and in many cases quite convenient household and farm arrangements numerous farmeries in every section of the united states particularly in the older ones demonstrate most fully that where our farmers have taken the trouble to think on the subject their ingenuity has been equal in the items of convenient and economical arrangement of their dwellings and outbuildings to their demands but we are forced to say that such buildings have been executed in most cases with great neglect of architectural system taste or effect and in many instances to the utter violation of all propriety in appearance or character as appertaining to the uses for which they are applied the character of the farm should be carried out so as to express itself in everything which it contains all should bear a consistent relation with each other the former himself is a plain man his family are plain people although none the less worthy useful or exalted on that account his structures of every kind should be plain also yet substantial where substance is required all these detract nothing from his respectability or his influence in the neighborhood the town the county or the state a farmer has quite as much business in the field or about his ordinary occupations with ragged garments out at elbows and a crownless hat as he has to occupy a leaky windbroken and dilapidated house neither is he any nearer the mark with a ruffled shirt a fancy dress or gloved hands when following his plough behind a pair of fancy horses than in living in a finical pretending house such as we see stuck up in conspicuous places in many parts of the country all these are out of place in each extreme and the one is as absurd so far as true propriety is concerned as the other a fitness of things or a correspondence of one thing with another should always be preserved upon the farm as elsewhere and there is not a single reason why propriety and good keeping should not as well distinguish it nor is there any good cause why the farmer himself should not be a man of taste in the arrangement and architecture of every building on his place as well as other men it is only necessary that he devote a little time to study in order to give his mind a right direction in all that appertains to this department or if he prefer to employ the ingenuity of others to do his planningwhich by the way is in most cases the more natural and better coursehe certainly should possess sufficient judgment to see that such plans be correct and will answer his purposes the plans and directions submitted in this work are intended to be of the most practical kind plain substantial and applicable throughout to the purposes intended and such as are within the reacheach in their kindof every farmer in our country these plans are chiefly original that is they are not copied from any in the books or from any structures with which the writer is familiar yet they will doubtless on examination be found in several cases to resemble buildings both in outward appearance and interior arrangement with which numerous readers may be acquainted the object in addition to our own designs has been to apply practical hints gathered from other structures in use which have seemed appropriate for a work of the limited extent here offered and that may serve to improve the taste of all such as in building useful structures desire to embellish their farms and estates in an agreeable style of home architecture at once pleasant to the eye and convenient in their arrangement introductory the lover of country life who looks upon rural objects in the true spirit and for the first time surveys the cultivated portions of the united states will be struck with the incongruous appearance and style of our farm houses and their contiguous buildings and although on examination he will find many that in their interior accommodation and perhaps relative arrangement to each other are tolerably suited to the business and convenience of the husbandman still the feeling will prevail that there is an absence of method congruity and correct taste in the architectural structure of his buildings generally by the american farmer we may in truth be said to have no architecture at all as exhibited in our agricultural districts so far as any correct system or plan is concerned as the better taste in building which a few years past has introduced among us has been chiefly confined to our cities and towns of rapid growth even in the comparatively few buildings in the modern style to be seen in our farming districts from the various requirements of those buildings being partially unknown to the architect and builder who had their planningand upon whom owing to their own inexperience in such matters their employers have relieda majority of such dwellings have turned out if not absolute failures certainly not what the necessities of the farmer has demanded consequently save in the mere item of outward appearanceand that not alwaysthe farmer and cottager have gained nothing owing to the absurdity in style or arrangement and want of fitness to circumstances adopted for the occasion we have stated that our prevailing rural architecture is discordant in appearance it may be added that it is also uncouth out of keeping with correct rules and ofttimes offensive to the eye of any lover of rural harmony why it is so no matter beyond the apology already giventhat of an absence of cultivation and thought upon the subject it may be asked of what consequence is it that the farmer or small propertyholder should conform to given rules or mode in the style and arrangement of his dwelling or outbuildings so that they be reasonably convenient and answer his purposes for the same reason that he requires symmetry excellence of form or style in his horses his cattle or other farm stock household furniture or personal dress it is an arrangement of artificial objects in harmony with natural objects a cultivation of the sympathies which every rational being should have more or less with true taste that costs little or nothing in the attainment and when attained is a source of gratification through life every human being is bound under ordinary circumstances to leave the world somewhat better so far as his own acts or exertions are concerned than he found it in the exercise of such faculties as have been given him such duty among thinking men is conceded so far as the moral world is concerned and why not in the artificial so far as the influence for good goes in all practical use from the building of a temple to the knocking together of a pigstyea labor of years or the work of a daythe exercise of a correct taste is important in a degree in the available physical features of a country no land upon earth exceeds north america from scenery the most sublime through the several gradations of magnificence and grandeur down to the simply picturesque and beautiful in all variety and shade in compass vast or in area limited we have an endless variety and with a pouring out of gods harmonies in the creation without a parallel inviting every intelligent mind to study their features and character in adapting them to his own uses and in so doing to even embellishif such a thing be possiblesuch exquisite objects with his own most ingenious handiwork indeed it is a profanation to do otherwise and when so to improve them requires no extraordinary application of skill or any extravagant outlay in expense not to plan and to build in conformity with good taste is an absolute barbarism inexcusable in a land like ours and among a population claiming the intelligence we do or making but a share of the general progress which we exhibit it is the idea of some that a house or building which the farmer or planter occupies should in shape style and character be like some of the storedup commodities of his farm or plantation we cannot subscribe to this suggestion we know of no good reason why the walls of a farm house should appear like a hay rick or its roof like the thatched covering to his wheat stacks because such are the shapes best adapted to preserve his crops any more than the grocers habitation should be made to imitate a tea chest or the shipping merchants a rum puncheon or cotton bale we have an idea that the farmer or the planter according to his means and requirements should be as well housed and accommodated and in as agreeable style too as any other class of community not in like character in all things to be sure but in his own proper way and manner nor do we know why a farm house should assume a peculiarly primitive or uncultivated style of architecture from other sensible houses that it be a farm house is sufficiently apparent from its locality upon the farm itself that its interior arrangement be for the convenience of the indoor farm work and the proper accommodation of the farmers family should be quite as apparent but that it should assume an uncouth or clownish aspect is as unnecessary as that the farmer himself should be a boor in his manners or a dolt in his intellect the farm in its proper cultivation is the foundation of all human prosperity and from it is derived the main wealth of the community from the farm chiefly springs that energetic class of men who replace the enervated and physically decaying multitude continually thrown off in the wasteweir of our great commercial and manufacturing cities and towns whose population without the infusionand that continuallyof the strong substantial and vigorous life blood of the country would soon dwindle into insignificance and decrepitude why then should not this first primitive healthenjoying and lifesustaining class of our people be equally accommodated in all that gives to social and substantial life its due development it is absurd to deny them by others or that they deny themselves the least of such advantages or that any mark of caste be attempted to separate them from any other class or profession of equal wealth means or necessity it is quite as well to say that the farmer should worship on the sabbath in a meetinghouse built after the fashion of his barn or that his district school house should look like a stable as that his dwelling should not exhibit all that cheerfulness and respectability in form and feature which belongs to the houses of any class of our population whatever not that the farm house should be like the town or the village house in character style or architecture but that it should in its own proper character express all the comfort repose and quietude which belong to the retired and thoughtful occupation of him who inhabits it sheltered in its own secluded yet independent domain with a cheerful intelligent exterior it should exhibit all the painstaking in home embellishment and rural decoration that becomes its position and which would make it an object of attraction and regard rural architecture general suggestions in ascertaining what is desirable to the conveniences or the necessities in our household arrangement it may be not unprofitable to look about us and consider somewhat the existing condition of the structures too many of us now inhabit and which in the light of true fitness for the objects designed are inconvenient absurd and out of all harmony of purpose yet under the guidance of a better skill and a moderate outlay might be well adapted in most cases to our convenience and comfort and quite well to a reasonable standard of taste in architectural appearance at the thresholdnot of the house but of this treatiseit may be well to remark that it is not here assumed that there has been neither skill ingenuity nor occasional good taste exhibited for many generations back in the united states in the construction of farm and country houses on the contrary there are found in the older states many farm and country houses that are almost models in their way for convenience in the main purposes required of structures of their kind and such as can hardly be altered for the better such however form the exception not the rule yet instead of standing as objects for imitation they have been ruled out as antiquated and unfit for modern builders to consult who have in the introduction of some real improvements also left out or discarded much that is valuable and where true comfort is concerned indispensable to perfect housekeeping alteration is not always improvement and in the rage for innovation of all kinds among much that is valuable a great deal in housebuilding has been introduced that is absolutely pernicious take for instance some of our ancientlooking country houses of the last century which in america we call old see their ample dimensions their heavy massive walls their low comfortable ceilings their high gables sharp roofs deep porches and spreading eaves and contrast them with the ambitious tall proportionless and cardsided things of a modern date and draw the comparison in true comfort which the ancient mansion really affords by the side of the other bating its huge chimneys its wide fireplaces its heavy beams dropping below the ceiling overhead and the lack of some modern conveniences which to be added would give all that is desired and every man possessed of a proper judgment will concede the superiority to the house of the last century that american housebuilding of the last fifty years is out of joint requires no better proof than that the main improvements which have been applied to our rural architecture are in the english style of farm and country houses of two or three centuries ago so in that particular we acknowledge the better taste and judgment of our ancestors true modern luxury and in some particulars modern improvement has made obsolete if not absurd many things considered indispensable in a ruder age the wide rambling halls and rooms the huge deep fireplaces in the chimneys the proximity of outbuildings and the contiguity of stables ricks and cattleyardsall these are wisely contracted dispensed with or thrown off to a proper distance but instead of such style being abandoned altogether as has too often been done the house itself might better have been partially reformed and the interior arrangement adapted to modern convenience such changes have in some instances been made and when so how often does the old mansion with outward features in good preservation outspeak in all the expression of homebred comforts the flashy gimcrack neighbor which in its plenitude of modern pretension looks so flauntingly down upon it we cannot in the united states consistently adopt the domestic architecture of any other country throughout to our use we are different in our institutions our habits our agriculture our climates utility is our chief object and coupled with that the indulgence of an agreeable taste may be permitted to every one who creates a home for himself or founds one for his family the frequent changes of estates incident to our laws and the many inducements held out to our people to change their locality or residence in the hope of bettering their condition is a strong hindrance to the adoption of a universally correct system in the construction of our buildings deadening as the effect of such changes that home feeling which should be a prominent trait of agricultural character an attachment to locality is not a conspicuous trait of american character and if there be a people on earth boasting a high civilization and intelligence who are at the same time a roving race the americans are that people and we acknowledge it a blemish in our domestic and social constitution such remark is not dropped invidiously but as a reason why we have thus far made so little progress in the arts of home embellishment and in clustering about our habitations those innumerable attractions which win us to them sufficiently to repel the temptation so often presented to our enterprise our ambition or love of gainand these not always successfulin seeking other and distant places of abode if then this tendency to changea want of attachment to any one spotis a reason why we have been so indifferent to domestic architecture and if the study and practice of a better system of building tends to cultivate a home feeling why should it not be encouraged home attachment is a virtue therefore let that virtue be cherished and if any one study tend to exalt our taste and promote our enjoyment let us cultivate that study to the highest extent within our reach style of buildingmiscellaneous diversified as are the features of our country in climate soil surface and position no one style of rural architecture is properly adapted to the whole and it is a gratifying incident to the indulgence in a variety of taste that we possess the opportunity which we desire in its display to almost any extent in mode and effect the swiss chalt may hang in the mountain pass the pointed gothic may shoot up among the evergreens of the rugged hillside the italian roof with its overlooking campanile may command the wooded slope or the open plain or the quaint and shadowy style of the old english mansion embosomed in its vines and shrubbery may nestle in the quiet shaded valley all suited to their respective positions and each in harmony with the natural features by which it is surrounded nor does the effect which such structures give to the landscape in an ornamental point of view require that they be more imposing in character than the necessities of the occasion may demand true economy demands a structure sufficiently spacious to accommodate its occupants in the best manner so far as convenience and comfort are concerned in a dwelling and its conformity to just rules in architecture need not be additionally expensive or troublesome he who builds at all if it be anything beyond a rude or temporary shelter may as easily and cheaply build in accordance with correct rules of architecture as against such rules and it no more requires an extravagance in cost or a wasteful occupation of room to produce a given effect in a house suited to humble means than in one of profuse accommodation magnificence or the attempt at magnificence in building is the great fault with americans who aim to build out of the common line and the consequence of such attempt is too often a failure apparent always at a glance and of course a perfect condemnation in itself of the judgment as well as taste of him who undertakes it holding our tenures as we do with no privilege of entail to our posterity an eye to his own interest or to that of his family who is to succeed to his estate should admonish the builder of a house to the adoption of a plan which will in case of the sale of the estate involve no serious loss he should build such a house as will be no detriment in its expense to the selling value of the land on which it stands and always fitted for the spot it occupies hence an imitation of the high extended castellated mansions of england or the continent although in miniature are altogether unsuited to the american farmer or planter whose lands instead of increasing in his family are continually subject to division or to sale in mass on his own demise and when the estate is encumbered with unnecessarily large and expensive buildings they become an absolute drawback to its value in either event an expensive house requires a corresponding expense to maintain it otherwise its effect is lost and many a worthy owner of a costly mansion has been driven to sell and abandon his estate altogether from his unwillingness or inability to support the establishment which it entailed when if the dwelling were only such as the estate required and could reasonably maintain a contented and happy home would have remained to himself and family it behooves therefore the american builder to examine well his premises to ascertain the actual requirements of his farm or plantation in convenience and accommodation and build only to such extent and at such cost as shall not impoverish his means nor cause him future disquietude another difficulty with us is that we oftener build to gratify the eyes of the public than our own and fit up our dwellings to accommodate company or visitors rather than our own families and in the indulgence of this false notion subject ourselves to perpetual inconvenience for the gratification of occasional hospitality or ostentation this is all wrong a house should be planned and constructed for the use of the household with incidental accommodation for our immediate friends or guestswhich can always be done without sacrifice to the comfort or convenience of the regular inmates in this remark a stinted and parsimonious spirit is not suggested a liberal appropriation of rooms in every department a spare chamber or two or an additional room on the ground floor looking to a possible increase of family and the indulgence of an easy hospitality should always govern the resident of the country in erecting his dwelling the enjoyments of society and the intercourse of friends sharing for the time our own table and fireside is a crowning pleasure of country life and all this may be done without extraordinary expense in a wise construction of the dwelling the farm house too should comport in character and area with the extent and capacity of the farm itself and the main design for which it is erected to the farmer properhe who lives from the income which the farm producesit is important to know the extent of accommodation required for the economical management of his estate and then to build in accordance with it as well as to suit his own position in life and the station which he and his family hold in society the owner of a hundred acre farm living upon the income he receives from it will require less house room than he who tills equally well his farm of three six or ten hundred acres yet the numbers in their respective families the relative position of each in society or their taste for social intercourse may demand a larger or smaller household arrangement regardless of the size of their estates still the dwellings on each should bear in extent and expense a consistent relation to the land itself and the means of its owner for instance a farm of one hundred acres may safely and economically erect and maintain a house costing eight hundred to two thousand dollars while one of five hundred to a thousand acres may range in an expenditure of twentyfive hundred to five thousand dollars in its dwelling and all be consistent with a proper economy in farm management let it be understood that the above sums are named as simply comporting with a financial view of the subject and such as the economical management of the estate may warrant to one who has no regard to such consideration this rule of expenditure will not apply he may invest any amount he so chooses in building beyond if he only be content to pocket the loss which he can never expect to be returned in an increased value to the property over and above the price of cheaper buildings on the other hand he would do well to consider that a farm is frequently worth less to an ordinary purchaser with an extravagant house upon it than with an economical one and in many cases will bring even less in market in proportion as the dwelling is expensive fancy purchasers are few and fastidious while he who buys only for a home and an occupation is governed solely by the profitable returns the estate will afford upon the capital invested there is again a grand error which many fall into in building looking as they do only at the extent of wood and timber or stone and mortar in the structure and paying no attention to the surroundings which in most cases contribute more to the effect of the establishment than the structure itself and which if uncultivated or neglected any amount of expenditure in building will fail to give that completeness and perfection of character which every homestead should command thus the tawdry erections in imitation of a castoff feudalism in europe or a copying of the massive piles of more recent date abroad although in miniature both in extent and cost is the sheerest affectation in which no sensible man should ever indulge it is out of all keeping or propriety with other things as we in this country have them and the indulgence of all such fancies is sooner or later regretted substance convenience purpose harmonyall perhaps better summed up in the term expressionthese are the objects which should govern the construction of our dwellings and outbuildings and in their observance we can hardly err in the acquisition of what will promote the highest enjoyment which a dwelling can bestow position the site of a dwelling should be an important study with every country builder for on this depends much of its utility and in addition to that a large share of the enjoyment which its occupation will afford custom in many parts of the united states in the location of the farm buildings gives advantages which are denied in others in the south and in the slave states generally the planter builds regardless of roads on the most convenient site his plantation presents the farmer of german descent in pennsylvania and some other states does the same while the yankee be he settled where he will either in the east north or west inexorably huddles himself immediately upon the highway whether his possessions embrace both sides of it or not disregarding the facilities of access to his fields the convenience of tilling his crops or the character of the ground which his buildings may occupy seeming to have no other object than proximity to the roadas if his chief business was upon that instead of its being simply a convenience to his occupation to the last but little choice is left and so long as a close connection with the thoroughfare is to control he is obliged to conform to accident in what should be a matter of deliberate choice and judgment still there are right and wrong positions for a house which it is necessary to discuss regardless of conventional rules and they should be considered in the light of propriety alone a fitness to the purposes for which the dwelling is constructed should unquestionably be the governing point in determining its position the site should be dry and slightly declining if possible on every side but if the surface be level or where water occasionally flows from contiguous grounds or on a soil naturally damp it should be thoroughly drained of all superfluous moisture that is indispensable to the preservation of the house itself and the health of its inmates the house should so stand as to present an agreeable aspect from the main points at which it is seen or the thoroughfares by which it is approached it should be so arranged as to afford protection from wind and storm to that part most usually occupied as well as be easy of access to the outbuildings appended to it it should have an unmistakable front sides and rear and the uses to which its various parts are applied should distinctly appear in its outward character it should combine all the advantages of soil cultivation water shade and shelter which the most liberal gratification consistent with the circumstances of the owner may demand if a site on the estate command a prospect of singular beauty other things equal the dwelling should embrace it if the luxury of a stream or a sheet of water in repose present itself it should if possible be enjoyed if the shade and protection of a grove be near its benefits should be included in fine any object in itself desirable and not embarrassing to the main purposes of the dwelling and its appendages should be turned to the best account and appropriated in such manner as to combine all that is desirable both in beauty and effect as well as in utility to make up a perfect whole in the family residence attached to the building site should be considered the quality of the soil as affording cultivation and growth to shrubbery and treesat once the ornament most effective to all domestic buildings grateful to the eye always as objects of admiration and beautydelightful in the repose they offer in hours of lassitude or weariness and to them that indispensable feature in a perfect arrangement the garden both fruit and vegetable should be added happily for the american our soils are so universally adapted to the growth of vegetation in all its varieties that hardly a farm of considerable size can be found which does not afford tolerable facilities for the exercise of all the taste which one may indulge in the cultivation of the garden as well as in the planting and growth of trees and shrubbery and a due appropriation of these to an agreeable residence is equal in importance to the style and arrangement of the house itself the site selected for the dwelling and the character of the scenery and objects immediately surrounding it should have a controlling influence upon the style in which the house is to be constructed a fitness and harmony in all these is indispensable to both expression and effect and in their determination a single object should not control but the entire picture as completed should be embraced in the view and that style of building constituting the most agreeable whole as filling the eye with the most grateful sensations should be the one selected with which to fill up and complete the design home embellishments a discussion of the objects by way of embellishment which may be required to give character and effect to a country residence would embrace a range too wide in all its parts for a simply practical treatise like this and general hints on the subject are all indeed that will be required as no specific rules or directions can be given which would be applicable indiscriminately to guide the builder in the execution of his work a dwelling house no matter what the style standing alone either on hill or plain apart from other objects would hardly be an attractive sight as a mere representation of a particular style of architecture or as a model of imitation it might excite our admiration but it would not be an object on which the eye and the imagination could repose with satisfaction it would be incomplete unless accompanied by such associates as the eye is accustomed to embrace in the full gratification of the sensations to which that organ is the conductor but assemble around that dwelling subordinate structures trees and shrubbery properly disposed and it becomes an object of exceeding interest and pleasure in the contemplation it is therefore that the particular style or outward arrangement of the house is but a part of what should constitute the general effect and such style is to be consulted only so far as it may in itself please the taste and give benefit or utility in the purposes for which it is intended still the architectural design should be in harmony with the features of the surrounding scenery and is thus important in completing the effect sought and which cannot be accomplished without it a farm with its buildings or a simple country residence with the grounds which enclose it or a cottage with its dooryard and garden should be finished sections of the landscape of which it forms a part or attractive points within it and of consequence complete each within itself and not dependent upon distant accessories to support itan imperium in imperio in classic phrase a tower a monument a steeple or the indistinct outline of a distant town may form a striking feature in a pictorial design and the associations connected with them or the character in which they are contemplated may allow them to stand naked and unadorned by other objects and still permit them to fill up in perfect harmony the picture this idea will illustrate the importance of embellishment not only in the substitution of trees as necessary appendages to a complete rural establishment but in the erection of all the buildings necessary for occupation in any manner in form and position to give effect from any point of view in which the homestead may be seen general appearance should not be confined to one quarter alone but the house and its surroundings on every side should show completeness in design and harmony in execution and although humble and devoted to the meanest purposes a portion of these erections may be yet the character of utility or necessity which they maintain gives them an air of dignity if not of grace thus a house and outbuildings flanked with orchards or a wood on which they apparently fall back for support fills the eye at once with not only a beautiful group in themselves combined but associate the idea of repose of comfort and abundanceindispensable requisites to a perfect farm residence they also seem to connect the house and outbuildings with the fields beyond which are of necessity naked of trees and gradually spread the view abroad over the farm until it mingles with or is lost in the general landscape these remarks may seem too refined and as out of place here and trenching upon the subject of landscape gardening which is not designed to be a part or but an incidental one of the present work yet they are important in connection with the subject under discussion the proper disposition of trees and shrubbery around or in the vicinity of buildings is far too little understood although tree planting about our dwellings is a practice pretty general throughout our country nothing is more common than to see a man build a house perhaps in most elaborate and expensive style and then plant a row of trees close upon the front which when grown will shut it almost entirely out of view while he leaves the rear as bald and unprotected as if it were a barn or a horseshedas if in utter ignorance as he probably is that his house is more effectively set off by a flanking and background of tree and shrubbery than in front and this is called good taste let us examine it trees near a dwelling are desirable for shade shelter they do not afford except in masses which last is always better given to the house itself by a veranda immediately adjoining or within touching distance of a house trees create dampness more or less litter and frequently vermin they injure the walls and roofs by their continual shade and dampness they exclude the rays of the sun and prevent a free circulation of air therefore close to the house trees are absolutely pernicious to say nothing of excluding all its architectural effect from observation when if planted at proper distances they compose its finest ornaments if it be necessary to build in good taste at all it is quite as necessary that such good taste be kept in view throughout a country dwelling should always be a conspicuous object in its full character and outline from one or more prominent points of observation consequently all plantations of tree or shrubbery in its immediate vicinity should be considered as aids to show off the house and its appendages instead of becoming the principal objects of attraction in themselves their disposition should be such as to create a perfect and agreeable whole when seen in connection with the house itself they should also be so placed as to open the surrounding landscape to view in its most attractive features from the various parts of the dwelling much in the effective disposition of trees around the dwelling will thus depend upon the character of the country seen from it and which should control to a great extent their position a single tree of grand and stately dimensions will frequently give greater effect than the most studied plantations a ledge of rock in the clefts of which wild vines may nestle or around which a mass of shrubbery may cluster will add a charm to the dwelling which an elaborate cultivation would fail to bestow and the most negligent apparel of nature in a thousand ways may give a character which we might strive in vain to accomplish by our own invention in the efforts to embellish our dwellings or grounds the strong natural objects with which they are associated should be consulted always keeping in view an expression of the chief character to which the whole is applied material for farm buildings in a country like ours containing within its soils and upon its surface such an abundance and variety of building material the composition of our farm erections must depend in most cases upon the ability or the choice of the builder himself stone is the most durable in the long run the cheapest and as a consequence the best material which can be furnished for the walls of a dwelling with other farm buildings circumstances may govern differently still in many sections of the united states even stone cannot be obtained except at an expense and inconvenience altogether forbidding its use yet it is a happy relief that where stone is difficult or not at all to be obtained the best of clay for bricks is abundant and in almost all parts of our country even where building timber is scarce its transportation is so comparatively light and the facilities of removing it are so cheap that wood is accessible to every one hence we may indulge in almost every fitting style of architecture and arrangement to which either kind of these materials are best adapted we shall slightly discuss them as applicable to our purposes stone is found either on the surface or in quarries under ground on the surface they lie chiefly as bowlders of less or greater size usually of hard and durable kinds large bowlders may be either blasted or split with wedges into sufficiently available shapes to lay in walls with mortar or if small they may with a little extra labor be fitted by the aid of good mortar into equally substantial wall as the larger masses in quarries they are thrown out either by blasting or splitting in layers so as to form regular courses when laid up and all their varieties may unhammered except to strike off projecting points or angles be laid up with a sufficiently smooth face to give fine effect to a building thus when easily obtained aside from the greater advantages of their durability stone is as cheap in the first instance as lumber excepting in new districts of country where good building lumber is the chief article of production and cheaper than brick in any event stone requires no paint its color is a natural therefore an agreeable one be it usually what it may although some shades are more grateful to the eye than others yet it is always in harmony with natural objects and particularly so on the farm where everything ought to wear the most substantial appearance the outer walls of a stone house should always be firred off inside for lathing and plastering to keep them thoroughly dry without that the rooms are liable to dampness which would penetrate through the stone into the inside plastering unless cut off by an open space of air between bricks where stone is not found supply its place tolerably well when made of good clay rightly tempered with sand and well burned they will in a wall remain for centuries and as far as material is concerned answer all purposes brick walls may be thinner than stone walls but they equally require firring off for inside plastering and in addition they need the aid of paint quite as often as wood to give them an agreeable colorbricks themselves not usually being in the category of desirable colors or shades wood when abundant and easily obtained is worked with the greatest facility and on many accounts is the cheapest material for the time of which a building can be constructed but it is perishable it requires every few years a coat of paint and is always associated with the idea of decay yet wood may be moulded into an infinite variety of form to please the eye in the indulgence of any peculiar taste or fancy we cannot in the consideration of material for housebuilding therefore urge upon the farmer the adoption of either of the above named materials to the preference of another in any particular structure he may require but leave him to consult his own circumstances in regard to them as best he may but this we will say if it be possible never lay a cellar or underground wall of perishable material such as wood or soft bricks nor build with soft or unburnt bricks in a wall exposed to the weather anywhere nor with stone which is liable to crumble or disintegrate by the action of frost or water upon it we are aware that unburnt bricks have been strongly recommended for housebuilding in america but from observation we are fully persuaded that they are worthless for any permanent structure and if used will in the end prove a dead loss in their application cottages outbuildings and other cheap erections on the farm for the accommodation of laborers stock or crops may be made of wood where wood is the cheapest and most easily obtained and even taking its perishable nature into account it may be the most economical in their construction it may be simply a matter of calculation with him who needs them to calculate the first cost of any material he has at hand or may obtain and to that add the interest upon it the annual wear and tear the insurance and the period it may last to determine this matter to his entire satisfactionalways provided he have the means at hand to do either but other considerations generally control the american farmer his pocket is apt more often to be pinched than his choice is to be at fault and this weighty argument compels him into the make shift system which perhaps in its results provided the main chance be attained is quite as advantageous to his interests as the other as a general remark all buildings should show for themselves what they are built of let stone be stone bricks show on their own account and of all things put no counterfeit by way of plaster stucco or other false pretence other than paint or a durable wash upon wood it is a miserable affectation always and of no possible use whatever all counterfeit of any kind as little becomes the buildings of the farmer as the gilded pinchbeck watch would fit the finished attire of a gentleman before submitting the several designs proposed for this work it may be remarked that in addressing them to a climate strictly american we have in every instance adopted the wide steeplypitched roof with broad eaves gables and cornices as giving protection shade and shelter to the walls thus keeping them dry and in good preservation and giving that well housed and comfortable expression so different from the stiff pinched and tuckedup look in which so many of the haberdasherbuilt houses of the present day exult we give some examples of the hipped roof because they are convenient and cheap in their construction and we also throw into the designs a lateral direction to the roofs of the wings or connecting parts of the building this is sometimes done for effect in architectural appearance and sometimes for the economy and advantage of the building itself where roofs thus intersect or connect with a side wall the connecting gutters should be made of copper zinc lead galvanized iron or tin into which the shingles if they be covered with that material should be laid so as to effectually prevent leakage the eave gutters should be of copper zinc lead galvanized iron or tin also and placed at least one foot back from the edge of the roof and lead the water into conductors down the wall into the cistern or elsewhere as may be required if the water be not needed and the roof be wide over the walls there is no objection to let it pass off naturally if it be no inconvenience to the ground below and can run off or be absorbed into the ground without detriment to the cellar walls all this must be subject to the judgment of the proprietor himself outside color we are not among those who cast off and on a sudden condemn as out of all good taste the timehonored white house with its green blinds often so tastefully gleaming out from beneath the shade of summer trees nor do we doggedly adhere to it except when in keeping by contrast or otherwise with everything around it for a century past white has been the chief color of our wooden houses and often so of brick ones in the united states this color has been supposed to be strong and durable being composed chiefly of white lead and as it reflected the rays of the sun instead of absorbing them as some of the darker colors do it was thus considered a better preserver of the weatherboarding from the cracks which the fervid heat of the sun is apt to make upon it than the darker colors white consequently has always been considered until within a few years past as a fitting and tasteful color for dwellings both in town and country a new school of taste in colors has risen however within a few years past among us about the same time too that the recent gingerbread and beadwork style of country building was introduced and these were both as all new things are apt to be carried to extremes instead of toning down the glare of the white into some quiet neutral shade as a straw color a drab of different huesalways an agreeable and appropriate color for a dwelling particularly when the door and window casings are dressed with a deeper or lighter shade as those shades predominate in the main body of the house or a natural and soft wood color which also may be of various shades or even the warm russet hue of some of our rich stonesquite appropriate too as applied to wood or bricksthe fashion must be followed without either rhyme or reason and hundreds of our otherwise pretty and imposing country houses have been daubed over with the dirtiest gloomiest pigment imaginable making every habitation which it touched look more like a funeral appendage than a cheerful lifeenjoying home we candidly say that we have no sort of affection for such sooty daubs the fashion which dictates them is a barbarous false and arbitrary fashion void of all natural taste in its inception and to one who has a cheerful lifeloving spirit about him such colors have no more fitness on his dwelling or outbuildings than a tomb would have in his lawn or dooryard locality amplitude of the buildings the purpose to which they are appliedevery consideration connected with them in fact should be consulted as to color stone will give its own color which by the way some prodigiously smart folks paintquite as decorous or essential as to paint the lily brick sometimes must be painted but it should be of a color in keeping with its characterof substance and dignity not a counterfeit of stone or to cheat him who looks upon it into a belief that it may be marble or other unfounded pretension a warm russet is most appropriate for brickwork of any kind of colorthe color of a russet apple or undressed leathershades that comport with miltons beautiful idea of russet lawns and fallows gray red and yellow are both too glaring and slate or lead colors too somber and cold it is in fact a strong argument in favor of bricks in building where they can be had as cheap as stone or wood that any color can be given to them which the good taste of the builder may require in addition to their durability which when made of good material and properly burned is quite equal to stone in a wooden structure one may play with his fancy in the way of color minding in the operation that he does not play the mountebank and like the clown in the circus make his tattooed tenement the derision of men of correct taste as the other does his burlesque visage the ridicule of his auditors a wooden country house together with its outbuildings should always be of a cheerful and softlytoned colora color giving a feeling of warmth and comfort nothing glaring or flashy about it and yet such buildings should not in their color any more than in their architecture appear as if imitating either stone or brick wood of itself is light one cannot build a heavy house of wood as compared with brick or stone therefore all imitation or device which may lead to a belief that it may be other than what it really is is nothing less than a fraudnot criminal we admit but none the less a fraud upon good taste and architectural truth it is true that in this country we cannot afford to place in stone and brick buildings those ornate trimmings and appendages which perhaps if economy were not to be consulted might be more durably constructed of stone but at an expense too great to be borne by those of moderate means yet it is not essential that such appendages should be of so expensive material the very purposes to which they are applied as a parapet a railing a balustrade a portico piazza or porch all these may be of wood even when the material of the house proper is of the most durable kind and by being painted in keeping with the building itself produce a fine effect and do no violence to good taste or the most fastidious propriety they may be even sanded to a color and grained stained or otherwise brought to an identity almost with the material of the house and be quite proper because they simply are appendages of convenience necessity or luxury to the building itself and may be taken away without injuring or without defacing the main structure they are not a material part of the building itself but reared for purposes which may be dispensed with it is a matter of taste or preference that they were either built there or that they remain permanently afterward and of consequence proper that they be of wood yet they should not imitate stone or brick they should still show that they are of wood but in color and outside preservation denote that they are appendages to a stone or brick house by complying with the proper shades in color which predominate in the building itself and become their own subordinate character not being a professional painter or compounder of colors we shall offer no receipts or specifics for painting or washing buildings climate affects the composition of both paints and washes and those who are competent in this line are the proper persons to dictate their various compositions and we do but common justice to the skill and intelligence of our numerous mechanics when we recommend to those who contemplate building to apply forthwith to such as are masters of their trade for all the information they require on the various subjects connected with it one who sets out to be his own architect builder and painter is akin to the lawyer in the proverb who has a fool for his client when pleading his own case and quite as apt to have quack in them all hints general outlines and oftentimes matters of detail in interior convenience and many other minor affairs may be given by the proprietor when he is neither a professional architect mechanic or even an amateur but in all things affecting the substantial and important parts of his buildings he should consult those who are proficient and experienced in the department on which he consults them and it may perhaps be added that none professing to be such are competent unless well instructed and whose labors have met the approbation of those competent to judge there is one kind of color prevailing to a great extent in many parts of our country particularly the northern and eastern which in its effect upon any one having an eye to a fitness of things in country buildings is a monstrous perversion of good taste that is the glaring red made up of venetian red ochre or spanish brown with doors and windows touched off with white the only apology we have ever heard given for such a barbarism was that it is a good strong and lasting color we shall not go into an examination as to that fact but simply answer that if it be so there are other colors not more expensive which are equally strong and durable and infinitely more tasteful and fitting there can be nothing less comporting with the simplicity of rural scenery than a glaring red color on a building it connects with nothing natural about it it neither fades into any surrounding shade of soil or vegetation and must of necessity stand out in its own bold and unshrouded impudence a perfect ishmaelite in color and a perversion of every thing harmonious in the design we eschew red therefore from every thing in rural architecture a short chapter on taste the compound words or terms goodtaste and badtaste have been used in the preceding pages without perhaps sufficiently explaining what is meant by the word taste other than as giving vague and unsatisfactory terms to the reader in measuring the subject in hand taste is a term universally applied in criticism of the finearts such as painting sculpture architecture c c of which there are many schoolsof taste we meansome of them perhaps natural but chiefly conventional and all more or less arbitrary the proverb there is no accounting for taste is as old as the aforesaid schools themselves and defines perfectly our own estimate of the common usage of the term as we have intended to use it webster defines the word taste to be the faculty of discerning beauty order congruity proportion symmetry or whatever constitutes excellence style manner with respect to what is pleasing with this understanding therefore a fitness to the purpose for which a thing is intendedgot up in a manner agreeable to the eye and the mindpreserving also a harmony between its various parts and uses pleasing to the eye as addressed to the sense and satisfactory to the mind as appropriate to the object for which it is requiredthese constitute goodtaste as the term is here understood the term style also is the manner or form of a thing when we say that is a stylish house it should mean that it is in or approaches some particular style of building recognized by the schools it may or may not be in accordance with good taste and is consequently subject to the same capricious test in its government yet styles are subject to arrangement and are classified in the several schools of architecture either as distinct specimens of acknowledged orders as the doric the ionic the corinthian in grecian architecture or the tuscan and composite which are more distinctly styles of roman architecture to these may be added the egyptian the most massive of all and either of them in their proper character grand and imposing when applied to public buildings or extensive structures but altogether inapplicable from their want of lightness and convenience to country or even city dwellings other stylesnot exactly ordersof architecture such as the italian the romanesque the gothic the swiss with their modificationsall of which admit of a variety of departures from fixed rules not allowed in the more rigid ordersmay be adapted in a variety of ways to the most agreeable and harmonious arrangement in architectural effect for dwellings and structures appurtenant to them the italian style of architecture modified somewhat in pretension and extent is admirably adapted to most parts of the united states its general lightness openness and freedom gives a wide range of choice and its wings verandas and terraces stretching off in any and almost every direction desired from the main building make it exceedingly appropriate for general use the modern or rural gothic branching off sometimes into what is termed the english cottage style and in many instances blending so intimately with the italian as hardly to mark the line of division is also a beautiful arrangement of building for country dwellings these in ruder structures may also be carried into the rusticnot a style proper in itselfbut so termed as approximating in execution or pretension to either of the above while the swiss with its hanging roofs and sheltering eaves may be frequently brought in aid to show out the rustic form in more completeness and in greater harmony with surrounding objects than either of the others for farm houses either of these arrangements or departures from a set and positive style are better fitted than any which we have noticed and in some one or other of the modifications named we have applied them in the examples submitted in this work they may not therefore be viewed as distinct delineations of an order of architecture or style proper even but as a mode appropriate to the object required and so long as they do not absolutely conflict with true taste or in their construction commit a barbarism upon any acknowledged system of architecture in any of its modifications we hazard no impropriety in introducing them for the imitation of country builders congruity with the objects to which it is applied should be the chief merit of any structure whatever and so long as that object be attained good taste is not violated and utility is fully subserved intimately connected with this subject in rural buildings is the shape of the structure many of the designs recently introduced for the imitation of builders are full of angles and all sorts of zigzag lines which although they may add to the variety of style or relieve the monotony of straight and continuous lines are carried to a needless excess expensive in their construction and entail infinite trouble upon the owner or occupant in the repairs they subject him to in the leakages continually occurring against which last either of wind or rain it is almost impossible to guard and what let us ask are the benefits of a parcel of needless gables and peaked windows running up like owls ears above the eaves of a house except to create expense and invite leakage and decay if in appearance they provoke an association of that kind they certainly are not in good taste and a foot or two of increased height in a wall or a low window sufficient for the purpose intended would give a tone of dignity of comfort and real utility which a whole covey of such pretentious things could not all such trumpery should be scouted from the dwelling house of the farmer and left to the special indulgence of the town builder a square form of house will afford more area within a given line of wall than any other sensible form which may be adopted yet a square house is not so agreeable to the eye as an oblong thus a house should stand somewhat broader on one front than on another it should also be relieved from an appearance of monotony and tameness by one or more wings and such wings should at their junction with the main building retreat or advance a sufficient distance from a continuous line as to relieve it effectually from an appearance of stiffness and show a different character of occupation from that of the main structure the front of a house should be the most imposing and finished in its architecture of any one of its parts and unless some motive of greater convenience control otherwise its entrance the most highly wrought as indicating the luxury of the establishmentfor even the humblest habitations have their luxuries the side rooms or more usually occupied apartments require less pretension in both architectural effect and finish and should wear a more subdued appearance while the kitchen section and from that the several grades of apartments stretching beyond it should distinctly show that they are subservient in their character and wear a style and finish accordingly thus each part of the house speaks for itself it is its own fingerboard pointing the stranger to its various accommodation as plainly as if written on its walls and saying as significantly as dumb walls can do that here dwells a well regulated family who have a parlor for their friends a library or sittingroom for their own leisure and comfort an ample bedroom and nursery for the parents and the little ones a kitchen for the cooking and a scullery and closets and all the other etceteras which belong to a perfect family homestead and so with the grounds the lawn or dooryard should be the best kept ground on the place the most conspicuous part of the garden should show its shrubbery and its flowers the side or rear approach should be separated from the lawn and show its constant business occupation and openly lead off to where men and farm stock meet on common ground devoted to every purpose which the farm requires such arrangement would be complete in all its parts satisfactory and lasting tinsel ornament or gewgaw decoration should never be permitted on any building where the sober enjoyment of agricultural life is designed it can never add consideration or dignity to the retired gentleman even and least of all should it be indulged in by the farmer dwelling on his own cultivated acres the construction of cellars every farm house and farm cottage where a family of any size occupy the latter should have a good substantial stonewalled cellar beneath it no room attached to the farm house is more profitable in its occupation than the cellar it is useful for storing numberless articles which are necessary to be kept warm and dry in winter as well as cool in summer of which the farmer is well aware the walls of a cellar should rise at least one to two or even three feet above the level of the ground surrounding it according to circumstances and the rooms in it well ventilated by two or more sliding sash windows in each according to size position and the particular kind of storage for which it is required so that a draft of pure air can pass through and give it thorough ventilation at all times it should also be at least seven and a half feet high in the clear and if it be even nine feet that is not too much if the soil be compact or such as will hold water it should be thoroughly drained from the lowest point or corner and the drain always kept open a stone drain is the best and most durable and if floored with a coat of flat or rubble stones well set in good hydraulic cementor cement alone when the stone cannot be obtainedall the better this last will make it rat proof for the purpose of avoiding these destructive creatures the foundation stones in the wall should be brought to a joint and project at least six inches on each side from the wall itself when laid upon this bottom course as the usual manner of rats is to burrow in a nearly perpendicular direction from the surface by the side of the wall when intending to undermine it on arriving at the bottom if circumvented by the projecting stones they will usually abandon their work plank of hard wood or hard burnt bricks may answer this purpose when stone cannot be had all cellar walls should be laid in good lime mortar or if that be not practicable they should be well pointed with it this keeps them in place and renders them less liable to the ingress of water and vermin the thickness of wall should not be less than fifteen to eighteen inches in any event when of stone and if the house walls above be built of stone or brick two feet is better and in all cases the cellar wall should be full three inches thicker than the wall resting upon it in the cellar of every farm house there should be an outside door with a flight of steps by which to pass roots and other bulky or heavy articles to which a wagon or cart may approach either to receive or discharge them this is indispensable every outbuilding upon the farm let it be devoted to what purpose it may having a wooden floor on the ground story should be set up sufficiently high from the surface to admit a cat or small terrier dog beneath such floor with openings for them to pass in and out or these hiding places will become so many rat warrens upon the premises and prove most destructive to the grain and poultry nothing can be more annoying to the farmer than these vermin and a trifling outlay in the beginning will exclude them from the foundations and walls of all buildings care therefore should be taken to leave no haunt for their convenience with these suggestions the ingenuity of every builder will provide sufficient guards against the protection of vermin beneath his buildings ventilation of houses pure air and enough of it is the cheapest blessing one can enjoy and to deny ones self so indispensable an element of good health is little short of criminal neglect or the sheerest folly yet thousands who build at much needless expense for the protection of their health and that of their families as they allege and no doubt suppose by neglecting the simplest of all contrivances in the work of ventilation invite disease and infirmity from the very pains they so unwittingly take to ward off such afflictions a man be he farmer or of other profession finding himself prosperous in life sets about the very sensible business of building a house for his own accommodation looking back perhaps to the days of his boyhood in a severe climate he remembers the not very highlyfinished tenement of his father and the wide open fireplace which with its well piled logs was scarcely able to warm the large livingroom where the family were wont to huddle in winter he possibly remembers with shivering sympathy the sprinkling of snow which he was accustomed to find upon his bed as he awaked in the morning that had found its way through the frail casing of his chamber windowbut in the midst of all which he grew up with a vigorous constitution a strong arm and a determined spirit he is resolved that his children shall encounter no such hardships and that himself and his excellent helpmate shall suffer no such inconvenience as his own parents had done who now perhaps are enjoying a strong and serene old age in their oldfashioned yet to them not uncomfortable tenement he therefore determines to have a snug close house where the cold cannot penetrate he employs all his ingenuity to make every joint an airtight fit the doors must swing to an airtight joint the windows set into airtight frames and to perfect the catalogue of his comforts an airtight stove is introduced into every occupied room which perchance if he can afford it are further warmed and poisoned by the heated flues of an airtight furnace in his airtight cellar in short it is an airtight concern throughout his family breathe an airtight atmosphere they eat their food cooked in an airtight kitchen witch of the latest premium pattern and thus they start father mother children all on the high roadif persisted into a galloping consumption which sooner or later conducts them to an airtight dwelling not soon to be changed if such melancholy catastrophe be avoided colds catarrhs headaches and all sorts of bodily afflictions shortly make their appearance and they wonder what is the matter they live so snug their house is so warm they sleep so comfortable how can it be true in the morning the air of their sleepingrooms feels close but then if a window is opened it will chill the rooms and that will give them colds what can be the matter the poor creatures never dream that they have been breathing for hour after hour decomposed air charged with poisonous gases which cannot escape through the tight walls or over the tight windows or through the tight stoves and thus they keep on in the sure course to infirmity disease and premature deathall for the want of a little ventilation better indeed that instead of all this painstaking a pane were knocked out of every window or a panel out of every door in the house we are not disposed to talk about cellar furnaces for heating a farmers house they have little to do in the farmers inventory of goods at all unless it be to give warmth to the halland even then a snug box stove with its pipe passing into the nearest chimney is in most cases the better appendage fuel is usually abundant with the farmer and where so its benefits are much better dispensed in open stoves or fireplaces than in heating furnaces or airtights we have slightly discussed this subject of firing in the farm house in a previous page but while in the vein must crave another word a farmers house should look hospitable as well as be hospitable both outside and in and the broadest most cheerful look of hospitality within doors in cold weather is an open fire in the chimney fireplace with the blazing wood upon it there is no mistake about it it thaws you out if cold it stirs you up if drooping and is the welcome winning introduction to the good cheer that is to follow a short time ago we went to pay a former town friend a visit he had removed out to a snug little farm where he could indulge his agricultural and horticultural tastes yet still attend to his town engagements and enjoy the quietude of the country we rang the door bell a servant admitted us and leaving overcoat and hat in the hall we entered a lone room with an airtight stove looking as black and solemn as a turkish eunuch upon us and giving out about the same degree of genial warmth as the said eunuch would have expressed had he been therean emasculated warming machine truly on the floor was a wilton carpet too fine to stand on around the room were mahogany sofas and mahogany chairs all too fine to sit onat all events to rest one upon if he were fatigued the blessed light of day was shut out by crimson and white curtains held up by gilded arrows and upon the mantle piece and on the center and side tables were all sorts of gimcracks costly and worthless in short there was no comfort about the whole concern hearing our friend coming up from his diningroom below where too was his cellar kitchenthat most abominable of all appendages to a farm house or to any other country house for that matterwe buttoned our coat up close and high thrust our hands into our pockets and walked the room as he entered glad to see youglad to see you my friend said he in great joy but dear me why so buttoned up as if you were going whats the matter my good sir we replied you asked us to come over and see you a plain farmer and take a quiet family dinner with you we have done so and here find you with all your town nonsense about you no fire to warm by no seat to rest in no nothing like a farm or farmer about you and it only needs your charming better half whom we always admired when she lived in town to take down her enameled harp and play in fairy bowers by moonlight hours to convince one that instead of ruralizing in the country you had gone a peg higher in town residence no no well go down to farmer jocelyns our old schoolfellow and take a dinner of bacon and cabbage with him if he does occupy a onestory house he lives up in sunshine has an open fireplace with a blazing wood fire on a chilly day and his latch string is always out our friend was petrifiedastonished we meant to go it rather strong upon him but still kept a frank goodhumored face that showed him no malice he began to think he was not exactly in character and essayed to explain we listened to his story his good wife came in and all together we had a long talk of their family and farming arrangements how they had furnished their house and how they proposed to live but wound up with a sad story that their good farming neighbors didnt call on them the second timekind civil people they appeared tooand while they were in acted as though afraid to sit down and afraid to stand upin short they were dreadfully embarrassed for why our friends couldnt tell but now began to understand it well my good friends said we you have altogether mistaken country life in the outset to live on a farm it is neither necessary to be vulgar nor clownish nor to affect ignorance simplicity is all you require in manners and equal simplicity in your furniture and appointments now just turn all this nonsense in furniture and room dressing out of doors and let some of your town friends have it get some simple comfortable cottage furniture much better for all purposes than this and you will settle down into quiet natural country life before you are aware of it and all will go merry as a marriage bell with you in a little timefor they both loved the country and were truly excellent people we continued i came to spend the day and the night and i will stay and this evening well go down to your neighbor jocelyns and you mrs n shall go with us and we will see how quietly and comfortably he and his family take the world in a farmers way we did go not in carriage and livery but walked the pleasant half mile that lay between them the exercise of which gave us all activity and good spirits jocelyn was right glad to see us and patty his staid and sober wife with whom we had romped many an innocent hour in our childhood days was quite as glad as he but they looked a little surprised that such great folks as their new neighbors should drop in so unceremoniously and into their common keeping room too to chat away an evening however the embarrassment soon wore off we talked of farming we talked of the late elections we talked of the fruit trees and the strawberry beds and mrs jocelyn who was a pattern of good housekeeping told mrs n how she made her apple jellies and her currant tarts and cream cheeses and before we left they had exchanged ever so many engagementsmrs patty to learn her new friend to do half a dozen nice little matters of household pickling and preserving while she in turn was to teach nancy and fanny pattys two rosycheeked daughters almost as pretty as their mother was at their own age to knit a bead bag and work a fancy chair seat and then we had apples and nuts all of the very bestfor jocelyn was a rare hand at grafting and managing his fruit trees and knew the best apples all over the country we had indeed a capital time to cut the story short the next spring our friend sent his fancy furniture to auction and provided his house with simple cottage furnishings at less than half the cost of the other which both he and his wife afterward declared was infinitely better for all housekeeping purposes he also threw a neat wing on to the cottage for an upper kitchen and its offices and they now live like sensible country folks and with their healthy frolicksome children are worth the envy of all the dyspeptic townfed people in existence a long digression truly but so true a story and one so apt to our subject can not well be omitted but what has all this to do with ventilation well tell you jocelyns house was ventilated as it should befor he was a methodical thoughtful man who planned and built his house himselfnot the mechanical work but directed it throughout and saw that it was faithfully done and that put us in mind of the story to be perfect in its ventilation every room in the house even to the closets should be so arranged that a current of air may pass through to keep it pure and dry in living rooms fresh air in sufficient quantity may usually be admitted through the doors in sleeping rooms and closets when doors may not be left open one or more of the lower panels of the door may be filled by a rolling blind opening more or less at pleasure or a square or oblong opening for that purpose may be left in the base board at the floor and covered by a wire netting and in all rooms living apartments as well as these an opening of at least sixtyfour square inches should be made in the wall near the ceiling and leading into an air flue to pass into the garret such opening may be filled by a rolling blind or wire screen as below and closed or kept open at pleasure some builders prefer an air register to be placed in the chimney over the fireplace or stove near the ceiling but the liability to annoyance by smoke escaping through it into the room if not thoroughly done is an objection to this latter method and the other may be made in its construction rather ornamental than otherwise in appearance all such details as these should be planned when the building is commenced so that the several flues may be provided as the building proceeds in a stone or brick house a small space may be left in the walls against which these air registers may be required and for inner rooms or closets they may pass off into the openings of the partitions and so up into the garret from which apertures of escape may be left or made at the gables under the roof or by a blind in a window for the admission of air to the first floor of the house a special opening through the walls for that purpose can hardly be necessary as the doors leading outside are usually opened often enough for such object one of the best ventilated houses we have ever seen is that owned and occupied by samuel cloon esq of cincinnati it is situated on his farm three miles out of the city and in its fine architectural appearance and finished appointments as a rural residence and firstclass farm house is not often excelled every closet is ventilated through rolling blinds in the door panels and foul air either admitted or created within them is passed off at once by flues near the ceiling overhead passing into conductors leading off through the garret where chambers are carried into the roof of a house to any extent they are sometimes incommoded by the summer heat which penetrates them conducted by the chamber ceiling overhead this heat can best be obviated by inserting a small window at each opposite peak of the garret by which the outside air can circulate through above the chambers and so pass off the heated air which will continually ascend all this is a simple matter for which any builder can provide without particular expense or trouble interior accommodation of houses ground in the country being the cheapest item which the farmer can devote to building purposes his object should be to spread over rather than to go deeply into it or climb high in the air above it we repudiate cellar kitchens or underground rooms for house work altogether as being little better than a nuisancedark damp unhealthy inconvenient and expensive the several rooms of a farm dwelling house should be compact in arrangement and contiguous as may be to the principallyoccupied apartments such arrangement is cheaper more convenient and laborsaving and in addition more in accordance with a good and correct taste in the outward appearance of the house itself the general introduction of cooking stoves and other stoves and apparatus for warming houses within the last twenty years which we acknowledge to be a great acquisition in comfort as well as in convenience and economy has been carried to an extreme not only in shutting up and shutting out the timehonored open fireplace and its broad hearthstone with their hallowed associations but also in prejudice to the health of those who so indiscriminately use them regardless of other arrangements which ought to go with them a farm house should never be built without an ample open fireplace in its kitchen and other principally occupied rooms and in all rooms where stoves are placed and fires are daily required the open franklin should take place of the close or airtight stove unless extraordinary ventilation to such rooms be adopted also the great charm of the farmers winter evening is the open fireside with its cheerful blaze and glowing embers not wastefully expended but giving out that genial warmth and comfort which to those who are accustomed to its enjoyment is a pleasure not made up by any invention whatever and although the cooking stove or range be requiredwhich in addition to the fireplace we would always recommend to lighten female laborit can be so arranged as not to interfere with the enjoyment or convenience of the open fire in the construction of the chimneys which appear in the plans submitted the great majority of themparticularly those for northern latitudesare placed in the interior of the house they are less liable to communicate fire to the building and assist greatly in warming the rooms through which they pass in southern houses they are not so necessary fires being required for a much less period of the year yet even there they may be oftentimes properly so placed where holes for the passage of stovepipes through floors partitions or into chimneys are made stone earthen or iron thimbles should be inserted and except in the chimneys such holes should be at least one to two inches larger than the pipe itself the main flues of the chimney conducting off the smoke of the different fires should be built separate and kept apart by a partition of one brick in thickness and carried out independently as in no other way will they rid the house of smoky rooms illustration an illustration in point fifteen years ago we purchased and removed into a most substantial and wellbuilt stone house the chimneys of which were constructed with open fireplaces and the flues carried up separately to the top where they all met upon the same level surface as chimneys in past times usually were built thus every fireplace in the house and some of them had stoves in smoked intolerably so much so that when the wind was in some quarters the fires had to be put out in every room but the kitchen which as good luck would have it smoked lessalthough it did smoke therethan the others after balancing the matter in our own mind some time whether we should pull down and rebuild the chimneys altogether or attempt an alteration as we had given but little thought to the subject of chimney draft and to try an experiment was the cheapest we set to work a bricklayer who under our direction simply built over each discharge of the several flues a separate top of fifteen inches high in this wise the remedy was perfect we have had no smoke in the house since blow the wind as it may on any and all occasions the chimneys cant smoke and the whole expense for four chimneys with their twelve flues was not twenty dollars the remedy was in giving each outlet a distinct current of air all around and on every side of it illustration chimney tops nothing adds more to the outward expression of a dwelling than the style of its chimneys we have just shown that independent chimney tops pass off their smoke more perfectly than when only partitioned inside to the common point of outlet aside from the architectural beauty which a group of chimney flues adds to the building we have seen that they are really useful beyond the formal squaresided piles so common throughout the country they denote good cheer social firesides and a generous hospitality withinfeatures which should always mark the country dwelling and more particularly that of the farmer the style and arrangement of these chimney groups may be various as comporting with the design of the house itself and any good architect can arrange them as fitted to such design our illustrations will show them of different kinds which are generally cheap in construction and simple yet expressive in their arrangement preliminary to our designs we have discussed with tolerable fullness the chief subjects connected with farm buildingssufficiently so we trust to make ourselves understood as desiring to combine utility with commendable ornament in all that pertains to them the object has been thus far to give hints rather than models in description but as the point to which we have endeavored to arrive will be but imperfectly understood without illustration we shall submit a few plans of houses and outbuildings as carrying out more fully our ideas we are quite aware that different forms or fashions of detail and finish to both outside and inside work prevail among builders in different sections of the united states some of these fashions are the result of climate some of conventional taste and some of education with them we are not disposed to quarrel in many cases they are immaterial to the main objects of the work and so long as they please the taste or partialities of those adopting them are of little consequence there are however certain matters of principle both in general construction and in the detail of finish which should not be disregarded and these in the designs submitted and in the explanations which follow will be fully discussed each in its place the particular form or style of work we have not directed because as before remarked we are no professional builder and of course free from the dogmas which are too apt to be inculcated in the professional schools and workshops we give a wide berth and a free toleration in all such matters and are not disposed to raise a hornets nest about our ears by interfering in matters where every tyro of the drafting board and workbench assumes to be and probably may be our superior all minor subjects we are free to leave to the skill and ingenuity of the builderwho fortunately for the country is found in almost every village and hamlet of the land modes and styles of finish both inside and outside of buildings change and that so frequently that what is laid down as the reigning fashion today may be superseded by another fashion of tomorrowimmaterial in themselves only and not affecting the shape arrangement and accommodation of the building itself which in these must ever maintain their relation with the use for which it is intended the northern dwelling with its dependencies and appointments requires a more compact snug and connected arrangement than that of the south while one in the middle states may assume a style of arrangement between them both each fitted for their own climate and country and in equally good taste the designs we are about to submit are intended to be such as may be modified to any section of the country although some of them are made for extremes of north and south and are so distinguished another object we have had in view is to give to every farmer and country dweller of moderate means the opportunity of possessing a cheap work which would guide him in the general objects which he wishes to accomplish in building that he may have his own notions on the subject and not be subject to the caprice and government of such as profess to exclusive knowledge in all that appertains to such subjects and in which it need not be offensive to say that although clever in their way they are sometimes apt to be mistaken therefore without assuming to instruct the professional builder our plans will be submitted not without the hope that he even may find in them something worthy of consideration and we offer them to the owner and future occupant of the buildings themselves as models which he may adopt with the confidence that they will answer all his reasonable purposes design i we here present a farm house of the simplest and most unpretending kind suitable for a farm of twenty fifty or an hundred acres buildings somewhat in this style are not unfrequently seen in the new england states and in new york and the plan is in fact suggested although not copied from some farm houses which we have known there with improvements and additions of our own illustration farm house pages 7374 this house may be built either of stone brick or wood the style is rather rustic than otherwise and intended to be altogether plain yet agreeable in outward appearance and of quite convenient arrangement the body of this house is 4030 feet on the ground and 12 feet high to the plates for the roof the lower rooms nine feet high the roof intended for a pitch of 35but by an error in the drawing made lessthus affording very tolerable chamber room in the roof story the l or rear projection containing the washroom and woodhouse juts out two feet from the side of the house to which it is attached with posts 7 feet high above the floor of the main house the pitch of the roof being the same beyond this is a building 3224 feet with 10 feet posts partitioned off into a swillroom piggery workshop and wagonhouse and a like roof with the others a light rustic porch 128 feet with lattice work is placed on the front of the house and another at the side door over which vines by way of drapery may run thus combining that sheltered comfortable and homelike expression so desirable in a rural dwelling the chimney is carried out in three separate flues sufficiently marked by the partitions above the roof the windows are hooded or sheltered to protect them from the weather and fitted with simple sliding sashes with 79 or 810 glass outer blinds may be added if required but it is usually better to have these inside as they are no ornament to the outside of the building are liable to be driven back and forth by the wind even if fastenings are used and in any event are little better than a continual annoyance illustration ground plan interior arrangement the front door over which is a single sashlight across opens into a hall or entry 97 feet from which a door opens on either side into a sittingroom and parlor each 1615 feet lighted by a double plain window at the ends and a single twosash window in front between the entrance door and stove are in each room a small pantry or closet for dishes or otherwise as may be required the chimney stands in the center of the house with a separate flue for each front room into which a thimble is inserted to receive the stovepipes by which they are warmed and from the inner side of these rooms each has a door passing to the kitchen or chief living room this last apartment is 2215 feet with a broad fireplace containing a crane hooks and trammel if required and a spacious family ovenaffording those homely and primitive comforts still so dear to many of us who are not ready to concede that all the virtues of the present day are combined in a perfection cooking stove and a patent heater although there is a chance for these last if they should be adopted into the peaceful atmosphere of this kitchen illustration chamber plan on one side of the kitchen in rear of the stairs is a bedroom 98 feet with a window in one corner adjoining that is a buttery dairyroom or closet 96 feet also having a window at the inner end of the stairway is the cellar passage at the outer end is the chamber passage landing above in the highest part of the roof story opposite the chamber stairs is a door leading to the washroom between the two windows on the rear side of the kitchen is a sink with a waste pipe passing out through the wall at the further corner a door opens into a snug bedroom 98 feet lighted by a window in rear and adjoining this is a side entry leading from the end door 96 feet in area thus making every room in the house accessible at once from the kitchen and giving the greatest possible convenience in both living and housework the roof story is partitioned into convenientsized bedrooms the ceiling running down the pitch of the roof to within two feet of the floor unless they are cut short by inner partitions as they are in the largest chamber to give closets the open area in the center at the head of the stairs is lighted by a small gable window inserted in the roof at the rear and serves as a lumber room or if necessary a bed may occupy a part of it in rear of the main dwelling is a building 4416 feet occupied as a washroom and woodhouse the washroom floor is let down eight inches below the kitchen and is 1614 feet in area lighted by a window on each side with a chimney in which is set a boiler and fireplace if desired and a sink in the corner adjoining this room is 7 feet in height a door passes from this washroom into the woodhouse which is 3016 feet open in front with a watercloset in the further corner the cellar is 7 feet in heightand is the whole size of the house laid with good stone wall in lime mortar with a flight of steps leading outside in rear of the kitchen and two or more sashlight windows at the ends if not in a loose gravelly or sandy soil the cellar should be kept dry by a drain leading out on to lower ground the building beyond and adjoining the woodhouse contains a swillhouse 1612 feet with a window in one end a chimney and boiler in one corner with storage for swill barrels grain meal potatoes c for feeding the pigs which are in the adjoining pen of same size with feeding trough place for sleeping c and having a window in one end and a door in the rear leading to a yard adjoining these in front is a workshop and toolhouse 1610 feet with a window at the end and an entrance door near the wood house in this is a joiners workbench a chest of working tools such as saw hammer augers c c necessary for repairing implements doing little rough jobs or other wood work c which every farmer ought to do for himself and also storing his hoes axes shovels hammers and other small farm implements in this room he will find abundant rainyday employment in repairing his utensils of various kinds making his beehives hencoops c c next to this is the wagonhouse 1614 feet with broad doors at the end and harness pegs around the walls the posts of this building are 10 feet high the rooms eight feet high and a low chamber overhead for storing lumber grain and other articles as may be required altogether these several apartments make a very complete and desirable accommodation to a man with the property and occupation for which it is intended on one side and adjoining the house should be the garden the clothesyard and the beehouse which last should always stand in full sight and facing the most frequented roomsay the kitchenthat they can be seen daily during the swarming season as those performing household duties may keep them in view miscellaneous in regard to the surroundings and approach to this dwelling they should be treated under the suggestions already given on these subjects this is an exceedingly snug tenement and everything around and about it should be of the same character no pretension or frippery whatever a neat garden usefully rather than ornamentally and profusely supplied a moderate courtyard in front free access to the end door from the main everyday approach by vehiclesnot on the highway but on the farm road or lanethe business entrance in fact which should also lead to the barns and sheds beyond not far distant every feature should wear a most domestic look and breathe an air of repose and content trees should be near but not so near as to cover the house a few shrubs of simple kindsome standing rosesa few climbing ones a syringa a lilac a snow ball and a little patch or two of flowers near the front porch and the whole expression is given just as one would wish to look upon as a simple unpretending habitation it is not here proposed to give working plans or estimates to a nicety or particular directions for building any design even that we present the material for construction best suited to the circumstances and locality of the proprietor must govern all those matters and as good builders are in most cases at hand who are competent to give estimates for the cost of any given plan when the material for construction is once settled the question of expense is readily fixed the same sized house with the same accommodation may be made to cost fifty to one hundred per cent over an economical estimate by the increased style or manner of its finish or it may be kept within bounds by a rigid adherence to the plan first adopted in western new york this house and attachments complete the body of stone the woodhouse wagonhouse c of wood may be built and well finished in a plain way for 1500 if built altogether of wood with grooved and matched vertical boarding and battens the whole may be finished and painted for 800 to 1200 for the lowest sum the lumber and work would be of a rough kind with a cheap wash to color it but the latter amount would give good work and a lasting coat of mineral paint both outside and within as a tenant house on a farm of three four or even five hundred acres where all who live in it are laborers in the field or household this design may be most conveniently adopted the family inhabiting it in winter may be well accommodated for sleeping under the main roof while they can at all seasons take their meals and be made comfortable in the several rooms in the summer season when a larger number of laborers are employed the lofts of the carriage or wagonhouse and workshop may be occupied with beds and thus a large share of the expense of house building for a very considerable farm be saved luxury is a quality more or less consulted by every one who builds for his own occupation on a farm or elsewhere and the tendency in building is constantly to expand to give a higher finish and in fact to overbuild indeed if we were to draw the balance on our old farms between scantilyaccommodated houses and houses with needless room in them the latter would preponderate not that these latter houses either are too good or too convenient for the purpose for which they were built but they have too much room and that room badly appropriated and arranged on a farm proper the whole establishment is a workshop the shop out of doors we acknowledge is not always dry nor always warm but it is exceedingly well aired and lighted and a place where industrious people dearly love to labor within doors it is a workshop too there is always labor and occupation for the family in the general business of the farm therefore but little room is wanted for either luxury or leisure and the farm house should be fully occupied with the exception perhaps of a single room on the main floor and that not a large one for some regular business purpose all these accommodated and the requirements of the house are ended owners of rented farms should reflect too that expensive houses on their estates entail expensive repairs and that continually many tenants are careless of highlyfinished houses not early accustomed to them they misappropriate perhaps the best rooms in the house and pay little attention to the purposes for which the owner designed them or to the manner of using them it is therefore a total waste of money to build a house on a tenant estate anything beyond the mere comfortable wants of the family occupying it and to furnish the room necessary for the accommodation of the crops stock and farm furniture in the barns and other outbuildingsall in a cheap tidy yet substantial way so too with the grounds for domestic purposes around the house a kitchen garden sufficient to grow the family vegetablesa few plain fruitsa posey bed or two for the girlsand the story is told give a larger space for these thingsanything indeed for eleganceand ten to one the plow is introduced a corn or potato patch is set out field culture is adopted and your choice grounds are torn up defaced and sacrificed to the commonest uses notwithstanding these drawbacks a cheerful homeexpression may be given and should be given to the homestead in the character and construction of the buildings be they ever so rough and homely we can call to mind many instances of primitive houseslog cabins evenbuilt when none better could be had that presented a most comfortable and lifeenjoying pictureresidences once indeed of those who swayed the applause of listening senates but under the hands of taste and a trifle of labor made to look comfortable happy and sufficient we confess therefore to a profound veneration if not affection for the humble farm house as truly american in character and which with a moderate display of skill may be made equal to the main purposes of life and enjoyment for all such as do not aspire to a high display and who are content to make the most of moderate means design ii this is the plan of a house and outbuildings based chiefly on one which we built of wood some years since on a farm of our own and which in its occupation has proved to be one of exceeding convenience to the purposes intended as a farm business house we have not known it excelled nor in the ease and facility of doing up the housework within it do we know a better it has a subdued quiet unpretending look yet will accommodate a family of a dozen workmen besides the females engaged in the household work with perfect convenience or if occupied by a farmer with but his own family around him ample room is afforded them for a most comfortable mode of life and sufficient for the requirements of a farm of two to three or four hundred acres illustration farm house pages 8586 this house is in the main body 3622 feet one and a half stories high with a projection on the rear 3416 feet for the kitchen and its offices and a still further addition to that of 2618 feet for washroom the main body of the house is 14 feet high to the plates the lower rooms are 9 feet high the roof has a pitch of 35 from a horizontal line giving partiallyupright chambers in the main building and roof lodging rooms in the rear the rear or kitchen part is one story high with 10 feet posts and such pitch of roof which last runs at right angles to the main body and laps on to the main roof as will carry the peak up to the same air line this addition should retreat 6 inches from the line of the main building on the side given in the design and 18 inches on the rear the rooms on this kitchen floor are 8 feet high leaving one foot above the upper floor under the roof as a chamber garret or lumberroom as may be required beyond this in the rear is the other extension spoken of with posts 9 feet high for a buttery closet or dairy or all three combined and a washroom the floor of which is on a level with the last and the roof running in the same direction and of the same pitch in front of this washroom where not covered by the woodhouse is an open porch 8 feet wide and 10 feet long the roof of which runs out at a less angle than the otherssay 30 from a horizontal line attached to this is the woodhouse running off by way of l at right angles 3616 feet of same height as the washroom adjoining the woodhouse on the same front line is a building 5020 feet with 12 feet posts occupied as a workshop wagonhouse stable and storeroom with a leanto on the last of 1510 feet for a piggery the several rooms in this building are 8 feet high affording a good lumber room over the workshop and hay storage over the wagonhouse and stable over the wagonhouse is a gable with a blind window swinging on hinges for receiving hay thus relieving the long uniform line of roof and affording ample accommodation on each side to a pigeonhouse or dovecote if required the style of this establishment is of plain italian or bracketed and may be equally applied to stone brick or wood the roofs are broad and protect the walls by their full projection over them 2 feet the small gable in the front roof of the main dwelling relieves it of its otherwise straight uniformity and affords a high doorwindow opening on to the deck of the veranda which latter should be 8 or 10 feet in width the shallow windows also over the wings of the veranda give it a more cheerful expression the lower end windows of this part of the house are hooded or sheltered by a cheap roof which gives them a snug and most comfortable appearance the veranda may appear more ornamental than the plain character of the house requires but any superfluous work upon it may be omitted and the style of finish conformed to the other the veranda roof is flatter than that of the house but it may be made perfectly tight by closer shingling and paint while the deck or platform in the centre may be roofed with zinc or tin and a coat of sanded paint laid upon it the front chimney is plain yet in keeping with the general style of the house and may be made of ordinary bricks the two parts of the chimney as they appear in the front rooms are drawn together as they pass through the chamber above and become one at the roof the kitchen chimneys pass up through the peaks of their respective roofs and should be in like character with the other illustration chamber plan ground plan interior arrangement the front door of this house opens into a small entry or hall 96 feet which is lighted by a low sash of glass over the front door a door leads into a room on each side and at the inner end of the hall is a recess between the two chimneys of the opposite rooms in which may be placed a table or broad shelf to receive hats and coats on the left is a parlor 2215 feet lighted on one side by a double window and in front by a single plain one the fireplace is centrally placed on one side of the room in the middle of the house on one side of the fireplace is a closet three feet deep with shelves and another closet at the inner end of the room near the kitchen door or this closet may be dispensed with for the use of this parlor and given up to enlarge the closet which is attached to the bedroom another door opens directly into the kitchen this parlor is 9 feet high between joints the sittingroom is opposite to the parlor 1915 feet and lighted and closeted in nearly the same manner as will be seen by referring to the floor plan the kitchen is the grand room of this house it is 2416 feet in area having an ample fireplace with its hooks and trammels and a spacious oven by its side it is lighted by a double window at one end and a single window near the fireplace at one end of this kitchen is a most comfortable and commodious family bedroom 1310 feet with a large closet in one corner and lighted by a window in the side two windows may be inserted if wanted a passage leads by the side of the oven to a sinkroom or recess behind the chimney with shelves to dry dishes on and lighted by the half of a double window which accommodates with its other half the dairy or closet adjoining a door also opens from this recess into the closet and dairy furnished with broad shelves that part of which next the kitchen is used for dishes cold meat and bread cupboards c while the part of it adjoining the window beyond is used for milk this room is 146 feet besides the l running up next to the kitchen of 64 feet from the kitchen also opens a closet into the front part of the house for any purpose needed this adjoins the parlor and sittingroom closets in the passage to the sittingroom also opens the stairway leading to the chambers and beneath at the other end of it next the outside wall is a flight leading down cellar the cellar is excavated under the whole house being 3622 and 3416 feet with glass windows one light deep by four wide of 810 glass and an outer door and flight of steps outside under either the sittingroom or kitchen windows as may be most convenient a door opens also from the kitchen into a passage 4 feet wide and 12 feet long leading to the washroom 1816 feet and by an outside door through this passage to the porch in this passage may be a small window to give it light in the washroom are two windows a chimney at the far end accommodates a boiler or two and a fireplace if required a sink stands adjoining the chimney a flight of stairs leading to a garret over head on one side and to the kitchen chamber on the other stands next the dairy into which last a door also leads in this washroom may be located the cooking stove in warm weather leaving the main kitchen for a family and eating room a door also leads from the washroom into the woodhouse the woodhouse stands lower than the floor of the washroom from which it falls by steps this is large because a plentiful store of wood is needed for a dwelling of this character if the room be not all wanted for such purpose a part of it may devoted to other necessary uses there seldom being too much shelter of this kind on a farm through the rear wall of this woodhouse leads a door into the garden or clothesyard as the case may be and at its extreme angle is a water closet 64 feet by way of leanto with a hipped roof 8 feet high running off from both the woodhouse and workshop this watercloset is lighted by a sliding sash window on to the woodhouse in a continuous front line joins the workshop an indispensable appendage to farm convenience this has a flight of stairs leading to the lumberroom above for the furnishing of this apartment see description of design i next to the workhouse is the wagon and toolhouse above which is the hay loft also spread over the stable adjoining in which last are stalls for a pair of horses which may be required for uses other than the main labors of the farmto run to market carry the family to church or elsewhere a pair of horses for such purposes should always be kept near the house the horsestalls occupy a space of 1012 feet with racks and feeding boxes the plans of these will be described hereafter the door leading out from these stalls is 5 feet wide and faces the partition so that each horse may be led out or in at an easy angle from them beyond the stalls is a passage 4 feet wide leading to a storeroom or area from which a flight of rough stairs leads to the hay loft above beyond this room in which is the oat bin for the horses is a small piggery for the convenience of a pig or two which are always required to consume the daily wash and offal of the house and not for the general pork stock of the farm which on one of this size may be expected to require more commodious quarters the chamber plan of this house is commodious furnishing one large room and three smaller ones the small chamber leading to the deck over the porch may or may not be occupied as a sleeping room the small one near the stairs may contain a single bed or be occupied as a large clothescloset through this a door leads into the kitchen chamber which may serve as one or more laborers bedchambers they may be lighted by one or more windows in the rear gable if more convenient to the family the parlor and sittingroom already described may change their occupation and one substituted for the other the main business approach to this house should be by a lane or farm road opening on the side next the stable and wagonhouse the yard in front of these last named buildings should be separated from the lawn or front dooryard of the dwelling the establishment should stand some distance back from the traveled highway and be decorated with such trees shrubbery and cultivation as the taste of the owner may direct no general rules or directions can be applicable to this design beyond what have already been given and the subject must be treated as circumstances may suggest the unfrequented side of the house should however be flanked with a garden either ornamental or fruit and vegetable as buildings of this character ought to command a corresponding share of attention with the grounds by which they are surrounded this house will appear equally well built of wood brick or stone its cost according to materials or finish may be 1000 or 1500 the outbuildings attached will add 400 to 600 with the same conditions as to finish but the whole may be substantially and well built of either stone brick or wood where each may be had at equal convenience for 2000 in the interior of new york of course it is intended to do all the work plain and in character for the occupation to which it is intended miscellaneous details at this point of our remarks a word or two may be offered on the general subject of inside finish to farm houses which may be applicable more or less to any one or all of the designs that may come under our observation therefore what is here said may be applied at large different sections of the united states have their own several local notions or preferences as to the mode of finish to their houses and outbuildings according to climate education or other circumstances in all these matters neither taste fashion nor climate should be arbitrary the manner of finish may be various without any departure from truth or proprietyalways keeping in mind the object for which it is intended the material for a country house should be strong and durable and the work simple in its details beyond that for either town or suburban houses it should be strong for the reason that the interior of the farm house is used for purposes of industry in finishing up and perfecting the labors of the farm labors indispensable too and in amount beyond the ordinary housekeeping requirements of a family who have little to do but merely to live and make themselves comfortable the material should be durable because the distance at which the farm house is usually located from the residences of building mechanics renders it particularly troublesome and expensive to make repairs and alterations the work should be simple because cheaper in the first place in construction and finish quite as appropriate and satisfactory in appearance and demanding infinitely less labor and pains to care for and protect it afterward therefore all mouldings architraves chiselwork and gewgawgery in interior finish should be let alone in the living and daily occupied rooms of the house if to a single parlor or spare bedchamber a little ornamental work be permitted let even that be in moderation and just enough to teach the active mistress and her daughters what a world of scrubbing and elbow work they have saved themselves in the enjoyment of a plainlyfinished house instead of one full of gingerbread work and finery none but the initiated can tell the affliction that chiseled finishing entails on housekeepers in the spider fly and other insect lodgment which it invitesfrequently the cause of more annoyance and daily disquietude in housekeeping because unnecessary than real griefs from which we may not expect to escape bases casings sashes doorsall should be plain and painted or stained a quiet russet colora color natural to the woods used for the finish if it can be showing in their wear as little of dust soiling and fly dirt as possible there is no poetry about common housekeeping cooking housecleaning washing scrubbing sweeping are altogether matteroffact duties and usually considered work not recreation and these should all be made easy of performance and as seldom to be done as possible although the first item always was and always will be and the last item should be an everyday vocation for somebody and the manner of inside finish to a house has a great deal to do with all these labors in a stone or brick house the inside walls should be firred off for plastering this may be done either by plugging that is driving a plug of wood strongly into the mortar courses into which the firring should be nailed or by laying a strip of thin board in the mortar course the entire length of each wall this is better than blocks laid in for such purpose because it is effectually bound by the stone or brick work whereas a block may get loose by shrinking but the nails which hold the firring to the plug or to the thin strip of board will split and wedge it closer to the mason work of the outside wall this is an important item it makes close work too and leaves no room for rats mice or other vermin and as it admits a spaceno matter how thinso that no outside damp from the walls can communicate into or through the inner plastering it answers all purposes the inside and partition walls should be of coarse strong mortar floated off as smoothly as may be not a hard finish which is fine and costly and then papered throughout for the better rooms and the commonlyused rooms whitewashed paper gives a most comfortable look to the rooms more so than paint and much less expensive while nothing is so sweet tidy and cheerful to the working rooms of the house as a lime wash either white or softened down with some agreeable tint such as light blue green drab fawn or russet to give the shade desired and for which every professional painter and whitewasher in the vicinity can furnish a proper recipe applicable to the place and climate on such subjects we choose to prescribe rather than to play the apothecary by giving any of the thousand and one recipes extant for the composition our remarks upon the strength and durability of material in housebuilding do not apply exclusively to brick and stone wood is included also and of this there is much difference in the kind sound white oak is perhaps the best material for the heavy framework of any house or outbuilding and when to be had at a moderate expense we would recommend it in preference to any other if white oak cannot be had the other varieties of oak or chesnut are the next best in light frametimbers such as studs girts joists or rafters oak is inclined to spring and warp and we would prefer hemlock or chesnut which holds a nail equally as well or in its absence pine which holds a nail badly whitewood or black walnut the outside finish to a wooden house may be lighter than in one of stone or brick the wood work on the outside of the latter should always be heavy and in character with the walls giving an air of firmness and stability to the whole structure no elaborate carving or beadwork should be permitted on the outside work of a country house at all and only a sufficient quantity of ornamental tracery of any kind to break the monotony of a plainness that would otherwise give it a formal or uncouth expression and relieve it of what some would consider a pasteboard look a farm house in fact of any degree either cheap or expensive should wear the same appearance as a welldressed person of either sex so that a stranger not looking at them for the purpose of inspecting their garb should after an interview be unable to tell what particular sort of dress they wore so perfectly in keeping was it with propriety in the design now under discussion a cellar is made under the whole body of the house and this cellar is a shallow one so far as being sunk into the ground is concerned say 5 feet leaving 2 feet of cellar wall above ground8 feet in all a part of the wall above ground should be covered by the excavated earth and sloped off to a level with the surrounding surface a commodious welllighted and wellventilated cellar is one of the most important apartments of the farm house it should if the soil be compact be well drained from some point or corner within the walls into a lower level outside to which point within the whole floor surface should incline and the bottom be floored with waterlime cement this will make it hard durable and dry it may then be washed and scrubbed off as easily as an upper floor if the building site be high and in a gravelly or sandy soil neither drain nor flooring will be required the cellar may be used for the storage of root crops apples meats and household vegetables a partitioned room will accommodate either a summer or a winter dairy if not otherwise provided and a multitude of conveniences may be made of it in all well arranged farmeries but in all cases the cellar should be well lighted ventilated and dry even the ashhouse and smokehouse may be made in it with perfect convenience by brick or stone partitions and the smokehouse flue be carried up into one of the chimney flues above and thus make a more snug and compact arrangement than to have separate buildings for those objects a washroom in which also the soap may be made the tallow and lard tried up and other extraordinary labor when fire heat is to be used may properly be made in a cellar particularly when on a sloping ground and easy of access to the ground level on one side but as a general rule such room is better on a level with the main floor of the dwelling and there are usually sufficient occupations for the cellar without them all cellar walls should be at least 18 inches thick for even a wooden house and from that to 2 feet for a stone or brick one and well laid in strong limemortar unmortared cellar walls are frequently laid under wooden buildings and pointed with limemortar inside but this is sometimes dug out by rats and is apt to crumble and fall out otherwise a complete cellar wall should be thoroughly laid in mortar illustration farm house pages 101102 design iii we here present the reader with a substantial plain yet highlyrespectable stone or brick farm house of the second class suitable for an estate of three to five hundred acres and accommodation for a family of a dozen or more persons the style is mixed rural gothic italian and bracketed yet in keeping with the character of the farm and the farmers standing and occupation the main body of this house is 4224 feet on the ground and one and three quarter stories highthe chambers running two or three feet into the roof as choice or convenience may direct the roof has a pitch of 30 to 40 from a horizontal line and broadly spread over the walls say two and a half feet showing the ends of the rafters bracket fashion the chimneys pass out through the peak of the roof where the hips of what would otherwise be the gables connect with the long sides of the roof covering the front and rear on the long front is partly seen in the perspective a portico 1610 feetnot the chief entrance front but rather a side front practically which leads into a lawn or garden as may be most desirable and from which the best view from the house is commanded over this porch is a small gable running into the roof to break its monotony in which is a doorwindow leading from the upper hall on to the deck of the porch this gable has the same finish as the main roof by brackets the chamber windows are twothirds or threequarters the size of the lower ones thus showing the upper story not full height below the plates but running two to four feet into the garret the rear wing containing the entrance or business front is 2432 feet one and a half stories high with a pitch of roof not less than 35 and spread over the walls both at the eaves and gable in the same proportion as the roof to the main body in front of this is a porch or veranda eight feet wide with a low hipped roof in the front and rear roofs of this wing is a dormer window to light the chambers the gable to this wing is bold and gives it character by the breadth of its roof over the walls and the strong brackets by which it is supported the chimney is thrown up strong and boldly at the point of the roof indicating the everyday uses of the fireplaces below which although distinct and wide apart in their location on the ground floors are drawn together in the chambers thus showing only one escape through the roof the woodhouse in the rear of the wing has a roof of the same character and connects with the long building in the rear which has the same description of roof but hipped at one end that end over the workshop and next the woodhouse shows a bold gable like the wing of the house and affords room and light to the lumber room over the shop and also gives variety and relief to the otherwise too great sameness of roofappearance on the further side of the establishment illustration ground plan chamber plan interior arrangement as has been remarked the main entrance front to this house is from the wing veranda from which a well finished and sizeable door leads into the principal hall 248 feet in area and lighted by a fullsized window at the front end opposite the entrance door is the door leading into the parlor and farther along is the staircase under the upper landing of which a door leads into a dining or sittingroom as may be determined this hall is 10 feet high as are all the rooms of this lower main story in the chimney which adjoins the parlor side of this hall may be inserted a thimble for a hall stovepipe if this method of warming should be adopted the parlor into which a door leads from the hall is 1816 feet with two windows on the side shown in perspective and one on the front facing the lawn or garden it has also a fireplace near the hall door at the further angle is a door leading to an entry or passage on to the portico e is the entry just mentioned six feet square and lighted by a short sash one light deep over the outside door this portico may be made a pleasant summer afternoon and evening resort for the family by which the occupied rooms connect with the lawn or garden thus adding to its retired and private character opposite the parlor on the other side of this entry a door leads into a room 1812 feet which may be occupied as a family bedroom library or small sittingroom this is lighted by two windows and has a closet of 65 feet a fireplace is on the inner side of this room and near to that a door connects with a diningroom of the same size having a window in one end and a fireplace and closet of the same size as the last through the rear wall is a door leading into a pantry which also communicates with the kitchen and another door leads to the hall and from the hall under the staircases which at that point are sufficiently high for the purpose is a passage leading to the kitchen under the wing veranda near the point of intersection of the wing with the main body of the house is an everyday outer door leading into a small entry 65 feet and lighted by a low onesash window over the door by another door this leads to the kitchen or family room which is lighted by three windows an ample fireplace with oven c accommodates this room at the end a closet 75 feet also stands next to the entry and beyond that an open passage to the left leading out under the front hall stairs to the rooms of the main building a door also leads from that passage into a best pantry for choice crockery sweetmeats and teatable comforts another door near the last leads into a dairy or milkroom 98 feet beyond the passage in which last also may be placed a tier of narrow shelves this milk or dairyroom is lighted by a window in the end and connects also by a door in the side with the outer kitchen or washroom next to this milkroom door in the front kitchen is another door leading down cellar and through this door passing by the upper broad stair of the flight of cellar steps is another door into the washroom at the farther angle of the kitchen is still another door opening into a passage four feet wide and in that passage a door leading up a flight of stairs into the wing chambers this passage opens into the back kitchen or washroom 1616 feet in area and lighted by two windows one of which looks into the woodhouse in this washroom is a chimney with boilers and fireplace as may be required the cellar and chamber stairs and the milkroom are also accessible direct by doors leading from this washroom the chamber plan will be readily understood and requires no particular description the space over the wing may be partitioned off according to the plan or left more open for the accommodation of the work folks as occasion may demand but as this dwelling is intended for substantial people well to do in the world and who extend a generous hospitality to their friends a liberal provision of sleeping chambers is given to the main body of the house the parlor chamber which is the best or spare one is 1816 feet with roomy sideclosets besides this are other rooms for the daughters sally and nancy and fanny and possibly mary and elizabethwho want their own chambers which they keep so clean and tidy with closets full of nice bedclothes table linen towels c c for certain events not yet whispered of but quite sure to come round and then there are frederick and robert and george fine stalwart boys coming into manhood intending to be somebody in the world one day or another they must have their roomsand good ones too for if any people are to be well lodged why not those who toil for it all such accommodation every farm house of this character should afford and we need not go far or look sharp to see the best men and the best women in our state and nation graduating from the wholesome farm house thus tidily and amply provided how delightfully look the faroff mountains or the nearer plains or prairies from the lawn porch of this snug farm house the distant lake the shining river singing away through the valley or the wimpling brook stealing through the meadow aye enjoy them all for they are gods best richest gifts and we are made to love them the woodhouse strikes off from the back kitchen retreating two feet from its gable wall and is 3614 feet in size a bathing room may be partitioned off 86 feet on the rear corner next the washroom if required although not laid down in the plan at the further end is the watercloset 64 feet or if the size and convenience of the family require it a part of the woodhouse may be partitioned off for a washroom from which a chimney may pass up through the peak of the roof if so carry it up so high that it will be above the eddy that the wind may make in passing over the adjoining wing not causing it to smoke from that cause at the far end of the woodhouse is the workshop and toolhouse 1816 feet lighted by two windows and a door to enter it from beneath the woodhouse over this is the lumber and storeroom next to this is the swillroom and pigsty for the house pigs as described in the last design and over it a loft for farm seeds small grains and any other storage required adjoining this is the wagon and carriagehouse and above the hayloft stretching also partly over the stable which stands next with two stalls 125 feet each with a flight of stairs leading to the loft in the passage next the door in this loft are swinging windows to let in hay for the horses this completes the household establishment and we leave the surroundings to the correct judgment and good taste of the proprietor to complete as its position and the variety of objects with which it may be connected requires stone and brick we have mentioned as the proper materials for this house but it may be also built of wood if more within the means and limits of the builder there should be no pinching in its proportions but every part carried out in its full breadth and effect the cost of the whole establishment may be from 2000 to 3000 depending somewhat upon the material used and the finish put upon it the firstnamed sum would build the whole in an economical and plain manner while the latter would complete it amply in its details miscellaneous it may be an objection in the minds of some persons to the various plans here submitted that we have connected the outbuildings immediately with the offices of the dwelling itself we are well aware that such is not always usual but many years observation have convinced us that in their use and occupation such connection is altogether the most convenient and economical the only drawback is in the case of fire which if it occur in any one building the whole establishment is liable to be consumed this objection is conceded but we take it that it is the business of every one not able to be his own insurer to have his buildings insured by others and the additional cost of this insurance is not a tithe of what the extra expense of time labor and exposure is caused to the family by having the outbuildings disconnected and at a fireproof distance from each other there has too in the separation of these outbuildings we do not now speak of barns and houses for the stock and the farmwork proper from the main dwelling crept into the construction of such dwellings by modern builders some things which in a country establishment particularly ought never to be there such as privies or waterclosets as they are more genteelly called these last in our estimation have no business in a farmers house they are an effeminacy only and introduced by city life an appendage they should be but separated to some distance from the living rooms and accessible by sheltered passages to them the woodhouse should adjoin the outer kitchen because the fuel should always be handy and the outer kitchen or washroom is a sort of sloproom of necessity and the night wood and that for the morning fires may be deposited in it for immediate use the workshop and small toolhouse naturally comes next to that as being chiefly used in stormy weather next to this last would more conveniently come the carriage or wagonhouse and of course a stable for a horse or two for family use always accessible at night and convenient at unseasonable hours for farm labor in the same close neighborhood also should be a small pigsty to accommodate a pig or two to eat up the kitchen slops from the table refuse vegetables parings dishwater c c which could not well be carried to the main piggery of the farm unless the oldfashioned filthy mode of letting the hogs run in the road and a trough set outside the dooryard fence as seen in some parts of the country were adopted a pig can always be kept and fatted in three or four months from the wash of the house with a little grain in any wellregulated farmers family a few fowls may also be kept in a convenient henhouse if desired without offenceall constituting a part of the household economy of the place these outbuildings too give a comfortable domestic look to the whole concern each one shelters and protects the other and gives an air of comfort and repose to the wholea family expression all round what so naked and chilling to the feelings as to see a country dwellinghouse all perked up by itself standing literally out of doors without any dependencies about it no no first should stand the house the chief structure in the foreground appendant to that the kitchen wing next in grade the woodhouse covering in also the minor offices of the house then by way of setting up partially on their own account should come the workshop carriagehouse and stable as practically having a separate character but still subordinate to the house and its requirements and these too may have their piggery and henhouse by way of tapering off to the adjoining fence which encloses a kitchen garden or family orchard thus each structure is appropriate in its wayand together they form a combination grateful to the sight as a complete rural picture all objections on account of filth or vermin to this connection may be removed by a cleanly keeping of the premisesa removal of all offal immediately as it is made and daily or weekly taking it on to the manure heaps of the barns or depositing it at once on the grounds where it is required in point of health nothing is more congenial to sound physical condition than the occasional smell of a stable or the breath of a cow not within the immediate contiguity to the occupied rooms of the dwelling on the score of neatness therefore as we have placed them no bar can be raised to their adoption design iv this is perhaps a more ambitious house than either of the preceding although it may be adapted to a domain of the same extent and value it is plain and unpretending in appearance yet in its ample finish and deeply drawn sheltering eaves broad veranda and spacious outbuildings may give accommodation to a larger family indulging a more liberal style of living than the last by an error in the engraving the main roof of the house is made to appear like a double or gambrelroof breaking at the intersection of the gable or hanging roof over the ends this is not so intended the roofs on each side are a straight line of rafters the swiss or hanging style of gableroof is designed to give a more sheltered effect to the elevation than to run the end walls to a peak in the point of the roof by a defect in the drawing the roof of the veranda is not sufficiently thrown over the columns this roof should project at least one foot beyond them so as to perfectly shelter the mouldings beneath from the weather and conform to the style of the main roof of the house illustration farm house pages 115116 the material of which it is built may be of either stone brick or wood as the taste or convenience of the proprietor may suggest the main building is 4436 feet on the ground the cellar wall may show 18 to 24 inches above the ground and be pierced by windows in each end as shown in the plan the height of the main walls may be two full stories below the roof plates or the chambers may run a foot or two into the garret at the choice of the builder either of which arrangements may be permitted the front door opens from a veranda 28 feet long by 10 feet in depth dropping eight inches from the doorsill this veranda has a hipped roof which juts over the columns in due proportion with the roof of the house over its walls these columns are plain with brackets or braces from near their tops sustaining the plate and finish of the roof above which may be covered either with tin or zinc painted or closely shingled the walls of the house may be 18 to 20 feet high below the plates the roof a pitch of 30 to 45 which will afford an upper garret or store or small sleeping rooms if required and the eaves should project two to three feet as climate may demand over the walls a plain finishthat is ceiled underneathis shown in the design but brackets on the ends of the rafters beaded and finished may be shown if preferred the gables are swissroofed or truncated thus giving them a most sheltered and comfortable appearance particularly in a northerly climate the small gable in front relieves the roof of its monotony and affords light to the central garret the chimneys are carried out with partition flues and may be topped with square caps as necessity or taste may demand retreating three feet from the kitchen side of the house runs at right angles a wing 3018 feet one and a half stories high with a veranda eight feet wide in front next in rear of this continues a woodhouse 3018 feet one story high with ten feet posts and open in front the ground level of which is 18 inches below the floor of the wing to which it is attached the roof of these two is of like character with that of the main building adjoining this woodhouse and at right angles with it is a building 6818 feet projecting two feet outside the line of woodhouse and kitchen this building is one and a half stories high with 12 feet posts and roof in the same style and of equal pitch as the others illustration ground plan interior arrangement the front door from the veranda of the house opens into a hall 188 feet and 11 feet high amply lighted by sash windows on the sides and over the door from the rear of this hall runs a flight of easy stairs into the upper or chamber hall on one side of the lower hall a door leads into a parlor 18 feet square and 11 feet high lighted by three windows and warmed by an open stove or fireplace the pipe passing into a chimney flue in the rear a door passes from this parlor into a rear passage or entry thus giving it access to the kitchen and rear apartments at the back end of the front hall a door leads into the rear passage and kitchen and on the side opposite the parlor a door opens into the sitting or family room 1816 feet in area having an open fireplace and three windows on the hall side of this room a door passes into the kitchen 2216 feet and which may in case the requirements of the family demand it be made the chief family or living room and the last one described converted into a library in this kitchen which is lighted by two windows is a liberal open fireplace with an ample oven by its side and a sink in the outer corner a flight of stairs also leads to the rear chambers above and a corresponding flight under them to the cellar below a door at each end of these stairs leads into the back entry of the house and thus to the other interior rooms or through the rear outer door to the back porch this back entry is lighted by a single sash window over the outside door leading to the porch another door opposite that leading down cellar opens into the passage through the wing from the rear hall which is 165 feet the innermost passage leads into a family bedroom or nursery 1614 feet lighted by a window in each outside wall and warmed by an open fireplace or stove at pleasure attached to this bedroom is a clothescloset 84 feet with shelves and drawers next the outer door in rear end of the hall is a small closet opening from it 64 feet in dimensions convertible to any use which the mistress of the house may direct illustration chamber plan opening into the wing from the kitchen first is a large closet and pantry supplied with a table drawers and shelves in which are stored the dishes table furniture and edibles necessary to be kept at a moments access this room is 148 feet and well lighted by a window of convenient size if necessary this room may have a partition shutting off a part from the everyday uses which the family requires in this room so near to the kitchen to the sink to hotwater and the other little domestic accessories which good housewives know so well how to arrange and appreciate all the nice little tablecomforts can be got up and perfected and stored away under lock and key in drawer tub or jar at their discretion and still their eyes not be away from their subordinates in the other departments next to this and connected by a door is the dairy or milkroom also 148 feet which if necessary may be sunk three or four feet into the ground for additional coolness in the summer season and the floor reached by steps in this are ample shelves for the milkpans conveniences of churning c c but if the dairy be a prominent object of the farm a separate establishment will be required and the excavation may not be necessary for ordinary household uses out of this milkroom a door leads into a washroom 1814 feet a passage from the kitchen also leads into this the washroom is lighted by two windows in rear and one in front a sink is between the two rear windows with conductor leading outside and a closet beneath it for the iron ware in the chimney at the end are boilers and a fireplace an oven or anything else required and a door leading to a platform in the woodhouse and so into the yard on the other side of the chimney a door leads into a bathingroom 76 feet into which hot water is drawn from one of the boilers adjoining and cold water may be introduced by a handpump through a pipe leading into the well or cistern as no more convenient opportunity may present itself a word or two will be suggested as to the location of the bathroom in a country house in city houses or country houses designed for the summer occupancy of city dwellers the bathingrooms are usually placed in the second or chamber story and the water for their supply is drawn from cisterns still above them this arrangement in city houses is made chiefly from the want of room on the ground floor and also thus arranged in the citycountry houses because they are so constructed in the city in the farm house or in the country house proper occupied by whom it may be such arrangement is unnecessary expensive and inconvenient unnecessary because there is no want of room on the ground expensive because an upper cistern is always liable to leakages and a consequent wastage of water wetting and rotting out the floors and all the slopping and dripping which such accidents occasion and inconvenient from the continual upanddownstair labor of those who occupy the bath to say nothing of the piercing the walls of the house for the admission of pipes to lead in and let out the water and the thousandandone vexations by way of plumbers bills and expense of getting to and from the house itself always a distance of some miles from the mechanic the only defence for such location of the bathroom and cisterns is the convenience and privacy of access to them by the females of the family this counts but little if anything over the place appropriated in this and the succeeding designs of this work the access is almost if not quite as private as the other and in case of illhealth as easily approachable to invalids and on the score of economy in construction repair or accident the plan here adopted is altogether preferable in this plan the water is drawn from the boiler by the turning of a cock that from the cistern by a minutes labor with the handpump it is let off by the drawing of a plug and discharges by a short pipe into the adjoining garden or grassplat to moisten and invigorate the trees and plants which require it and the whole affair is clean and sweet again a screen for the window gives all the privacy required and the most fastidious shrinking female is as retired as in the shadiest nook of her dressingroom so with waterclosets a fashion prevails of thrusting these noisome things into the midst of sleeping chambers and living roomspandering to effeminacy and at times surcharging the housefor they cannot at all times and under all circumstances be kept perfectly closewith their offensive odor out of the house they belong and if they by any means find their way within its walls proper the fault will not be laid at our door to get back to our description this bathingroom occupies a corner of the woodhouse a raised platform passes from the washroom in past the bathroom to a watercloset which may be divided into two apartments if desirable the vaults are accessible from the rear for cleaning out or introducing lime gypsum powdered charcoal or other deodorizing material at the extreme corner of the woodhouse a door opens into a feed and swillroom 208 feet which is reached by steps and stands quite eighteen inches above the ground level on a stone underpinning or with a stone cellar beneath for the storage of roots in winter in one corner of this is a boiler and chimney for cooking food for the pigs and chickens a door leads from this room into the piggery 2012 feet where halfadozen swine may be kept a door leads from this pen into a yard in the rear where they will be less offensive than if confined within if necessary a flight of steps leading to the loft overhead may be built where corn can be stored for their feeding next to this is the workshop and toolhouse 1814 feet and in rear a snug warm house for the family chickens 186 feet these chickens may also have the run of the yard in rear with the pigs and apartments in the loft overhead for roosting adjoining the workshop is the carriage house 1818 feet with a flight of stairs to the hayloft above in which is also a dovecote and leading out of the carriage floor is the stable 1812 feet with stalls for two or four horses and a passage of four feet wide from the carriagehouse into it thus completing and drawing under one continuous roof and at less exposure than if separated the chief everyday requirements of living to a wellarranged and highlyrespectable family the chamber plan of the dwelling will be readily understood by reference to its arrangement there are a sufficiency of closets for all purposes and the whole are accessible from either flight of stairs the rooms over the wing of course should be devoted to the male domestics of the family workpeople c surrounding plantations shrubbery walks etc after the general remarks made in the preceding pages no particular instructions can be given for the manner in which this residence should be embellished in its trees and shrubbery the large forest trees always grand graceful and appropriate would become such a house throwing a protecting air around and over its quiet unpretending roof vines or climbing roses might throw their delicate spray around the columns of the modest veranda and a varied selection of familiar shrubbery and ornamental plants checker the immediate front and sides of the house looking out upon the lawn through which a spacious walk or carriageway should wind from the high road or chief approach there are however so many objects to be consulted in the various sites of houses that no one rule can be laid down for individual guidance the surface of the ground immediately adjoining the house must be considered the position of the house as it is viewed from surrounding objects its altitude or depression as affected by the adjacent lands its command upon surrounding near or distant objects in the way of prospect the presence of water either in stream pond or lake far or near or the absence of water altogetherall these enter immediately into the manner in which the lawn of a house should be laid out and worked and planted but as a rule all filagree work such as serpentine paths and tortuous unmeaning circles artificial piles of rock and a multitude of small ornamentsso esteemed by someshould never be introduced into the lawn of a farm house it is unmeaning in the first place expensive in its care in the second place unsatisfactory and annoying altogether such things about a farm establishment are neither dignified nor useful and should be left to townspeople having but a stinted appreciation of what constitutes natural beauty and wanting to make the most of the limited piece of ground of which they are possessed nor would we shut out by these remarks the beauty and odor of the flowerborders which are so appropriately the care of the good matron of the household and her comely daughters to them may be devoted a welldug plat beneath the windows or in the garden enough and to spare they should always have of such cheerful lifegiving pleasures we only object to their being strewed all over the grounda tussoc of plant here a patch of posey there and a scattering of both everywhere without either system or meaning they lower the dignity and simplicity of the country dwelling altogether the business approach to this house is of course toward the stables and carriagehouse and from them should lead off the main farmavenue the kitchen garden if possible should lie on the kitchen side of the house where also should be placed the beehouse in full sight from the windows that their labors and swarming may be watched in fact the entire economy of the farm house and its appendages should be brought close under the eye of the household to engage their care and watchfulness and to interest them in all the little associations and endearmentsand they are many when properly studied outwhich go to make agricultural life one of the most agreeable pursuits if not altogether so in which our lot in life may be cast a fruitgarden too should be a prominent object near this house we are now advancing somewhat into the elegances of agricultural life and although fruit trees and good fruits too should hold a strong place in the surroundings of even the humblest of all country placessufficient at least for the ample use of the familythey have not yet been noticed to any extent in those already described it may be remarked that the fruitgardenthe orchard for market purposes is not here intendedshould be placed in near proximity to the house all the small fruits for household use such as strawberries raspberries currants gooseberries blackberries grapes as well as apricots plums nectarines peaches pears apples quinces or whatever fruits may be cultivated in different localities should be close by for the convenience of collecting them and to protect them from destruction by vermin birds or the depredations of creatures called human a decided plan of arrangement for all the plantations and grounds should enter into the composition of the site for the dwelling outhouses gardens c as they are to appear when the whole establishment is completed and nothing left to accident chance or afterthought which can be disposed of at the commencement by the adoption of such a course the entire composition is more easily perfected and with infinitely greater expression of character than if left to the chance designs or accidental demands of the future another feature should be strictly enforced in the outward appointments of the farm houseand that is the entire withdrawal of any use of the highway in its occupation by the stock of the farm except in leading them to and from its enclosures nothing looks more slovenly and nothing can be more unthrifty in an enclosed country than the running of farm stock in the highway what so untidy as the approach to a house with a herd of filthy hogs rooting about the fences basking along the sidewalk or feeding at a huge uncouth hollowed log in the road near the dwelling it may be out of place here to speak of it but this disgusting spectacle has so often offended our sight at the approach of an otherwise pleasant farm establishment that we cannot forego the opportunity to speak of it the road lying in front or between the different sections of the farm should be as well and as cleanly kept as any portion of the enclosures and it is equally a sin against good taste and neighborhoodmorality to have it otherwise treeplanting in the highway this is frequently recommended by writers on country embellishment as indispensable to a finished decoration of the farm such may or may not be the fact trees shade the roads when planted on their sides and so they partially do the fields adjoining making the first muddy in bad weather by preventing the sun drying them and shading the crops of the last by their overhanging foliage in the season of their growth thus they are an evil in moist and heavy soils yet in light soils their shade is grateful to the highway traveler and not perhaps injurious to the crops of the adjoining field and when of proper kinds they add grace and beauty to the domain in which they stand we do not therefore indiscriminately recommend them but leave it to the discretion of the farmer to decide for himself having seen estates equally pleasant with and without trees on the roadside nothing however can be more beautiful than a clump of trees in a pastureground with a herd or a flock beneath them near the road or the grand and overshadowing branches of stately tree in a rich meadow leaning perhaps over the highway fence or flourishing in its solitary grandeur in the distanceeach and all imposing features in the rural landscape all such should be preserved with the greatest care and solicitude as among the highest and most attractive ornaments which the farm can boast illustration farm house pages 131132 design v we here present a dwelling of a more ambitious and pretending character than any one which we have as yet described and calculated for a large and wealthy farmer who indulges in the elegances of country life dispenses a liberal hospitality and is every way a country gentleman such as all our farmers of ample means should be it will answer the demands of the retired man of business as well and is perhaps as full in its various accommodation as an american farm or country house may require it claims no distinct style of architecture but is a composition agreeable in effect and appropriate to almost any part of the country and its climate its site may be on either hill or plainwith a view extensive or restricted it may look out over broad savannas cultivated fields and shining waters it may nestle amid its own quiet woods and lawn in its own selected shade and retirement or lord it over an extensive park ranged by herds and flocks meandered by its own stream spreading anon into the placid lake or rushing swiftly over its own narrow bedan independent substantial convenient and wellconditioned home standing upon its own broad acres and comporting with the character and standing of its occupant among his friends and neighbors the main building is 5040 feet in area upon the ground two stories high the ground story 11 feet high its floor elevated 2 or 3 feet above the level of the surrounding surface as its position may demand the chambers 9 feet high and running 2 feet into the roof the rear wing is one and a half stories high 3616 feet the lower rooms 11 feet high with a one story leanto range of closets and small rooms on the weather side 8 feet in width and 9 feet high in the rear of these is a woodhouse 3020 feet with 10 feet posts dropped to a level with the ground at the extremity of this is a building by way of an l 6020 feet one and a half stories high with a leanto 1230 feet in the rear the ground rooms of this are elevated 1 feet above the ground and 9 feet high a broad roof covers the whole standing at an angle of 40 or 45 above a horizontal line and projecting widely over the walls 2 to 3 feet on the main building and 2 feet on the others to shelter them perfectly from the storms and damps of the weather a small cupola stands out of the ridge of the rear building which may serve as a ventilator to the apartments and lofts below and in it may be hung a bell to summon the household or the field laborers as the case may be to their duties or their meals the design as here shown is rather florid and perhaps profusely ornamental in its finish as comporting with the taste of the day but the cut and moulded trimmings may be left off by those who prefer a plain finish and be no detriment to the general effect which the deep friezes of the roofs properly cased beneath may give to it such indeed is our own taste but this full finish has been added to gratify such as wish the full ornament which this style of building may admit illustration ground plan interior arrangement the front of this house is accommodated by a porch or veranda 40 feet long and 10 feet wide with a central or entrance projection of 18 feet in length and 12 feet in width the floor of which is eight inches below the main floor of the house the wings or sides of this veranda may be so fitted up as to allow a pleasant conservatory on each side of the entrance area in winter by enclosing them with glass windows and the introduction of heat from a furnace under the main hall in the cellar of the house this would add to its general effect in winter and if continued through the summer would not detract from its expression of dignity and refinement from the veranda a door in the center of the front with two side windows leads into the main hall which is 2612 feet in area two feet in the width of which is taken from the rooms on the right of the main entrance on the left of the hall a door opens into a parlor or drawingroom marked p 20 feet square with a bay window on one side containing three sashes and seats beneath a single window lights the front opening on to the veranda on the opposite side to this is the fireplace with blank walls on each side on the opposite side of the hall is a library 1816 feet with an end window and a corresponding one to the parlor in front looking out on the veranda in case these portions of the veranda opposite the two front windows are occupied as conservatories these windows should open to the floor to admit a walk immediately into them at the farther corner of the library a narrow door leads into an office or business apartment 128 feet and opening by a broad door the upper half of which is a lighted sash this door leads from the office out on a small porch with a floor and two columns 85 feet and nine feet high with a gable and double roof of the same pitch as the house between the chimney flues in the rear of this room may be placed an iron safe or chest for the deposit of valuable papers and although small a table and chairs sufficient to accommodate the business requirements of the occupant may be kept in it a chimney stands in the center of the inner wall of the library in which may be a fireplace or a flue to receive a stovepipe whichever may be preferred for warming the room near the hall side of the library a door opens into a passage leading into the family bedroom or nursery a portion of this passage may be shelved and fitted up as a closet for any convenient purpose the nursery is 1816 feet in size lighted by two windows it may have an open fireplace or a stove as preferred let into the chimney corresponding to that in the library these two chimneys may either be drawn together in the chambers immediately above or carried up separately into the garret and pass out of the roof in one stack or they maybe built in one solid mass from the cellar bottom but they are so placed here as saving room on the floors and equally accommodating in their separate divisions the stovepipes that may lead into them on the inner side of the nursery a door leads into a large closet or childs sleepingroom 98 feet or it may be used as a dressingroom with a sash inserted in the door to light it a door may also lead from it into the small rear entry of the house and thus pass directly out without communicating with the nursery on the extreme left corner of the nursery is a door leading into the back entry by which it communicates either with the rear porch the diningroom or the kitchen such a room we consider indispensable to the proper accommodation of a house in the country as saving a world of upanddownstairs labor to her who is usually charged with the domestic cares and supervision of the family on the right of the main hall an ample staircase leads into the upper hall by a landing and broad stair at eight feet above the floor and a rightangled flight from that to the main floor above under this main hall staircase a door and stairs may lead into the cellar beyond the turning flight below a door leads into the back hall or entry already mentioned which is 134 feet in area which also has a side passage of 84 feet and a door leading to the rear porch and another into the kitchen at its farther side near the outer one opposite the turning flight of stairs in the main hall is also a door leading to the diningroom 2016 feet this is lighted by a large double window at the end a fireplace or stove flue is in the center wall and on each side a closet for plate or table furniture these closets come out flush with the chimney at the extreme right corner a door leads into the rear entryor this may be omitted at pleasure another door in the rear wall leads into the kitchen past the passage down into the cellaror this may be omitted if thought best still another door to the left opens into a large dining closet of the back leanto apartments 88 feet this closet is lighted by a window of proper architectural size and fitted up with a suite of drawers shelves table and cupboards required for the preparation and deposit of the lighter family stores and edibles from this closet is also a door leading into the kitchen through which may be passed all the meats and cookery for the table either for safekeeping or immediate service here the thrifty and careful housekeeper and her assistants may shut apart and by themselves get up fabricate and arrange all their table delicacies with the greatest convenience and privacy together with ease of access either to the diningroom or kitchenan apartment most necessary in a liberallyarranged establishment from the rear entry opens a door to the kitchen passing by the rear chamber stairs this flight of stairs may be entered directly from the kitchen leading either to the chamber or under them into the cellar without coming into the passage connecting with the entry or diningroom if preferred in such case a broad stair of thirty inches in width should be next the door on which to turn as the door would be at right angles with the stairs either up or down the kitchen is 2016 feet and 11 feet high it has an outer door leading on the rear porch and a window on each side of that door also a window under which is a sink on the opposite side at the end of a passage four feet wide leading through the leanto it has also an open fireplace and an oven by the side of itold fashion it may be also furnished with a cooking range or stovethe smoke and fumes leading by a pipe into a flue into the chimney on the leanto side is a milk or dairyroom 88 feet lighted by a window here also the kitchen furniture and meats may be stored in cupboards made for the purpose in rear of the kitchen and leading from it by a door through a lighted passage next the rear porch is the washroom 1616 feet lighted by a large window from the porch side a door also leads out of the rear on to a platform into the woodhouse another door leads from the washroom into a bathroom in the leanto 88 feet into which warm water is drawn by a pipe and pump from the boiler in the washroom or if preferred the bathroom may be entered from the main kitchen by the passage next the sink this bathroom is lighted by a window next to the bathroom is a bedroom for a man servant who has charge of the fires and heavy housework wood c c this bedroom is also 88 feet and lighted by a window in the leanto in front of this washroom and kitchen is a porch eight inches below the floor six feet wide with a railing or not as may be preferred the railing is made in the cut a platform three feet wide leads from the back door of the washroom to a watercloset for the family proper the woodhouse is open in front with a single post supporting the center of the roof at the extreme outer angle is a watercloset for the domestics of the establishment adjoining the woodhouse and opening from it into the l before mentioned is a workshop and smalltoolhouse 2016 feet lighted by a large double window at one end in this should be a carpenters workbench and toolchest for the repairs of the farming utensils and vehicles overhead is a storeroom for lumber or whatever else may be necessary for use in that capacity next to this is a granary or feedroom 2010 feet with a small chimney in one corner where may be placed a boiler to cook food for pigs poultry c as the case may be here may also be bins for storage of grain and meal leading out of this is a flight of stairs passing to the chamber above and a passage four feet wide through the rear into a yard adjoining at the further end of the stairs a door opens into a poultry house 1610 feet including the stairs the poultry room is lighted at the extreme left corner by a broad window in this may be made roosts and nesting places and feeding troughs a low door under the window may be also made for the fowls in passing to the rear yard adjoining the granary and leading to it by a door is the carriagehouse 2020 feet at the gable end of which are large doors for entrance from the carriagehouse is a broad passage of six feet into the stables which are 12 feet wide and occupy the leanto this leanto is eight feet high below the eaves with two double stalls for horses and a door leading into the side yard with the doors of the carriagehouse a window also lights the rear of the stables a piggery 12 feet square occupies the remainder of the leanto in rear of the poultryhouse in which two or three pigs can always be kept and fatted on the offal of the house for small pork at any season apart from the swine stock of the farm a door leads out of the piggery into the rear yard where range also the poultry as the shed roof shuts down on to the pigsty and stables no loft above them is necessary in the loft over the granary poultry and carriagehouse is deposited the hay put in there through the doors which appear in the design chamber planthis is easily understood at the head of the stairs over the main hall is a large passage leading to the porch and opening by a doorwindow on the middle deck of the veranda which is nearly level and tinned or coppered watertight as are also the two sides on either side of this upper hall is a door leading to the front sleeping chambers which are well closeted and spacious if it be desirable to construct more sleepingrooms they can be partitioned laterally from the hall and doors made to enter them a rear hall is cut off from the front lighted by a window over the lower rear porch and a door leads into a further passage in the wing four feet wide which leads down a flight of stairs into the kitchen below at the head of this flight is a chamber 2012 feet for the female domestics sleepingroom in which may be placed a stove if necessary passing its pipe into the kitchen chimney which passes through it illustration chamber plan it is also lighted by a window over the leanto on the side back of this at the end of the passage is the sleepingroom 16 feet square for the menfolks lighted on both sides by a window this may also be warmed if desired by a stove the pipe passing into the kitchen chimney the cellar may extend under the entire house and wing as convenience or necessity may require if it be constructed under the main body only an offset should be excavated to accommodate the cellar stairs three feet in width and walled in with the rest a wide outer passage with a flight of steps should also be made under the rear nursery window for taking in and passing out bulky articles with double doors to shut down upon it and partition walls should be built to support the partitions of the large rooms above many minor items of detail might be mentioned all of which are already treated in the general remarks under their proper heads in the body of the work and which cannot here be noticedsuch as the mode of warming it the construction of furnaces c it may by some builders be considered a striking defect in the interior accommodation of a house of this character that the chief entrance hall should not be extended through from its front to the rear as is common in many of the large mansions of our country we object to the large open hall for more than one reason except possibly in a house for summer occupation only in the first place it is uncomfortable in subjecting the house to an unnecessary draught of air when it is not needed in cold weather secondly it cuts the house into two distinct parts making them inconvenient of access in crossing its wide surface thirdly it is uneconomical in taking up valuable room that can be better appropriated for summer ventilation it is unnecessary that may be given by simply opening the front door and a chamber window connected with the hall above through which a current of fresh air will always pass another thing the hall belongs to the front or dress part of the house and should be cut off from the more domestic and common apartments by a partition although accessible to them and not directly communicating with such apartments which cannot of necessity be in keeping with its showy and pretending character it should contain only the front flight of stairs as a part of its appointments besides the doors leading to its best apartments on the ground floor which should be centrally placedits rear door being of a less pretending and subordinate character thus the hall with its open doors connecting the best rooms of the house on each side with its ample flight of stairs in the background gives a distinct expression of superiority in occupation to the other and humbler portions of the dwelling in winter too how much more snug and comfortable is the house shut in from the prying winds and shivering cold of the outside air which the opposite outer doors of an open hall cannot in their continual opening and shutting altogether exclude our own experience and we believe the experience of most housekeepers will readily concede its defects and after full reflection we have excluded it as both unnecessary and inconvenient another objection has been avoided in the better class of houses here presented which has crept into very many of the designs of modern builders which is that of using the living rooms of the family more or less as passages from the kitchen apartments in passing to and from the front hall or chief entrance such we consider a decided objection and hence arose probably the older plans of bygone years of making the main hall reach back to the kitchen itself this is here obviated by a cutting up of the rear section of the hall by which a passage in all cases of the better kind of dwelling is preserved without encroaching upon the occupied rooms in passing out and in to be sure the front door is not the usual passage for the laborers or servants of the house but they are subject any hour of the day to be called there to admit those who may come and the continual opening of a private room for such purposes is most annoying therefore as matter of convenience and as a decided improvement on the designs above noticed we have adhered strictly to the separate rear passage the garret also as we have arranged our designs is either altogether left out or made a quite unimportant part of the dwelling it is but a lumber room at best and should be approached only by a flight of steps from a rear chamber or passage and used as a receptacle for useless traps or castoff furniture seldom wanted it is hot in summer and cold in winter unfit for decent lodging to any human being in the house and of little account any way we much prefer running the chambers partially into the roof which we think gives them a more comfortable expression and admits of a better ventilation by carrying their ceilings higher without the expense of high body walls to the house which would give them an otherwise naked look if it be objected that thus running the chambers above the plates of the roof prevents the insertion of proper ties or beams to hold the roof plates together to prevent their spreading we answer that he must be a poor mechanic who cannot in framing the chamber partitions so connect the opposite plates as to insure them against all such difficulty a sheltered comfortable aspect is that which should distinguish every farm house and the cottage chamber is one of its chiefest characteristics and this can only be had by running such apartments into the roof as in our design construction a house of this kind must according to its locality and the material of which it is built be liable to wide differences of estimate in its cost and from our own experience in such matters any estimate here made we know cannot be reliable as a rule for other localities where the prices of material and labor are different from our own where lumber stone and brick abound and each are to be had at reasonable prices the cost of an establishment of this kind would not vary much in the application of either one of these materials for the walls if well and substantially constructed there should be no sham nor slight in any part of the building as already observed the design shows a high degree of finish which if building for ourself we should not indulge in a plain style of cornice and veranda finish we should certainly adopt but the roof should not be contracted in its projecting breadth over the walls in any part of the structureif anything it should be more extended the baywindow is an appendage of luxury only great care should be had in attaching its roof to the adjoining outer wall to prevent leakage of any kind if the walls be of brick or stone a beam or lintel of wood should be inserted in the wall over the windowopening quite two inchesthree would be betterback from its outer surface to receive the casing of the window that the drip of the wall and the driving of the storms may fall over the connecting joints of the window roof beyond its point of junction with it such also should be the case with the intersection of the veranda or porch roof with the wall of the house wherever a veranda or porch is adopted as simply joined on to a flush surface as such appendages usually areeven if ever so well doneleakage and premature decay is inevitable the style of finish must of course influence in a considerable degree its cost it may with the plainest finish be done for 4000 and from that up to 6000 every one desirous to build should apply to the best mechanics of his neighborhood for information on that point as in such matters they are the best judges and from experience in their own particular profession of what the cost of building must be the rules and customs of housekeeping vary in different sections of the united states and the canadas these also enter into the estimates for certain departments of building and must be considered in the items of expenditure the manner in which houses should be warmed the ventilation accommodation for servants and laborers the appropriations to hospitalityall will have a bearing on the expense of which we cannot be the proper judge a sufficient time should be given to build a house of this character a house designed and built in a hurry is never a satisfactory house in its occupation a year is little enough and if two years be occupied in its design and construction the more acceptable will probably be its finish and the more comfort will be added in its enjoyment grounds plantations and surroundings a house of this kind should never stand in vulgar and familiar contact with the highway but at a distance from it of one hundred to a thousand yards or even if the estate on which it is built be extensive a much greater distance breadth of ground between the highway and the dwelling adds dignity and character to its appearance an ample lawn or a spreading park well shaded with trees should lay before it through which a wellkept avenue leads to its front and most frequented side the various offices and buildings of the farm itself should be at a respectable distance from it so as not to interfere with its proper keeping as a genteel country residence its occupant is not to be supposed as under the necessity of toiling with his daily laborers in the fields and therefore although he may be strictly a man of business he has sufficient employment in planning his work and managing his estate through a foreman in the various laboroccupations of the estate his horse may be at his door in the earliest morning hours that he may inspect his fields and give timely directions to his laborers or view his herds or his flocks before his breakfast hour or an early walk may take him to his stables his barns or to see that his previous directions are executed the various accommodation appurtenant to the dwelling makes ample provision for the household convenience of the family and the main business of the farm may be at some distance without inconvenience to the owners everyday affairs consequently the indulgence of a considerable degree of ornament may be given in the surroundings of his dwelling which the occupant of a less extensive estate would neither require nor his circumstances warrant a natural forest of stately trees properly thinned out is the most appropriate spot on which to build a house of this character but that not at hand it should be set off with plantations of forest trees of the largest growth as in keeping with its own liberal dimensions a capacious kitchen garden should lead off from the rear apartments well stocked with all the family vegetables and culinary fruits in their proper seasons a luxuriant fruitgarden may flank the least frequented side of the house neat and tasteful flower beds may lie beneath the windows of the rooms appropriated to the leisure hours of the family to which the smaller varieties of shrubbery may be added separated from the chief lawn or park only by a wire fence or a simple railing such as not to cut up and checker its simple and dignified surface and all these shut in on the rear from the adjoining fields of the farm by belts of large shrubbery closely planted or the larger orchards thus giving it a style of its own yet showing its connection with the pursuits of the farm and its dependence upon it these various appointments however may be either carried out or restricted according to the requirements of the family occupying the estate and the prevailing local taste of the vicinity in which it is situated but no narrow or stingy spirit should be indicated in the general plan or in its execution every appointment connected with it should indicate a liberality of purpose in the founder without which its effect is painfully marred to the eye of the man of true taste and judgment small yards picketed in for small uses have no business in sight of the grounds in front and all minor concerns should be thrown into the rear beyond observation from the main approach to the dwelling the trees that shade the entrance park or lawn should be chiefly forest trees as the oak in its varieties the elm the maple the chestnut walnut butternut hickory or beech if the soil be favorable a few weeping willows may throw their drooping spray around the house and if exotic or foreign trees be permitted they should take their position in closer proximity to it than the natural forest trees as indicating the higher care and cultivation which attaches to its presence the lombardy poplar albeit a tree of disputed taste with modern planters we would now and then throw in not in stiff and formal rows as guarding an avenue but occasionally in the midst of a group of others above which it should rise like a church spire from amidst a block of contiguous housesa cheerful relief to the monotony of the rounderheaded branches of the more spreading varieties if a stream of water meander the park or spread into a little pond trees which are partial to moisture should shadow it at different points and low water shrubs should hang over its border or even run into its margin aquatic herbs too may form a part of its ornaments and a boathouse if such a thing be necessary should under the shade of a hanging tree of some kind be a conspicuous object in the picture an overhanging rock if such a thing be native there may be an object of great attraction to its features and its outlet may steal away and be hid in a dense mass of tangled vines and brushwood the predominating natural features of the place should be cultivated not rooted out and metamorphosed into something foreign and unfamiliar it should in short be nature with her hair combed out straight flowing and graceful instead of pinched puffed and curlinga thing of luxuriance and beauty under the hand of a master the great difficulty with many americans in getting up a new place of any considerable extent is that they seem to think whatever is common or natural in the features of the spot must be so changed as to show above all others their own ingenuity and love of expense in fashioning it to their peculiar tastes rocks must be sunk or blasted trees felled and bushes grubbed crooked watercourses straightenedthe place gibbeted and put into stocks in fact that their own boasted handiwork may rise superior to the wisdom of him who fashioned it in his own good pleasure forgetting that a thousand points of natural beauty upon the earth on which they breathe are when unadorned adorned the most and our eye has been frequently shocked at finding the choicest gems of nature sacrificed to a wanton display of expense in perverting to the indulgence of a mistaken fancy that which with an eye to truth and propriety and at a trifling expense might have become a spot of abiding interest and contentment design vi a southern or plantation housethe proprietor of a plantation in the south or southwest requires altogether a different kind of residence from the farmer of the northern or middle states he resides in the midst of his own principality surrounded by a retinue of dependents and laborers who dwell distant and apart from his own immediate family although composing a community requiring his daily care and superintendence for a great share of his time a portion of them are the attachs of his household yet so disconnected in their domestic relations as to require a separate accommodation and yet be in immediate contiguity with it and of course an arrangement of living widely different from those who mingle in the same circle and partake at the same board illustration farm house pages 155156 the usual plan of housebuilding at the south we are aware is to have detached servants rooms and offices and a space of some yards of uncovered way intervene between the family rooms of the chief dwelling and its immediate dependents such arrangement however we consider both unnecessary and inconvenient and we have devised a plan of household accommodation which will bring the family of the planter himself and their servants although under different roofs into convenient proximity with each other a design of this kind is here given the style is mainly italian plain substantial yet we think becoming the broad veranda stretching around three sides including the front gives an air of sheltered repose to what might otherwise appear an ambitious structure and the connected apartments beyond show a quiet utility which divests it of an over attempt at display nothing has been attempted for appearance solely beyond what is necessary and proper in the dwelling of a planter of good estate who wants his domestic affairs well regulated and his family and servants duly provided with convenient accommodation the form of the main dwelling is nearly square upright with two full stories giving ample area of room and ventilation together with that appropriate indulgence to ease which the enervating warmth of a southern climate renders necessary the servants apartments and kitchen offices are so disposed that while connected to render them easy of access they are sufficiently remote to shut off the familiarity of association which would render them obnoxious to the most fastidiousall in fact under one shelter and within the readiest call such should be the construction of a planters house in the united states and such this design is intended to give a stable and carriagehouse in the same style is near by not connected to any part of the dwelling as in the previous designswith sufficient accommodation for coachman and grooms and the number of saddle and carriage horses that may be required for either business or pleasure and to it may be connected in the rear in the same style of building or plainer and less expensive further conveniences for such domestic animals as may be required for family use the whole stands in open grounds and may be separated from each other by enclosures as convenience or fancy may direct the roofs of all the buildings are broad and sweeping well protecting the walls from storm and frosts as well as the glaring influences of the sun and combining that comfortable idea of shelter and repose so grateful in a wellconditioned country house it is true that the dwelling might be more extensive in room and the purposes of luxury enlarged but the planter on five hundred or five thousand acres of land can here be sufficiently accommodated in all the reasonable indulgences of family enjoyment and a liberal even an elegant and prolonged hospitality to which he is so generally inclined the chimneys of this house different from those in the previous designs are placed next the outer walls thus giving more space to the interior and not being required as in the others to promote additional warmth than their fireplaces will give to the rooms a deck on the roof affords a pleasant lookout for the family from its top guarded by a parapet and giving a finish to its architectural appearance and yet making no ambitious attempt at expensive ornament it is in fact a plain substantial respectable mansion for a gentleman of good estate and nothing beyond it illustration ground plan interior arrangement this house stands 5040 feet

passage from the main dwelling a door opens into the kitchen which is 2418 feet in size accommodated with two windows looking on to the porch just described at one end is an open fireplace with a cooking range on one side and an oven on the other at the left of the entrance door is a large commodious storeroom and pantry 129 feet lighted by a window and adjoining it and may be connected with it by a door if necessary a kitchen closet of the same size also connected by a corresponding door from the opposite corner of the kitchen between these doors is a flight of stairs leading to the sleepingrooms above and a cellar passage beneath them in the farther right corner of the kitchen a door leads into a smaller closet 86 feet lighted by a small window looking on to the rear porch at the end a door at the rear of the kitchen leads out into the porch of the washroom beyond which is six feet wide and another door into the washroom itself which is 2016 feet and furnished with a chimney and boilers a window looks out on the extreme right hand and two windows on to the porch in front a door opens from its rear wall into the woodhouse 3212 feet which stands open on two sides supported by posts and under the extended roof of the washroom and its porch just mentioned a servants watercloset is attached to the extreme right corner of the woodhouse by way of leanto the bathroom is 106 feet in area and supplied with water from the kitchen boilers adjoining the watercloset beyond is 6 feet square and architecturally in its roof may be made a fitting termination to that of the porch leading to it illustration chamber plan the main flight of stairs in the entrance hall leads on to a broad landing in the spacious upper hall from which doors pass into the several chambers which may be duly accommodated with closets the passage connecting with the upper story of the servants offices opens from the rear section of this upper hall and by the flight of rear stairs communicates with the kitchen and outbuildings a garret flight of steps may be made in the rear section of the main upper hall by which that apartment may be reached and the upper deck of the roof ascended the sleepingrooms of the kitchen may be divided off as convenience may dictate and the entire structure thus appropriated to every accommodation which a wellregulated family need require illustration carriage house the carriagehouse is 4824 feet in size with a projection of five feet on the entrance front the door of which leads both into the carriageroom and stables on the right is a bedroom 108 feet for the grooms lighted by a window and beyond are six stalls for horses with a window in the rear wall beyond them a flight of stairs leads to the hayloft above in the rear of the carriageroom is a harnessroom 124 feet and a granary of the same size each lighted by a window if farther attachments be required for the accommodation of outbuilding conveniences they may be continued indefinitely in the rear miscellaneous it may strike the reader that the house just described has a lavish appropriation of veranda and a needless sidefront which latter may detract from the precise architectural keeping that a dwelling of this pretension should maintain in regard to the first it may be remarked that no feature of the house in a southern climate can be more expressive of easy comfortable enjoyment than a spacious veranda the habits of southern life demand it as a place of exercise in wet weather and the cooler seasons of the year as well as a place of recreation and social intercourse during the fervid heats of the summer indeed many southern people almost live under the shade of their verandas it is a delightful place to take their meals to receive their visitors and friends and the veranda gives to a dwelling the very expression of hospitality so far as any one feature of a dwelling can do it no equal amount of accommodation can be provided for the same cost it adds infinitely to the room of the house itself and is in fact indispensable to the full enjoyment of a southern house the side front in this design is simply a matter of convenience to the owner and occupant of the estate who has usually much office business in its management and in the almost daily use of his library where such business may be done a side door and front is both appropriate and convenient the chief front entrance belongs to his family and guests and should be devoted to their exclusive use and as a light fence may be thrown off from the extreme end of the side porch separating the front lawn from the rear approach to the house the veranda on that side may be reached from its rear end for business purposes without intruding upon the lawn at all so we would arrange it objections may be made to the sameness of plan in the arrangement of the lower rooms of the several designs which we have submitted such as having the nursery or family sleepingroom on the main floor of the house and the uniformity in location of the others and that there are no new and striking features in them the answer to these may be that the room appropriated for the nursery or bedroom may be used for other purposes equally as well that when a mode of accommodation is already as convenient as may be it is poorly worth while to make it less convenient merely for the sake of variety and that utility and convenience are the main objects to be attained in any wellordered dwelling these two requisites utility and convenience attained the third and principal onecomfortis secured cellar kitchensthe most abominable nuisances that ever crept into a country dwellingmight have been adopted no doubt to the especial delight of some who know nothing of the experimental duties of housekeeping but the recommendation of these is an offence which we have no stomach to answer for hereafter steep winding and complicated staircases might have given a new feature to one or another of the designs dark closets intricate passages unique cubbyholes and all sorts of inside gimcrackery might have amused our pencil but we have avoided them as well as everything which would stand in the way of the simplest cheapest and most direct mode of reaching the object in view a convenient comfortablyarranged dwelling within having a respectable dignified appearance withoutand such we trust have been thus far presented in our designs lawn and park surroundings the trees and shrubbery which ornament the approach to this house should be rather of the graceful varieties than otherwise the weepingwillow the horsechesnut the mountainash if suitable to the climate or the chinatree of the south or the linden the weepingelm and the silvermaple with its long slender branches and hanging leaves would add most to the beauty and comport more closely with the character of this establishment than the more upright stiff and unbending trees of our american forests the lombardypoplaralbeit an object of fashionable derision with many treefanciers in these more tasty days as it was equally the admiration of our fathers of forty years agowould set off and give effect to a mansion of this character either in a clump at the background as shown in the design or occasionally shooting up its spirelike top through a group of the other trees yet if built in a fine natural park or lawn of oaks with a few other trees such as we have named planted immediately around it this house would still show with fine effect the style of finish given to this dwelling may appear too ornate and expensive for the position it is supposed to occupy if so a plainer mode of finish may be adopted to the cheapest degree consistent with the manner of its construction still on examination there will be found little intricate or really expensive work upon it strength substance durability should all enter into its composition and without these elements a house of this appearance is a mere bauble not fit to stand upon the premises of any man of substantial estate if a more extensive accommodation be necessary than the size of this house can afford its style will admit of a wing of any desirable length on each side in place of the rear part of the side verandas without prejudice to its character or effect indeed such wings may add to its dignity and consequence as comporting with the standing and influence which its occupant may hold in the community wherein he resides a man of mark indeed should if he live in the country occupy a dwelling somewhat indicating the position which he holds both in society and in public affairs by this remark we may be treading on questionable ground in our democratic country but practically there is a fitness in it which no one can dispute not that extravagance pretension or any other assumption of superiority should mark the dwelling of the distinguished man but that his dwelling be of like character with himself plain dignified solid and as a matter of course altogether respectable it is a happy feature in the composition of our republican institutions both social and political that we can afford to let the flashy men of the daynot of timeflaunter in all their purchased fancy in housebuilding without prejudice to the prevailing sober sentiment of their neighbors in such particulars the man of money simply may build his villa and squander his tens of thousands upon it he may riot within it and fidget about it for a few brief years he may even hang his coat of arms upon it if he can fortunately do so without stumbling over a lapstone or greasing his coat against the pans of a cookshop but it is equally sure that no child of his will occupy it after him even if his own changeable fancy or circumstances permit him to retain it for his natural life such are the episodes of country housebuilding and of frequent attempts at agricultural life by those who affect it as a matter of ostentation or display for the subjects of these we do not write but there is something exceedingly grateful to the feelings of one of stable views in life to look upon an estate which has been long in an individual family still maintaining its primitive character and respectability some fiveandtwenty years ago when too young to have any established opinions in matters of this sort as we were driving through one of the old farming towns in massachusetts about twenty miles west of boston we approached a comfortable wellconditioned farm with a tavernhouse upon the high road and several great elms standing about it the road passed between two of the trees and from a crossbeam lodged across their branches swung a large square sign with names and dates painted upon itname and date we have forgotten it was a good old puritan name howeverin this wise john endicott 1652 john endicott 1696 john endicott 1749 john endicott 1784 john endicott 1817 as our eyes read over this list we were struck with the stability of a family who for many consecutive generations had occupied by the same name that venerable spot and ministered to the comfort of as many generations of travelers and incontinently took off our hat in respect to the record of so much worth drove our horse under the shed had him fed went in and took a quiet family dinner with the civil goodtempered host and the equally kindmannered hostess then in the prime of life surrounded with a fine family of children and heard from his own lips the history of his ancestors from their first emigration from englandnot in the mayflower to whose immeasurable accommodations our good new england ancestors are so prone to referbut in one of her early successors all over the old thirteen states from maine to georgia can be found agricultural estates now containing families the descendants of those who founded themexceptions to the general rule we admit of american stability of residence but none the less gratifying to the contemplation of those who respect a deep love of home wherever it may be found for the moral of our episode on this subject we cannot refrain from a description of a fine old estate which we have frequently seen minus now the buildings which then existed and long since supplanted by others equally respectable and commodious and erected by the successor of the original occupant the late dr boylston of roxbury who long made the farm his summer residence the description is from an old work the history of the county of worcester in the state of massachusetts by the rev peter whitney 1793 many of the houses in princeton are large and elegant this leads to a particular mention that in this town is the country seat of the hon moses gill esq honorable meant something in those days who has been from the year 1775 one of the judges of the court of common pleas for the county of worcester and for several years a counsellor of this commonwealth his noble and elegant seat is about one mile and a quarter from the meetinghouse to the south the farm contains upwards of three thousand acres the county road from princeton to worcester passes through it in front of the house which faces to the west the buildings stand upon the highest land of the whole farm but it is level round about them for many rods and then there is a very gradual descent the land on which these buildings stand is elevated between twelve hundred and thirteen hundred feet above the level of the sea as the hon james winthrop esq informs me the mansion house is large being 5050 feet with four stacks of chimnies the farm house is 40 feet by 36 in a line with this stand the coach and chaisehouse 50 feet by 36 this is joined to the barn by a shed 70 feet in lengththe barn is 200 feet by 32 very elegant fences are erected around the mansion house the outhouses and the garden the prospect from this seat is extensive and grand taking in a horizon to the east of seventy miles at least the blue hills in milton are discernible with the naked eye from the windows of this superb edifice distant not less than sixty miles as also the waters in the harbor of boston at certain seasons of the year when we view this seat these buildings and this farm of so many hundred acres now under a high degree of profitable cultivation and are told that in the year 1766 it was a perfect wilderness we are struck with wonder admiration and astonishment the honorable proprietor thereof must have great satisfaction in contemplating these improvements so extensive made under his direction and i may add by his own active industry judge gill is a gentleman of singular vivacity and activity and indefatigable in his endeavors to bring forward the cultivation of his lands of great and essential service by his example in the employment he finds for so many persons and in all his attempts to serve the interests of the place where he dwells and in his acts of private munificence and public generosity and deserves great respect and esteem not only from individuals but from the town and country he has so greatly benefited and especially by the ways in which he makes use of that vast estate wherewith a kind providence has blessed him such was the estate and such the man who founded and enjoyed it sixty years ago and many an equal estate founded and occupied by equally valuable men then existed and still exist in all our older states and if our private and public virtues are preserved will ever exist in every state of our union such pictures too are forcible illustrations of the morals of correct building on the ample estates of many of our american planters and farmers the mansion house which is so graphically described we saw but a short time before it was pulled downthen old and hardly worth repairing being built of wood and of style something like this design of our own bating the extent of veranda the cost of this house may be from 5000 to 8000 depending upon the material of which it is constructed the degree of finish given to it and the locality where it is built all these circumstances are to be considered and the estimates should be made by practical and experienced builders who are competent judges in whatever appertains to it illustration farm house pages 173174 design vii a plantation houseanother southern house is here presented quite different in architectural design from the last plain unpretending less ornate in its finish as well as less expensive in construction it may occupy a different site in a hilly wooded country of rougher surface but equally becoming it as the other would more fitly grace the level prairie or spreading plain in the more showy luxury of its character this house stands 4644 feet on the ground two stories high with a full length veranda 10 feet wide in front and a half length one above it connecting with the main roof by an open gable under which is a railed gallery for summer repose or recreation or to enjoy the scenery upon which it may open the roof is broad and overhanging thoroughly sheltering the walls and giving it a most protected comfortable look covering half the rear is a leanto with shed roof 16 feet wide communicating with the servants offices in the wing the hall of which opens upon a low veranda on its front and leading to the minor conveniences of the establishment the main servants building is 3020 feet one and a half stories high with a roof in keeping with the main dwelling and a chimney in the center in rear of this is attached a woodhouse with a shed roof thus sloping off and giving it a reposed quiet air from that point of view a narrow porch 23 feet long and 8 feet wide also shades the remaining rear part of the main dwelling opening on to the approach in rear illustration ground plan interior arrangement the front door opens into a hall 34 feet long and 10 feet wide with a flight of stairs on the left of this opens a parlor or diningroom 2218 feet lighted by two windows in front and one on the side and connecting with the diningroom beyond which is 1816 feet with two small dining closets between the diningroom has two windows opening on to the rear veranda under the cross flight of stairs in the hall a partition separates it from the rear hall into which is a door on the right of the entrance hall is a library 1818 feet lighted by three windows at the farther end is a closet and by the side of it a small entry leading into the nursery or family bedroom 1815 feet in size which also has a corresponding closet with the library on the rear of the nursery is a flight of back stairs opening from it under these stairs at the other end a door opens to another flight leading into the cellar below a door also leads out from the nursery into the rear passage to the offices another door on the further side of the room opens into the rear hall of the house the nursery should have two windows but the drawing by an error gives only one from this rear hall a door opens on the rear veranda and another into the passage to the rear offices this passage is six feet wide and 34 feet long opening at its left end on to the veranda and on the right to the servants porch and from its rear side into three small rooms 10 feet square each the outer one of which may be a business room for the proprietor of the estate the next a storeroom for family supplies and the other a kitchen closet each of these is lighted by a window on the rear a door also leads from the rear passage into the kitchen 2016 feet in area with a window looking out in front and two others on the side and rear and a door into the woodhouse in this is placed a large chimney for the cooking establishment oven c c a flight of stairs and partition divides this from the washroom which is 1414 feet with two windows in the side and a door into the woodhouse this woodhouse is open on two sides and a watercloset is in the far corner the small veranda which is six feet wide fronting the kitchen apartments opens into the bathroom 96 feet into which the water is drawn from the kitchen boilers in the adjoining chimney still beyond this is the entrance to the waterclosets 65 feet illustration chamber plan the chamber plan is simple and will be readily comprehended if more rooms are desirable they can be cut off from the larger ones a flight of garret stairs may also be put in the rear chamber hall the main hall of the chambers in connection with the upper veranda may be made a delightful resort for the summer where the leisure hours of the family may be passed in view of the scenery which the house may command and thus made one of its most attractive features miscellaneous we have given less veranda to this house than to the last because its style does not require it and it is a cheaper and less painstaking establishment throughout although perhaps quite as convenient in its arrangement as the other the veranda may however be continued round the two ends of the house if required a screen or belt of privet or low evergreens may be planted in a circular form from the front righthand corner of the dwelling to the corresponding corner of the rear offices enclosing a clothes drying yard and cutting them off from too sightly an exposure from the lawn in front the opposite end of the house which may be termed its business front may open to the everyday approach to the house and be treated as convenience may determine for the tree decoration of this establishment evergreens may come in for a share of attraction their conical tapering points will correspond well with its general architecture and add strikingly to its effect otherwise the remarks already given on the subject of park and lawn plantation will suffice as however in the position where this establishment is supposed to be erected land is plenty ample area should be appropriated to its convenience and no pinched or parsimonious spirit should detract from giving it the fullest effect in an allowance of ground nor need the ground devoted to such purposes be at all lost or unappropriated various uses can be made of it yielding both pleasure and profit to which a future chapter will refer and it is one of the chief pleasures of retired residence to cultivate in the right place such incidental objects of interest as tend to gratify as well as to instruct in whatever appertains to the elevation of our thoughts and the improvement of our condition all these in their place should be drawn about our dwellings to render them as agreeable and attractive as our ingenuity and labor may command lawns grounds parks and woods having essayed to instruct our agricultural friends in the proper modes of erecting their houses and providing for their convenient accommodation within them a few remarks may be pardoned touching such collateral subjects of embellishment as may be connected with the farm residence in the way of plantations and grounds in their immediate vicinity we are well aware that small farms do not permit any considerable appropriation of ground to waste purposes as such spots are usually called which are occupied with wood or the shade of open trees near the dwelling but no dwelling can be complete in all its appointments without trees in its immediate vicinity this subject has perhaps been sufficiently discussed in preceding chapters yet as a closing course of remark upon what a farm house greater or less in extent should be in the amount of shade given to it a further suggestion or two may be permitted there are in almost all places in the vicinity of the dwelling portions of ground which can be appropriated to forest trees without detriment to other economical uses if applied in the proper way any one who passes along a high road and discovers the farm house seated on the margin or in the immediate vicinity of a pleasant grove is immediately struck with the peculiarly rural and picturesque air which it presents and thinks to himself that he should love such a spot for his own home without reflecting that he might equally as well create one of the same character sites already occupied where different dispositions are made of contiguous ground may not admit of like advantages and such are to be continued in their present arrangement with such course of improvement as their circumstances will admit but to such as are about to select the sites of their future homes it is important to study what can best embellish them in the most effective shade and ornament in the immediate vicinity of our large towns and cities it is seldom possible to appropriate any considerable breadth of land to ornamental purposes excepting rough and unsightly waste ground more or less occupied with rock or swamp or plainer tracts so sterile as to be comparatively worthless for cultivation such grounds too often lie bare of wood and require planting and a course of years to cover them with trees even if the proprietor is willing or desirous to devote them to such purpose still there are vast sections of our country where to economize land is not important and a mixed occupation of it to both ornament and profit may be indulged to the extent of the owners disposition all over the united states there are grand and beautiful sweeps and belts of cultivated country interspersed with finelywooded tracts which offer the most attractive sites for the erection of dwellings on the farms which embrace them and that require only the eye and hand of taste to convert them with slight labor into the finestwooded lawns and forested parks imaginable no country whatever produces finer trees than north america the evergreens of the north luxuriate in a grandeur scarcely known elsewhere and shoot their cones into the sky to an extent that the stripling pines and firs and larches of england in vain may strive to imitate the elm of new england towers up and spreads out its sweeping arms with a majesty unwonted in the ancient parks or forests of europe while its maples and birches and beeches and ashes and oaks and the great whitearmed buttonwood make up a variety of intervening growth luxuriant in the extreme pass on through the middle states and into the far west and there they still flourish with additional kindsthe tulip and poplarthe nuttrees in all their wide variety with a host of others equally grand and imposing interspersed and shrubtrees innumerable are seen every where as they sweep along your path beyond the alleghanies and south of the great lakes are vast natural parks many of them enclosed and dotted with herds of cattle ranging over them which will show single trees and clumps of forest that william the conqueror would have given a whole fiefdom in his hampshire spoliations to possess while stretching away toward the gulf of mexico new varieties of tree are found equally imposing grand and beautiful throughout the whole vast range and in almost every locality susceptible of the finest possible appropriation to ornament and use many a one of these noble forests and open natural parks have been appropriated already to embellish the comfortable family establishment which has been built either on its margin or within it and thousands more are standing as yet unimproved but equally inviting the future occupant to their ample protection the moral influences too of lawns and parks around or in the vicinity of our dwellings are worthy of consideration secluded as many a country dweller may be away from the throng of society there is a sympathy in trees which invites our thoughts and draws our presence among them with unwonted interest and in frequent cases assist materially in stamping the feelings and courses of our future livesalways with pure and ennobling sentiments the groves were gods first temples the thoughtful man as he passes under their sheltering boughs in the heat of summer with uncovered brow silently worships the hand that formed them there scarcely conscious that their presence thus elevates his mind to holy aspirations among them the speculative man finds tongues in trees books in the running brooks sermons in stones even children born and educated among groves of trees drink in early impressions which follow them for good all their days and when the toils of their after life are passed they love to return to these grateful coverts and spend their remaining days amid the tranquillity of their presence men habituated to the wildest life too enjoy the woods the hills and the mountains beyond all the captivation and excitement of society and are nowhere at rest but when in their communion the love of forest scenery is a thing to be cultivated as a high accomplishment in those whose early associations have not been among them indeed country life is tame and intolerable without a taste either natural or acquired for fine landscape scenery and in a land like this where the country gives occupation to so great a proportion of its people and a large share of those engaged in the active and exciting pursuits of populous towns sigh and look forward to its enjoyment every inducement should be offered to cultivate a taste for those things which make one of its chief attractions nor should seclusion from general society and a residence apart from the bustling activity of the world present a bar to the due cultivation of the taste in many subjects supposed to belong only to the throng of association it is one of the advantages of rural life that it gives us time to think and the greatest minds of whose labors in the old world we have had the benefit and of later times in our own land have been reared chiefly in the solitude of the country patrick henry loved to range among the woods admiring the leafy magnificence of nature and to follow the meandering courses of the brooks with his hook and line washington when treading the vast solitudes of central virginia with his surveyors instruments on his back conceived the wonderful resources of the great empire of which he will ever be styled the father the dwelling of the late john c calhoun sheltered by noble trees stands on an elevated swell of a grand range of mountain land and it was there that his prolific genius ripened for those burning displays of thought which drew to him the affections of admiring thousands henry clay undoubtedly felt the germ of his future greatness while sauntering in his boyhood days through the wild and picturesque slashes of hanover webster born amid the rugged hills of new hampshire drew the delightful relish of rural life for which he is so celebrated from the landscapes which surrounded his early home and laid the foundation of his mighty intellect in the midst of lone and striking scenery bryant could never have written his thanatopsis his rivulet and his green river but from the inspiration drawn from his secluded youthful home in the mountains of massachusetts nor to touch a more sacred subject could jonathan edwards ever have composed his masterly treatise on the will in a pentup city but owes his enduring fame to the thought and leisure which he found while ministering among the sublime mountains of the housatonic to a feeble tribe of stockbridge indians and these random names are but a few of those whose love of nature early imbibed and in later life enjoyed in their own calm and retired homes amid the serene beauty of woods and waters which might be named as illustrations of the influence which fine scenery may exercise upon the mind to assist in moulding it to greatness the following anecdote was told us many years ago by a venerable man in connecticut a friend of the elder hillhouse of new haven to whom that city is much indebted for the magnificent trees by which it has become renowned as the city of the elms while a member of the general assembly of that state when hillhouse was in congress learning that he had just returned home from the annual session our informant with a friend went to the residence of the statesman to pay him a visit he had returned only that morning and on their way there they met him near his house with a stout young tree on his shoulder just taken from a neighboring piece of forest which he was about to transplant in the place of one which had died during his absence after the usual salutations our friend expressed his surprise that he was so soon engaged in treeplanting before he had even had time to look to his private and more pressing affairs another day may be too late replied the senator my tree well planted it will grow at its leisure and i can then look to my own concerns at my ease so gentlemen if you will just wait till the tree is set well walk into the house and settle the affairs of state in our own way walter scott whose deep love of park and forest scenery has stamped with his masterly descriptions his native land as the home of all things beautiful and useful in trees and plantations spent a great share of his leisure time in planting and has written a most instructive essay on its practice and benefits he puts into the mouth of the laird of dumbiedikes the advice be aye sticking in a tree jock it will be growing while you are sleeping but walter scott had no american soil to plant his trees upon nor do the grandest forest parks of scotland show a tithe of the luxuriance and majesty of our american forests could he but have seen the variety the symmetry and the vast size of our oaks and elms and evergreens a new element of descriptive power would have grown out of the admiration they had created within him and he would have envied a people the possession of such exhaustless resources as we enjoy to embellish their homes in the best imaginable manner with such enduring monuments of grace and beauty to the miscellaneous or casual reader such course of remark may appear merely sublimated nonsense no matter we are not upon stilts talking down to a class of inferior men in a condescending tone on a subject above their comprehension but we are addressing men and the sons of men who are our equalsalthough like ourself upon their farms taking their share in its daily toils as well as pleasuresand can perfectly well understand our language and sympathize with our thoughts they are the thoughts of rural life everywhere it was old sam johnson the great lexicographer who lumbered his unwieldy gait through the streets of cities for a whole life and with all his vast learning and wisdom had no appreciation of the charms of the country that said who feeds fat cattle should himself be fat as if the dweller on the farm should not possess an idea above the brutes around him we wonder if he ever supposed a merchant should have any more brain than the parcel that he handled or the bale which he rolled or directed others to roll for him but loving the solitude of the farm and finding a thousand objects of interest and beauty scattered in profusion where those educated among artificial objects would see nothing beyond things to them vulgar and commonplace in conversing with our rural friends upon what concerns their daily comfort and is to constitute the nursery of those who succeed them and on the influences which may in a degree stamp their future character we cannot forbear such suggestions connected with the family home as may induce them to cultivate all those accessories around it which may add to their pleasure and contentment we believe it was keats who said a thing of beauty is a joy for ever and the thought that such beauty has been of our own creation or that our own hands have assisted in its perpetuation should certainly be a deep joy of our life we have remarked that the farm house is the chief nursery on which our broad country must rely for that healthy infusion of stamina and spirit into those men who under our institutions guide its destiny and direct its councils they in the great majority of their numbers are natives of the retired homestead it is therefore of high consequence that good taste intelligence and correct judgment should enter into all that surrounds the birthplace and early scenes of those who are to be the future actors in the prominent walks of life either in public or private capacity and as the love of trees is one of the leading elements of enjoyment amid the outward scenes of countrylife we commend most heartily all who dwell in the pure air and bright sunshine of the open land to their study and cultivation every man who lives in the country be he a practical farmer or not should plant trees more or less the father of a family should plant for the benefit of his children as well as for his own the bachelor and the childless man should plant if for nothing more than to show that he has left some living thing to perpetuate his memory boys should early be made planters none but those who love trees and plant them know the serene pleasure of watching their growth and anticipating their future beauty and grandeur and no one can so exquisitely enjoy their grateful shade as he whose hand has planted and cared for them planting too is a most agreeable pastime to a reflecting mind it may be ranked among the pleasures instead of the toils of life we have always so found it there is no pleasanter sight of labor than to see a father with his young lads about him planting a tree it becomes a landmark of their industry and good taste and no thinking man passes a plantation of fine trees but inwardly blesses the man or the memory of the man who placed them there aside from all this trees properly distributed give a value to an estate far beyond the cost of planting and tending their growth and which no other equal amount of labor and expense upon it can confer innumerable farms and places have been sold at high prices over those of perhaps greater producing value merely for the trees which embellished them thus in a pecuniary light to say nothing of the pleasure and luxury they confer trees are a source of profitable investment it is a happy feature in the improving rural character of our country that treeplanting and tree preservation for some years past have attracted much more attention than formerly and with this attention a better taste is prevailing in their selection we have gained but little in the introduction of many of the foreign trees among us for ornament some of them are absolutely barbarous in comparison with our american forest trees and their cultivation is only a demonstration of the utter want of good taste in those who apply them for ordinary purposes but few exotics should be tolerated and those chiefly in collections as curiosities or for arboretumsin which latter the farmer cannot often indulge and for all the main purposes of shade and use and ornament the trees of no country can equal our own varied as our country is in soils and climates no particular directions can be given as to the individual varieties of tree which are to be preferred for planting each locality has its own most appropriate kinds and he who is to plant can best make the selections most fitted to his use rapidgrowing trees when of fine symmetry and free from bad habits in throwing up suckers not liable to the attacks of insects of early dense and longcontinued foliage are most to be commended while their opposites in character should be avoided in all wellkept grounds it requires indeed but a little thought and observation to guide every one in the selection which he should make to produce the best effect of which the tree itself is capable giving the importance we have to trees and their planting it may be supposed that we should discuss their position in the grounds to which they should be appropriated but no specific directions can be given at large all this branch of the subject must be left to the locality position and surface of the ground sought to be improved a good tree can scarcely stand in a wrong place when not injurious to a building by its too dense shade or shutting out its light or prospect still the proper disposition of trees is a study and should be well considered before they be planted bald unsightly spots should be covered by them when not devoted to more useful objects of the farm either in pasturage or cultivation a partial shading of the soil by trees may add to its value for grazing purposes like the woodland pastures of kentucky where subject to extreme droughts or a scorching sun if the planter feels disposed to consult authorities as to the best disposition of his trees works on landscape gardening may be studied but these can give only general hints and the only true course is to strive to make his grounds look as much like nature herself as possiblefor nature seldom makes mistakes in her designs to conclude a course of remark which the plain farmer cultivating his land for its yearly profit alone may consider as foreign to the subject of our work we would not recommend any one to plant trees who is not willing to spend the necessary time to nurse and tend them afterward till they are out of harms way and well established in a vigorous growth all this must be taken into the account for it is better to have even but a few trees and those what trees should be than a whole forest of stinted things writhing and pining through a course of sickly existence a chapter might also be written upon the proper mode of taking up and planting trees but as this would lead us to a subject more directly belonging to another department the proper authorities on that head must be consulted fruit gardenorchards as the fruit garden and orchards are usually near appendages to the dwelling and outbuildings a few remarks as to their locality and distribution may be appropriate the first should always be near the house both for convenience in gathering its fruits and for its due protection from the encroachments of those not entitled to its treasures it should if possible adjoin the kitchen garden for convenience of access as fruit is or should be an important item in the daily consumption of every family where it can be grown and afforded a sheltered spot if to be had should be devoted to this object or if not its margin on the exposed side should be set with the hardiest trees to which it is appropriatedas the apple the fruit garden proper may also contain the smaller fruits as they are termed as the currant gooseberry raspberry and whatever other shrubfruits are grown while the quince the peach the apricot nectarine plum cherry pear and apple may in the order they are named stand in succession behind them the taller and more hardy growth of each successive variety rising higher and protecting its less hardy and aspiring neighbor the soil for all these varieties of tree is supposed to be congenial and our remarks will only be directed to their proper distribution the aspect for the fruit garden should if possible front the south southeast or southwest in a northerly climate in the middle and southern states the exposure is of less consequence currants gooseberries raspberries c should for their most productive bearing and the highest quality of their fruits be set at least four feet apart in the rows and the rows six feet distant from each other that there may be abundant room to cultivate them with the plow and kept clean of weeds and grass the quince peach apricot nectarine and plum should be 16 feet apart each way the pear if on quince stock may be 12 feet apart and if on its own stock 20 to 24 feet while the apple should always be 30 to 36 feet apart to let in the requisite degree of sun and air to ripen as well as give growth color and flavor to its fruit the tendency of almost all planters of fruit trees is to set them too close and many otherwise fine fruit gardens are utterly ruined by the compact manner in which they are planted trees are great consumers of the atmosphere every leaf is a lung inhaling and respiring the gases and if sufficient breathing room be not allowed them the tree sickens and pines for the want of it therefore every fruit tree and fruitbearing shrub should be so placed that the summer sun can shine on every part of its surface at some hour of the day in such position the fruit will reach its maximum of flavor size and perfection the ground too should be rich and to have the greatest benefit of the soil no crops should be grown among the trees after they have arrived at their full maturity of bearing thus planted and nursed with good selections of varieties both the fruit garden and the orchard become one of the most ornamental as well as most profitable portions of the farm in point of position as affecting the appearance of the homestead the fruit garden should stand on the weatherside of the dwelling so as although protected in its several varieties by itself when not altogether sheltered by some superior natural barrier it should appear to shelter both the dwelling and kitchen gardens which adjoin them as this is a subject intended to be but incidentally touched in these pages and only then as immediately connected in its general character with the dwelling house and its attachments we refrain from going into any particulars of detail concerning it it is also a subject to which we are strongly attached and gladly would we have a set chat with our readers upon it but as the discussion for so broad a field as we should have to survey would be in many points arbitrary and unfitting to local information as to varieties and particular cultivation we refer the reader with great pleasure to the several treatises of downing and thomas and barry on this interesting topic with which the public are fortunately in possession observing only that there is no one item of rural economy to which our attention can be given which yields more of luxury health and true enjoyment both to the body and the mind than the cultivation of good fruits how to lay out a kitchen garden the kitchen garden yields more necessaries and comforts to the family than any other piece of ground on the premises it is of consequence necessary that it be so located and planned as to be ready of access and yield the greatest possible quantity of products for the labor bestowed upon it and as locality and plan have much to do with the labor bestowed upon it and the productions it may yield both these subjects should be considered as to locality the kitchen garden should lie in the warmest and most sheltered spot which may be convenient to the kitchen of the house it should in connection with that be convenient of access to the dungyards of the stables the size may be such as your necessities or your convenience may demand the shape either a parallelogram or a square for it will be recollected that this is a place allotted not for a show or pleasure ground but for profit if the garden be large this shape will better allow the use of the plow to turn up the soil which in a large garden is a much cheaper and when properly done a better mode than to spade it and if small and it be worked with the spade right lines are easier made with the spade than curved ones one or more walks at least eight feet wide should be made leading from a broad gate or bars through which a cart and horse or oxen may enter to draw in manure or carry out the vegetables and if such walk or walks do not extend around the garden which if in a large one they should do a sufficient area should be thrown out at the farther extremity to turn the cart upon if the soil be free and stony the stones should be taken out clean when largeand if small down to the size of a hens eggand the surface made as level as possible for a loose soil will need no draining if the soil be a clay or clayey loam it should be underdrained two and a half feet to be perfect and the draining so planned as to lead off to a lower spot outside this draining warms the soil opens it for filtration and makes it friable then properly fenced thoroughly manured and plowed deep and left roughno matter how roughin the fall of the year and as late before the setting in of winter as you dare risk it that part of the preparation is accomplished the permanent or wide walks of the garden after being laid out and graded should never be plowed nor disturbed except by the hoe and rake to keep down the weeds and grass yet if a close and wellshorn grass turf be kept upon them it is perhaps the cheapest and most cleanly way of keeping the walks they need only cutting off close with the handhook in summer we have known a great many people after laying out a kitchen garden and preparing it for use fill it up with fruit trees supposing that vegetables will grow quite as well with them as without this is a wide mistake no tree larger than a currant or gooseberry bush should ever stand in a vegetable garden these fruits being partially used in the cooking department as much in the way of vegetables as of fruits and small in size may be permitted and they contrary to the usual practice should always stand in open ground where they can have all the benefits of the sun and rain to ripen the fruit to perfection as well as to receive the cultivation they need instead of being placed under fences around the sides of the garden where they are too frequently neglected and become the resort of vermin or make prolific harbors for weeds along the main walks or alleys the borders for perennial plants as well as the currant and gooseberry bushes should be madefor the plow should run parallel to and not at right angles with them here may stand the rhubarbs the sea kales the various herbs or even the asparagus beds if a particular quarter be not set apart for them and if it be important a portion of these main borders may be appropriated to the more common flowers and small shrubbery if desired to cultivate them in a plain way but not a peach apricot or any other larger tree than a currant or raspberry should come within it they not only shade the small plants but suck up and rob them of their food and moisture and keep off the sun and prevent the circulation of airthan which nothing needs all these more than garden vegetables to have them in high perfection if it be necessary by means of a cold exposure on the one side to have a close plantation of shrubbery to screen the garden let it be outside the fence rather than within it but if within let there be a broad walk between such shrubbery and the garden beds as their roots will extend under the vegetables and rob them of their food a walk alley or cartway on the sides of the garden is always better next to the fence than to fill that space with anything else as it is usually shaded for a portion of the day and may be better afforded for such waste purposes than the open sunny ground within it will be observed that market gardeners men who always strive to make the most profit from their land and labor and obtain the best vegetables cultivate them in open fields not a tree nor even a bush is permitted to stand near the growing crop if they can prevent it and where one is not stinted in the area of his domain their example should be followed a word upon plowing gardens clays or clayey loams should always be manured and plowed in the fall just before the setting in of the winter frosts a world of pounding and hammering of lumps to make them fine in spring is saved by fall plowing besides incorporating the manure more thoroughly with the soil as well as freezing out and destroying the eggs of worms and insects which infest it thrown up deeply and roughly with the plow or spade the frosts act mechanically upon the soil and slack and pulverise it so thoroughly that a heavy raking in early spring is all that becomes necessary to put it in the finest condition for seeds and make it perhaps the very best and most productive of all garden soils whatever a light sandy loam is better to lie compact in winter and manured and turned up in early spring its friable nature leaves it always open and light and at all times in the absence of frost accessible to the spade or the hoe on these accounts it is usually the most desirable and convenient soil for the kitchen garden and on the whole generally preferred where either kind may be a matter simply of choice flowers start not gentle reader we are not about to inflict upon you a dissertation on pelargoniums callaethiopias japonicas and such like unmentionable terms that bring to your mind the greenhouse and forcinghouse and all the train of expense and vexation attending them but we desire to have a short familiar conversation about what is all around you or if not around you should be and kept there with very little pains or labor on your part still if you dislike the subject just hand this part of our book over to your excellent wife or daughters or sisters as the case may be and we will talk to them about this matter flowers have their objects and were made for our use and pleasure otherwise god would never have strewed them as he has so bountifully along our paths and filled the world with their fragrance and beauty like all else beautiful which he made and pronounced good flowers have been objects of admiration and love since mans creation and their cultivation has ever been a type of civilization and refinement among all people who have left written records behind them flowers equally become the cottage and the palace in their decoration the humblest cottager and the mightiest monarch have equally admired their beauty and their odor and the whole train of mortals between have devoted a portion of their time and thoughts to the development of their peculiar properties but let that pass plain country people as we are there are enough of sufficient variety all around us to engage our attention and give us all that we desire to embellish our homes and engage the time which we have to devote to them among the wild flowers in the mountains and hills of the farthest north on the margin of their hidden brooks where floats the scarcerooted watercress and on their barren sides the tiny violet and the laurel bloom each in their season with unwonted beauty and sloping down on to the plains beneath blush out in all their summer garniture the wild rose and the honeysuckle on through the middle states the lesser flowers of early spring throw out a thousand brilliant dyes and are surrounded by a host of summer plants vieing with each other in the exuberance of their tints on the alleghanies through all their vast range grow up the magnificent dogwood kalmia and rhododendron spangling mile upon mile of their huge sides and tops with white and covering crags and precipices of untold space with their blushing splendor further west on the prairies and oak openings and in the deep woods too of the great lakes and of the mississippi valley with the earliest grass shoot up all over the land a succession of flowers which in variety and profusion of shape and color and odor outvie all the lilies of the gardens of solomon and so they continue till the autumnal frosts cut down both grass and flower alike further south along the piney coast back through the hills and over the vast reach of cotton and sugar lands another class of flowers burst out from their natural coverts in equal glory and the magnolia and the tuliptree and the wild orange throw a perfume along the air like the odors of palestine in the deep lagoons of the southern rivers too float immense waterlilies laying their great broad leaves and expanded white and yellow flowers upon the surface which the waters of the nile in the days of cleopatra never equaled and these are natures wild productions only flowers being cultivated not for profit but for show and amusement need not intrude upon the time which is required to the more important labors of the farm a little time given at such hours when it can be best spared will set all the little flowerbeds in order and keep the required shrubbery of the place in trimand should not be denied in any family who enjoy a taste for them even the simplest of their kind when carefully disposed produce a fine effect and the hardy bulbous and tuberousrooted plants require but slight aid in producing the highest perfection of their bloom while the fibrousrooted perennials and the flowering shrubs bloom on from year to year almost uncared for and untouched the annuals require the most attention their seeds must be planted and gathered every year they must be weeded and nursed with more care than the others yet they richly repay all this trouble in their fresh bloom when the others are gone and will carry their rich flowers far into the frosts of autumn when their hardier companions have composed themselves for a winters rest the position of the flowerbed or borders may be various as a matter of taste however they should be near the house and in view of the windows of the most frequented rooms they thus give more enjoyment in their sight than when but occasionally seen in special visits and such spots can usually be set apart for them if not in the way of more important things they should always be thus placed where they are ever objects of interest and attraction the ground which flowering plants occupy should be devoted to them alone and the soil be made deep and rich they should not be huddled up nor crowded but stand well apart and have plenty of breathingroom for their branches and leaves and space for the spread of their roots they are consumers of the fertilizing gases and require equally with other plants their due supply of manureswhich also adds to the brilliance and size of their bloom as well as to the growth of their stems their roots should be protected in winter by coarse litter thrown over them particularly the earlier flowering plants as it gives them an early and rapid start in the spring in variety we need scarcely recommend what may be most desirable the crocus and snowdrop are among if not quite the earliest in bloom and to these follow the hyacinth and daffodil the jonquil and manyvaried family of narcissus the lowheaded heartsease or pansy with them too comes the floweringalmond the lilac and another or two flowering shrubs then follow the tulips in all their gorgeous and splendid variety of single double and fringed to these follow the great peonies in their full dashing colors of crimson white and pink and the treelike snowball or guelderrose by the side of these hangs out the monthlytrumpethoneysuckle gracing the columns of your veranda porch or window and the large siberian honeysuckle with its white and pink flowers and along with them the various iris family or fleurdelis reminding one of france and the bourbons the prussian lilac and the early phloxes then blush out in all their endless variety of shade and tint from the purest white to the deepest purple the whole vast family of roses and in stature from the humblest twig that leans its frail stem upon the ground up to the hardy climber whose delicious clusters hang over your chamber window and a month of fragrance and beauty of these completes the succession of bulbs and tubers and perennial plants and shrubsscores of which have not been noticed now commence the annuals which may carry you a month further into the season when the flaunting dahlia of every hue and budding from its plant of every size from the height of little tommy who is just toddling out with his mother to watch the first opening flower up to the top of his fathers hat as he stands quite six feet to hold the little fellow up to try to smell of another which like all the rest has no sign of odor then come after a long retinue of different thingsamong which we always count the morningglory or convolvulus running up the kitchen windowsthe great sunflower which throws his broad disk high over the garden fence always cheerful and always glowingthe brilliant tribe of asters rich varied and beautiful running far into the autumnal frosts and to close our floral season the chrysanthemum which well caredfor blooms out in the open air and carefully taken up and boxed will stay with us in the house till christmas thus ends the blooming year now if you would enjoy a pleasure perfectly pure which has no alloy save an occasional disappointment by casualty and make home interesting beyond all other places learn first to love then to get and next to cultivate flowers farm cottages altogether too little attention has been paid in our country to these most useful appendages to the farm both in their construction and appearance nothing adds more to the feeling of comfort convenience and home expression in the farm than the snugbuilt laborers cottage upon it the cottage also gives the farm an air of respectability and dignity the laborer should if not so sumptuously be as comfortably housed and sheltered as his employer this is quite as much to the interest of such employer as it is beneficial to the health and happiness of the laborer building is so cheap in america that the difference in cost between a snuglyfinished cottage and a rickety open tenement is hardly to be taken into consideration as compared with the higher health and increased enjoyment of the laborer and his family while every considerate employer knows that cheerfulness and contentment of disposition which are perhaps more promoted by good home accommodations for the workingman than by any other influence are strong incentives to increased labor on his part and more fidelity in its application a landed estate of whatever extent with its respectable farm house in its own expressive style of construction relieved and set off by its attendant cottages either contiguous or remote and built in their proper character leaves nothing wanting to fill the picture upon which one loves to gaze in the contemplation of country life and without these last in due keeping with the chief structures of the estate a blank is left in its completeness and finish the little embellishments which may be given by way of architectural arrangement or the conveniences in accommodation are in almost all cases appreciated by those who occupy them and have an influence upon their character and conduct while the trifling decorations which may be added in the way of shrubbery trees and flowering plants costing little or nothing in their planting and keeping give a charm to the humblest abode the position of cottages on a farm should be controlled by considerations of convenience to the place of labor and a proper economy in their construction and hardly a site can be inappropriate which ensures these requirements in the plans which are submitted due attention has been paid to the comfort of those who inhabit them as well as to picturesque effect in the cottage itself decency order and respectability are thus given to the estate and to those who inhabit the cottages upon it as well as to those whose more fortunate position in life has given the enjoyment of a higher luxury in the occupancy of its chief mansion on all estates where the principal dwelling is located at any considerable distance from the public road or where approached by a side road shut off from the highway by a gate a small cottage by way of lodge or laborers tenement should be located at or near the entrance such appendage is not only ornamental in itself but gives character to the place and security to the enclosure in guarding it from improper intrusion as well as to receive and conduct into the premises those who either reside upon or have business within it it is thus a sort of sentrybox as well as a laborers residence illustration cottage pages 211212 design i this cottage is 10 feet high from the sill to the plates and may be built of wood with a slight frame composed of sills and plates only and planked up and down vertically and battened or grooved and tongued and matched close together or it may be framed throughout with posts and studs and covered with rough boards and over these clapboards and lathed and plastered inside the first mode would be the cheapest although not so warm and durable as the other yet quite comfortable when warmed by a stove on the second plan of building it will cost near or quite double the amount of the first if neatly painted a small brick chimney should rest upon the floor overhead in the side of which at least a foot above the chamber floor should be inserted an earthen or iron thimble to receive the stovepipe and guard against fire unless a flat stone 14 to 16 inches square and 2 to 4 inches thick with a pipeholewhich is the better planshould rest on the floor immediately over the pipe this stone should be also the foundation of the chimney which should pass immediately up through the ridge of the roof and for effect in the center longitudinally of the house such position will not interfere with the location of the stove which may be placed in any part of the room the pipe reaching the chimney by one or more elbows interior arrangement the main body of this cottage is 1812 feet with a leanto 8 feet wide running its whole length in rear this leanto may be 8 or 9 inches lower on the floor than the main room and divided into a passage leading to an open woodhouse in rear 1012 feet with a shed roof a large closet and a bedroom as may be required or the passage end may be left open at the side for a wood shelter or other useful purpose the roof which is raftered boarded and shingled in the usual mode is well spread over the gables as well as over the front and rearsay 18 inches the porch in front will give additional convenience in summer as a place to sit or eat under and its posts so fitted with grooves as to let in rough planks for winter enclosure in front and at one end leaving the entrance only at the least windy or stormy side the extra cost of such preparation with the planks which should be 1 or 1 inches thick and jointed would not exceed ten or fifteen dollars this would make an admirable woodhouse for the winter and a perfect snuggery for a small family while in its summer dress with the porch openedthe planks taken out and laid overhead across the beams connecting the porch with the houseit would present an object of quiet comfort and beauty a hop vine or honeysuckle might be trained outside the posts and give it all the shade required in a stony country where the adjoining enclosures are of stone this cottage may be built of stone also at about double the cost of wood this would save the expense of paint or wash of any kind besides the greater character of durability and substance it would add to the establishment trees of course should shelter it and any little outbuildings that may be required should be nestled under a screen of vines and shrubbery near by this being designed as the humblest and cheapest kind of cottage where the family occupy only a single room the cost would be small on the plan first named stained with a coarse wash it could be built for 100 on the second plan wellframed of sills plates posts studs c c covered with vertical boarding and battens or clapboarded and well painted in oil it might cost 150 to 200 stone or brick without paint would add but little if anything in cost over the last sum the ceiling of the main floor is 8 feet high and a low chamber or garret is afforded above it into which a swingstep ladder ascends and when not in use it may be hung to the ceiling overhead by a common hook and staples design ii this cottage is a grade beyond the one just described both in appearance and accommodation it is 2016 feet on the ground with a rear wing 268 feet in area the main body is 10 feet high to the roof vertically boarded and battened a snug halfopen or it may be closed as convenience may require porch shelters the front door 54 feet in area the cottage has a square or hipped roof of a 30 pitch from a horizontal line which spreads full two feet over the walls and bracketed beneath the rear wing retreats two feet from the wall line of the main building and has also a hipped roof of the same pitch as the main one with eightfeet posts the open end of the wing advances 6 feet toward the front of the main part for woodhouse and storage the construction of this is in the same style as design i the windows are plain twosashed of six lights each 812 glass in front and 810 in the rear illustration cottage pages 217218 interior arrangement the front door opens into a common living room 1612 feet with two windows in which is a stovechimney running up from the main floor next the partition or placed over it in the chamber and running up through the center of the roof on one side of the living room is a bedroom 108 feet with two windows next to this bedroom is a large closet 86 feet with one window and shelves and tight cupboard within these rooms are 9 feet high and over them is a chamber or garret 2016 feet entered by a swing step ladder as in design no i this garret is lighted by a small dormer window in the rear roof over the shed or leanto a bed may be located in this chamber or it may serve as a storage and lumberroom the wing contains a small kitchen in case the living room be not occupied for that purpose 108 feet lighted by a sidewindow and having a small chimney in the rear wall it may contain also a small closet 3 feet square a door passes from this small kitchen into the woodhouse which is 168 feet or with its advance l 14 feet in the extreme outer corner of which is a watercloset 53 feet thus altogether giving accommodation to a family of five or six persons the construction of this cottage is shown as of wood other material either brick or stone may be used as most convenient at a not much increased cost the expense of this building may be say fifty per cent higher than that of no i according to the finish and may be sufficiently well done and painted complete for 300 which may be reduced or increased according to the style of finish and the taste of the builder a cellar may be made under this cottage which can be reached by a trapdoor from the living room opening to a flight of steps below design iii this cottage is still in advance of no ii in style and arrangement and may accommodate not only the farm laborer or gardener but will serve for a small farmer himself or a village mechanic it is in the french style of roof and allied to the italian in its brackets and gables and halfterraced front the body of the cottage is 2220 feet with twelvefeet posts the roof has a pitch of 50 from a horizontal line in its straight dimensions curving horizontally toward the eaves which together with the gables project 3 feet over the walls the terrace in front is 5 feet wide on the rear is a woodhouse 1816 feet in area open at the house end and in front with a roof in same style as the main house and posts 8 feet high standing on the ground 2 feet below the surface of the cellar wall which supports the main building illustration cottage pages 221222 interior arrangement the front door opens in the center of the front wall into a hall 128 feet with a flight of stairs on one side leading to the chamber above under the stairs at the upper end is a passage leading beneath them into the cellar on one side of this hall is a bedroom 810 feet lighted by a window in front and part of the hooded double window on the side on the inner side a door leads from the hall into the living room or kitchen 1812 feet on one side of this is a bedroom or pantry as may be most desirable 96 feet from which leads a close closet 3 feet square this bedroom has a window on one side next the hall a door from the kitchen leads into a closet 3 feet wide which may contain a sink and cupboard for kitchen wares the living room is lighted by a part of the double hooded window on one side and another on the rear a door leads into the woodhouse which is 1216 feet in the extreme corner of which is the watercloset 53 feet the rooms in this cottage are 9 feet high a chimney leads up from the floor of the living room which may receive in addition to its own fireplace or stove a pipe from the stove in the hall if one is placed there the chamber has two feet of perpendicular wall and the sharp roof gives opportunity for two good lodging rooms which may be partitioned off as convenience may require each lighted by a window in the gables and a dormer one in the roof for the passage leading into them the hall may serve as a pleasant sitting or diningroom in pleasant weather opening as it does on to the terrace which is mostly sheltered by the overhanging roof the construction of this cottage may be of either stone brick or wood and produce a fine effect although it has neither porch nor veranda the broad eaves and gables give it a wellsheltered appearance and the hooded windows on the sides throw an air of protection over them quite agreeable to the eye the framing of this roof is no way different in the rafters from those made on straight lines but the curve and projection is given by planks cut into proper shape and spiked into the rafters and apparently supported by the brackets below which should be cut from two to threeinch plank to give them a heavy and substantial appearance the windows are in casement form as shown in the design but may be changed into the ordinary sash form if preferred which is in this country usually the better way it will be observed that we have in all cases adopted the usual squaresided form of glass for windows as altogether more convenient and economical in building simple in repairing and we think quite as agreeable in appearance as those outoftheway shapes frequently adopted to give a more picturesque effect in a hilly mountainous and evergreen country this style of cottage is peculiarly appropriate it takes additional character from bold and picturesque scenery with which it is in harmony the pine spruce cedar or hemlock or the evergreen laurel planted around or near it will give it increased effect while among deciduous trees and shrubs an occasional lombardy poplar and larch will harmonize with the boldness of its outline even where hill or mountain scenery is wanting plantations such as have been named would render it a pleasing style of cottage and give agreeable effect to its bold sharp roof and projecting eaves in a snowy country the plan of roof here presented is well adapted to the shedding of heavy snows on which it can find no protracted lodgment where massive stone walls enclose the estate this style of cottage will be in character as comporting with that strong and solid air which the rustic appearance of stone alone can give it may too receive the same amount of outer decoration in its shrubbery and plantations given to any other style of building of like accommodation and with an equally agreeable effect design iv this cottage is still in advance of the last in its accommodation and is suitable for the small farmer or the more liberal cottager who requires wider room and ampler conveniences than are allowed by the hitherto described structures it is a first class dwelling of its kind and in its details and finish may be adapted to a variety of occupation while it will afford a sufficient amount of expenditure to gratify a liberal outlay to him who chooses to indulge his taste in a moderate extent of decoration and embellishment the ground plan of this cottage is 3022 feet in light ruralgothic style one and a half stories high the posts 14 feet in elevation it has two chimneys passing out through the roof on each side of the ridge uniformly each with the other the roof has a pitch of 45 from a horizontal line giving it a bold and rather dashing appearance and deeply sheltering the walls the side gables give variety to the roof and light to the chambers and add to the finish of its appearance while the sharp arched double window in the front gable adds character to the design illustration cottage pages 227228 the deep veranda in front covers threequarters of its surface in length and in the symmetry of its roof and airiness of its columns with their light braces give it a style of completeness and if creeping vines or climbing shrubs be trained upon them will produce an effect altogether rural and beautiful or if a rustic style of finish be adopted to render it cheaper in construction the effect may still be imposing and in harmony with the purposes to which it is designed in fact this model will admit of a variety of choice in finish from the plainest to a high degree of embellishment as the ability or fancy of the builder may suggest interior arrangement from the veranda in the center of the front a door opens into a hall 177 feet with a flight of stairs leading in three different angles to the chambers above opposite the front door is the passage into the living room or parlor 1715 feet lighted by three windows two of which present an agreeable view of an adjacent stream and its opposite shores at the line of partition from the hall stands a chimney with a fireplace if desirable or for a stove to accommodate both this room and the hall with a like convenience and under the flight of stairs adjoining opens a china closet with spacious shelves for the safekeeping of household comforts from this room a door leads into a bedroom 1013 feet lighted by a window opening into the veranda also accommodated by a stove which leads into a chimney at its inner partition next to this bedroom is the kitchen 1213 feet accommodated with a chimney where may be inserted an open fireplace or a stove as required in this is a flight of back chamber and cellar stairs this room is lighted by two windowsone in the side another in the rear a door leads from its rear into a large roomy pantry 8 feet square situated in the wing and lighted by a window next to this is a passage 3 feet in width leading to the woodhouse in which the pantry just named is included 1612 feet with ninefeet posts and roof pitched like the house in the extreme corner of which is a watercloset 53 feet cornering upon the woodhouse beyond is a small building 1512 feet with tenfeet posts and a roof in same style as the otherswith convenience for a cow and a pig with each a separate entrance a flight of stairs leads to the hayloft above the stables in the gable of which is the haydoor and under the stairs is the granary and to these may be added inside a small accommodation for a choice stock of poultry the chamber plan is the same as the lower floor mainly giving three good sleepingrooms that over the kitchen being a back chamber need not have a separate passage into the upper hall but may have a door passage into the principal chamber the door to the front bedroom leads direct from the upper hall thus accommodation is given to quite a numerous family closets may be placed in each of these chambers if wanted and the entire establishment made a most snug and compact as well as commodious arrangement cottage outside decoration nothing so perfectly sets off a cottage in external appearance as the presence of plants and shrubbery around it a large tree or two by giving an air of protection is always in place and creeping vines and climbing shrubs about the windows and porch are in true character while a few lowheaded trees of various kinds together with some simple and hardy annual and other flowersto which should always be added near by a small welltended kitchen gardenfill up the picture in the choice of what varieties should compose these ornaments one can hardly be at a loss flanking the cottage and near the kitchen garden should be the fruit trees the elm maples oak and hickory in all their varieties blackwalnut butternutthe last all the better for its rich kernelare every one appropriate for shade as large trees the hop morningglory running beansall useful and ornamental as summer climbers the clematis bittersweet ivy any of the climbing roses the lilac syringa snowball and the standard roses while marigolds asters pinks the phloxes peonies and a few other of the thousandandone simple and charming annuals biennials and perennials with now and then a gorgeous sunflower flaunting in its broad glory will fill up the catalogue rare and costly plants are not required and indeed are hardly in place in the grounds of an ordinary cottage unless occupied by the professional gardener they denote expense which the laboring cottager cannot afford and besides that they detract from the simplicity of the life and purpose which not only the cottage itself but everything around it should express there is an affectation of cottage building with some people who with a seeming humility really aim at higher flights of style in living within them than truth of either design or purpose will admit but as such cases are more among villagers and those temporarily retiring from the city for summer residence the farm cottage has little to do with it still such fancies are contagious and we have occasionally seen the ambitious cottage with its covert expression of humility insinuating itself on to the farm and for the farmers own family occupation too which at once spoiled to the eye the substantial reality of the whole establishment a farmer should discard all such things as ornamental cottages they do not belong to the farm if he live in a cottage himself it should be a plain one yet it may be very substantial and well finishedsomething showing that he means either to be content in it in its character of plainness or that he intends at a future day to build something betterwhen this may serve for the habitation of one of his laborers the cottage should never occupy a principal or prominent site on the farm it should take a subordinate position of ground this adds to its expression as subordinate in rank among the lesser farm buildings a cottage cannot and should not aspire to be chief in either position or character such should be the farm house proper although unpretending still in style above the cottage and if the latter in addition be required on the farm it should so appear both in construction and finish just what it is intended fora tenement for economical purposes there is another kind of cottage the dwellers in which these pages will probably never reach that expresses in its wild structure and rude locality the idea of moores pretty song i knew by the smoke that so gracefully curled above the green elms that a cottage was near yet in some parts of our country landlords may build such for the accommodation of tenants which they may make useful on the outskirts of their estates and add indirectly to their own convenience and interest in so doing this may be indulged in poetically toofor almost any thinking man has a spice of poetry in his compositionvagabondism a strict economizing utilitarian would call it the name matters not one may as well indulge his taste in this cheap sort of charitable expenditure as another may indulge in his dogs and guns his horses and equipagesand the first is far the cheapest they at the west and south understand this whose recreations are occasionally with their hounds in chase of the deer and the fox and in their pursuit spend weeks of the fall and winter months in which they are accompanied and assisted as boon companions for the time by the rude tenants of the cottages we have described a cheerful simple honest people another class of cottage may come within the farm enclosures half poetical and half economical such as milton describes hard by a cottage chimney smokes from betwixt two aged oaks and occupied by a family pensioner and his infirm old wifewe dont think all poor old folks ought to go to the almshouse because they cannot work every day of the yearof which all longsettled families of good estate have now and then one near to or upon their premises thousands of kind and liberal hearts among our farming and planting brethren whose impulses are open as the day to melting charity are familiar with the wants of those who are thus made their dependents and in their accommodation an eye may be kept to the producing of an agreeable effect in locating their habitations and to rudely embellish rather than to mar the domain on which they may be lodged in short cottage architecture in its proper character may be made as effective in all the ornament which it should give to the farm as that of any other structure and if those who have occasion for the cottage will only be content to build and maintain it as it should be and leave off that perpetual aspiration after something unnatural and foreign to its purpose which so many cottage builders of the day attempt and let it stand in its own humble secluded character they will save themselves a world of trouble and pass forwhat they now do notmen possessing a taste for truth and propriety in their endeavors house and cottage furniture this is a subject so thoroughly discussed in the books of late that anything which may here be said would avail but little inasmuch as our opinions might be looked upon as oldfashioned out of date and of no account whateverfor wonderfully modern notions in roomfurnishing have crept into the farm house as well as into town houses indeed we confess to altogether ancient opinions in regard to household furniture and contend that with a few exceptions modern degeneracy has reached the utmost stretch of absurdity in housefurnishing to which the ingenuity of man can arrive fashions in furniture change about as often as the cut of a ladys dress or the shape of her bonnet and pretty much from the same source toothe fancy shops of par once in good old english paris the capital city of france a farmer rich or poor may spend half his annual income every year of his life in taking down old and putting up new furniture and be kept uncomfortable all the time when if he will after a quiet goodtempered talk with his betterhalf agree with her upon the list of necessary articles to make them really comfortable and then a catalogue of what shall comprise the luxurious part of their furnishings which when provided they will fixedly make up their mind to keep and be content with they will remain entirely free from one great source of the ills which flesh is heir to it is pleasant to see a young couple setting out in their housekeeping life well provided with convenient and properlyselected furniture appropriate to all the uses of the family and then to keep and use it and enjoy it like contented sensible people adding to it now and then as its wear or the increasing wants of their family may require old familiar things to which we have long been accustomed and habituated make up a round share of our actual enjoyment a family addicted to constant change in their household furniture attached to nothing content with nothing and looking with anxiety to the next change of fashion which shall introduce something new into the house can take no sort of comfort let their circumstances be ever so affluent it is a kind of dissipation in which some otherwise worthy people are prone to indulge but altogether pernicious in the indulgence it detracts also from the apparent respectability of a family to find nothing old about themas if they themselves were of yesterday and newly dusted out of a modern shopkeepers stock in trade the furniture of a house ought to look as though the family within it once had a grandfatherand as if old things had some veneration from those who had long enjoyed their service we are not about to dictate of what fashion household furniture should be when selected any further than that of a plain substantial and commodious fashion and that it should comport so far as those requirements in it will admit with the approved modes of the day but we are free to say that in these times the extreme of absurdity and unfitness for use is more the fashion than anything else what so useless as the modern french chairs standing on legs like pipestems garoteing your back like a rheumatism and frail as the legs of a spider beneath you as you sit in it and a tribe of equally worthless incumbrances which absorb your money in their cost and detract from your comfort instead of adding to it when you have got them or a bedstead so high that you must have a ladder to climb into it or so low as to scarcely keep you above the level of the floor when lying on it no give us the substantial the easy the free and enjoyable articles and the rest may go to tickle the fancy of those who have a taste for them nor do these flashy furnishings add to ones rank in society or to the good opinion of those whose consideration is most valuable look into the houses of those people who are the really substantial and worthy of the land there will be found little of such frippery with them old furniture wellpreserved useful in everything mark the wellordered arrangement of their rooms and give an air of quietude of comfort and of hospitality to their apartments children cling to such objects in after life as heirlooms of affection and parental regard although we decline to give specific directions about what varieties of furniture should constitute the furnishings of a house or to illustrate its style or fashion by drawings and content ourself with the single remark that it should in all cases be strong plain and durableno sham nor ostentation about itand such as is made for use mere trinkets stuck about the room on center tables in corners or on the mantelpiece are the foolishest things imaginable they are costly they require a world of care to keep them in condition and then with all this care they are good for nothing in any sensible use we have frequently been into a country house where we anticipated better things and on being introduced into the parlor actually found everything in the furniture line so dainty and prinked up that we were afraid to sit down on the frail things stuck around by way of seats for fear of breaking them and everything about it looked so gingerly and inhospitable that we felt an absolute relief when we could fairly get out of it and take a place by the wide old fireplace in the common living room comfortably ensconced in a good old easy highbacked splitbottomed chairthere was positive comfort in that when in the parlor there was nothing but restraint and discomfort no leave all this vanity to townfolk who have nothing betteror who at least think they haveto amuse themselves with it has no fitness for a country dwelling whatever all this kind of frippery smacks of the boarding school the pirouette and the dancing master and is out of character for the farm or the sensible retirement of the country in connection with the subject of furniture a remark may be made on the room arrangement of the house which might perhaps have been more fittingly made when discussing that subject in the designs of our houses some people have a marvellous propensity for introducing into their houses a suite of rooms connected by wide foldingdoors which must always be opened into each other furnished just alike and devoted to extraordinary occasions thus absolutely sinking the best rooms in the house for display half a dozen times in the year and at the sacrifice of the everyday comfort of the family this is nothing but a bastard taste of the most worthless kind introduced from the citythe propriety of which for city life need not here be discussed the presence of such arrangement in a country house is fatal to everything like domestic enjoyment and always followed by great expense and inconvenience no room in any house should be too good for occupation by the family themselvesnot everyday and commonplacebut occupation at any and all times when convenience or pleasure demand it if a large room be required let the single room itself be large not sacrifice an extra room to the occasional extension of the choicer one as in the use of foldingdoors must be done this parlor may be better furnishedand so it should bethan any other room in the house its carpet should be not too good to tread or stand upon or for the children to roll and tumble upon provided their shoes and clothes be clean let the happy little fellows roll and tumble on it to their hearts content when their mother or elder sisters are with themfor it may be perhaps the most joyous and most innocent pleasure of their lives poor things the hearthrug should be in keeping with the carpet also and no floorcloth should be necessary to cover it for fear of soiling but everything free and easy with a comfortable inviting hospitable look about it go into the houses of our great mensuch as live in the countrywhom god made great not moneyand see how they live we speak not of statesmen and politicians alone but great merchants great scholars great divines great mechanics and all men who in mind and attainments are head and shoulder above their class in any of the walks of life and you find no starch or flummery about them we once went out to the country househe lived there all the time for that matterof a distinguished banker of one of our great cities to dine and spend the day with him he had a small farm attached to his dwelling where he kept his horses and cows his pigs and his poultry he had a large plain twostory cottage house with a piazza running on three sides of it from which a beautiful view of the neighboring city and water and land was seen in nearly all directions he was an educated man his father had been a statesman of distinguished ability and station at home and a diplomatist abroad and himself educated in the highest circles of business and of society his wife too was the daughter of a distinguished city merchant quite his equal in all the accomplishments of life his own wealth was competent he was the manager of millions of the wealth of others and his station in society was of the highest yet with all this claim to pretension his house did not cost him eight thousand dollarsand he built it by dayswork too so as to have it faithfully done and the furniture in it aside from library paintings and statuary never cost him three thousand every room in it was a plain one not more highly finished than many a farmers house can afford the furniture of every kind was plain saving perhaps the old family plate and such as he had added to it which was all substantial and made for use the younger childrenand of these younger and older he had severalwe found happy healthy cheerful and frolicking on the carpets and their worthy mother in the plainest yet altogether appropriate garb was sitting among them at her family sewing and kindly welcomed us as we took our seats in front of the open glowing fireplace why sir we exclaimed rubbing our hands in the comfortable glow of warmth which the fire had givenfor it was a cold december dayyou are quite plain as well as wonderfully comfortable in your country housequite different from your former city residence to be sure we are was the reply we stood it as long as we could amid the starch and the gimcracks of street where we rarely had a day to ourselves and the children could never go into the streets but they must be tagged and tasselled in their dress into all sorts of discomfort merely for the sake of appearance so after standing it as long as we could my wife and i determined we would try the country for a while and see what we could make of it we kept our townhouse into which we returned for a winter or two but gave it up for a permanent residence here with which we are perfectly content we see here all the friends we want to see we all enjoy ourselves and the children are healthy and happy and this is but a specimen of thousands of families in the enjoyment of country life including the families of men in the highest station and possessed of sufficient wealth why then should the farmer ape the fashion and the frivolity of the butterflies of town life or permit his family to do it it is the sheerest possible folly in him to do so yet it is a folly into which many are imperceptibly gliding and which if not reformed will ultimately lead to great discomfort to themselves and ruin to their families let thoughtless people do as they choose pay no attention to their extravagance but watch them for a dozen years and see how they come out in their fashionable career and observe the fate of their families as they get established in the like kind of life he who keeps aloof from such temptation will then have no cause to regret that he has maintained his own steady course of living and taught his sons and daughters that a due attention to their own comfort with economical habits in everything relating to housekeeping will be to their lasting benefit in future but we have said enough to convey the ideas in housefurnishing we would wish to impart and the reader will do as he or she no doubt would have done had we not written a word about itgo and select such as may strike their own fancy we received a day or two since a letter from a person at the west entirely unknown to us whose ideas so entirely correspond with our own that we give it a place as showing that a proper taste does prevail among many people in this country in regard to buildings and housefurnishings and which we trust he will pardon us for publishing as according entirely with our own views in conclusion ill dec 18 1851 dear siri received a few days since a copy of the first number of a periodical called the plough into which is copied the elevation of a design for a farm house purporting to be from a forthcoming work of yours entitled rural architecture although a perfect stranger to you you will perhaps allow me to make one or two suggestions i have seen no work yet which seems fully to meet the wants of our country people in the matter of furniture after having built their houses they need showing how to furnish them in the cheapest most neat comfortable convenient and substantial manner the furniture should be designed for use not merely for show i would have it plain but not coarsejust enough for the utmost convenience but nothing superfluous the articles of furniture figured and partially described in the late works on those subjects are mostly of too elaborate and expensive a cast to be generally introduced into our country houses there is too much nabobery about them to meet the wants or suit the taste of the plain american farmer as to outhousesthe barn stable carriage and wagonhouse toolhouse piggery poultryhouse corncrib and granary to say nothing of the rabbitwarren and dovecoteare necessary appendages of the farm house now as cheapness is one great desideratum with nearly all our new beginners in this western region it seems to me that such plans as will conveniently include the greatest number of these under the same roof will be best suited to their necessities i do not mean to be understood that for the sake of the first cost we should pay no regard to the appearance or that we should slight our work or suffer it to be constructed of flimsy or perishable materials we should not only have an eye to taste and durability but put in practice the most strict economy i hope in the above matters you may be able to furnish something better suited to the necessities and means of our plain farmers than has been done by any of your predecessors i remain c most respectfully yours having completed the series of designs for dwelling houses which we had proposed for this work and followed them out with such remarks as were thought fitting to attend them we now pass on to the second part of our subject the outbuildings of the farm in which are to be accommodated the domestic animals which make up a large item of its economy and management together with other buildings which are necessary to complete its requirements we trust that they will be found to be such as the occasion and the wants of the farmer may demand and in economy accommodation and extent be serviceable to those for whose benefit they are designed an apiary or beehouse every farmer should keep beesprovided he have pasturage for them on his own land or if a proper range for their food and stores lie in his immediate vicinity bees are beyond any other domestic stock economical in their keeping to their owners still they require care and that of no inconsiderable kind and skill in their management not understood by every one who attempts to rear them they ask no food they require no assistance in gathering their daily stores beyond that of proper housing in the cheapest description of tenement and with that they are entirely content yet without these they are a contingent and sometimes a troublesome appendage to the domestic stock of the farm we call them domestic in one sense they are so in another they are as wild and untamed as when buzzing and collecting their sweets in the vineyard of timnath where the mighty sampson took their honey from the carcass of the dead lion or as when john the baptist clothed with camels hair ate locusts and wild honey in the arid wastes of palestine although kept in partial bondage for six thousand years the ruling propensity of the bee is to seek a home and shelter in the forest when it emerges in a swarm from the parent hive and no amount of domestic accommodation or kindness of treatment will induce it willingly to migrate from its nursery habitation to another by its side although provided with the choicest comforts to invite its entrance it will soon fly to the woods enter a hollow and dilapidated tree and carve out for itself its future fortunes amid a world of labor and apparent discomfort the bee too barring its industry patience and sweetened labors is an arrant thiefrobbing its nearest neighbors with impunity when the strongest and mercilessly slaughtering its weaker brethren when standing in the way of its rapacity it has been extolled for its ingenuity its patience its industry its perseverance and its virtue patience industry and perseverance it has beyond a doubt and in a wonderful degree but ingenuity and virtue it has none more than the spider who spins his worthless web or the wasp who stings you when disturbing his labors instinct the bee has like all animals but of kind feeling and gratitude it has nothing and with all our vivid nursery remembrance of good doctor watts charming little hymn how doth the little busy bee c c we have long ago set it down as incorrigible to kind treatment or charitable sympathy and looked upon it simply as a thing to be treated kindly for the sake of its labors and as composing one of that delightful family of domestic objects which make our homes attractive pleasant and profitable the active labors of the bee in a bright may or june morning as they fly in their busy order back and forth from their hives or the soothing hum of their playful hours in a summers afternoon are among the most delightful associations of rural life and as a luxury to the sight and the ear they should be associated with every farmers home and with every laborers cottage when practicable and as their due accommodation is to be the object of our present writing a plan is presented for that object in many of the modern structures held out for imitation the beehouse or apiary is an expensive pretentious affair got up in an ambitious way with efforts at style in the semblance of a temple a pagoda or other absurdity the very appearance of which frightens the simple bee from its propriety and in which we never yet knew a colony of them to become and remain successful the insect is as we have observed wild and untamablea savage in its habits and rude in its temper it rejects all cultivated appearances and seeks only its own temporary convenience together with comfortable room for its stores and the increase of its kind and therefore the more rustic and simple its habitation the better is it pleased with its position illustration apiary the beehouse should front upon a sheltered and sunny aspect it should be near the ground in a clean and quiet spot free from the intrusion of other creatures either human or profane and undisturbed by noisome smells and uncouth soundsfor it loathes all these instinctively and loves nothing so much as the wild beauty of nature itself the plan here presented is of the plainest and least expensive kind nine posts or crutches are set into the ground sufficiently deep to hold them firm and to secure them from heaving out by the frost the distance of these posts apart may be according to the size of the building and to give it strength enough to resist the action of the wind the front posts should be 9 feet high above the ground the rear posts should be 7 feetthat a man with his hat on may stand upright under themand 6 feet from the front line the two end posts directly in the rear of the front corner posts should be 3 feet back from them and on a line to accommodate the pitch of the roof from the front to the rear a light plate is to be fitted on the top line of the front posts a plate at each end should run back to the posts in rear and then another crossplate or girt from each one of these middle posts to the post in rear of all to meet the plate which surmounts this rear line of posts and a parallel plate or rafter should be laid from the two intermediate posts at the ends to connect them and for a central support to the roof intermediate central posts should also be placed opposite those in front to support the central plate and not exceeding 12 feet apart a shed roof of boards or shingles tightly laid should cover the whole sufficiently projecting over the front rear and sides to give the house abundant shelter and make it architecturally agreeable to the eyesay 12 to 18 inches according to its extent a corner board should drop two feet below the plate with such finish by way of ornament as may be desirable the ends should be tightly boarded up against the weather from bottom to top the rear should also be tightly boarded from the bottom up to a level with the stand inside for the hives and from 15 to 18 inches above that to the roof fitted into the space thus left in the rear should be a light though substantial swing door hung from the upper boarding made in sections extending from one post to the other as the size of the house may determine and secured with hooks or buttons as may be convenient the outside of the structure is thus completed the inside arrangement for the hives may be made in two different ways as the choice of the apiarian may govern in the mode in which his hives are secured the most usual is the stand method which may be made thus at each angle equidistant say 18 to 24 inches inside from the rear side and ends of the buildingas shown in the ground planand opposite to each rear and end post suspend perpendicularly a line of stout pieces of twoinch plank 4 inches wide well spiked on to the rafters above reaching down within two feet of the groundwhich is to hold up the bottom of the stand on which the hives are to rest from each bottom end of these suspended strips secure another piece of like thickness and width horizontally back to the post in rear of it at the side and ends then lengthwise the building and turning the angles at the ends and resting on these horizontal pieces just described lay other strips 32 inches set edgewiseone in front and another in rear inside each post and suspended strip and close to it and secured by heavy nails so that there shall be a double line of these strips on a level extending entirely around the interior from the front at each end this forms the hanging framework for the planks or boards on which the hives are to rest now for the hives first let as many pieces of sound one and a half or twoinch plank as you have hives to set upon them be cut long enough to reach from the boarding on the rear and ends of the building to one inch beyond and projecting over the front of the outer strip last described let these pieces of plank be well and smoothly planed and laid lengthwise across the aforesaid strips not less than four inches apart from each otherif a less number of hives be in the building than it will accommodate at four inches apart no matter how far apart they may bethese pieces of plank are the ferms for the hives on which they are to sit and as we have for many years adopted the plan now described with entire success a brief description is given of our mode of hive and the process for obtaining the surplus honey we say surplus for destroying the bees to obtain their honey is a mode not at all according to our notions of economy or mercy and we prefer to take that honey only which the swarm may make after supplying their own wants and the stores for their increasing family this process is given in the report of a committee of gentlemen appointed by the new york state agricultural society on a hive which we exhibited on that occasion with the following note attached at their show at buffalo in 1848 i have seen examined and used several different plans of patent hive of which there are probably thirty invented and used more or less i have found all which i have ever seen unsatisfactory not carrying out in full the benefits claimed for them the bee works and lives i believe solely by instinct i do not consider it an inventive or very ingenious insect to succeed well its accommodations should be of the simplest and securest form therefore instead of adopting the complicated plans of many of the patent hives i have made and used a simple box like that now before you containing a cube of one foot square insidemade of one and a quarter inch sound pine plank well jointed and planed on all sides and put together perfectly tight at the joints with white lead ground in oil and the inside of the hive at the bottom champered off to threeeighths of an inch thick with a door for the bees in front of four inches long by threeeighths of an inch high i do this that there may be a thin surface to come in contact with the shelf on which they rest thus preventing a harbor for the beemoth i have never used a patent hive which would exclude the beemoth nor any one which would so well do it as this having never been troubled with that scourge since i used this tight hive on the top of the hive an inch or two from the front is made a passage for the bees of an inch wide and six to eight inches long to admit the bees into an upper hive for surplus honey which passage is covered when no vessel for that purpose is on the top for obtaining the honey i use a common ten or twelvequart water pail inverted with the bail turned over in which the bees deposit their surplus like the sample before you the pail will hold about twenty pounds of honey this is simple cheap and expeditious the pail costing not exceeding twentyfive cents is taken off in a moment the bail replaced and the honey ready for transportation or market and always in place if there is time for more honey to be made my bees made two pailsfull in succession this year another pail can be put on at once such gentlemen in short is my method i have kept bees about twenty years i succeed better on this plan than with any other in addition to this our hives are painted white or other light color on the outside to protect them from warping and as a further security against the beemoth or miller which infests and destroys so many carelesslymade hives as to discourage the efforts of equally careless people in keeping them inside the hive on each end we fasten by shingle nails about halfway between the bottom and top a small piece of halfinch board about the size of a common window button and with a like notch in it set upward but stationary on which when the hive is to receive the swarm a stick is laid across to support the comb as it is built from falling in hot weather at such time also when new and used for the first time the underside of the top is scratched with the tines of a table fork or a nail so as to make a rough surface to which the new comb can be fastened in addition to the pails on the top of the hives to receive the surplus honey we sometimes use a flat box the size of the hive in diameter and six or seven inches high inside which will hold twentyfive to thirty pounds of honey the pails we adopted as an article of greater convenience for transporting the honey the other plan of arranging the hives alluded to is suspending them between the strips before described by means of cleats secured on to the front and rear sides of the hive say twothirds the way up from the bottom in such case the strips running lengthwise the house must be brought near enough together to receive the hives as hung by the cleats and the bottom boards or forms must be much smaller than those already described and hung with wire hooks and staples to the sides with a button on the rear to close up or let them down a sufficient distance to admit the air to pass freely across them and up into the hiveweeks plan in fact for which he has a patent together with some other fancied improvements such as chambers to receive the boxes for the deposit of surplus honey this by the way is the best patent we have seen and mr weeks having written an ingenious and excellent treatise on the treatment of the bee we freely recommend his book to the attention of every apiarian who wishes to succeed in their management as a rule we have no confidence in patent hives we have seen scores of them of different kinds have tried several of great pretension to sundry virtuessuch as excluding moths and other marvelous benefitsand after becoming the victim of bee empirics to the tune of many a dollar have thrown aside the gimcracks and taken again to a commonsense method of keeping our bees as here described the bees themselves we feel bound to say seem to hold these patentright habitations in quite as sovereign contempt as ourself reluctantly going into them and getting out of them at the first safe opportunity but as a treatise on beekeeping is not a part of this present work we must for further information commend the inquirer on that subject to some of the valuable treatises extant on so prolific a subject among which we name those of bevan weeks and miner the beehouse should be thoroughly whitewashed inside every spring and kept clean of cobwebs wasps nests and vermin and it may be painted outside a soft and agreeable color in keeping with the other buildings of the farm its premises should be clean and sweet the grass around should be kept mowed close low trees or shrubbery should stand within a few yards of it that the new swarms may light upon them when coming out and not for want of such settling places be liable to loss from flying away it should also be within sight and hearing and at no great distance from a continuallyfrequented room in the dwellingperhaps the kitchen if convenient that in their swarming season they may be secured as they leave the parent hive the apiary is a beautiful object with its busy tenantry and to the invalid or one who loves to look upon gods tiny creatures it may while away many an agreeable hour in watching their laborsthus adding pleasure to profit the cost of a beehouse on the plan given may be from ten to fifty dollars according to the price of material and the amount of labor expended upon it it should not be an expensive structure in any event as its purpose does not warrant it if a gimcrack affair be wanted for the purposes of ornament or expense any sum of money may be squandered upon it which the fancy of its builder may choose to spare an icehouse among the useful and convenient appendages to the farm and country family establishment is the icehouse different from the general opinion which prevailed in our country before ice became so important an article of commerce and of home consumption the building which contains it should stand aboveground instead of below it and the plainer and more simple it can be constructed the better the position of the icehouse may be that which is most convenient to the dwelling or to the wants of those who use it if it can be placed beneath the shade of trees it will so far be relieved from the influence of the sun but it should be so constructed that sunshine will not affect the ice within it even if it stand unsheltered and as it has by the icemerchants of our eastern cities who put up large quantities for exportation abroad and others in the interior who furnish ice in quantity for home consumption been proved to be altogether the better plan to build the icehouse entirely above ground we shall present no other mode of construction than this it may be added that five years experience with one of our own building has confirmed our opinion of the superiority of this over any other plan which may be adopted the design here presented is of the most economical kind yet sufficiently ornamental to make it an agreeable appendage to any family establishment the size may be 12 feet squareless than that would be too small for keeping ice welland from that up to any required extent the idea here given is simply the principle of construction the posts should be full eight feet high above the ground to where the plate of the roof is attached and built thus illustration icehouse mark out your ground the size you require for the house then commencing at one corner dig opposite each other a double set of holes one foot deep and two and a half feet apart on each side of the intended building say three feet equidistant so that when the posts stand up they will present a double set one and a half feet apart then set in your posts which should be of oak chestnut or some lasting wood and pack the earth firmly around them if the posts are sawed they may be 46 inches in size set edgeways toward each other if not sawed they may be round sticks cut from the woods or split from the body of a tree quarteredbut sizable so as to appear decentand the insides facing each other as they stand up lined to a surface to receive the planking of course when the posts are set in the ground they are to show a square form or skeleton of what the building is to be when completed when this is done square off the top of each post to a level all round then frame or spike on to each line of posts a plate say six inches wide and four to six inches deep and stay the two plates together strongly so as to form a double frame now plank or board up closely the inside of each line of posts that the space between them shall be a fair surface cut out or leave out a space for a door in the center of the side where you want it two and a half or three feet wide and six and a half feet high and board up the inner partition sides of this opening so as to form a doorcasing on each side that the space between the two lines of posts may be a continuous box all around then fill up this space between the posts with moist tanbark or sawdust well packed from the ground up to the plates and the body of the house is inclosed sunproof and airproof to guard the ice now lay down inside the building some sticksnot much matter what so that they be leveland on them lay loose planks or boards for a floor cover this floor with a coating of straw a foot thick and it is ready to receive the ice for the roof take common 34 joists as rafters or in place of them poles from the woods long enough in a pitch of full 35 from a horizontal line to carry the roof at least four feet over the outside of the plates and secure the rafters well by pins or spikes to them then board over and shingle it leaving a small aperture at the top through which run a small pipe say eight inches in diametera stovecrock will dofor a ventilator then set in 4 little posts say two feet highas in the designthrow a little foursided pointed cap on to the top of these posts and the roof is done if you want to ornament the under side of the roof in a rude wayand we would advise ittake some pieces of 34 scantling such as were used for the roof if the posts are of sawed stuffif not rough limbs of trees from the woods to match the rough posts of the same kind and fasten them to the posts and the under side of the roof by way of brackets as shown in the design when the ice is put into the house a close floor of boards should be laid on joists which rest on the plates loosely so that this floor can be removed when putting in ice and that covered five or six inches deep with tan or sawduststraw will do if the other can not be hadand the inside arrangement is complete two doors should be attached to the opening where the ice is put in and taken out one on the inner side of the lining and the other on the outer side both opening out tan sawdust or straw should also be placed on the top of the ice when put in so as to keep the air from it as much as possible and as the ice is removed it will settle down upon and still preserve it care must be taken to have a drain under the floor of the house to pass off the water which melts from the ice as it would if standing there injure its keeping it will be seen that by an error in the cut of the ground plan the inside line of posts does not show as in the outer line which they should do nor is the outside door inserted as is shown in the elevation these defects however will be rectified by the builder we have given considerable thought to this subject and can devise no shape to the building more appropriate than this nor one cheaper in construction it may be built for fifty to a hundred dollars according to the cost of material and labor and the degree of finish given to it it is hardly worth while to expatiate upon the convenience and economy of an icehouse to an american those who love wellkept meats fruits butter milk and various etceteras for the table understand its utility well to say nothing of the cooling draughts in the way of drinks in hot weather to which it addswhen not taken to extremessuch positive luxury we commend the icehouse wellfilled most heartily to every good country housekeeper as a matter of convenience economy and luxury adding next to nothing to the living expenses and as an appendage to the main buildings an item of little cost and a considerable degree of ornament if an underground icehouse be preferred to the plan here shown a side hill or bank with a northerly exposure is the best location for it and the manner of building should be mainly like this for the body of the house the roof however should be only twosided and the door for putting in and taking out the ice may be in the gable on the ground level the drainage under the floor and precautions for keeping the ice should be quite as thorough as we have described as otherwise the earth surrounding it on three sides at least of the house will be a ready conductor of warmth and melt the ice with great rapidity if the underground plan is adopted but little more than the roof will show and of course be of little ornament in the way of appearance the ashhouse and smokehouse these two objects may both for convenience and economy be well combined under one roof and we have thus placed them in connection the building is an exceedingly simple structure made of stone or brick the body 10 feet high and of such size as may be desirable with a simple roof and a plain hooded chimney illustration ash house and smoke house in the ground plan will be seen a brick or stone partitionwhich may extend to such height as may be necessary to contain the bulk of ashes required for storage within iton one side of the building to which a door gives access the opposite side and overhead is devoted to the smokehouse in which the various girts and hooks may be placed for sustaining the meats to be smoked the building should be tied together by joists at the plates properly anchored into the walls to prevent their spreading a stove or pans or neither as the method of keeping the smoke alive may govern can be placed inside to which the chimney in the roof may serve as a partial escape or not as required the whole process is so simple and so easily understood that further explanation is unnecessary a great advantage that a house of this construction has is the convenience of storing the smoked meats for an indefinite time even through the whole season keeping them dark dry and cool and permitting at any time a smoke to be made to drive out the flies if they find their way into it the ashes can of course be removed at any time by the door at which they are thrown in the poultryhouse as poultry is an indispensable appendage to the farm in all cases the poultryhouse is equally indispensable for their accommodation and for the most profitable management of the fowls themselves and most convenient for the production of their eggs and young indeed without wellarranged quarters for the fowls of the farm they are exceedingly troublesome and of doubtful profit but with the proper buildings devoted to them exclusively they become one of the most interesting and agreeable objects with which either the farm or the country house is associated it is hardly worth while to eulogize poultry their merits and virtues are written in the hearts of all provident housekeepers and their beauty and goodness are familiar to every son and daughter of the rural homestead we shall then proceed at once to discuss their proper accommodation in the cheapest and most familiar method with which we are acquainted the henhousefor hens barndoor fowls we mean are the first and chief stock of the kind to be provided for and with them most of the other varieties can be associatedshould be located in a warm sheltered and sunny place with abundant grounds about it where they can grazehens eat grassand scratch and enjoy themselves to their hearts content in all seasons when the ground is open and they can scratch into or range over its surface some peopleindeed a good many peoplepicket in their gardens to keep hens out but we prefer an enclosure to keep the hens in at all seasons when they are troublesome which after all is only during short seasons of the year when seeds are planted or sown and grain and vegetables are ripening otherwise they may range at will on the farm doing good in their destruction of insects and deriving much enjoyment to themselves for hens on the whole are happy things illustration poultry lawn we here present the elevation of a poultryhouse in perspective to show the principle which we would adopt in its construction and which may be extended to any required length and to which may be added any given area of ground or yardroom which the circumstances of the proprietor may devote to it it is as will be seen of a most rustic appearance and built as cheaply yet thoroughly as the subject may require its length we will say is 20 feet its breadth 16 and its height 10 feet made of posts set into the groundfor we do not like sills and floors of wood because rats are apt to burrow under them which are their worst enemiesand boarded up either inside or outside as in the case of the icehouse previously described though not double plates are laid on these posts to connect them firmly together and the rafters rest on the plates as usual the chamber floor is 9 feet high above the ground and may be used either for laying purposes by the fowls or reserved as a storageroom for their feed the roof is broadly drawn over the body of the building to shelter it and through the point of the roof in the center is a ventilator with a covered top and a vane significant of its purpose it is also sufficiently lighted with glass windows into which our draughtsman has put the diamondpaned glass contrary to our notions but as he had no doubt an eye to the picturesque we let it pass only remarking that if we were building the house on our own account there should be no such nonsense about it the front windows are large to attract the warmth of the winters sun a section of picket fence is also attached and trees in the rearboth of which are necessary to a complete establishment the first to secure the poultry in the contiguous yards and the trees to give them shade and even roostingplaces if they prefer such lodgings in warm weatherfor which we consider them eminently wholesome the wooden floor is dispensed with as was remarked to keep rid of the vermin if the ground be gravelly or sandy it will be sufficiently dry if a heavy or damp soil be used it should be underdrained which will effectually dry it and be better for the fowls than a floor of either wood brick or stone doors of sufficient size can be made on the yard sides of the house near the ground for the poultry to enter either the living or roosting apartments at pleasure and hung with butts on the upper side to be closed when necessary interior arrangement the front door opens into the main living room at each end and in the rear are tiers of boxes one foot wide one and a half feet long and one and a half feet highthe lowest tier elevated two feet above the groundand built one tier above the other and snugly partitioned between with a hole at one corner of each ten inches high and eight inches wide for passing in to them and a shelf or passageboard nine inches wide in front these are the nesting boxes and should be kept supplied with short soft straw or hay orts for that purpose hens love secrecy in their domestic economy and are wonderfully pleased with the opportunity to hide away and conceal themselves while laying indeed such concealment or the supposition of it we have no doubt promotes fecundity as it is well known that a hen can stop laying almost at pleasure when disturbed in her regular habits and settled plans of life burns says the best laid schemes of mice and men gang aft agley and why not hens we think so if turkeys be kept in the premises the females can also be accommodated in these boxes as they are fond of laying in company with the hens and frequently in the same nests only that they require larger entrances into them or a tier of boxes may be made on the ground for their convenience a door leads from the rear of this room into the roosting apartment through which is a passage to the back side of the building and a door opposite leading out into the yard on each side of this passage are roosts rising each behind and above the other 18 inches apart the lowest roosts may be three feet from the ground and the highest six feet that they may easily fly from one to the other and in this way they may all be approached to catch the fowls when required for the roosts slender poles two to three inches in diametersmall trees cut from the woods with the bark on are the bestmay be used and they should be secured through augur holes in board slats suspended from the floor joists overhead this apartment should be cleaned out as often as once a fortnight both for cleanliness and healthfor fowls like to be clean and to have pure air a flight of stairs may be made in one corner of the front room to go into the chamber if preferred but a swing ladder hung by one end with hinges to the joists above is for such purpose a more cleanly mode of access which when not in use may be hooked up to the under side of the floor above and a trap door shutting into the chamber floor and also hung on hinges will accommodate the entrance for feeding troughs we have seen many ingenious contrivances and among them possibly a yankee patent or two but all these we put aside as of little account a common segar box or any other castoff thing that will hold their food is just as good as the most complicated invention and in common feeding there is no better mode than to scatter abroad their corn and let them pick it up at their pleasurewhen spread on a clean surface we think also that except for fattening poultry stated hours of feeding are best for the birds themselves and that they be fed only such quantity as they will pick up clean water should if possible be kept constantly by them and if a small running stream could pass through the yard all the better if it be desirable to have fresh eggs during winterand that is certainly a conveniencea box stove may be set in the living room and properly protected by a grating around it for warming the living apartment it may be remarked however that this winterlaying of hens is usually a forcing business a hen will lay but about a given number of eggs in a year say a hundredwe believe this is about the number which the most observant of poultrykeepers allow themand what she lays in winter must be subtracted from the number she would otherwise lay in the spring summer or autumn yet a warm house will laying aside keep the fowls with less food and in greater comfort than if cold and left to their own natural warmth there is usually little difficulty in keeping hens turkies ducks and geese together in the same inclosure during winter and early spring before the grass grows but geese and turkies require greater range during the warm season than the others and should have it both for convenience to themselves and profit to their owners for winter quarters low shelters may be made for the waterfowls in the yards and the turkies will frequently prefer to share the shelter of the hens on the roosts in the house guineahenscruel vindictive things as they areshould never be allowed within a common poultry yard always quarrelsome and never quiet they should take to the farmyard with the cattle where they may range at will and take their amusement in fisticuffs with each other at pleasure neither should peacocks be allowed to come into the poultry inclosures during the breeding season they are anything but amiable in their manners to other birds with the care and management of the poultry department after thus providing for their accommodation it is not our province to interfere that is a subject too generally understood to require further remark nor need we discuss the many varieties of poultry which at the present time so arrest the attention of many of our good country people and we will leave so important a subject to the meditations of the new england poultry society who have taken the gallinaceous and other tribes under their special cognizance and will doubtless in due time illumine the world with various knowledge in this department of rural economy not yet dreamt of in our philosophy the recently published poultry books too with an amplitude and particularity in the discussion of the different breeds and varieties which shuts all suspicions of selfinterest into the corner have given such a fund of information on the subject that any further inquiry may with entire good will be turned over to their pages the dovecote this is a department in itself not common among the farm buildings in the united states and for the reason probably that the domestic pigeon or housedove is usually kept more for amusement than for profitthere being little actual profit about themand is readily accommodated in the spare lofts of sheds and outbuildings devoted to other purposes pigeons however add to the variety and interest of the poultry department and as there are many different breeds of them they are general favorites with the juveniles of the family our present object is not to propose any distinct building for pigeon accommodation but to give them a location in other buildings where they will be conveniently provided with room and least annoying by their presencefor be it known they are ofttimes a most serious annoyance to many crops of the farm when kept in any considerable numbers as well as in the waste and havoc they make in the stores of the barns and granaries although graceful and beautiful birds generally clean and tidy in their personal habits out of doors they are the filthiest housekeepers imaginable and no building can be especially devoted to their use if not often swept and cleaned but what will soon become an intolerable nuisance within and not much better without and the ground immediately around the premises a dirty place the common pigeon is a pugnacious cavalier warring apparently upon mere punctilio as we have often seen in the distant strutandcoo of a stranger bird to his mate even if she be the very incarnation of rejected addresses on all these accounts we would locateunless a small and select family of fancy birds perhapsthe pigeon stock at the principal farmyard and in the lofts of the cattle sheds or the chambers of the stable wherever the pigeon accommodations are designed to be a close partition should separate their quarters from the room occupied for other purposes with doors for admission to those who have to do with them in cleaning their premises or to take the birds when needed a line of holes five inches high and four inches widethe top of the hole slightly archedshould be made say 18 inches apart for the distance of room they are to occupy in the building a foot above the top of these another line may be made and so on tiering them up to the height intended to devote to them a line of shelves or lightingboards six to eight inches wide should then be placed one inch below the bottom of these holes and firmly braced beneath and nailed to the weatherboarding of the house inside a range of box should be made of corresponding length with the line of holes to embrace every entrance from the outside 18 inches wide and partitioned equidistant between each entrance so as to give a square box of 18 inches to each pair of birds the bottom board of each ascending tier of boxes will of course be the top of the boxes below and these must be made perfectly tight to prevent the offal of the upper ones from falling through to the annoyance of their neighbors below the back of these boxes should have a line of swing doors hung with butts or hinges from the top and fastened with buttons or hooks at the bottom to allow admission or examination at any time to those who have the care of them this plan of door is indispensable to clean them outwhich should be done as often as once a week or fortnight at farthestand to secure the birds as they may be wanted for the table or other purposesfor it will be recollected that squabs just feathered out are considered a delicious dish at the most sumptuous tables it will be understood that these boxes above described are within a partitioned room with a floor in their rear with sufficient space for the person in charge of them to pass along and to hold the baskets or whatever is to receive the offal of their boxes as it is taken out this offal is valuable as a highly stimulating manure and is sought for by the morocco tanners at a high pricefrequently at twentyfive cents a bushel as pigeons are prolific breeders laying and hatching six or seven times a year and in warm climates oftener they require a good supply of littershort cut soft straw is the bestwhich should be freely supplied at every new incubation and the old litter removed the boxes too should be in a warm place snugly made and well sheltered from the wind and driving storms for pigeons although hardy birds when grown should be well protected while young the common food of the pigeon is grain of almost any kind and worms and other insects which they pick up in the field on the whole they are a pleasant bird when they can be conveniently kept and are worth the trifling cost that their proper housing may demand if our opinion were asked as to the best and least troublesome kind of pigeon to be kept we should say the finest and most hardy of the common kind which are usually found in the collections throughout the country but there are many fancy breedssuch as the fantail the powter the tumbler the ruffler and perhaps another variety or twoall pretty birds and each distinct in their appearance and in some of their domestic habits the most beautiful of the pigeon kind however is the carrier they are the very perfection of grace and symmetry and beauty their colors are always brilliant and changing and in their flight they cleave the air with a rapidity which no other varietyindeed which scarce any other bird of any kind can equal history is full of examples of their usefulness in carrying tidings from one country to another in letters or tokens fastened to their necks or legs for which they are trained by those who have thus used them but which now the well known telegraph wire has nearly superseded all these fancy breeds require great care in their management to keep them pure in blood as they will all mix more or less with the common pigeon as they come in contact with them and the selection of whatever kind is wanted to be kept must be left to those who are willing to bestow the pains which their necessary care may demand a piggery the hog is an animal for which we have no especial liking be he either a tender suckling nosing and tugging at the wellfilled udder of his dam or a wellproportioned porker basking in all the plenitude of swinish luxury albeit in the use of his flesh we affect not the jew but liking it moderately well in its various preparations as a substantial and savory article of diet still the hog is an important item of our agricultural economy and his production and proper treatment is a valuable study to all who rear him as a creature either of profit or convenience in the western and southern states a mild climate permits him to be easily reared and fed off for market with little heed to shelter or protection while in the north he requires care and covering during winter not only this in all places the hog is an unruly mischievous creature and has no business really in any other place than where he can he controlled and kept at a moments call but as tastes and customs differ essentially with regard to his training and destiny to such as agree with us in opinion that his proper place is in the sty particularly when feeding for pork a plan of piggery is given such as may be economical in construction and convenient in its arrangement both for the swine itself and him who has charge of him the design here given is for a building 36 feet long and 24 feet wide with twelvefeet posts the lower or living room for the swine 9 feet high and a storage chamber above for the grain and other food required for his keeping the roof has a pitch of 40 from a horizontal line spreading over the sides and gables at least 20 inches and coarsely bracketed the entrance front projects 6 feet from the main building by 12 feet in length over its main door in the gable is a door with a hoisting beam and tackle above it to take in the grain and a floor over the whole area receives it a window is in each gable end a ventilator passes up through this chamber and the roof to let off the steam from the cooking vats below and the foul air emitted by the swine by the side of which is the furnacechimney giving it on the whole as respectable an appearance as a pigsty need pretend to illustration piggery interior arrangement at the left of the entrance is a flight of stairs b leading to the chamber above on the right is a small area a with a window to light it a door from this leads into the main room c where stands a chimney d with a furnace to receive the fuel for cooking the food for which are two kettles or boilers with wooden vats on the top if the extent of food demands them these are secured with broad wooden covers to keep in the steam when cooking an iron valve is placed in the back flue of the furnace which may fall upon either side to shut off the fire from either of the kettles around which the fire may revolve or the valve may stand in a perpendicular position at will if both kettles be heated at the same time but as the most economical mode is to cook one kettle while the other is in process of feeding out and vice versa scarcely more than one at a time will be required in use over each kettle is a sliding door with a short spout to slide the food into them when wanted if necessary and it can be conveniently done a well may be sunk under this room and a pump inserted at a convenient place or if equally convenient a pipe may bring the water in from a neighboring stream or spring on three sides of this room are feeding pens e and sleeping partitions f for the swine these several apartments are accommodated with doors which open into separate yards on the sides and in rear or a large one for the entire family as may be desired construction the frame of this building is of strong timber and stout for its size the sills should be 8 inches square the corner posts of the same size and the intermediate posts 86 inches in diameter in the center of these posts grooves should be made 2 inches wide and deep to receive the plank sides which should be 2 inches thick and let in from the level of the chamber by a flush cutting for that purpose out of the grooves inside thus using no nails or spikes and holding the planks tight in their place that they may not be rooted out or rubbed off by the hogs and the inner projection of the main posts left to serve as rubbing posts for themfor no creature so loves to rub his sides when fatting as a hog and this very natural and praiseworthy propensity should be indulged these planks like the posts should particularly the lower ones be of hard wood that they may not be eaten off above the chamber floor thinner planks may be used but all should be well jointed that they may lie snug and shut out the weather the center post in the floor plan of the engraving is omitted by mistake but it should stand there like the others inside posts at the corners and in the sides of the partitions like the outside ones should be also placed and grooved to receive the planking four and a half feet high and their upper ends be secured by tenons into mortices in the beams overhead the troughs should then if possible be made of cast iron or in default of that the hardest of white oak plank strongly spiked on to the floor and sides and the apartment may then be called hogprooffor a more unquiet destructive creature to a building in which he is confined does not live than the hog the slide or spout to conduct the swill and other feed from the feedingroom into the trough should be inserted through the partition planks with a steep slant the whole length of the trough that the feed may be readily thrown into any or all parts of it this slide should be of twoinch whiteoak plank and bound along the bottom by a strip of hoopiron to prevent the pigs from eating it offa habit they are prone to then firmly spiked down to the partition planks and through the ends to the adjoining studs and the affair is complete with what experience we have had with the hog and that by no means an agreeable one we can devise no better method of accommodation than this here described and it certainly is the cheapest but the timber and lumber used must be sound and strong and then properly put together it may defy their most destructive ingenuity of the separate uses to which the various apartments may be put nothing need be said as the circumstances of every farmer will best govern them one to three hundred dollars according to price of material and labor will build this piggery besides fitting it up with furnace and boilers it may be contracted or enlarged in size as necessity may direct but no one with six to twenty porkers in his fatting pens a year will regret the expense of building a convenient appurtenance of this kind to his establishment a word may be pardoned in relation to the too universal practice of permitting swine to prowl along the highways and in the yards and lawns of the farm house there is nothing so slovenly wasteful and destructive to ones thrift and so demoralizing in a small way as is this practice what so revolting to one of the least tidy nature whatever as a villainous brute with a litter of filthy pigs at her heels and the slimy ooze of a mudpuddle reeking and dripping from their sides see the daubs of mud marking every fencepost far and near along the highway or whereever they run a burrow is rooted up at every shady point a nuisance at every corner you turn and their abominable snouts into everything that is filthy or obscenea living curse to all that is decent about them an ishmaelite among the farm stock they are shunned and hated by every living thing when at large but put the creature in his pen with a ring in his nose if permitted to go into the adjoining yard and comfortably fed your pig if of a civilized breed is a quiet inoffensiveindeed gentlemanly sort of animal and as such he is entitled to our tolerationregard we cannot say for in all the pages of our reading we learn by no creditable history of any virtuous sympathies in a hog farm barns the farm barn next to the farm house is the most important structure of the farm itself in the northern and middle states and even at the south and southwest where less used they are of more importance in the economy of farm management than is generally supposed indeed to our own eyes a farm or a plantation appears incomplete without a good barn accommodation as much as without good household appointmentsand without them no agricultural establishment can be complete in all its proper economy the most thorough barn structures perhaps to be seen in the united states are those of the state of pennsylvania built by the german farmers of the lower and central counties they are large and expensive in their construction and in a strictly economical view perhaps more costly than required yet there is a substance and durability in them that is exceedingly satisfactory and where the pecuniary ability of the farmer will permit may well be an example for imitation in the structure of the barn and in its interior accommodation much will depend upon the branches of agriculture to which the farm is devoted a farm cultivated in grain chiefly requires but little room for stabling purposes storage for grain in the sheaf and granaries will require its room while a stock farm requires a barn with extensive hay storage and stables for its cattle horses and sheep in all climates not admitting such stock to live through the winter in the field like the great grazing states west of the alleghanies again there are wide districts of country where a mixed husbandry of grain and stock is pursued which require barns and outbuildings accommodating both and to supply the exigencies of each we shall present such plans as may be appropriate and that may possibly by a slight variation be equally adapted to either or all of their requirements it may not be out of place here to remark that many designers of barns sheds and other outbuildings for the accommodation of farm stock have indulged in fanciful arrangements for the convenience and comfort of animals which are so complicated that when constructed as they sometimes are the practical commonsense farmer will not use them and in the learning required in their use are altogether unfit for the use and treatment they usually get from those who have the daily care of the stock which they are intended for and for the rough usage they receive from the animals themselves a very pretty and a very plausible arrangement of stabling and feeding and all the etceteras of a barn establishment may be thus got up by an ingenious theorist at the fireside which will work to a charm as he dilates upon its good qualities untried but when subjected to experiment will be utterly worthless for practical use all this we in our practice have gone through and after many years experience have come to the conclusion that the simplest plan of construction consistent with an economical expenditure of the material of food for the consumption of stock is by far the most preferable another item to be considered in this connection is the comparative value of the stock the forage fed to them and the labor expended in feeding and taking care of them we will illustrate suppose a farm to lie in the vicinity of a large town or city its value is perhaps a hundred dollars an acre the hay cut upon it is worth fifteen dollars a ton at the barn and straw and coarse grains in proportion and hired labor ten or twelve dollars a month consequently the manager of this farm should use all the economy in his power by the aid of cuttingboxes and other machinery to make the least amount of forage supply the wants of his stock and the internal economy of his barn arranged accordingly because labor is his cheapest item and food the dearest then for any contrivance to work up his forage the closestby way of machinery or manual laborby which it will serve the purposes of keeping his stock is true economy and the making and saving of manures is an item of the first importance his buildings and their arrangements throughout should on these accounts be constructed in accordance with his practice if on the other hand lands are cheap and productive and labor comparatively dear a different practice will prevail he will feed his hay from the mow without cutting the straw will be either stacked out and the cattle turned to it to pick what they like of it and make their beds on the remainder or if it is housed he will throw it into racks and the stock may eat what they choose it is but onethird or onehalf the labor to do this that the other mode requires and the saving in this makes up and perhaps more than makes up for the increased quantity of forage consumed again climate may equally affect the mode of winter feeding the stock the winters may be mild the hay may be stacked in the fields when gathered or put into small barns built for hay storage alone and the manure scattered over the fields by the cattle as they are fed from either of them may be knocked to pieces with the dungbeetle in the spring or harrowed and bushed over the ground and with the very small quantity of labor required in all this such practice will be more economical than any other which can be adopted it is therefore a subject of deliberate study with the farmer in the construction of his outbuildings what plans he shall adopt in regard to them and their fitting up and arrangement with these considerations before us we shall submit such plans of barn structures as may be adapted for general use where shelters for the farm crops and farm stock are required and which may in their interior arrangement be fitted for almost any locality of our country as the judgment and the wants of the builder may require design i this is a design of barn partially on the pennsylvania plan with underground stables and a stonewalled basement on three sides with a line of posts standing open on the yard front and a wall pierced by doors and windows retreating 12 feet under the building giving in front a shelter for stock two sheds by way of wings are run out to any desired length on each side the body of this barn which is built of wood above the basement is 6046 feet the posts 18 feet high above the sills the roof is elevated at an angle of 40 from a horizontal line and the gables hooded or truncated 14 feet wide at the verge so as to cover the large doors at the ends the main roof spreads 3 to 4 feet over the body of the barn and runs from the side eaves in a straight line different from what is shown in the engraving which appears of a gambrel or hipped fashion the sides are covered with boards laid vertically and battened with narrow strips 3 inches wide the large doors in the ends are 14 feet wide and 14 feet high a slatted blind window is in each gable for ventilation and a door 96 feet on the yard side illustration interior arrangement a main floor a 12 feet wide runs the whole length through the center of the barn s s are the large doors h h are trap doors to let hay or straw down to the alleys of the stables beneath b is the principal bay for hay storage 16 feet wide and runs up to the roof c is the bay 2616 feet for the grain mow if required for that purpose d is a granary 1316 feet and 8 feet high e a storage room for fanning mill cuttingbox or other machinery or implements of same size and height as the granary f is a passage 8 feet wide leading from the main floor to the yard door through which to throw out litter over this passage and the granary and storeroom may be stored grain in the sheaf or hay the main floor will accommodate the thrashingmachine horsepower cutting box c c when at work a line of movable sleepers or poles may be laid across the floor 10 feet above it on a line of girts framed into the main posts for that purpose over which when the sides of the barn are full either hay or grain may be deposited up to the ridge of the roof and thus afford large storage and if the demands of the crops require it after the sides and over the floor is thus filled the floor itself may a part of it be used for packing away either hay or grain by taking off the team after the load is in and passing them out by a retreating process on the side of the cart or wagon and the vehicle when unloaded backed out by hand we have occasionally adopted this method when crowded for room for increased crops to great advantage it requires somewhat more labor to be sure but it is much better than stacking out and a wellfilled barn is a good sight to look upon illustration main floor plan underneath the body of the barn are the stables root cellar calf houses or any other accommodation which the farm stock may require but for the most economical objects is here cut up into stables at the ends l l are passages for the stock to go into their stalls and also on the sides for the men who attend to them the main passage through the center double line of stalls is 8 feet wide and on each side are double stalls 6 feet wide from the two end walls the cattle passages are 5 feet wide the partition between the stalls running back in a slant from 5 feet high at the mangers to the floor at that distance from the walls the mangers j j are 2 feet wide or may be 2 feet by taking an additional six inches out of the rear passage the passage is between the mangers 3 feet wide to receive the hay from the trap doors in the floor above illustration underground plan and yard the most economical plan for room in tying cattle in their stalls is to fasten the rope or chain whichever is used the wooden stanchion or stanchel as it is called to open and shut enclosing the animal by the neck we do not like into a ring which is secured by a strong staple into the post which sustains the partition just at the top of the manger on each side of the stall this prevents the cattle in the same stall from interfering with each other while the partition effectually prevents any contact from the animals on each side of it in the separate stalls the bottom of the mangers for grown cattle should be a foot above the floor and the top two and a half feet which makes it deep enough to hold their food and the whole both sides and bottom should be made of twoinch sound strong plank that they may not be broken down the back sides of the stalls next the feeding alleys should be full 3 feet high and if the cattle are large and disposed to climb into their mangers with their forefeet as they sometimes do a pole of 2 or 3 inches in diameter should be secured across the front of the stall next the cattle and over the mangerssay 4 feet above the floor to keep them out of the manger and still give them sufficient room for putting their heads between that and the top of the manger to get their food cattle thus secured in double stalls take up less room and lie much warmer than when in single stalls besides the expense of fitting them up being much lessan experience of many years has convinced us on this point the doors for the passage of the cattle in and out of the stables should be five feet wide that they may have plenty of room in front of these stables on the outside is a line of posts the feet of which rest on large flat stones and support the outer sill of the barn and form a recess before named of 12 feet in width under which may be placed a line of racks or mangers for outside cattle to consume the orts or leavings of hay rejected by the indoor stock or the manure may be housed under it which is removed from the stables by wheelbarrows the low line of sheds which extend from the barn on each side of the yard may be used for the carts and wagons of the place or racks and mangers may be fitted up in them for outside cattle to consume the straw and coarse forage or they may be carried higher than in our plan and floored overhead and hay or other food stored in them for the stock they are so placed merely to give the idea there may be no more fitting occasion than this perhaps to make a remark or two on the subject of managing stock in stables of any kind when kept in any considerable numbers and a word may not be impertinent to the subject in hand as connected with the construction of stables there is no greater benefit to cattle after coming into winter quarters than a straightforward regularity in everything appertaining to them every animal should have its own particular stall in the stable where it should always be kept and in no other the cattle should be fed and watered at certain hours of the day as near as may be when let out of the stables for water unless the weather is very pleasant when they may be permitted to lie out an hour or two they should be immediately put back and not allowed to range about with the outside cattle they are more quiet and contented in their stables than elsewhere and eat less food than if permitted to run out and are every way more comfortable if properly bedded and attended to as every one will find on trying it the habit of many people in turning their cattle out of the stables in the morning in all weathersletting them range about in a cold yard hooking and thorning each otheris of no possible benefit unless to rid themselves of the trouble of cleaning the stables which pays twice its cost in the saving of manure the outside cattle which occupy the yard are all the better that the stabled ones do not interfere with them they become habituated to their own quarters as the others do to theirs and all are better for being each in their own proper place it may appear a small matter to notice this but it is a subject of importance which every one may know who tries it it will be seen that a driving way is built up to the barn doors at the ends this need not be expensive and will add greatly to the ease and convenience of its approach it is needless to remark that this barn is designed to stand on a shelving piece of ground or on a slope which will admit of its cellar stables without much excavation of the earth and in such a position it may be economically built no estimate is given of its cost which must depend upon the price of materials and the convenience of stone on the farm the size is not arbitrary but may be either contracted or extended according to the requirements of the builder illustration design ii here is presented the design of a barn built by ourself about sixteen years since and standing on the farm we own and occupy and which has proved so satisfactory in its use that save in one or two small particulars which are here amended we would not for a stock barn alter it in any degree nor exchange it for one of any description whatever for the farmer who needs one of but half the size or greater or less it may be remarked that the extent of this need be no hindrance to the building of one of any sizeas the general design may be adopted and carried out either in whole or in part according to his wants and the economy of its accommodation preserved throughout the principle of the structure is what is intended to be shown the main body of this barn stands on the ground 10050 feet with eighteenfeet posts and a broad sheltering roof of 40 pitch from a horizontal line and truncated at the gables to the width of the main doors below the sills stand 4 feet above the ground and a raised driving way to the doors admits the loads of grain and forage into it the manner of building the whole structure would be to frame and put up the main building as if it was to have no attachment whatever and put on the roof and board up the gable ends then frame and raise adjoining it on the long sides and on the rear endfor the opposite gable end to that is the entrance front to the barna continuous leanto 16 feet wide attaching it to the posts of the barn strongly by girts these ranges of leanto stand on the ground level nearlyhigh enough however to let a terrier dog under the floors to keep out the ratsbut quite 3 feet below the sills of the barn the outer posts of the leantos should be 12 feet high and 12 feet apart from center to center except at the extreme corners which would be 16 feet one foot below the roofplates of the main building and across the rear gable end a line of girts should be framed into the posts as a rest for the upper ends of the leanto rafters that they may pass under and a foot below the lower ends of the main roof rafters to make a break in the roof of one foot and allow a line of eave gutters under it if needed and to show the leanto line of roof as distinct from the other the stables are 7 feet high from the lower floor to the girts overhead which connect them with the main line of barn posts thus giving a loft of 4 feet in height at the eaves and of 12 feet at the junction with the barn in this loft is large storage for hay and coarse forage and bedding for the cattle which is put in by side windows level with the loft flooras seen in the plate in the center of the rear end leanto is a large door corresponding with the front entrance to the barn as shown in the design 12 feet high and 14 feet wide to pass out the wagons and carts which have discharged their loads in the barn having entered at the main front door a line of board one foot wide between the line of the main and leanto roofs is then nailed on to shut up the space and the rear gable end boarded down to the roof of the leanto attached to it the front end and the stables on them vertically boarded and battened as directed in the last design the proper doors and windows inserted and the outside is finished illustration floor plan interior arrangement entering the large door a at the front end 14 feet wide and 14 feet high the main floor g passes through the entire length of the barn and rear leanto 116 feetthe last 16 feet through the leantoand sloping 3 feet to the outer sill and door a of that appendage on the left of the entrance is a recess e of 2018 feet to be used as a thrashing floor and for machinery cutting feed c c5 feet next the end being cut off for a passage to the stable beyond this is a bay b 1870 feet for the storage of hay or grain leaving a passage at the further end of 5 feet wide to go into the further stables this bay is bounded on the extreme left by the line of outside posts of the barn on the right of the main door is a granary d 1018 feet two stories high and a flight of steps leading from the lower into the upper room beyond this is another bay b corresponding with the one just described on the opposite side the passages at the ends of the bays e e have steps of 3 feet descent to bring them down on to a level with the stable floors of the leanto a passage in each of the two long side leantos e e 3 feet wide receives the hay forage for cattle or other stock thrown into them from the bays and the lofts over the stables and from them is thrown into the mangers h h the two apartments in the extreme end leanto f f 3416 feet each may be occupied as a hospital for invalid cattle or partitioned off for calves or any other purpose a calving house for the cows which come in during the winter is always convenient and one of these may be used for such purpose the stalls i i are the same as described in design i and back of them is the passage for the cattle as they pass in and out of their stalls the stable doors j j are six in number small windows for ventilation should be cut in the rear of the stalls as marked and for throwing out the manure with sliding board shutters this completes the barn accommodationgiving twentyeight double stalls where fiftysix grown cattle may be tied up with rooms for twenty to thirty calves in the end stables if a larger stock is kept young cattle may be tied up with their heads to the bays on the main floor beyond the thrashing floor which we practice this will hold forty young cattle the manure is taken out on a wheelbarrow and no injury done to the floor they will soon eat out a place where their forage can be put and do no injury beyond that to the hay in the bays as it is too closely packed for them to draw it out any farther in this way we can accommodate more than a hundred head of cattle of assorted ages the hay in the bays may drop three feet below the level of the main floor by placing a tier of rough timbers and poles across them to keep it from the ground and many tons of additional storage be thus provided we have often stored one hundred and fifty tons of hay in this barn and it will hold even more if thoroughly packed and the movable girts over the main floor be used as described in design i the chief advantages in a barn of this plan are the exceeding convenience of getting the forage to the stock when the barn is full and feeding is first commenced with a hay knife we commence on each side next the stables on the top of the bays cut a well down to the alley way in front of the mangers which is left open up to the stable roof this opens a passage for the hay to be thrown into the alleys and in a short time it is so fed out on each side that the sides of the main barn being open to them the hay can be thrown along their whole distance and fed to the cattle as wanted and so at the rear end stables in the fivefoot alley adjoining them if a root cellar be required it may be made under the front part of the main floor and a trapdoor lead to it for a milk dairy this arrangement is an admirable onewe so used it for four years or for stallfeeding it is equally convenient one man will do more work so far as feeding is concerned in this barn than two can do in one of almost any other arrangement and the yards outside may be divided into five separate inclosures with but little expense and still be large enough for the cattle that may want to use them it matters not what kind of stock may be kept in this barn it is convenient for all alike even sheep may be accommodated in it with convenience but low open sheds inclosed by a yard are better for them with storage for hay overhead and racks and troughs beneath this barn is built of wood it may be well constructed with stone underpinning without mortar for 1000 to 1500 as the price of materials may govern and if the collection of the water from the roofs be an object cheap gutters to carry it into one or more cisterns may be added at an expense of 200 to 300 as before observed a barn may be built on this principle of any size and the stables or leantos may only attach to one side or end or they may be built as mere sheds with no storage room over the cattle the chief objection to stabling cattle in the body of the barn is the continual decay of the most important timbers such as sills sleepers c c by the leakage of the stale and manure of the cattle on to them and the loss of so much valuable storage as they would occupy for hay and grain by the plan described the stables have no attachment to the sills and other durable barn timbers below and if the stable sills and sleepers decay they are easily and cheaply replaced with others taking it altogether we can recommend no better nor as we think so good and so cheap a plan for a stock barn as this we deem it unnecessary to discuss the subject of water to cattle yards as every farm has its own particular accommodations or inconveniences in that regard and the subject of leading water by pipes into different premises is too well understood to require remark where these can not be had and springs or streams are not at hand wells and pumps must be provided in as much convenience as the circumstances of the case will admit water is absolutely necessary and that in quantity for stock uses and every good manager will exercise his best judgment to obtain it barn attachments it may be expected perhaps that in treating so fully as we have of the several kinds of farm building a full cluster of outbuildings should be drawn and exhibited showing their relative positions and accommodation this can not be done however except as a matter of fancy and if attempted might not be suited to the purposes of a single individual by reason of the particular location where they would be situated and the accommodation which the buildings might require convenience of access to the barns from the fields where the crops are grown a like convenience to get out manures upon those fields and a ready communication with the dwelling house are a part of the considerations which are to govern their position or locality economy in labor in the various avocations at the barn and its necessary attachments and the greatest convenience in storage and the housing of the various stock grains implements and whatever else may demand accommodation are other considerations to be taken into the account all to have a bearing upon them compactness is always an object in such buildings when not obtained at a sacrifice of some greater advantage and should be one of the items considered in placing them and in their construction next to the arrangement of them in the most convenient possible manner for their various objects a due regard to their architectural appearance should be studied such appearance where their objects are apparent can easily be secured utility should be their chief point of expression and no style of architecture or finish can be really bad where this expression is duly consulted and carried out even in the humblest way of cheapness or rusticity we have heretofore sufficiently remarked on the folly of unnecessary pretension in the farm buildings of any kind and nothing can appear and really be more out of place than ambitious structures intended only for the stock and crops extravagant expenditure on these any more than an extravagant expenditure on the dwelling and its attachments does not add to the selling value of the farm nor to its economical management in a productive capacity and he who is about to build should make his proposed buildings a study for months in all their different requirements and conveniences before he commences their erection mistakes in their design and location have cost men a whole after life of wearandtear of temper patience and labor to themselves and to all who were about them and it is better to wait even two or three years to fully mature the best plans of building than by hurrying to mislocate misarrange and miss in fact the very best application in their structure of which such buildings are capable a word might also be added about barnyards the planning and management of these also depends much upon the course the farmer has to pursue in the keeping of his stock the amount of waste litter such as straw c which he has to dispose of and the demands of the farm for animal and composted manures there are different methods of constructing barnyards in different parts of the country according to climate and soils and the farmer must best consult his own experience the most successful examples about him and the publications which treat of that subject in its connection with farm husbandry to which last subject this item more properly belongs rabbits it may appear that we are extending our rural architecture to an undue length in noticing a subject so little attended to in this country as rabbit accommodations but as with other small matters which we have noticed this may create a new source of interest and attachment to country life we conclude to give it a place it is a matter of surprise to an american first visiting england to see the quantities of game which abound at certain seasons of the year in the london and other markets of that country in contrast with the scanty supply or rather no supply at all existing in the markets of american cities the reason for such difference is that in england scotland wales and ireland every acre of the soil is appropriated to some profitable use while we from the abundance of land in america select only the best for agricultural purposes and let the remainder go barren and uncared for lands appropriated to the rearing of game when fit for farm pasturage or tillage is unprofitable generally with us but there are thousands of acres barren for other purposes that might be devoted to the breeding and pasturage of rabbits and which by thus appropriating them might be turned to profitable account all the preparation required is to enclose the ground with a high and nearly close paling fence and the erection of a few rude hutches inside for winter shelter and the storage of their food they will burrow into the ground and breed with great rapidity and in the fall and winter seasons they will be fat for market with the food they gather from the otherwise worthless soil over which they run rocky bushy and evergreen grounds either hill dale or plain are good for them wherever the soils are dry and friable the rabbit is a gross feeder living well on what many grazing animals reject and gnawing down all kinds of bushes briars and noxious weeds the common domestic rabbits are probably the best for market purposes and were they to be made an object of attention immense tracts of mountain land in new jersey pennsylvania and the new york and new england highlands could be made available for this object some may think this a small business so is making pins and rearing chickens and bees but there are an abundance of people whose age and capacity are just fitted for it and for want of other employment are a charge upon their friends or the public and now when our cities and large towns are so readily reached by railroads from all parts of the country our farmers should study to apply their land to the production of everything that will find a profitable market things unthought of a few years ago now find a large consumption in our large cities and towns by the aid of railroads and we know of no good reason why this production and traffic should not continue to an indefinite extent when the breeding of rabbits is commenced get a good treatise on the breeding and rearing of them which may be found at many of the bookstores as the rearing of rabbits and their necessary accommodation is not a subject to which we have given much personal attention we applied to francis rotch esq of morris otsego county new york who is probably the most accomplished rabbit fancier in the united states for information with which he has kindly furnished us his beautiful and highbred animals have won the highest premiums at the shows of the new york state agricultural society he thus answers i now forward you the promised plan from mr alfred rodman of dedham massachusetts which i think will give you the information you wish upon these subjects rabbits kept for profit in the vicinity of a city and where there are mills may be raised at a very small cost and when once known as an article of food will be liberally paid for by the epicure for their meat is as delicate as a chickens and their fat mild and very rich i am surprised they are not more generally kept as a source of amusement and for the purposes of experiment there is i think in many a natural fondness for animals but not easily indulged without more room than is often to be found in city residences fowls and pigeons trespass on our neighbors and are a frequent cause of trouble this objection does not hold good against the rabbit which occupies so small a space that where there is an outhouse there may be a rabbitry english children are encouraged in their fondness for animals as tending to good morals and good feelings and as offering a home amusement in contradistinction to street associations illustration drawn from life by mr francis rotch mr rotch continues i have just finished the enclosed drawing of a fancy rabbit which i hope will answer your purpose as an illustration of what the little animal should be in form color marking and carriage according to the decisions of the various societies in and out of london who are its greatest admirers and patrons these amateurs hold frequent meetings for its exhibition at which premiums are awarded and large prizes paid for such specimens as come up to their standard of excellence this standard is of course conventional and as might be expected is a combination of form and color very difficult to obtainbased it is true on the most correct principles of general breeding but much of fancy and beauty is added to complete the requisites of a prize rabbit for instance the head must be small and clean the shoulders wide and full the chest broad and deep the back wide and the loin large thus far these are the characteristics of all really good and improved animals to which are to be added on the score of fancy an eye round full and bright an ear long broad and pendant of a soft delicate texture dropping nearly perpendicularly by the side of the headthis is termed its carriage the color must be in rich unmixed masses on the body spreading itself over the back side and haunch but breaking into spots and patches on the shoulder called the chain while that on the back is known as the saddle the head must be full of color broken with white on the forehead and cheeks the marking over the bridge of the nose and down on both sides into the lips should be dark and in shape somewhat resembling a butterfly from which this mark takes its name the ear however must be uniform in color add to all this a large full dewlap and you will have a rabbit fit to go in and win the most esteemed colors are black and white yellow and white tortoiseshell and white blue and white and gray and white these are called broken colors while those of one uniform color are called selfs it will be observed that mr rotch here describes a beautiful fancy variety of lopeared rabbits which he brought from england a few years since they were originally natives of madagascar he continues the domestic rabbit in all its varieties has always been and still is a great favorite in many parts of the european continent in holland it is bred with reference to color only which must be a pure white with dark ears feet legs and tail this distribution has a singular effect but withal it is a pretty little creature the french breed a long rangy animal of great apparent size but deficient in depth and breadth and of course wanting in constitution no attention is paid to color and its marking is matter of accident the white angola with its beautiful long fur and red eyes is also a great favorite in france in england the rabbit formerly held the rank of farm stock and thousands of acres were exclusively devoted to its production families were supported and rents rates and taxes were paid from its increase and sale the grayskins went to the hatter the silverskins were shipped to china and were dressed as furs while the flesh was a favorite dish at home this was the course pursued in yorkshire lincolnshire and many other counties with their light sandy soils before the more general introduction of root culture and the rotation of crops gave an increased value to such land since then however i remember visiting a farm of lord onslows in surrey containing about 1400 acres it was in the occupation of an eminent flockmaster and agriculturist who kept some hundreds of hutched rabbits for the sake of their manure which he applied to his turnep crop added to this their skins and carcasses were quite an item of profit notwithstanding the care of them required an old man and boy with a donkey and cart the food used was chiefly brewers grains millers waste bran and hay with clover and roots the cost of keeping not exceeding two pence a week the hutches stood under a long shed open on all sides for the greater convenience of cleaning and feeding i was told that the manure was much valued by the market gardeners round london who readily paid 2s 6d a bushel at the rabbitries these rabbitries are very numerous in all the towns and cities of england and form a source of amusement or profit to all classes from the man of fortune to the day laborer nor is it unfrequent that this latter produces a rabbit from an old teachest or drygoods box that wins the prize from its competitor of the mahogany hutch or ornamental rabbitry the food of the rabbit embraces great variety including grain of all kinds bran peachaff millers waste brewers grains clover and other hay and the various weeds known as plantain dock mallow dandelion purslain thistles c c the rabbit thus easily conforms itself to the means condition and circumstances of its owner occupies but little space breeds often comes early to maturity and is withal a healthy animal requiring however to be kept clean and to be cautiously fed with succulent food which must always be free from dew or rainwater is unnecessary to them when fed with greens my own course of feeding is one gill of oats in the morning with a mediumsized cabbage leaf or what i may consider its equivalent in any other vegetable food for the rabbit in confinement must be as already stated cautiously fed with what is succulent at noon i feed a handfull of cut hay or clover chaff and in the evening the same as in the morning to does when suckling i give what they will eat of both green and dry food the cost to me is about three cents per week per head i by no means recommend this as the best or the most economical mode of feeding but it happens to suit my convenience were i in a town or near mills i should make use of other and cheaper substitutes my young rabbits when taken from the doe say at eight ten or twelve weeks old are turned out together till about six months old when it becomes necessary to take them up and put them in separate hutches to prevent their fighting and destroying each other the doe at that age is ready to breed her period of gestation is about thirtyone or two days and she produces from three or four to a dozen young at a litter it is not well to let her raise more than six or even four at oncethe fewer the larger and finer the produce young rabbits are killed for the table at any age from twelve weeks to twelve months old and are a very acceptable addition to the country larder the male is not allowed to remain with the doe lest he should destroy the young ones hutches are made singly or in stacks to suit the apartment which should be capable of thorough ventilation the best size is about three feet long two feet deep and fourteen inches high with a small apartment partitioned off from one end nearly a foot wide as a breeding place for the doe a wire door forms the front and an opening is left behind for cleaning the floor should have a descent to the back of the hutch of two inches all edges should be tinned to save them from being gnawed having now given the leading characteristics and qualities which constitute a good fancy lopeared rabbit and its general management allow me to remark on the striking difference observable between americans and the people of many other countries as to a fondness for animals or what are termed fancy pets of and for which we as a people know and care very little indeed we scarcely admit more than a selfish fellowship with the dog and but too seldom does our attachment even for this faithful companion place him beyond the reach of the omnipotent dollar the operatives mechanics and laborers in other countries seem to have a perfect passion for such pursuits and take the greatest interest and pride in breeding and perfecting the lesser animals though often obliged to toil for the very food they feed to them here too home influences are perceived to be good and are encouraged by the employer as supplying the place of other and much more questionable pursuits and tastes we here present the elevation and floor plan of mr rodmans rabbitry together with the front and rear views of the hutches within them illustration elevation main floor plan no 1 is the gable end elevation of the building with a door and window no 2 is the mainfloor plan or living room for the rabbits explanation a the

their own use but as a complete arrangement of all the rooms which may be conveniently appropriated to this object to make it a complete thing may be acceptable to the reader we conclude even at the risk of prolixity to insert the upper loft and cellar apartments with which we have been furnished hoping that our youthful friends will set themselves about the construction of a branch of rural

explanations may be considered by the plain matteroffact man as below the dignity of people pursuing the useful and moneymaking business of life very possible but many boysfor whose benefit they are chiefly introducedand men even may do worse than to spend their time in such apparent trifles it is better than going to a horserace it is better even than going to a trotting match where fast men as well as fast horses congregate it is better too than a thousand other places where boys want to go when they have nothing to interest them at home one half of the farmers boys who discontented at home leave it for something more congenial to their feelings and tastes do so simply because of the excessive dullness and want of interest in objects to attract them there and keep them contented boys in america at least are apt to be smart so their parents think at all events and too smart they prove to stay at home and follow the beaten track of their fathers as their continual migration from the paternal roof too plainly testifies this in many cases is the fault of the parents themselves because they neglect those little objects of interest to which the minds and tastes of their sons are inclined and for want of which they imagine more attractive objects abroad although in the search they often fail in finding them we are a progressive people our children are not always content to be what their fathers are and parents must yield a little to the spirit of the age in which they live and boys pay too as they go along if properly treated they should be made companions not servants many a joyous hearty spirit who when properly encouraged comes out a whole man at oneandtwenty if kept in curb and harnessed down by a hard parent leaves the homestead with a curse and a kick determined whether in weal or in woe never to return under a different course of treatment he would have fixed his home either at his birthplace or in its immediate vicinity and in a life of frugality usefulness and comparative ease blessed his parents his neighborhood and possibly the world with a useful exampleall perhaps grown out of his youthful indulgence in the possession of a rabbitwarren or some like trifling matter this may appear to be small morals as well as small business we admit it but those who have been well and indulgently as well as methodically trained may look back and see the influence which all such little things had upon their early thoughts and inclinations and thus realize the importance of providing for the amusements and pleasures of children in their early years the dovecote the rabbitry the poultryyard the sheepfold the calfpen the piggery the young colt of a favorite mare the yoke of yearling steers or a fruit tree which they have planted and nursed and called it or the fruit it bears their ownanything in fact which they can call theirsare so many objects to bind boys to their homes and hallow it with a thousand nameless blessings and associations known only to those who have been its recipients heavens blessings be on the family homestead be it ever so humble theres no place like home sung the imaginary maid of milan the beautiful creation of john howard payne when returning from the glare and pomp of the world to her native cottage in the mountains of switzerland and although all out of date and conventionally vulgar this sentiment may be now considered such is or should be the subdued unsophisticated feeling of all natives of the farm house and the country cottage we may leave the quiet roof of our childhood we may mix in the bustling contentions of the open world we may gain its treasures we may enjoy its greatness its honors and its applause but there are times when they will all fade into nothing in comparison with the peace and quietude and tranquil happiness of a few acres of land a comfortable roof and contentment therewith dairy buildings wherever the dairy is made an important branch of farm production buildings for its distinct accommodation are indispensable the dairy is as much a manufactory as a cotton mill and requires as much conveniences in its own peculiar line we therefore set apart a building on purpose for its objects and either for cheese or butter separate conveniences are alike required we commence with the illustration cheese dairy house cheese dairy house this building is one and a half stories high with a broad spreading roof of 45 pitch the ground plan is 10 feet between joists and the posts 16 feet high an icehouse made on the plan already described is at one end and a woodshed at the opposite end of the same size this building is supposed to be erected near the milking sheds of the farm and in contiguity to the feeding troughs of the cows or the piggery and adapted to the convenience of feeding the whey to whichever of these animals the dairyman may select as both or either are required to consume it and to which it may be conveyed in spouts from the dairyroom interior arrangement the front door is protected by a light porch a entering by a door b the main dairy room the cheese presses c c occupy the left end of the room between which a passage leads through a door l into the woodshed h open on all sides with its roof resting on four posts set in the ground the large cheesetable d stands on the opposite end and is 3 feet wide in the center of the room is a chimney e with a whey and water boiler and vats on each side a flight of stairs f leading into the storage room above is in the rear a door b on the extreme right leads into the icehouse g there are four windows to the roomtwo on each side front and rear in the loft are placed the shelves for storing the cheese as soon as sufficiently prepared on the temporary table below this loft is thoroughly ventilated by windows and the heat of the sun upon it ripens the cheese rapidly for market a trapdoor through the floors over which is hung a tackle admits the cheese from below or passes it down when prepared for market the cheese house should if possible be placed on a sloping bank when it is designed to feed the whey to pigs and even when it is fed to cows it is more convenient to pass it to them on a lower level than to carry it out in buckets it may however if on level ground be discharged into vats in a cellar below and pumped out as wanted a cellar is convenientindeed almost indispensableunder the cheese dairy and water should be so near as to be easily pumped or drawn into the vats and kettles used in running up the curd or for washing the utensils used in the work when the milk is kept over night for the next mornings curd temporary tables may be placed near the iceroom to hold the pans or tubs in which it may be set and the ice used to temper the milk to the proper degree for raising the cream if the dairy be of such extent as to require larger accommodation than the plan here suggested a room or two may be partitioned off from the main milk and pressingroom for washing the vessels and other articles employed and for setting the milk every facility should be made for neatness in all the operations connected with the work different accommodations are required for making the different kinds of cheese which our varied markets demand and in the fitting up of the dairyhouse no positive plan of arrangement can be laid down suited alike to all the work which may be demanded the dairyman therefore will best arrange all these for the particular convenience which he requires the main plan and style of building however we think will be generally approved as being in an agreeable architectural style and of convenient construction and shape for the objects intended the butter dairy this if pursued on the same farm with the cheese dairy and at different seasons of the year may be carried on in the lower parts of the same building but as it is usually a distinct branch of business when prosecuted as the chief object on a farm it should have accommodations of its own kind which should be fitted up specially for that purpose we cannot perhaps suggest a better model of a building for the butter dairy than the one just submitted for the cheesehouse only that there is no necessity for the upper story and the posts of the main building should not stand more than nine feet above the sills a good walled cellar well lighted as a room for setting the milk is indispensable with a broad open flight of steps from the main floor above into it here too should stand the stone slabs where the butter is worked and the churns to be driven by hand or water or animal power as the two latter may be provided and introduced into the building by belt shaft or crank if running water can be brought on to the milkshelves from a higher level which for this purpose should have curbs two or three inches high on their sides it can flow in a constant gentle current over them among the pans from a receiving vat in which ice is deposited to keep the milk at the proper temperatureabout 55 fahrenheitfor raising the cream and if the quantity of milk be large the shelves can be so arranged by placing each tier of shelf lower than the last like steps that the water may pass among them all before it escapes from the room such a mode of applying water and ice renders the entire process of creamrising almost certain in all weathers and is highly approved wherever it has been practiced the low temperature of the room by the aid of water and ice is also beneficial to the butter packed in kegs keeping it cool and sweetas much like a springhouse as possible in its operation the washing and drying of pans buckets churns and the heating of water should all be done in the room above where the necessary kettles are set and kept from contact with the cool atmosphere of the lower room the latter apartment should have a welllaid stone or brick floor filled and covered with a strong cement of water lime and sloping gradually to the outer side where all the water may pass off by a drain and everything kept sweet and clean the buttermilk may as in the case of the whey in the cheese dairy be passed off in spouts to the pigsty which should not be far distant as all this process of arrangement however must conform somewhat to the shape of the ground the locality and the facilities at hand where it may be constructed it is hardly possible to give any one system of detail which is applicable to an uniform mode of structure and much will be left to the demands and the skill of the dairyman himself in the plan he may finally adopt the water ram as water and that of a good quality and in abundant quantity is indispensable to the various demands of the farm it is worth some pains to provide it in the most economical manner and at the most convenient points for use in level grounds wells are generally dug and the water drawn up by buckets or pumps in a hilly country springs and streams from higher grounds may be brought in by the aid of pipes the water flowing naturally under its own head wherever it may be wanted away from its natural stream illustration water ram but of all contrivances to elevate water from a lower fountain or current to a higher level by its own action the water ram is the most complete in its operation and perfect in its construction of anything within our knowledge and as it may not be generally known to our readers at our request messrs a b allen co of new yorkwho keep them of all sizes for sale at their agricultural warehouse nos 189 and 191 waterstreethave kindly furnished us with the following description of the machine given by w b douglass of middletown connecticut manufacturers of the article h spring or brook c drive or supplypipe from brook to ram g discharge pipe conveying water to house or other point required for use b d a e i the ram j the plank or other foundation to which the machine is secured for use the various uses of the ram are at once obvious viz for the purposes of irrigating lands and supplying dwellings barnyards gardens factories villages engines railroad stations c with running water the simplicity of the operation of this machine together with its effectiveness and very apparent durability renders it decidedly the most important and valuable apparatus yet developed in hydraulics for forcing a portion of a running stream of water to any elevation proportionate to the fall obtained it is perfectly applicable where no more than eighteen inches fall can be had yet the greater the fall applied the more powerful the operation of the machine and the higher the water may be conveyed the relative proportions between the water raised and wasted is dependent entirely upon the relative height of the spring or source of supply above the ram and the elevation to which it is required to be raised the quantity raised varying in proportion to the height to which it is conveyed with a given fall also the distance which the water has to be conveyed and consequent length of pipe has some bearing on the quantity of water raised and discharged by the ram as the longer the pipe through which the water has to be forced by the machine the greater the friction to be overcome and the more the power consumed in the operation yet it is common to apply the ram for conveying the water distances of one and two hundred rods and up elevations of one and two hundred feet ten feet fall from the spring or brook to the ram is abundantly sufficient for forcing up the water to any elevation under say one hundred and fifty feet in height above the level of the point where the ram is located and the same ten feet fall will raise the water to a much higher point than above last named although in a diminished quantity in proportion as the height is increased when a sufficient quantity of water is raised with a given fall it is not advisable to increase said fall as in so doing the force with which the ram works is increased and the amount of labor which it has to perform greatly augmented the wear and tear of the machine proportionably increased and the durability of the same lessened so that economy in the expense of keeping the ram in repair would dictate that no greater fall should be applied for propelling the ram than is sufficient to raise a requisite supply of water to the place of use to enable any person to make the calculation as to what fall would be sufficient to apply to the ram to raise a sufficient supply of water to his premises we would say that in conveying it any ordinary distance of say fifty or sixty rods it may be safely calculated that about oneseventh part of the water can be raised and discharged at an elevation above the ram five times as high as the fall which is applied to the ram or onefourteenth part can be raised and discharged say ten times as high as the fall applied and so in that proportion as the fall or rise is varied thus if the ram be placed under a head or fall of five feet of every seven gallons drawn from the spring one may be raised twentyfive feet or half a gallon fifty feet or with ten feet fall applied to the machine of every fourteen gallons drawn from the spring one gallon may be raised to the height of one hundred feet above the machine and so in like proportion as the fall or rise is increased or diminished it is presumed that the above illustrations of what the machine will do under certain heads and rise will be sufficient for all practical purposes to enable purchasers of the article to determine with a sufficient degree of nicety as to the head or fall to apply to the ram for a given rise and distance which they may wish to overcome in raising water from springs or brooks to their premises or other places where water is required yet we have the pleasure of copying the following article which we find in the american agriculturist a very valuable journal published by c m saxton 152 fultonstreet new york which may serve to corroborate our statements as to what our ram will accomplish under given circumstances the following is a correct statement of a water ram i have had in successful operation for the last six months 1 the fall from the surface of the water in the spring is four feet 2 the quantity of water delivered per ten minutes at my house is three and a quarter gallons and that discharged at the ram twentyfive gallons thus nearly oneseventh part of the water is saved 3 the perpendicular height of the place of delivery above the ram is nineteen feetsay fifteen feet above the surface of the spring 4 the length of the pipe leading from the ram to the house is one hundred and ninety feet 5 the pipe leading from the ram to the house has three right angles rounded by curves 6 the ram is of douglass make of a small size 7 the length of the drive or supplypipe is sixty feet its inner diameter one inch 8 the depth of water in the spring over the drive pipe is six inches 9 the inner diameter of the pipe conducting the water from the ram to the house is threeeighths of an inch i consider it very essential that the drive or supplypipe should be laid as straight as possible as in the motion of the water in this pipe consists the power of the ram v h hallock northeast center ny april 2d 1849 we have seen several of these rams at work and in any place where the required amount of fall can be had with sufficient water to supply the demand we are entirely satisfied that no plan so cheap and efficient can be adopted by which to throw it to a higher level and at a distance from the point of its flow we heartily commend it to all who need a thing of the kind and have at hand the facilities in the way of a stream for its use it is hardly worth while to add that by the aid of the ram water can be thrown into every room in the dwelling house as well as into the various buildings and yards and fields of the farm wherever it may be required ratproof granary this plan and description we take from an agricultural periodical published in new yorkthe plow we can recommend no plan of a better kind for the objects required it is an oldfashioned structure which many of our readers will recognizeonly that it is improved in some of its details illustration granary the illustration above needs but little description the posts should be stone if procurable one foot square and four feet long set onethird in the ground and capped with smooth flat stones four to six inches thick and two feet at least across if wooden posts are used make them sixteen inches square and set them in a hole previously filled six inches deep with charcoal or rubble stone and lime grouting and fill around the posts with the same four inches from the top nail on a flange of tin or sheet iron six inches wide the projecting edge of which may be serrated as a further preventive against the depredating rascals creeping around the steps are hinged to the doorsill and should have a cord and weight attached to the door so that whenever it is shut the steps should be up also this would prevent the possibility of carelessness in leaving them down for the rats to walk up the sides should be made of slats with large cracks between and the floor under the corncrib with numerous open joints no matter if shattered corn falls through let the pigs and chickens have it the circulation of the air through the pile of corn will more than pay for all you will lose through the floor if you intend to have sweet grain be sure to have a ventilator in the roof and you may see by the vane on the top of it how the wind will always blow favorably for you improved domestic animals having completed the series of subjects which we had designed for this work we are hardly content to send it out to the public without inviting the attention of our farmers and others who dwell in the country and occupy land to the importance of surrounding themselves with the best breeds of domestic animals as an item of increased profit in their farm management and as a subject of interest and satisfaction to themselves in the embellishment of their grounds we have addressed ourselves through these pages to the good sense of men who in their general character and pursuits comprise the most stable class of our population we have endeavored to impress upon them the importance of providing all the conveniences and comforts to themselves in their dwellings as well as the due provision for their animals and crops in the rougher farm buildings which their circumstances will admit and we trust they have been shown that it is proper economy so to do we have in addition to these somewhat dilated upon objects of embellishment in the way of grounds to surround them and trees to beautify them which will in no way interfere with a just economy and add greatly to the pleasure and interest of their occupation we now want them to introduce into those grounds such domestic animals as shall add to their ornament and be far more profitable to themselves than the inferior things which are called the common or native stock of the country without this last lesson half our object would be lost of what avail will be the best provision for the conveniences of a family and the labors of the farm if the farm be badly cultivated and a worthless or inferior stock be kept upon it the work is but half done at best and the inferiority of the last will only become more conspicuous and contemptible in contrast with the superior condition of the first it is not intended to go into an examination of the farmstock of our country at large nor into their modes of treatment but to recommend such varieties of animals as are profitable in their breeding and keeping both to the professional farmer in his vocation and to such as beyond this find them an object of convenience or of pleasure we in america are comparatively a young people yet we have surmounted necessity we have arrived at the period when we enjoy the fruits of competencesome of us the luxuries of wealth a taste for superior domestic animals has been increasing and spreading over the united states for many years past so that now a portion of our farmers and country people understand somewhat of the subject it has been thoroughly demonstrated that good farm stock is better and more profitable than poor stock still a taste for good stock and the advantages of keeping them over the common stock of the country is not generally understood and that taste has to be cultivated it is not altogether a thing of nature any more than other faculties which require the aid of education to develope we have known many people who had a fine perception in many things an eye for a fine house pleasant grounds beautiful trees and all the surroundings which such a place might command and when these were complete would place about it the veriest brutes in the way of domestic animals imaginable the resident of the city who lives at his countryhouse in summer and selects a picture of mean or inferior quality to hang up in his house by way of ornament would be laughed at by his friends yet he may drive into his grounds the meanest possible creature in the shape of a cow a pig or a sheep and it is all very wellfor neither he nor they know any better yet the one is quite as much out of place as the other the man too who in good circumstances will keep and drive a miserable horse is the ridicule of his neighbors because everybody knows what a good horse is and that he should be well kept yet the other stock on his farm may be the meanest trash in existence and it creates no remark on the contrary one who at any extra cost has supplied himself with stock of the choicer kinds let their superiority be ever so apparent has often been the subject of ribaldry by his unthinking associates and such we are sorry to say is still the case in too many sections of our country but on the whole both our public spirit and our intelligence is increasing in such things now we hold it to be a practical fact that no farm or country place can be complete in its appointments without good stock upon it and it is useless for any one to suppose that his farm or his place is finished without it the man who has a fine lawn of any extent about his house or a park adjoining should have something to graze itfor he cannot afford to let it lie idle nor is it worth while even if he can afford it to be mowing the grass in it every fortnight during the summer to make it sightly besides this grass will grow under the trees and that too thin and short for cutting this ground must of course be pastured now will he go and get a parcel of mean scrubs of cattle or sheep to graze it surrounding his very door and disgracing him by their vulgar plebeian looks and yielding him no return in either milk beef mutton or wool of course not if he be a wise or a provident man or one who has any true taste in such matters he will rather go and obtain the best stock he can get of breeds suited to the climate and soil which will give him a profitable return either in milk or flesh or their increase for his outlay and which will also embellish his grounds and create an interest in his family for their care and arrest the attention of those who visit him or pass by his grounds of the proper selection of this branch of his stock we shall now discourse illustration in cattle if your grounds be rich and your grass abundant the shorthorns are the stock for them they are the head and front in appearance size and combination of good qualitiesthe very aristocracy of all neat cattle a wellbred and well developed shorthorn cow full in the qualities which belong to her character is the very perfection of her kind her large square form fine orange russet or nutcolored muzzle bright prominent yet mild expressive eye small light horn thin ears clean neck projecting brisket deep and broad chest level back and loin broad hips large and wellspread udder with its silky covering of hair and clean taper widestanding teats giving twenty to thirty quarts of rich milk in a day deep thigh and twist light tail small short legs and added to this her brilliant and evervarying colors of all and everyintermingling shades of red and white or either of them alone such singly or in groups standing quietly under the shade of trees grazing in the open field or quietly resting upon the grass are the very perfection of a cattle picture and give a grace and beauty to the grounds which no living thing can equal here stands a shorthorn cow in all the majesty of her style and character we add also a shorthorn bull which exhibits in a high degree the vigor stamina and excellence of his kind nor in this laudation of the shorthorns are we at all mistaken go into the luxuriant bluegrass pastures of kentucky the rich and widespread grazing regions of central and lower ohio the prairies of indiana and illinois just now beginning to receive them the sweet and succulent pastures of central and western new york or on the hudson river and now and then a finelycultivated farm in other sections of the united states where their worth has become established and they present pictures of thrift of excellence of beauty and of profit that no other neat cattle can pretend to equal as a family cow nothing can excel the shorthorn in the abundance and richness of her milk and in the profit she will yield to her owner and on every place where she can be supplied with abundance of food she stands without a rival from the shorthorns spring those magnificent fat oxen and steers which attract so much admiration and carry off the prizes at our great cattle shows thousands of them of less or higher grade in blood are fed every year in the scioto the miami and the other great feeding valleys of the west and in the fertile corn regions of kentucky and taken to the new york and philadelphia markets as a profitable beast to the grazier and the feeder nothing can equal them in early maturity and excellence for this purpose the shorthorns are steadily working their way all over the vast cattlebreeding regions of the west and for the richness and abundance of her milk the cow is eagerly introduced into the dairy and milkproducing sections of the other states where she will finally take rank and maintain her superiority over all others on rich and productive soils illustration devon cow devon bull on lighter soils with shorter pastures or on hilly and stony grounds another race of cattle may be kept better adapted to such localities than those just described they are the devonsalso an english breed and claimed there as an aboriginal race in england and if any variety of cattle exhibiting the bloodlike beauty and fineness of limb the deep uniformity of color and the gazellelike brilliancy of their eye can claim a remote ancestry and a pure descent the devons can make such claim beyond almost any other they were introducedsave now and then an isolated animal at an earlier dayinto the united states some thirtytwo or three years ago about the same time with the shorthorns and like them have been added to and improved by frequent importations since until now probably our country will show some specimens equal in quality to their high general character in the land of their nativity unlike the shorthorn the devon is a much lighter animal with a like fine expression of countenance an elevated horn more agile in form yet finer in limb and bone a deep mahoganyred in color and of a grace and beauty in figure excelled by no other breed whatever the devon cow is usually a good milker for her size of quiet temper docile in her habits a quick feeder and a most satisfactory animal in all particulars from the devons spring those beautifully matched red workingoxen so much admired in our eastern states the superiors to which in kindness docility endurance quickness and honesty of labor no country can produce in the quality of their beef they are unrivaled by any breed of cattle in the united states but in their early maturity for that purpose are not equal to the shorthorns we here present a cut of a devon cow but with the remark that she presents a deficiency of bag and stands higher on the leg than she ought to do and her leanness in flesh gives her a less graceful appearance than is her wont when in good condition we present also the cut of a devon bull this figure does not do him full justice the head being drawn in to give the cut room on the page several beautiful herds of devons are to be found in new york in maryland in connecticut and in massachusetts and some few in other states where they can be obtained by those who wish to purchase and it is a gratifying incident to learn that both the breeds we have named are increasing in demand which has created a corresponding spirit in those who breed them to bestow their best attention in perfecting their good qualities another branch of domestic stock should also excite the attention of those who wish to embellish their grounds as well as to improve the quality of their muttonobtaining withal a fleece of valuable wool these are the southdown and the cotswold leicester or other improved breeds of longwooled sheep there is no more peaceful or beautiful small animal to be seen in an open park or pleasure ground or in the paddock of a farm than these and as they have been of late much sought after they will be briefly noticed illustration southdown ram southdown ewe illustration longwooled ram longwooled ewe the southdown a cut of which we present is a fine compact and solid sheep with dark face and legs quiet in its habits mild in disposition of a medium quality and medium weight of fleece and yielding a kind of mutton unsurpassed in flavor and delicacyequal in the estimation of many to the finest venison the carcass of a southdown wether when well fatted is large weighing at two to three years old a hundred to a hundred and twenty pounds the ewe is a prolific breeder and a good nurse they are exceedingly hardy and will thrive equally well in all climates and on all our soils where they can live there is no other variety of sheep which has been bred to that high degree of perfection in england the great southdown breeder mr webb of batraham has often received as high as fifty to one hundred guineas in a season for the use of a single ram such prices show the estimation in which the best southdowns are held there as well as their great popularity among the english farmers they are extensively kept in the parks and pleasure grounds of the wealthy people where things of profit are usually connected with those devoted to luxury for this cut of the southdown ewe we are indebted to the kindness of luther tucker esq of the albany cultivator the cotswold new oxford and leicester sheep of the longwooled variety are also highly esteemed in the same capacity as the southdowns they are large not so compactly built as the southdowns producing a heavy fleece of long wool mostly used for combing and making into worsted stuffs they are scarcely so hardy either as the southdowns nor are they so prolific still they have many excellent qualities and although their mutton has not the fine grain nor delicacy of the other it is of enormous weight when well fattened and a most profitable carcass it has sometimes reached a weight of two hundred pounds when dressed they are gentle and quiet in their habits white in the face and legs and show a fine and stately contrast to the southdowns in their increased size and breadth of figure they require also a somewhat richer pasture but will thrive on any good soil yielding sweet grasses for the cut of the cotswold ewe we are also indebted to mr tucker of the cultivator to show the contrast between the common native sheep and the improved breeds of which we have spoken a true portrait of the former is inserted which will be readily recognized as the creature which embellishes in so high a degree many of the wild nooks and rugged farms of the country illustration a common sheep that the keeping of choice breeds of animals and the cultivation of a high taste for them is no vulgar matter with even the most exalted intellects and of men occupying the most honorable stations in the state and in society and that they concern the retired gentleman as well as the practical farmer it is only necessary to refer to the many prominent examples in great britain and our own country within the last fifty years the most distinguished noblemen of england and scotland have long bred the finest of cattle and embellished their home parks with them the late earl spencer one of the great patrons of agricultural improvement in england at his death owned a herd of two hundred of the highest bred shorthorns which he kept on his home farm at wiseton the dukes of bedford for the last century and a half have made extraordinary exertions to improve their several breeds of cattle the late earl of leicester better known perhaps as mr coke of holkham and the most celebrated farmer of his time has been long identified with his large and select herds of devons and his flocks of southdowns the duke of richmond has his great park at goodwood stocked with the finest southdowns shorthorns and devons prince albert even has caught the infection of such liberal and useful example and the royal park at windsor is tenanted with the finest farm stock of many kinds and he is a constant competitor at the great smithfield cattle shows annually held in london besides these hundreds of the nobility and wealthy country gentlemen of great britain every year compete with the intelligent farmers in their exhibitions of cattle at the royal and provincial shows in england scotland and ireland in the united states washington was a great promoter of improvement in farm stock and introduced on to his broad estate at mount vernon many foreign animals which he had sent out to him at great expense and it was his pride to show his numerous and distinguished guests his horses cattle sheep and pigs henry clay of kentucky was among the first promoters of the improvement of domestic animals in the fertile region of which his own favorite ashland is the center and to his continued efforts in the breeding of the finest shorthorns and mules is the state of kentucky greatly indebted for its reputation in these descriptions of stock daniel webster has introduced on to his estate at marshfield the finest cattle and sheep suited to its soil and climate and takes much pride in showing their good qualities indeed we have never heard either of these two last remarkable men more eloquent than when discoursing of their cattle and of their pleasure in ranging over their pastures and examining their herds and flocks they have both been importers of stock and liberal in their dissemination among their agricultural friends and neighbors publicspirited patriotic men in almost every one of our states have either imported from europe or drawn from a distance in their own country choice animals to stock their own estates and bred them for the improvement of their several neighborhoods merchants and generous men of other professions have shown great liberality and the finest taste in importing rearing and distributing over the country the best breeds of horses cattle sheep and pigs their own beautiful home grounds are embellished with them in a style that all the dumb statuary in existence can not equal in interestmodels of grace and beauty and utility which are in vain sought among the sculpture or paintings of ancient time and many a plain and unpretending farmer of our country emulating such laudable examples now shows in his luxuriant pastures and wellfilled barns and stables the choicest specimens of imported stock and their prizes won at the cattle shows are the laudable pride of themselves and their families nor is this laudable taste confined to men alone females of the highest worth and domestic example both abroad and at home cultivate a love for such objects and take much interest in the welfare of their farm stock we were at the annual state cattle show in one of our large states but a short time since and in loitering about the cattle quarter of the grounds met a lady of our acquaintance with a party of her female friends on a tour of inspection among the beautiful shorthorns and devons and the select varieties of sheep she was the daughter of a distinguished statesman who was also a large farmer and a patron of great liberality in the promotion of fine stock in his own state she was bred upon the farm and to rare accomplishments in education was possessed of a deep love for all rural objects and in the stock of the farm she took a peculiar interest her husband was an extensive farmer and a noted breeder of fine animals she had her own farm too and cattle upon it equally as choice as his in her own right and they were both competitors at the annual exhibitions introduced to her friends at her request we accompanied them in their round of inspection there were the beautiful cows and the younger cattle and the sheepall noticed criticised and remarked upon and with a judgment too in their various properties which convinced us of her sound knowledge of their physiology and good qualities which she explained to her associates with all the familiarity that she would a tambouring frame or a piece of embroidery there was no squeamish fastidiousness no affectation of prudery in this but all natural as the pure flow of admiration in a wellbred lady could be at her most comfortable and hospitable residence afterward she showed us with pride the several cups and other articles of plate which her family had won as prizes at the agricultural exhibitions and which she intended to preserve as heirlooms to her children this is not a solitary example yet a too rare one among our fair countrywomen such a spirit is contagious and we witness with real satisfaction their growing taste in such laudable sources of enjoyment contrary to the parvenue affectation of a vast many otherwise sensible and accomplished females of our cities and townscomprising even the wives and daughters of farmers toowho can saunter among the not over select and equivocal representations among the paintings and statuary of our public galleries and descant with entire freedom on the various attitudes and artistical merits of the works before them or gaze with apparent admiration upon the brazen pirouettes of a public dancing girl amid all the equivoque of a crowded theater and yet whose delicacy is shocked at the exhibitions of a cattle show such females as we have noticed can admire the living moving beauty of animal life with the natural and easy grace of purity itself and without the slightest suspicion of a stain of vulgarity from the bottom of our heart we trust that a reformation is at work among our american women in the promotion of a taste and not only a taste but a genuine love of things connected with country life it was not so with the mothers and the wives of the stern and earnest men who laid the foundations of their countrys freedom and greatness they were women of soul character and stamina who grappled with the realities of life in their labors and enjoyed its pleasures with truth and honesty this overnice mincing delicacy and sentimentality in which their granddaughters indulge is but the offthrow of the boardingschool the novelist and the prudemere leather and prunella such remarks may be thought to lie beyond the line of our immediate labor but in the discussion of the collateral subjects which have a bearing upon country life and residence we incline to make a clean breast of it and drop such incidental remark as may tend to promote the enjoyment as well as instruction of those whose sphere of action and whose choice in life is amid the pure atmosphere and the pure pleasures of the country waterfowls if a stream flow through the grounds in the vicinity of the house or a pond or a small lake be near a few varieties of choice waterfowls may be kept adding much to the interest and amusement of the family many of the english nobility and gentry keep swans for such purpose they are esteemed a bird of much grace and beauty although silent and of shy unsocial habits and not prolific in the production of their young for such purposes as they are kept in england the great african goose resembling the china but nearly double in size is a preferable substitute in this country it is a more beautiful bird in its plumage equally graceful in the water social and gentle in its habits breeding with facility and agreeable in its voice particularly at a little distance the african goose will attain a weight of twenty to twentyfive pounds its body is finely formed heavily feathered and its flesh is of delicate flavor the top of the head and the back of its neck which is long high and beautifully arched is a dark brown its bill black with a high protuberance or knob at its junction with the head a dark hazel eye with a golden ring around it the under part of the head and neck a soft ashcolor and a heavy dewlap at the throat its legs and feet are orangecolored and its belly white taken altogether a noble and majestic bird illustration china goose the small brown china goose is another variety which may be introduced she is nearly the color of the african but darker has the same black bill and high protuberance on it but without the dewlap under the throat and has black legs and feet she is only half the size of the other is a more prolific layerfrequently laying three or four clutches of eggs in a year has the same character of voice an equally high arched neck and is quite as graceful in the water the neck of the goose in the cut should be onethird longer to be an accurate likeness the white china is another variety in size and shape like the last but perfectly white with an orange colored bill and legs indeed no swan can be more beautiful than this which is of the same pure clean plumage and in its habits and docility equally a favorite with the others we have described the bremen goose is still another variety of about the same size as the african but in shape and appearance not unlike the common goose except in color which is pure white young geese of this breed at nine months old frequently weigh twenty pounds alive we have had them of that weight and for the table none can be finer they are equally prolific as the common goose but as a thing of ornament are far behind the african and the china still they are a stately bird and an acquisition to any grounds where waterfowls are a subject of interest convenience or profit all these birds are more domestic if possible than the common goose and we have found them less troublesome not inclined to wander abroad and in all the qualities of such a bird far more agreeable we have long kept them and without their presence should consider our grounds as incomplete in one of the most attractive features of animated life it is too much a fault of our farming population that they do not pay sufficient attention to many little things which would render their homes more interesting both to themselves if they would only think so and to their families most certainly if parents have no taste for such objects as we have recommended or even others more common they should encourage their children in the love of them and furnish them for their amusement the very soul of a farmers home is to cluster every thing about it which shall make it attractive and speak out the character of the country and of his occupation in its full extent herds and flocks upon the farm are a matter of course and so are the horses and the pigs but there are other things quite as indicative of household abundance and domestic enjoyment the pigeons and the poultry of all kinds and perhaps the rabbit warren which are chiefly in charge of the good housewife and her daughters and the younger boys show out the domestic feeling and benevolence of character in the family not to be mistaken it is a sign of enjoyment of domestic contentment and of mental cultivation even that will lead to something higher and more valuable in after life and it is in such light that it becomes an absolute duty of the farmer who seeks the improvement and education of his children to provide them with all these little objects to engage their leisure hours and promote their happiness how different a home like this from onewhich is really not a homewhere no attention is paid to such minor attractions where a few starveling things by way of geese perhaps picked half a dozen times a year to within an inch of their lives mope about the dirty premises making their nightly sittings in the door yard if the house has one a stray turkey or two running from fear of the untutored dogs into the nearest wood in the spring to make their rude nests and bring out half a clutch of young and creeping about the fields through the summer with a chicken or two which the foxes or other vermin have spared and then dogged down in the winter to provide a half gotup christmasdinner and the hens about the open buildings all the year committing their nuisances in every possible way there need be no surer indication than this of the utter hopelessness of progress for good in such a family a word about dogs we always loved a dog and it almost broke our little heart when but a trudging schoolboy in our first jacketandtrowsers our kind mother made us take back the young puppy that had hardly got its eyes open which we one day brought home to be kept until it was fit to be taken from its natural nurse we are now among the boys john tom and harry and intend to give them the benefit of our own experience in this line as well as to say a few words to the elder brothersand fathers evenif they do not turn up their noses in contempt of our instruction on a subject so much beneath their notice we say that we love dogs not all dogs however but we love some dogsof the right breeds there is probably no other civilized country so dogridden as this both in mongrel puppy whelp and hound and curs of low degree goldsmith kind man that he was must have been a capital judge of dogs like many other poetical gentlemen still other men than poets are sometimes good judges and great lovers of dogs but the mass of people are quite as well satisfied with one kind of dog as with another so that it be a dog and they too often indulge in their companionship much to the annoyance of good neighborhood good morals and indeed of propriety thrift and common justice of all these we have nothing to sayhere at least ours is a free countryfor dogs if for nothing else nor shall we discuss the various qualities or the different breeds of dogs for sporting purposes we never go out shooting nor do we take a hunthaving no taste that way perhaps in this we are to be pitied but we are content as it is therefore we shall let the hounds and pointers and setters the springers and the land and the water spaniels all alone the mastiffs and the bull dogs too we shall leave to those who like them the poodle and the little lapdog of other kinds also we shall turn over to the kindness of those whowe are sorry for them in having nothing better to interest themselves abouttake a pleasure in keeping and tending them we want to mix in a little usefulness as well as amusement in the way of a dog and after a whole life thus far of dog companionship and the trial of pretty much every thing in the line of a dogfrom the great newfoundland of a hundred pounds weight down to the squeaking little whiffet of sixwe have for many years past settled down into the practical belief that the small ratting terrier is the only one except the shepherd dog we care to keep and of these chiefly we shall speak there are many varieties of the terrier some are large weighing forty or fifty pounds roughhaired and savage looking there is the bullterrier of less size not a kindly welldisposed creature to strangers but irascibly inclined and unamiable in his deportment still useful as a watchdog and a determined enemy to all vermin whatever then again are the small ratterriers as they are termed weighing from a dozen to twenty pounds some with rough long wiry hair a fierce whiskered muzzle of prodigious strength for their size wonderful instinct and sagacity kind in temper and possessing valuable qualities bating a lack of beauty in appearance they are of all colors but are generally uniform in their color whatever it be another kind still is the smooth terrier of the same sizes as the last a very pretty dog indeed with a kinder disposition to mankind yet equally destructive to vermin and watchful to the premises which they inhabit or of whatever else is put under their charge the fidelity of the terrier to his master is wonderful equal if not superior to any other dog whatever in courage and perseverance in hardihood and feats of daring he has hardly an equal and in general usefulness no dog can compare with him illustration the smooth terrier sir walter scott who was a great friend to dogs as well as a nice and critical judge of their qualities used to tell this storywhen a young man first attending as an advocate the jedburgh assizes a notorious burglar engaged sir walter to defend him on his trial for housebreaking in the neighborhood the case was a hard one the proof direct and conclusive and no ingenuity of the defence could avoid the conviction of the culprit the matter was settled beyond redemption and before he left for his imprisonment or transportation the thief requested sir walter to come into his cell on meeting the fellow frankly told his counsel that he felt very grateful to him for his efforts to clear him that he had done the best he could but the proof was too palpable against him he would gladly reward sir walter for his services but he had no money and could only give him a piece of advice which might perhaps be serviceable hereafter sir walter heard him no doubt with some regret at losing his fee but concluding to hear what he had to say you are a housekeeper mr scott for security to your doors use nothing but a common lockif rusty and old no matter they are quite as hard to pick as any others neither chubbs nor hobbs nonpickable locks were then invented then provide yourself with a small rat terrier and keep him in your house at night there is no safety in a mastiff or bulldog or in a large dog of any breed they can always be appeased and quieted and burglars understand them but a terrier can neither be terrified nor silenced nor do we attempt to break in where one is known to be kept sir walter heeded the advice and in his housekeeping experience afterward confirmed the good qualities of the terrier as related to him by the burglar he also commemorated the conversation by the following not exceedingly poetical couplet a terrier dog and a rusty key was walter scotts first jedburgh fee the terrier has a perfect thorough unappeasable instinct for and hatred to all kinds of vermin he takes to rats and mice as naturally as a cat he will scent out their haunts and burrows he will lie for hours by their places of passage and point them with the sagacity of a pointer at a bird he is as quick as lightning in pouncing upon them when in sight and rarely misses them when he springs a single bite settles the matter and where there are several rats found together a dog will frequently dispatch half a dozen of them before they can get twenty feet from him a dog of our own has killed that number before they could get across the stable floor in the grain field with the harvesters a terrier will catch hundreds of fieldmice in a day or in the hay field he is equally destructive with a woodchuck a raccoon or anything of their sizeeven a skunk which many dogs avoidhe engages with the same readiness that he will a rat the night is no bar to his vigils he has the sight of an owl in the dark minks and weasels are his aversion as much as other vermin he will follow the first into the water till he exhausts him with diving and overtakes him in swimming he is a hunter too he will tree a squirrel or a raccoon as readily as the best of sporting dogs he will catch and hold a pig or anything not too large or heavy for him he will lie down on your garment and watch it for hours or by anything else left in his charge he will play with the children and share their sports as joyfully as a dumb creature can do and nothing can be more affectionate kind and gentle among them he is cleanly honest and seldom addicted to tricks of any kind we prefer the highbred smooth english terrier to any other variety they are rather more gentle in temper and very much handsomer in appearance than the roughhaired kind but perhaps no better in their useful qualities we have kept them for years we keep them now and no reasonable inducement would let us part with them a year or two ago having accidentally lost our farm terrier and nothing remaining on the place but our shepherd dog the buildings soon swarmed with rats they were in and about everything during the winter the men who tended the horses and cattle at their nightly rounds of inspection before going to bed would kill with their clubs three or four in the barns and stables every evening but still the rats increased and they became unendurable they got into the grainmows where they burrowed and brought forth with a fecundity second only to the frogs of egypt they gnawed into the granaries they dug into the dairy they entered the meat barrels they carried off the eggs from the hennests they stole away and devoured the young ducks and chickens they literally came into the kneading troughs of the kitchen oh the rats were intolerable traps were no use arsenic was innocuousthey wouldnt touch it opportunity favored us and we got two highbred smooth english terriersa dog and a slut then commenced such a slaughter as we seldom see the rats had got bold the dogs caught them daily by dozens as they came out from their haunts fearless of evil as before as they grew more shy their holes were watched and every morning dead rats were found about the premises the dogs during the day pointed out their holes planks were removed nests were found and the rats young and old killed instanter hundreds on hundreds were slaughtered in the first few weeks and in a short time the place was mostly rid of them until enough only are left to keep the dogs in play and to show that in spite of all precaution they will harbor wherever there is a thing to eat and a possible place of covert for them to burrow to have the terrier in full perfection it is important that the breed be pure we are so prone to mix up everything we get in this country that it is sometimes difficult to get anything exactly as it should be but a little care will provide us in this particular he should be properly trained too when young that is to mind what is said to him his intelligence will be equal to all your wants in the dogline but he should not be fooled with his instincts are sure and with a good education the terrier will prove all you need in a farm and a watchdog we speak from long experience and observation illustration the shepherd dog the shepherd dog is another usefulalmost indispensablecreature on the sheep or dairy farm this cut is an accurate representation of the finest of the breed to the flockmaster he saves a world of labor in driving and gathering the flocks together or from one field or place to another to the sheepdrover also he is worth a man at least and in many cases can do with a flock what a man can not do but for this labor he requires training and a strict thorough education by those who know how to do it he is a peaceable quiet creature good for little else than driving and on a stock farm will save fifty times his cost and keeping every year he is a reasonably good watchdog also but he has neither the instinct nor sagacity of the terrier in that duty to keep him in his best estate for his own peculiar work he should not be troubled with other labors as it distracts his attention from his peculiar duties we had a remarkably good dog of this kind a few years since he was worth the services of a stout boy in bringing up the cattle and sheep until an idle boy or two in the neighborhood decoyed him out in cooning a few nights during one autumnin which he proved a most capital hunter and after that he became worthless as a cattle dog he was always rummaging around among the trees barking at birds squirrels or any live thing that he could find and no man could coax him back to the dull routine of his duty a shepherd dog should never go ahunting we would not be understood as condemning everything else excepting the dogs we have named for farm use the newfoundland and the mastiff are enormously large dogs and possessed of some noble qualities they have performed feats of sagacity and fidelity which have attracted universal admiration but three to one if you have them on your farm they will kill every sheep upon it and their watchfulness is no greater than that of the shepherd dog or the terrier we have spoken of such as we have entire confidence in and such as we consider the best for useful service there are some kinds of cur dog that are useful they are of no breed at all to be sure but have now and then good qualities and when nothing better can be got they will do for a makeshift but as a rule we would be equally particular in the breed of our dog as we would in the breed of our cattle or sheep there are altogether too many dogs kept in the country and most usually by a class of people who have no need of them and which prove only a nuisance to the neighborhood and a destruction to the goods of others thousands of useful sheep are annually destroyed by them and in some regions of the country they can not be kept by reason of their destruction by worthless dogs which are owned by the disorderly people about them in a western state some time ago in conversing with a large farmer who had a flock of perhaps a hundred sheep running in one of his pastures and who also kept a dozen hounds for hunting we asked him whether the dogs did not kill his sheep to be sure they do was his reply but the dogs are worth more than the sheep for they give us great sport in hunting deer and foxes and the sheep only give us a little mutton now and then and some wool for the women to make into stockings this is a mere matter of taste thought we and the conversation on that subject dropped yet this man had a thousand acres
