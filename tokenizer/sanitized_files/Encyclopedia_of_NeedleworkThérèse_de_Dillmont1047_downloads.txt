preface the absolute want of any comprehensive book on needleworksuch an one as contains both verbal and pictorial descriptions of everything included under the name of needleworkhas led me to put into the serviceable form of an encyclopedia all the knowledge and experience which years of unceasing study and practice have enabled me to accumulate on the subject with the hope that diligent female workers of all ages may be able by its means to instruct themselves in every branch of plain and fancy needlework all the patterns given even the most insignificant were worked afresh for the purpose and thus not merely faithful representations but also lucid and intelligible explanations of the same are secured in order that my readers may have something besides the dull theory the work is enlivened by a number of useful patterns some new some derived from the artistic productions of such countries and epochs as have become famous by special excellence in the domain of needlework though at first sight the reproduction of many of these patterns may seem to present insuperable difficulties they will after a careful study of the text and exact attention to the directions given prove easy to carry out many of these interesting designs are drawn from private collections whose owners with great kindness placed their treasures at my disposal to copy and borrow from at discretion for which i desire to take the present opportunity of tendering them my warmest thanks the choice of colours and materiala difficult matter to manymy readers will find rendered comparatively easy to them by the notes affixed to the illustrations and i may point out that most of the patterns were worked with dmc cottons which enjoy the wellearned reputation of being the very best of their kind in the market of the world experience has convinced me that in many instances these cottons may with advantage take the place of wool linen thread and even silk if this work meet with indulgent judges and prove really useful i shall find ample reward in that fact for the trouble and difficulties that have unavoidably attended its completion illustration stripe showing running stitching buttonholing and herringboning plain sewing many on opening the encyclopedia of needlework will be disposed to exclaim as they read the heading of this first section what is the use of describing all the old wellknown stitches when machines have so nearly superseded the slower process of handsewing to this our reply is that of all kinds of needlework plain sewing needs to be most thoroughly learned as being the foundation of all those who are able to employ others to work for them should at least know how to distinguish good work from bad and those who are in less fortunate circumstances have to be taught how to work for themselves position of the body and handsbefore describing different kinds of stitches a word should be said as to the position of the body and hands when at work long experience has convinced me that no kind of needlework necessitates a stooping or cramped attitude to obviate which see that your chair and table suit each other in height and that you so hold your work as hardly to need to bend your head at all the practice of fastening the work to the knee besides being ungraceful is injurious to the health needlesthese should be of the best quality to test a needle try to break it if it resist and then break clean in two the steel is good if it bend without breaking or break without any resistance it is bad never use a bent needle it makes ugly and irregular stitches and see that the eye whether round or eggshaped be welldrilled that it may not fray or cut the thread long or halflong needles are the best for white work long ones for dressmaking and longer ones still with long eyes for darning a stock of each from no 5 to 12 is advised the needle should always be a little thicker than the thread to make an easy passage for it through the stuff to keep needles from rusting strew a little stone alum in the packets and workers whose hands are apt to get damp should have a small box of it handy to powder their fingers with blackened needles can be made quite bright again by drawing them through an emery cushion scissorsscissors are a very important accessory of the worktable and two varieties are indispensable a pair of large ones for cuttingout with one point blunt and the other sharp the latter to be always held downwards and a pair of smaller ones with two sharp points the handles should be large and round if at all tight they tire and disfigure the hand thimblesteel thimbles are the best bone are very liable to break and silver ones are not deeply enough pitted to hold the needle a thimble should be light with a rounded top and flat rim the threadexcept for tacking your thread should never be more than from 40 to 50 cm long1 if the thread is in skeins it does not matter which end you begin with but if you use reeled cotton thread your needle with the end that points to the reel when you cut it as the other end will split and unravel when twisted from left to right which is generally done to facilitate the process of threading the cotton should always be cut as it is weakened by breaking knotting the thread into the needle fig 1when the thread becomes inconveniently short and you do not want take a fresh one it may be knotted into the needle thus bring it round the forefinger close to the needle cross it on the inside next to the finger hold the crossed threads fast with the thumb draw the needle out through the loop thus formed and tighten the loop round both ends illustration fig 1 knotting the thread into the needle materialsfor tacking use coton coudre dmc qualit suprieure black and gold stamp nos 2 to 6a for handsewing fil dalsace dmc nos 30 to 700a and fil dentelle dmc balls or reels nos 25 to 100a will be found most useful for machinework cbl 6 fils pour machines dmc nos 30 to 300a black and white or white and blue stamp these can also be used for handwork both these and the lacethread fil dentelle on reels are superfine in quality the medium sizes are the most useful but the only suitable ones for very fine and delicate fabrics are the fil dentelle dmc and fil dalsace and the latter only is manufactured in the higher numbers all these threads are to be had wound in balls or on reels the buyer may make his own choice balls are apt to get tangled but the cotton preserves its roundness better than when it is wound on reels linen is generally sewn with linenthread but fil dentelle and the fil dalsace are very good substitutes position of the hands fig 2the stuff fastened to a cushion must be held with the left hand which should neither rest on the table nor on the cushion the needle must be held between the thumb and forefinger of the right hand and the middle finger armed with the thimble pushes the needle far enough through the stuff for the other fingers to take hold of it and draw it out the thread then comes to lie between the fourth and fifth fingers in the form of a loop which must be tightened gradually to avoid its knotting illustration fig 2 position of the hands position of the hands without cushion fig 3when the work cannot be fastened to a cushion it should be held between the forefinger and the thumb and left hanging down over the other fingers if it need to be more firmly held draw it between the fourth and fifth fingers which will prevent it from getting puckered or dragged illustration fig 3 position of the hands without cushion stitchesplainsewing comprises 4 varieties of stitches 1 running 2 backstitching 3 hemming and 4 top or oversewing 1 runningstitch fig 4this is the simplest and easiest of all pass the needle in and out of the material at regular intervals in a horizontal direction taking up three or four threads at a time if the stuff allow several stitches may be taken on the needle at once before the thread is drawn out runningstitch is used for plain seams for joining light materials for making gathers and for hems illustration fig 4 runningstitch 2 backstitch fig 5insert the needle and draw it out six threads further on carry your thread back from left to right and insert the needle three threads back from the point at which it was last drawn out and bring it out six threads beyond stitching and backstitching are better and more quickly done by machine than by hand illustration fig 5 backstitch stitching fig 6the production of a row of backstitches that exactly meet one another constitutes what is called stitching only one stitch can be made at a time and the needle must be put in exactly at the point where it was drawn out to form the preceding backstitch and brought out as many threads further on as were covered by the last backstitch the beauty of stitching depends on the uniform length of the stitches and the straightness of the line formed to ensure which it is necessary to count the threads for each stitch and to draw a thread to mark the line if you have to stitch in a slanting line across the stuff or the stuff be such as to render the drawing of a thread impossible a coloured tacking thread should be run in first to as a guide illustration fig 6 stitching stitched hem fig 7make a double turning as for a hem draw a thread two or three threads above the edge of the first turning and do your stitching through all three layers of stuff the right side will be that on which you form your stitches illustration fig 7 stitched hem 3 hemmingstitch fig 8to make a good hem your stuff must be cut in the line of the thread highly dressed stuffs such as linen and calico should be rubbed in the hand to soften them before the hem is laid your first turning should not be more than 2 mm wide turn down the whole length of your hem and then make the second turning of the same width so that the raw edge is enclosed between two layers of stuff illustration fig 8 hemmingstitch narrow hems do not need to be tacked but wide ones where the first turning should only be just wide enough to prevent the edge from fraying ought always to be in hemming you insert the needle and thread directed in a slanting position towards you just below the edge of the hem and push it out two threads above and so on to the end setting the stitches two or three threads apart in a continuous straight line to ensure the hem being straight a thread may be drawn to mark the line for the second turning but it is not a good plan especially in shirtmaking as the edge of the stuff too apt in any case to cut and fray is thereby still further weakened hems in woollen materials which will not take a bend can only be laid and tacked bit by bit in making what are called rolled hems the needle must be slipped in so as only to pierce the first turning in order that the stitches may not be visible on the outside flat seam fig 9lay your two edges whether straight or slanting exactly even tack them together with stitches 2 cm long distant 1 to 2 cm from the edge and then backstitch them by machine or by hand following the tackingthread cut off half the inner edge turn the outer one in as for a hem and sew it down with hemmingstitches illustration fig 9 flat seam smooth the seam underneath with the forefinger as you go to make it lie quite flat beginners should flatten down the seam with their thimbles or with the handle of the scissors before they begin to hem as the outer and wider edge is very apt to get pushed up and bulge over in the sewing which hides the stitches rounded seambackstitch your two edges together as above directed then cut off the inner edge to a width of four threads and roll the outer one in with the left thumb till the raw edge is quite hidden hemming as you roll this kind of seam on the wrong side looks like a fine cord laid on and is used in making the finer qualities of underclothing fastening threads off and on fig 10knots should be avoided in white work to fasten on in hemming turn the needle backwards with the point up take one stitch and stroke and work the end of the thread in underneath the turning to fasten on in backstitching or running make one stitch with the new thread then take both ends and lay them down together to the left and work over them so that they wind in and out of the next few stitches illustration fig 10 fastening threads off and on 4 top or oversewing stitch fig 11this stitch is used for joining selvedges together to keep the two pieces even it is better either to tack or pin them together first insert the needle from right to left under the first thread of the selvedge and through both edges and sew from right to left setting your stitches not more than three threads apart the thread must not be drawn too tightly so that when the seam is finished and flattened with the thimble the selvedges may lie side by side illustration fig 11 top or oversewing

threads from the selvedge first on the wrong side then on the right first through one selvedge then through the other setting the stitches two threads apart in this manner the thread crosses itself between the two selvedges and a perfectly flat seam is produced seams of this kind occur in old embroidered linen articles where the stuff was too narrow to allow for any other a similar stitch fig 14 only slanting instead of quite straight as in fig 13 is used in making sheets illustration fig 13 antique or oldgerman seam illustration fig 14 antique or old german seam french double seam fig 15for joining such stuffs as fray use the socalled frenchseam illustration fig 15 french doubleseam run your two pieces of stuff together the wrong sides touching and the edges perfectly even then turn them round just at the seam so that the right sides come together inside and the two raw edges are enclosed between and run them together again see that no threads are visible on the outside this seam is used chiefly in dressmaking for joining slight materials together which cannot be kept from fraying by any other means hemmed double seam figs 16 and 17turn in the two raw edges and lay them one upon the other so that the one next the forefinger lies slightly higher than the one next the thumb insert the needle not upwards from below but first into the upper edge and then slightly slanting into the lower one this seam is used in dressmaking for fastening down linings fig 17 shows another kind of double seam where the two edges are laid together turned in twice and hemmed in the ordinary manner with the sole difference that the needle has to pass through a sixfold layer of stuff illustration fig 16 hemmed doubleseam illustration fig 17 open hemmed doubleseam gathering fig 18gathers are made with runningstitches of perfectly equal length take up and leave three or four threads alternately and instead of holding the stuff fast with your thumb push it on to the needle as you go and draw up your thread after every four or five stitches illustration fig 18 gathering stroking gathers fig 19when you have run in your gathering thread draw it up tight and make it fast round the finger of your left hand and then stroke down the gathers with a strong needle so that they lie evenly side by side pushing each gather in stroking it under your left thumb whilst you support the stuff at the back with your other fingers illustration fig 19 stroking gathers running in a second gathering thread fig 20this is to fix the gathers after they have been stroked and should be run in 1 or 2 cm below the first thread according to the kind of stuff and the purpose it is intended for take up five or six gathers at a time and draw your two threads perfectly even that the gathers may be straight to the line of the thread illustration fig 20 running in a second gatheringthread sewing on gathers fig 21to distribute the fullness equally divide the gathered portion of material and the band or plain piece on to which it is to be sewn into equal parts and pin the two together at corresponding distances the gathered portion under the plain and hem each gather to the band or plain piece sloping the needle to make the thread slant and slipping it through the upper threads only of the gathers illustration fig 21 sewing on gathers whipping fig 22whipping is another form of gathering used for fine materials with the thumb and forefinger of the left hand roll the edge over towards you into a very tight thin roll insert the needle on the inside of the roll next the thumb and bring it out on the outside next the forefinger at very regular distances and draw up the thread slightly from time to time to form the gathers illustration fig 22 whipping ornamental hem fig 23 for an ornamental hem make a turning 2 or 3 cm deep and run in a thread with small runningstitches up and down as shown in fig 23 by slightly drawing the thread the straight edge will be made to look as if it were scalloped illustration fig 23 ornamental hem sewing on cord fig 24for sewing on cord use strong thread either fil dalsace dmc fil dentelle dmc or cbl 6 fils dmc no 25 30 35 or 40a be careful not to stretch the cord but to hold it in as you sew it as it invariably shrinks more than the stuff in the first washing fasten it with hemming stitches to the edge of the turning taking care that it does not get twisted illustration fig 24 sewing on cord sewing on flaps fig 25these should be backstitched on to the right side of the article they are to be affixed to quite close to the edge then folded over in half and hemmed down on the wrong side like the cord the flap must in the process be held in very firmly with the left hand though the backstitching could be more quickly done by machine handwork is here preferable as the holding in cannot be done by machine illustration fig 25 sewing on flaps sewing on tapeloops figs 26 and 27these in the case of the coarser articles of household linen are generally fastened to the corners lay the ends of your piece of tape which should be from 15 to 17 cm long side by side turn in and hem them down on three sides the loop should be so folded as to form a threecornered point shewn in the illustration join the two edges of the tape together in the middle with a few crossstitches and stitch the edge of the hem of the article to the loop on the right side illustration fig 26 sewing on tapeloops to the corner illustration fig 27 sewing on tapeloops in the middle of the article fig 27 shows how to sew on a loop in the middle of an article the two ends separately one on one side the other on the other strings and loops for fine underlinen fig 28sew these on likewise on the wrong side of the article hemming down the ends and fastening them on the right side with two rows of stitching crossing each other and a third row along the edge illustration fig 28 strings and loops on fine underlinen buttonholes in linen fig 29cut your hole perfectly straight and of exactly the diameter of the button having previously marked out the place for it with two rows of runningstitches two or three threads apart put in your needle at the back of the slit and take up about three threads bring the working thread round from right to left under the point of the needle and draw the needle out through the loop so that the little knot comes at the edge of the slit and so on to the end working from the lower lefthand corner to the right then make a bar of buttonhole stitching across each end the knotted edge towards the slit illustration fig 29 buttonholes in linen button holes in dress materials fig 30mark out and cut them as above described if however the material be liable to fray wet the slit as soon as you have cut it with liquid gum and lay a strand of strong thread along the edge to make your stitches over one end of dress buttonholes must be round the stitches diverging like rays from the centre and when you have worked the second side thread the needle with the loose strand and pull it slightly to straighten the edges then fasten off and close the buttonhole with a straight bar of stitches across the other end as in fig 29 illustration fig 30 buttonholes in dressmaterials sewing on buttons figs 31 and 32to sew linen or webbed buttons on to underclothing fasten in your thread with a stitch or two at the place where the button is to be bring the needle out through the middle of the button and make eight stitches diverging from the centre like a star and if you like encircle them by a row of stitching as in fig 32 this done bring the needle out between the stuff and the button and twist the cotton six or seven times round it then push the needle through to the wrong side and fasten off illustration fig 31 sewing on linen buttons illustration fig 32 sewing on webbed buttons binding slits figs 33 34 35 36nothing is more apt to tear than a slit whether it be hemmed or merely bound to prevent this make a semicircle of buttonhole stitches at the bottom of the slit and above that to connect the two sides a bridge of several threads covered with buttonhole stitches illustration fig 33 binding slits with hem illustration fig 34 binding slits with piece on cross illustration fig 35 binding slits with broad band illustration fig 36 strengthening slits with gusset in fig 33 we show a hemmed slit and in figs 34 and 35 are two slits backed the one with a narrow the other with a broad piece of the material cut on the cross in underlinen it often so happens that two selvedges meet at the slit which renders binding unnecessary in that case take a small square of stuff turn in the raw edges topsew it into the slit on two sides turn in the other two fold over on the bias and hem them down over the topsewing as shewn in fig 36 such little squares of material inserted into a slit or seam to prevent its tearing are called gussets sewing on piping fig 37 piping is a border consisting of a cord or bobbin folded into a stripe of material cut on the cross and affixed to the edge of an article to give it more strength and finish it is a good substitute for a hem or binding on a bias edge which by means of the cord can be held in and prevented from stretching cut your stripes diagonally across the web of the stuff and very even run them together lay the cord or bobbin along the stripe on the wrong side 5 mm from the edge fold the edge over and tack the cord lightly in then lay it on the raw edge of the article with the cord towards you and with all the raw edges turned away from you backstitch the piping to the edge keeping close to the cord then turn the article round fold in the raw outside edge over the others and hem it down like an ordinary hem illustration fig 37 sewing on piping fixing whalebones fig 38before slipping the whalebone into its case or fold of stuff pierce holes in it top and bottom with a red hot stiletto through these holes make your stitches diverging like rays or crossing each other as shown in fig 38 illustration fig 38 fixing whalebones herringboning fig 39this stitch is chiefly used for seams in flannel and for overcasting dressseams and takes the place of hemming for fastening down the raw edges of a seam that has been run or stitched without turning them in herringboning is done from left to right and forms two rows of stitches insert the needle from right to left and make a stitch first above and then below the edge the threads crossing each other diagonally as shewn in fig 39 illustration fig 39 herringboning footnotes 1 our readers should be provided with a french metre with the english yard marked on the back for purposes of comparison a see at the end of the concluding chapter the table of numbers and sizes and the list of colours of the dmc threads and cottons illustration specimens of pattern darns mending the mending of wearingapparel and houselinen though often an ungrateful task is yet a very necessary one to which every female hand ought to be carefully trained how best to disguise and repair the wear and tear of use or accident is quite as valuable an art as that of making new things under the head of mending we include the strengthening and replacing of the worn and broken threads of a fabric and fitting in of new stuff in the place of that which is torn or damaged the former is called darning the latter patching darningwhen only a few of the warp or woof threads are torn or missing a darn will repair the mischief provided the surrounding parts be sound when the damage is more extensive the piece must be cut out in some cases the warp of the stuff itself can be used for darning otherwise thread as much like the stuff as possible should be chosen materials suitable for mendingcoton repriser dmc is used for most kinds of darning it can be had in 18 different sizes from nos 8 to 100 white and unbleached and in all the colours of the dmc colourcard in nos 12 25 and 50 it is but very slightly twisted and can be split or used double if necessary according to the material for all the coarser articles of houselinen unbleached cotton is the best and for the finer white fabrics coton surfin dmc nos 110 120 and 150a this cotton which is not the least twisted and is to be had both white and unbleached can be used by subdividing it for darning the finest cambric varieties of darningthese are four 1 linen darning 2 damask darning 3 satin or twill darning and 4 invisible darning called also finedrawing 1 linen darning figs 40 and 41all darns should be made on the wrong side of the stuff excepting fig 54 which it is sometimes better to make on the right side the longitudinal running to form the warp must be made first the thread must not be drawn tightly in running your stitches backwards and forwards and be careful to leave loops at each turning to allow for the shrinking of the thread in the washing without its pulling the darn together illustration fig 40 linen darning drawing in the warp threads illustration fig 41 linen darning drawing in the woof threads run your needle in about one cm above the damaged part take up one or two threads of the stuff and miss the same number working straight to a thread on reaching the hole carry your cotton straight across it take up alternate threads beyond and proceed as before continue the rows backwards and forwards taking up in each row the threads left in the preceding one turn the work round and do the same for the woof alternately taking up and leaving the warp threads where the cotton crosses the hole the threads must lie so alone both ways that the darn when completed replaces the original web the threads are only drawn so far apart in the illustrations for the sake of clearness when the material to be darned does not admit of a fleecy thread such as coton repriser dmc one that as nearly as possible matches the material should be chosen from the dmc cottonsa diagonal linen darning fig 42darns are sometimes begun from the corner so as to form a diagonal web but they are then much more visible than when they are worked straight to a thread and therefore not advisable illustration fig 42 diagonal linen darning 2 satin or twill darning fig 43by twill darning the damaged web of any twilled or diagonal material can be restored it would be impossible to enumerate all the varieties of twilled stuffs but the illustrations and accompanying directions will enable the worker to imitate them all illustration fig 43 satin or twill darning begin as in ordinary darning by running in the warp threads then take up one thread and miss three in every succeeding row advance one thread in the same direction or miss one thread of the stuff and take up two and as before advance one thread in the same direction every succeeding row the order in which threads should be missed and taken up must depend on the web which the darn is intended to imitate when the original is a coloured stuff it is advisable to make a specimen darn first on a larger scale so that you may be more sure of obtaining a correct copy of the original web 3 damask darning figs 44 45 46 47 48 49a damask darn is begun in the same way as all other darns are the pattern is formed by the crossrunnings and will vary with the number of warp threads taken up and missed in each successive running the woven design which you are to copy with your needle must therefore be carefully examined first figs 44 and 45 show the wrong and right sides of a damask darn in process of being made illustration fig 44 damask darning wrong side illustration fig 45 damask darning right side fig 46 represents a completed one in the case of coloured webs a light shade of cotton is generally used for the warp one that matches the stuff for the shot or woof illustration fig 46 damask darning covered ground figs 47 and 48 illustrate two specimens of darning formerly done in the convents from which it will be seen that the warp and the woof were first drawn in with rather fine thread and the pattern then worked into this foundation with coarser or else coloured thread when this kind of darn is in two colours take for the darker shade coton broder dmc or coton repriser dmc which are both of them to be had in all the bright and faded shades to match alike both old and new linen illustration fig 47 damask darning on needlemade ground illustration fig 48 damask darning on needlemade ground fig 49 which is executed in two colours and is likewise copied from an old work on darning shows you the manner in which a dicepattern is to be reproduced illustration fig 49 damask darning with coloured thread 4 darning lost in the ground fig 50a kind of darn used for repairing rents the edges of which fit exactly into one another neither the torn threads of the material nor the rough edges must be cut off the torn part is to be tacked upon a piece of oilcloth wrong side uppermost and the edges drawn together by a thread run in backwards and forwards across them the stitches must be set as closely together as possible and regularly inverted as in every other darn a much finer thread relatively than that of which the material is composed should in all cases be used for darning in this instance also for the sake of greater distinctness the size of the thread has been magnified in the illustration coton surfin dmc will be found the best for darning both calico and linen illustration fig 50 darning lost in the ground fine drawing fig 51the art of making invisible darns in cloth though such a useful one is all but unknown it is a tedious process and one which though easy enough to understand requires great care in the execution illustration fig 51 fine drawing use as fine a needle as possible and thread it with hair instead of silk or any other kind of fibre red and white hair is the strongest and stronger than the ravellings of the stuff of course the hair has first to be carefully cleansed from grease pare the edges of the rent on the right sides quite clean and even with a razor so that both rent and stitches may be lost in the hairy surface of the cloth scissors do not cut so closely and are liable moreover to disturb the nap and render the darn more visible when this is done fit the edges exactly together and overcast them then thread a needle with a hair by the root and slip it in 2 or 3 mm from the one edge and back again pointed towards you through the other so that neither needle nor hair are visible on either side the stitches should be set slightly slanting and must be quite lost in the thickness of the cloth the needle must always be put in exactly at the place where it came out and the hair not be too tightly drawn when the darn is finished lay the article on a bare table or ironingboard cover it with a damp cloth and iron it the sharpest eye will fail to detect a rent when carefully darned in this manner patchingas we have already said when the defective part is past darning it must be cut out and a new piece of stuff inserted in its place if the garment be no longer new it should be patched with a slighter material than that of which it was originally made the patch should be of the same shape and cut the same way of the stuff as the piece it is to replace it should also be just so much larger as to allow for the turnings in and can either be topsewn or else run and felled in backstitching and felling in a patch fig 52tack in the new piece so that its edges overlap the edges of the hole the backstitching must be done on the article itself as this renders it easier to do the corners neatly the hem is turned down on to the patch make a little snip at the corners with your scissors to prevent puckering the backstitching should form a right angle at each corner illustration fig 52 backstitching and felling in a patch topsewing in a patch fig 53to do this the edges of the hole and of the patch must first be turned in and either overcast or hemmed to prevent their fraying after which sew the two edges together the raw edges may also be turned in with herringboning as in fig 39 putting the needle only through one layer of stuff illustration fig 53 topsewing in a patch drawing in a patch fig 54take a square piece of the original stuff 5 or 6 cm larger each way than the hole it is to fill draw out threads on all the four sides till the piece exactly matches the hole and tack it into its place thread a very fine needle with the two ends of a thread of silk or fil dalsace dmc no 700 run it in at the corner of the stuff and draw it out leaving a loop behind into this loop slip the first of the threads which as it were form a fringe to the patch and tighten the loop round it and so on with each thread alternately taking up and leaving threads in the stuff as in ordinary darning illustration fig 54 drawing in a patch to put a patch into a thin material in this manner you must darn in the threads a good long way into the material in order that the double layer of threads may be less visible footnotes a see at the end of the concluding chapter the table of numbers and sizes and the list of colours of the dmc threads and cottons illustration stripe of cut openwork on white linen single and cut openwork the above heading comprises every sort of needlework to which the drawing out of threads is a preliminary by sewing over the single threads that remain and drawing them together in different ways an infinite variety of patterns can be produced many pretty combinations also can be made of openwork crossstitch and other kinds of embroidery materials suitable for openworkfor all the coarser stuffs such as holbeinlinen java and linencanvas and the like now in such favour for the imitation of old needlework it will be best to use fil pointer dmc no 30a and cordonnet 6 fils dmc nos 10 to 20a and for the finer stuffs such as antiquelinen and linengauze cordonnet 6 fils dmc nos

the two different kinds of openworkthe one is called single openwork the italian punto tirato in which the first step is to draw out one layer of threads the other cut openwork the italian punto tagliato for which both the warp and the woof threads have to be drawn out single openwork punto tiratothis in its simplest form is the ornamental latticed hem in common use where something rather more decorative than an ordinary hem fig 8 is required and consists in drawing out one layer of threads either the warp or the woof single hemstitch fig 55draw out according to the coarseness of the stuff two or four threads below the edge of the turning and tack your hem down to the line thus drawn fasten your thread in to the left and work your hem from right to left taking up three or four crossthreads at a time and inserting your needle immediately above into the folded hem three or four threads from the edge and then drawing it out illustration fig 55 single hemstitch the same stitch is used for preventing the fringes that serve as a finish to so many articles of houselinen from ravelling second hemstitch fig 56prepare your hem as for fig 55 and work from left to right with this difference that after drawing two or three crossthreads together from right to left you skip the same number of perpendicular threads you took up below and insert your needle downwards from above bringing it out at the bottom edge of the hem illustration fig 56 second hemstitch these stitches which can be used for the right side also form a kind of little tress along the edge of the hem ladder stitch hem fig 57 complete the hem as already directed in fig 55 then draw out three or five threads more turn the work round and repeat the process taking up the same clusters of threads which you took up in the first row of stitches thus forming little perpendicular bars illustration fig 57 ladder stitch hem double hemstitch fig 58 begin as in fig 55 forming your clusters of an even number of threads and then in making your second row of stitches draw half the threads of one cluster and half of the next together thereby making them slant first one way and then the other illustration fig 58 double hemstitch antique hemstitch figs 59 60 61 and 62 in the old elaborate linen needlework we often meet two kinds of hemstitching seldom found in modern books on needlework figs 59 to 62 are magnified representations of the same at the necessary depth for forming a narrow hem a thread is drawn in the case of very fine textures where the edge is rolled not laid then fasten in the working thread at the left and work the stitches from left to right passing your needle from right to left under three or four threads draw the thread round the cluster and carry your needle on through as many threads of the upper layer of stuff as you took up below so that the stitch may always emerge from the middle of the cluster illustration fig 59 antique hemstitch wrong side illustration fig 60

cluster be careful not to draw your thread too tightly openwork with two threads drawn through fig 69one such wide lane of openwork between two finishing rows of stitches may have two threads drawn through it illustration fig 69 openwork with two threads drawn through openwork with three threads drawn through fig 70 overcast both edges with single stitches draw the clusters together in the middle as in fig 68 then above and below the middle thread draw in first one thread and then a second straight above it securing the latter with backstitches to enclose the clusters between two threads illustration fig 70 openwork with three threads drawn through clustered openwork fig 71draw out from sixteen to eighteen threads between two hemstitched edges fasten your thread in 3 mm above the seamedge and wind it three times round every two clusters passing the needle the third time under the two first rounds to fasten the thread the thread thus drawn through must be left rather slack a second row of stitches similar to the first and at the same distance from the bottom edge completes this pattern to give it greater strength you may if you like work back over the first thread with a second taking care to pass it under the knot which was formed by the first illustration fig 71 clustered openwork doublerowed clusteropenwork fig 72a very good effect can be obtained by making the above stitch in such a manner as to form groups of three clusters each between hemstitched bands of the stuff illustration fig 72 doublerowed clusteropenwork turkish cluster openwork fig 73after portioning off and sewing up the clusters on one side draw out twelve or fourteen threads and make your connectingstitch and hem all in one as follows bring out the thread before the cluster and pass it round it then from right to left over three horizontal and under four perpendicular threads again from left to right over the four threads just passed over and out at the second cluster laying it over this you bring it out behind the first cluster wind it round the middle of them both and pass it through between the overcasting stitches back to the hem encircle the second cluster with a loopstitch and carry your thread again over three horizontal and four perpendicular threads and upwards slanting underneath the stuff out in front of the next cluster illustration fig 73 turkish

and under and again over three perpendicular ones for the next stitch you again follow the dotted slanting line illustration fig 79 openwork insertion then make the darning stitch over nine threads or three clusters at half their length you leave out three threads first on the right then on the left whilst in the other half you in a similar manner take in three so that you have two darned and two undarned clusters standing opposite each other finally you overcast the single clusters and connect every two with a lockstitch as shown in the accompanying illustration openwork insertion fig 80draw out twenty threads overcast both edges with stitches made over three threads then make slanting stitches proceeding out from these over three six and nine threads respectively all three terminating in a perpendicular line one below the other illustration fig 80 openwork insertion for the openwork twist the thread five times quite tightly round and round one cluster bring it to the edge between the second and third clusters and connect these by means of six darningstitches to and fro join the first and second clusters in the same way by twelve stitches and finish by twisting the thread five times round the remaining length of the first cluster the second half of the openwork figure is carried out in a similar manner over the third and fourth clusters openwork insertion in four colours

eight for the darned clusters ornamented with picots see fig 165 and sixteen for the rectangular rosettes in two colours make a loose spider over the threads as a background for the rosette work the picots in a different colour from the cluster and the rosettes likewise in two colours the connecting loops between the figures should be made as you go along the thread being always carried back into the loop just made illustration fig 91 openwork with winding stitch cutting out threads at the corners figs 92 93 94 95 if you want to carry a latticedhem or a simple openwork pattern round a corner you must cut and loosen the threads on both sides about one cm from the edge of the hem as seen in fig 92 the loose threads can be pushed into the turning and the edge buttonholed as in fig 93 if however on the other hand the stitching be continued without interruption as indicated in the upper part of fig 94 the loose threads must be brought to the wrong side and as represented in the lower

have been cut out serve as a foundation on which a great variety of stitches can be worked stuffs equally coarse in the warp and woof should be chosen for all cut openwork for then the empty spaces that remain where threads have been drawn out both ways will be perfectly square drawing out threads both ways fig 96the same number of threads must be drawn out each way most patterns require the same number of threads to be left as are drawn out in fig 96 three threads have been drawn out and three left illustration fig 96 drawing out threads both ways without regard to the edges cutting out threads fig 97we often meet with cut openwork patterns set in another kind of embroidery in such cases the threads that are to be cut out must be cut a few millimetres within the edge and then drawn out so that there may be a frame of the stuff left intact outside illustration fig 97 cutting out threads in the middle of the stuff buttonholing the raw edges fig 98in very fine linen textures the threads can simply be cut out but in the case of coarser stuffs and when a pattern ends in steps as in figs 103 104 105 the raw edges must be buttonholed as in fig 98 or 99 illustration fig 98 buttonholing the raw edges of cut openwork overcasting the raw edges fig 99cording the raw edges is even better than buttonholing them count the number of threads carefully that have to be cut out run in a thread to mark the pattern and then only cut the threads through at least two threads within the line illustration fig 99 overcasting the raw edges of cut openwork overcasting the trellised ground fig 100if you only have a small surface to embroider you can draw out all the threads at once but in the case of a large piece of work it is better to begin by removing the threads in one direction only and completing all the little bars one way first after which you draw out the threads the other way and embroider those you leave in this way you will secure greater equality and finish in your work illustration fig 100 overcasting the trellised ground ground for square fig 105 figs 101 and 102finish the first row of bars along the edge completely to begin with in the second row

buttonhole edging and ornamented with one or other of the following patterns make very pretty washing laces and the like net laid upon irish point and converted by needlework into a lace ground makes an excellent substitute for a handmade ground which demands much labour and time materials suitable for net embroiderythe choice of material must be determined by the quality of the net and the effect

must run first above and then beneath alternating in each succeeding row at the turn of the lines the stitches cross each other as shown in the illustration illustration fig 113 tracing with running stitches net pattern fig 114here too the pattern is traced with running stitches which are run in on both sides of each row of meshes the thread is carried first to the right and then to the left under every alternate bar of the net and out again between the first and second rows one thread of the foundation must be left uncovered in the next row the thread is carried back again so that it encircles each mesh in the third row the thread passes under the same bar of net as in the second the threads touching each other the fourth row is a repetition of the first illustration fig 114 net

carried diagonally across a mesh lie from right to left illustration fig 115 net pattern net pattern fig 116begin with a double row as in fig 114 this is followed by a row of crossstitch touching the others for which the thread has to be carried first under one of the straight bars of the mesh and then diagonally across it a second similar row of stitches backwards completes the crosses this can be further varied by the introduction of a row of triple stitches after the double row as in fig 115 and the repetition of the two first only illustration fig 116 net pattern these rows can also be worked in two colours or in white thread and washing gold net pattern fig 117begin at the top carrying the thread first under and then over two bars and a mesh and then underneath as before in the

one row of crossstitch such as was described in fig 116 add a second carrying the thread under the bar that lies between the first stitches so that the two rows only cover three threads of the net the close bands of crossstitch must be divided from each other by one row of net bars illustration fig 119 net pattern net pattern fig 120draw the thread twice backwards and forwards as in darning through one row of meshes in the next make four stitches over one mesh and two bars after the fourth stitch the thread is carried forward under two bars to the next group the meshes filled in thus are divided

cottons already mentioned washing gold thread or fin dmc pour la broderie may be used for the overcasting dead gold introduced into simple needlework of this kind enlivens it extremely illustration fig 123 net pattern net pattern fig 124three kinds of stitches are required for this pattern in the first row the stitch lies crossed underneath the net in the second 3 stitches are made over one mesh the first and the last of which are carried across three meshes in the third row buttonhole stitches are carried from right to left over two diagonal bars in such a manner that the thread is drawn through the mesh facing the loops and the next stitch comes out under the loop of the preceding one illustration fig 124 net pattern net pattern fig 125fill in every other diagonal row of meshes with chain stitch inserting the needle into the same mesh it came out of so that the thread lies in front of the needle in a loop the rows of chain stitch may be made with two or three rows of meshes between them even the diagonal lines by themselves make a very pretty foundation for other stitches illustration fig 125 net pattern net pattern fig 126the first row worked from left to right consists of three loop stitches upwards and three downwards each over one bar in the second row divided from the first by one row of stitches the inner loops must be turned towards each other in the third the outer ones any of the stitches already described can be introduced into this pattern to enliven it illustration fig 126 net pattern net insertions figs 127 and 128these two as well as the subsequent patterns are most of them worked in darning stitch and simple overcasting the scallops in fig 127 are formed of darning stitches over 4 3 2 and 1 mesh respectively in the intervening space which is five meshes wide the stitch shown in fig 118 may be introduced illustration fig 127 net insertion in repeating the pattern the stitches forming the scallops must be made to run in the opposite direction instead of the thread simply drawn through the middle little stars like those described in fig 134 have a very pretty effect in fig 128 the thread is first carried round one mesh and then on to the next scallop in the second scallop which turns the opposite way the thread is carried once more round the last mesh after the pyramid is completed and then on to the next figure illustration

of which many a curious piece of old needlework is preserved coarse and fine net are all darned in the same way laying the first thread fig 139tack the net which is to be darned closely to the defective part upon either oilcloth or coloured paper and cut the edges straight to the thread your thread must be of exactly the same size as that of which the net is made it takes three rows of stitches to imitate the net ground in the first place as shown in fig 139 crossthreads must be laid from side to side carried as in darning a little beyond the edges of the hole and so as to surround each mesh with a slanting stitch illustration fig 139 net darning laying the first thread laying the second thread fig 140secondly beginning from one corner threads are laid diagonally across the first layer the crossthreads of the foundation are encircled by a stitch made from right to left the needle is then carried under the next horizontal bar and the first layer of threads is overcast with similar stitches illustration fig 140 net darning laying the second thread laying the third thread fig 141thirdly threads are carried across the second and first layers they must start far enough from the edge for the second layer of threads to be overcast at the same time so that there may be no loose threads left on the wrong side in this third journey every diagonal thread of the foundation is to be encircled with a stitch taken upwards from below the cut edges being strengthened in the same way then to form the little cross in the fabric the thread must be conducted by means of a second stitch under the single horizontal thread outwards to the nextdiagonal thread illustration fig 141 net darning laying the third thread in places where the net is worn it can be strengthened in the same manner the stitches being made the way of the stuff damask stitchesas a rule the pattern is simply outlined with stem and cord stitch and the inside spaces are left plain in spite of the time this simple tracing takes to do the effect is rather poor and scanty if however the inside of the leaves and flowers be filled in with damask stitch the result is very handsome not only can the following stitches which are suitable for any linen coarse or fine be used for this kind of embroidery but most of the net and lace patterns too and these combined with buttonholing and flat stitch produce charming effects materials suitable for damask stitchesall the threads and cottons used for net work can also be used for damask stitches according to the material and the kind of work we will enumerate them once more coton tricoter dmc nos 8 to 20 coton repriser dmc nos 25 to 70 coton broder dmc nos 16 to 50 fil dentelle dmc nos 25 to 50 coton broder surfin dmc nos 100 120 150a this kind of embroidery is generally done with a very coarse needle to press the threads of the stuff closely together and make the light spaces between which appear in many of the following illustrations first pattern fig 142carry the needle in a slanting direction over three threads and bring it out from right to left under three perpendicular ones then again slanting over three threads from left to right and out again underneath three horizontal ones downwards from above thus the first stitch lies across from right to left the second lengthways on the wrong side the stitch forms a regular succession of steps illustration fig 142 first pattern second pattern fig 143this is worked exactly in the same manner as fig 142 only that the second row of stitches touches the first so that two threads enter and issue from the same hole illustration fig 143 second pattern third pattern fig 144though at first sight this stitch is very like the holbein or stroke stitch it is very different in the execution it is worked in two rows to and fro in the first you make all the vertical stitches side by side in the width of the stuff drawing your thread very tightly in the second coming back you make the horizontal stitches in a straight line at right angles to the first stitches on the wrong side the stitches are crossed they in thin stuffs show through and quite alter the appearance of the right side illustration fig 144 third pattern fourth pattern fig 145in the first row the thread is carried slanting upwards from right to left over two threads then downwards under two coming back the stitches must be set the opposite way so that four threads meet in one hole illustration fig 145 fourth pattern fifth pattern fig 146this is worked like fig 145 only that the stitches must cover three threads each way in the second row you take up one thread on the right and two on the left to form your stitches illustration fig 146 fifth pattern sixth pattern fig 147here the stitches form a chessboard pattern you begin with a diagonal stitch over two threads and bring your needle up again into the same line it started from the second stitch covers three threads the third six the fourth eight the next three decrease successively in length in the same proportion illustration fig 147 sixth pattern seventh pattern fig 148two kinds of cotton have to be used for this pattern one of them soft and flat like colon repriser dmca darning cotton or coton tricoter dmc knitting cottona for the flat stitches and the other strongly twisted like cordonnet 6 fils dmc no 8 10 12 or 15a for the cross stitches illustration fig 148 seventh pattern the five flat stitches cover three threads in width and six in height and lie from right to left and from left to right in the second row which must be two threads distant from the first the stitches must lie in the contrary direction in the lozengeshaped space between make four cross stitches over four threads in height and two in width eighth pattern figs 149 and 150make five stitches over 8 horizontal threads miss 6 threads and make another 5 stitches the groups of long stitches above and beneath the first row encroach over two threads of the first group so that a space of only four threads remains between two groups the stitch between these groups is generally known as the rococo stitch illustration fig 149 eighth pattern bring out your needle between the third and fourth of these threads and insert it again above drawing it out afterwards between the second and third horizontal thread and securing the first stitch with a back stitch make the three remaining stitches as explained in fig 150 illustration fig 150 explanation of the rococo stitch in fig 149 ninth pattern fig 151this consists of straight bands of flat stitches covering three threads each way with spaces 8 threads wide between ornamented with a small pattern in stroke stitch see chapter on tapestry and linen embroidery illustration fig 151 ninth pattern damask stitch for figs 103 and 105 fig 152the stitches here represented on a large scale form the border to the square in cut openwork in fig 105 the long diagonal stitches on either side can be made to look fuller and more distinct by using a soft coarse cotton illustration fig 152 damask stitch for figs 103 and 105 tenth and eleventh patterns figs 153 and 154the former of these is used for filling in the short stripe in fig 105 the second for the long inside one fig 153 is clear enough to need no explanation with reference to fig 154 it is however as well to point out that the shortest stitch should cover 4 threads and the longest 12 the rest is easily learnt from the illustration this is a very suitable design for the decoration of large surfaces and combines well with any running diagonal pattern when it can be made to form a large star which can be worked as a separate figure illustration fig 153 tenth pattern damask stitch for figs 104 and 105 illustration fig 154 eleventh pattern damask stitch for fig 105 twelfth pattern fig 155in cases where this and the following stitches are to be executed on a light transparent stuff it is best to use a very strongly twisted thread such as fil dalsace dmc a or fil dentelle dmc a instead of a softer and looser material a stiff thread compresses the threads of the stuff better and the open spaces thus made in it are rendered more visible illustration fig 155 twelfth pattern count 6 threads vertically put in the needle and draw it through from right to left underneath 3 diagonal threads for the next stitch carry it upwards over 6 threads and back under 3 the second row is worked back over the first in the same way leave 6 threads between each row thirteenth pattern fig 156carry the thread from right to left over four vertical threads and under the same number of horizontal ones the second row of stitches touches the first so that the thread it is worked with seems to be drawn through under the same threads of the stuff as the one the first row was worked with illustration fig 156 thirteenth pattern fourteenth pattern fig 157here the stitches contrary to those in fig 147 are set vertically the first stitch covers 2 threads the second 6 the third 10 the fourth 14 the fifth 18 the longest stitches of two checks always meet in the same hole illustration fig 157 fourteenth pattern fifteenth pattern fig 158cover the whole expanse with rows of stitches such as are described in fig 155 with intervals of 12 threads between them illustration fig 158 fifteenth pattern these rows are intersected by others to which the thread is passed from between the sixth and seventh of the 12 threads between the first rows where the stitches of the two rows meet the working thread of the second row must be drawn through under that of the first sixteenth pattern fig 159between every two rows of crossstitch leave an interval of 6 threads counting those on each side of the rows over these 6 threads work 2 rows as shown in fig 148 but so that in the second the lower stitch of the first row and the upper one of the second cover the same threads illustration fig 159 sixteenth pattern seventeenth pattern fig 160this consists of stripes 4 stitches wide like those of fig 155 with 3 threads between which are overcast in the ordinary manner illustration fig 160 seventeenth pattern eighteenth pattern fig 161small squares of 7 stitches inclined alternately to the right and left and so formed that the longest stitch of one square is crossed by the first short stitch of the next so that a space only 6 threads wide and 4 long remains uncovered the intervening stripes are filled with 3 rows of overcasting stitches covering 2 threads each way illustration fig 161 eighteenth pattern nineteenth pattern fig 162the steps formed by this pattern are 11 stitches high and 11 wide and each stitch covers 4 threads illustration fig 162 nineteenth pattern eight threads intervene between each row of steps which are covered at the bend by a square of stitches from the last of which the thread is carried on at once to the four single stitches twentieth pattern fig 163the 4 squares set opposite to each other with 2 threads between are edged all round by 3 rows of overcasting illustration fig 163 twentieth pattern twentyfirst pattern fig 164begin by rows of stitches like those described in fig 155 over 4 and 2 threads with 4 threads between not counting those covered with crossstitch between the two rows of crossstitch join 6 threads together by a backstitch and carry your thread over the two last of the 6 to the 2 first of the next cluster the narrow diagonal stripes are separated by 24 threads exclusive of those covered by the crossstitches these spaces are filled in with squares 10 threads wide and 10 long formed by backstitches crossed on the wrong side illustration fig 164 twentyfirst pattern twentysecond pattern fig 165in the closer stuffs of a coarse texture the threads of which do not admit of being drawn together as you can those of a loose thin stuff where by simply pulling your thread a little tighter you get open spaces you must begin by cutting out every fourth or fifth thread after which you overcast all the rows first one way and then the other with stitches covering 4 threads each way on this foundation with strong looselytwisted cotton coton broder dmc or

a circular design which combines a variety of stitches and introduces our workers to two new patterns as well as to an advantageous way of hiding the junction of several kinds of stitches by semicircles of buttonhole stitching illustration fig 170 twentyseventh pattern footnotes a see at the end of the concluding chapter the table of numbers and sizes and the list of colours of the dmc threads and cottons illustration stripe in flat and raised satin stitch and madeira embroidery white embroidery we have retained the familiar term white embroidery for this kind of needlework for convenience sake in spite of its inaccuracy now that coloured materials are quite as much used for it as white it is executed either on a backing of oilcloth or in an embroidery frame called tambourframe only skilful workers can dispense with these for an untrained hand can hardly avoid puckering if you work without a foundation the material must be held quite smoothly over the forefinger so that the threads lie perfectly straight otherwise the pattern is very apt to get pulled out of shape in the working with your three other fingers you hold the material fast the thumb resting on the work itself beyond the outline of the pattern which must be turned towards the worker it is always the outside line of a pattern that is drawn in double lines that should be turned towards the palm of the hand tracing patternspatterns are generally to be had ready traced but as it is often necessary to repeat enlarge or reduce them descriptions of several modes of doing so will be found at the end of the concluding chapter materialsa loose soft make of cotton the looser the better and very little twisted is the best material for embroidery we recommend for white embroidery in general coton

all the different kinds of coton repriser dmca can be used outlining and paddingthe outlining of a pattern is a very important preliminary a want of precision in the ultimate effect is often due merely to careless outlining this part of the work should be done with rather a coarser cotton than the embroidery itself fasten in the thread by a few running stitches never with a knot a rule to be observed also in embroidering except in very rare cases finish off your thread by drawing it through the tracing stitches or through some part of the pattern that is already finished fill in the spaces between the lines with a padding of run threads run loosely and so that they lie thickly and solidly in the centre and shade off on both sides the fullness and roundness of embroidery depends on the firmness of this substratum of threads the outlining and the padding of the different rounded and pointed scallops as well as of other figures that occur in white embroidery are illustrated in figs 181 182 183 184 185 187 189 190 and 191 blanket or buttonhole stitch fig 171work from left to right run in a foundation line hold down the working thread below the run line with the right thumb insert the needle above and bring it out below the run line but above the working thread tighten the loop thus formed without drawing up the stuff and continue in this manner setting your stitches closely and regularly side by side illustration fig 171 blanket or buttonhole stitch straight stem stitch fig 172work from left to right the needle must always be inserted above the run thread and brought out underneath it in the case of a very delicate pattern take up only just as much stuff as the run thread covers illustration fig 172 straight stem stitch sloping stem stitch fig 173work without a run thread insert the needle from right to left in a slanting direction under 1 or 2 horizontal threads and 5 or 6 perpendicular ones so that each stitch reaches halfway back to the last illustration fig 173 sloping stem stitch this kind of stem stitch is chiefly used for the fine upstrokes of letters and numbers and for linen embroidery backstitching fig 174backstitching that is small even stitches set closely together is done from right to left along a straight line and is chiefly used for filling in the centres of letters leaves and flowers illustration fig 174 backstitching crossed backstitch figs 175 and 176used generally speaking only for very transparent materials it forms a close seam of crossstitch on the wrong side and two straight rows of backstitching on the right to work insert the needle as if for an ordinary backstitch pass it under the stuff sloping it a little towards the second outline of the pattern and draw it out almost in front of the first stitch after making a backstitch pass the needle up again under the stuff and bring it out at the spot where the next stitch is to be illustration fig 175 crossed backstitch right side illustration fig 176 crossed backstitch wrong side fig 176 shows the interlacing of the stitches on the wrong side and the way in which this stitch when it is used for filling in centres can be worked on the right side simple knot stitch fig 177 this consists of two backstitches side by side covering the same threads it is chiefly used for filling in leaves embroidered on very thin materials or in conjunction with flat stitch illustration fig 177 simple knot stitch twisted knot stitch fig 178 to work hold the working thread down with the thumb close to the spot where you first brought it out twist it twice round the needle turn the needle round from left to right following the direction indicated by the arrow pass it through the fabric at the place which is marked by a dot and draw it out at the place where the next stitch is to be illustration fig 178 twisted knot stitch post stitch fig 179something like knot stitch and much used for patterns composed of small flowers and leaves where it often takes the place of raised satin stitch the illustration represents five leaves finished and the sixth in process of being worked illustration fig 179 post stitch to work bring the needle up from the back and twist the thread round it as many times as the length of the stitch requires hold the left thumb on the species of curl thus formed and passing the needle and thread through it insert it at the end of the leaf where it first came out and draw it out at the right place for the next stitch buttonhole bars fig 180when a pattern is ornamented with openwork bars begin by tracing the outside parallel lines then buttonhole the whole lower line and the upper one till you come to the place where the first bar is to be then you carry your thread across and bring up the needle from below through one of the loops as shown in the figure lay three threads in this manner inserting your needle the third time one loop further on then cover the three threads thickly with buttonholing illustration fig 180 buttonhole bars different kinds of scallops figs 181 182 183the outlining padding and buttonholing of these scallops is executed in the manner already described be careful to adapt the length of the stitches to the shape and size of the scallops if they are pointed figs 182 183 the stitches will have to be set very closely together on the inner line and a little play allowed them on the outer to come exactly to the point which should be very sharply defined illustration fig 181 round buttonholed scallops illustration fig 182 large pointed buttonholed scallops illustration fig 183 small pointed buttonholed scallops rose scallops figs 184 and 185these are large buttonholed scallops with indented edges in the one case rounded at the top and sharply pointed at

overcasting stitches worked from left to right illustration fig 186 overcast eyelet holes when you have a long row of eyelet holes to make outline the upper and lower halves alternately first on one side and then on the other using two threads and then overcast them in the same way the double crossing of the working threads between the eyelet holes makes them much stronger than if each hole were finished off separately and the thread passed underneath from one to the other illustration fig 187 buttonholed shaded eyelet holes illustration fig 188 shaded eyelet holes half overcast half buttonholed the lower halves of shaded eyelet holes see figs 187 and 188 are worked with very short stitches and the upper halves with long ones they may be edged entirely either with buttonholing or overcasting or half with one and half with the other six leaves in raised satin stitch fig 189raised satin stitch is chiefly used for working flowers leaves petals dots initials and monograms after

imitation on stuff of venetian lace real venetian point is entirely needlemade in the embroidered imitations of it the stuff takes the place of the needlemade lace foundation to make it more like the original however the ground is seldom left plain but is covered with fancy stitches such as are represented in the illustration or with one or other of the damask stitches in figs 146 to 170 the buttonhole bars may be made with or without picots a full description of the latter will be found in the chapters on net embroidery and irish lace the space to be buttonholed must be well padded for thereon depends the roundness of the embroidery for this purpose take 6 or 8 threads of coton repriser dmc no 25a and fasten them down on to the pattern with loose stitches laying on extra threads and cutting them gradually away according to the width the line is to be the stuff underneath the bars should only be cut away when the embroidery is quite finished illustration fig 191 venetian

can only be used for embroidering pockethandkerchiefs and other small articles all larger work has to be done in an ordinary frame sew a piece of strong stuff into the frame stretch it as tightly and evenly as possible and cut out a square in the middle to the size of the pattern then tack your work in underneath straight to the thread dividing it out carefully with pins first to ensure its being set in perfectly evenly roll or fold up the rest of the stuff over the edges of the frame and secure it with a few stitches or pins to keep it out of the way of your hand as you work illustration fig

workers will be able to compose their own the letters are of a good medium size which can be magnified or reduced according to the workers own taste for any such modifications we would again draw our readers attention to the directions given in the concluding chapter the three first plates represent large wide letters intended to contain or encompass the more elongated ones represented in the fourth and fifth plates figs 203 and 204 the interlacing of the letters requires to be carefully done and our workers should study the following specimens so as to learn the stitches also which are

in pale pink followed by three shades of green the palest of which is used for the second row of stitches when these rows are worked upon a satine or cambric foundation it is advisable to begin by making a small drawing in which the height of the stitches and the distance between them is accurately marked out then prick the pattern through and pounce it upon the material beneath when they are worked on a material the threads of which can be counted no such precaution is necessary insertion in gobelin and stem stitch fig 219owing to the shortness of the stitches this pattern is easier to

stripe of gold embroidery in gold thread purl and flattened gold wire flat stitch and gold embroidery the terms flat stitch and gold embroidery suggest as a rule needlework upon rich materials such as velvet brocade plush and the like nevertheless a great deal of beautiful embroidery is to be met with in silk and gold thread upon quite common stuffs persian and moorish embroidery for instance both remarkable for their delicacy and minuteness and executed upon ordinary linen or cotton fabrics as a fact the material is quite a secondary matter almost any will do equally well as a foundation for the stitches described in these pages flat stitch and some of the other stitches used in gold embroidery can be worked with any kind of thread but best of all with the dmc cottons flat stitch embroiderydecorative designs and conventional flowers are the most suitable for flat stitch embroidery a faithful representation of natural flowers should not be attempted unless it be so well executed as to produce the effect of a painting and thus possess real artistic merit encroaching flat stitch fig 221small delicate flowers leaves and arabesques should in preference be worked either in straight flat stitch figs 189 and 190 or in encroaching flat stitch the stitches should all be of equal length the length to be determined by the quality of the thread a fine thread necessitating short and a coarse one long stitches the stitches should run one into the other as shown in the illustration they are worked in rows those of the second row encroaching on those of the first and fitting into one another illustration fig 221 encroaching satin stitch work your flowers and leaves from the point never from the calyx or stalk if they are to be shaded begin by choosing the right shade for the outside edge varying the depth according to the light in which the object is supposed to be placed the stitches should always follow the direction of the drawing oriental stitch figs 222 223 224the three following stitches which we have grouped under one heading are known also under the name of renaissance or arabic stitches we have used the term oriental because they are to be met with in almost all oriental needlework and probably derive their origin from asia whose inhabitants have at all times been renowned for the beauty of their embroideries illustration fig 222 oriental stitch illustration fig 223 oriental stitch these kind of stitches are only suitable for large bold designs draw in the vertical threads first in working with a soft silky material to economise thread and prevent the embroidery from becoming too heavy you can begin your second stitch close to where the first ended illustration fig 224 oriental stitch but if the thread be one that is liable to twist take it back underneath the stuff and begin your next stitch in a line with the first so that all the stitches of the first layer which form the grounding are carried from the top to the bottom the same directions apply to figs 223 224 and 226 when you have laid your vertical threads stretch threads horizontally across and fasten them down with isolated stitches set six vertical threads apart the position of these fastening stitches on the transverse threads must alternate in each row as indicated in fig 222 for fig 223 make a similar grounding to the one above described laying the horizontal threads a little closer together and making the fastening stitches over two threads in fig 224 the second threads are carried diagonally across the foundationthreads and the fastening stitches are given a similar direction for these stitches use either one material only a fleecy thread like coton repriser dmc for instance or else two such as coton repriser dmc for the grounding and a material with a strong twist like cordonnet 6 fils dmc or fil pointer dmc for the stem stitch plaited stitch fig 225when the vertical stitches are laid a kind of plait is formed in the following way pass the thread three times alternately under and over three foundation threads to do this very accurately you must take the thread back underneath to its startingpoint and consequently always make your stitch from right to left illustration fig 225 plaited stitch if you have chosen a washing material and dmc cottons to work with use one colour of cotton for the foundation and chin dor dmc no 30 for the plaited stitch mosaic stitch fig 226in old embroideries we often find this stitch employed as a substitute for plush or other costly stuffs appliqud on to the foundation it is executed in the same manner as the four preceding stitches but can only be done in thick twist such as cordonnet 6 fils dmc or ganse turque dmc illustration fig 226 mosaic stitch each stitch should be made separately and must pass underneath the foundation so that the threads which form the pattern are not flat as they are in the preceding examples but slightly rounded border in persian stitch fig 227this stitch of persian origin resembles the one represented in fig 175 instead of bringing the needle out however as indicated in fig 176 take it back as you see in the illustration to the space between the outlines of the drawing and behind the thread that forms the next stitch before filling in the pattern outline it with short stem stitches or a fine cord laid on and secured with invisible stitches

kind so as to obtain a really artistic effect whether the design be a conventional one or not the great point is to put in the lights and shadows at the right place if you want to make a faithful copy of a natural flower take the flower itself or a coloured botanical drawing of it and if possible a good black and white drawing of the same match the colours in 6 or 7 shades by the flower itself keeping them all rather paler in tone and take the black and white drawing as a guide for the lights and shadows the colours for the leaves and petals which should always be worked from the outside should be chosen with a view to their blending well together the stamens and the centres of the flowers should be left to the last but the veins and ribs of the leaves should always be put in before

chinese manner fig 230all chinese embroidery displays undoubted originality and wonderful skill and judgment in the choice of material and colour it excels particularly in the representation of figures flowers and animals but differs from european work in this that instead of using flat stitch and making the colours blend together as we do the chinese put them side by side without intermediate tones or they sometimes work the whole pattern in knot stitch the little knots formed by this stitch are generally set in gold thread illustration fig 230 flowers embroidered in the chinese manner often too instead of combining a number of colours as we do the chinese fill in the whole leaf with long stitches and upon this foundation draw the veins in a different stitch and colour even the flowers they embroider in the same way in very fine thread filling in the whole ground first with stitches set very closely together and marking in the seed vessels afterwards by very diminutive knots wide apart chinese encroaching flat stitch fig 231another easy kind of embroidery common in china is done in encroaching flat stitch the branch represented in our drawing taken from a

to stuffs of all kinds washing materials as well as others and can be worked in the hand and with any of the dmc threads and cottonsa raised embroidery figs 232 and 233raised embroidery worked in colours must be stuffed or padded first like the white embroidery in fig 191 if you outline your design with a cord secure it on the right side with invisible stitches untwisting the cord slightly as you insert your needle and thread that the stitch may be hidden between the strands use coton repriser dmc no 25 for the padding these cottons are to be had in all the colours indicated in the dmc colour card and are the most suitable for the kind of work illustration fig 232 raised embroidery preparatory work illustration fig 233 raised embroidery work completed use coton broder dmc for the transverse stitches and over the smooth surface which is thus formed work close lines of satin stitch in silk or cotton the effect produced will bear more resemblance to appliqu work than to embroidery the centres of the flowers are filled in with knot stitches which are either set directly on the stuff or on an embroidered ground embroidery in the turkish style figs 234 and 235this again is a style of embroidery different from any we are accustomed to the solid raised parts are first padded with common coarse cotton and then worked over with gold silver or silk thread contrary to what is noticeable in the real turkish embroidery the preparatory work here is very carefully done with several threads of coton repriser dmc used as one a rope of five threads is laid down and carried from right to left and from left to right across the width of the pattern after laying it across to the right as explained in fig 234 bring the needle out a little beyond the space occupied by the threads insert it behind them and passing it under the stuff draw it out at the spot indicated by the arrow the stitch that secures the threads should be sufficiently long to give them a little play so that they may lie perfectly parallel side by side over the whole width of the pattern this kind of work can be done on woolen or cotton materials and generally speaking with dmc cottons and gold thread shot with colour chin dor dmc very pretty effects can be obtained by a combination of three shades of rougecardinal 347 346 and 304 with chin dor gold and dark blue or with chin dor gold and light bluea this kind of embroidery may be regarded as the transition from satin stitch to gold embroidery illustration fig 234 embroidery in the turkish style preparatory work illustration fig 235 embroidery in the turkish style work completed gold embroideryup to the present time dating from the end of the eighteenth century gold embroidery has been almost exclusively confined to those who made it a profession amateurs have seldom attempted what it was commonly supposed required an apprenticeship of nine years to attain any proficiency in but now when it is the fashion to decorate every kind of fancy article whether of leather plush or velvet with monograms and ingenious devices of all descriptions the art of gold embroidery has revived and is being taken up and practised with success even by those to whom needlework is nothing more than an agreeable recreation we trust that the following directions and illustrations will enable our readers to dispense with the five years training which even now experts in the art consider necessary implements and materialsthe first and needful requisites for gold embroidery are a strong frame a spindle two pressers one flat and the other convex a curved knife a pricker or stiletto and a tray to contain the materials embroidery frame fig 236the frame represented here is only suitable for small pieces of embroidery for larger ones which have to be done piece by piece round bars on which to roll up the stuff are desirable as sharp wooden edges are so apt to mark the stuff illustration fig 236 embroidery frame for gold embroidery every gold embroidery on whatever material it may be executed requires a stout foundation which has to be sewn into the frame in doing which hold the webbing loosely almost in folds and stretch the stuff very tightly sew on a stout cord to the edges of the foundation which are nearest the stretchers setting the stitches 3 or 4 cm apart then put the frame together and stretch the material laterally to its fullest extent by passing a piece of twine in and out through the cord at the edge and over the stretchers draw up the bracing until the foundation is strained evenly and tightly upon this firm foundation lay the stuff which you are going to embroider and hem or herringbone it down taking care to keep it perfectly even with the thread of the foundation and if possible more tightly stretched to prevent it from being wrinkled or puckered when you come to take it off the backing for directions how to transfer the pattern to your stuff and prepare the paste with which the embroidery has to be stiffened before it is taken out of the frame see the concluding chapter in the book the spindle fig 237the spindle to wind the gold thread upon should be 20 cm long and made of hard wood cover the round stalk and part of the prongs with a double thread of coton broder dmc no 16 or pale yellow cordonnet dmc no 25 and terminate this covering with a loop to which you fasten the gold thread that you wind round the stalk illustration fig 237 the spindle the pressers figs 238 and 239these so called pressers are small rectangular boards with a handle in the middle the convex one fig 238 should be 15 cm long by 9 broad the other fig 239 which is quite flat should be 32 cm by 20 illustration fig 238 convex presser for pressing the stuff on the wrong side illustration fig 239 flat presser for laying on the pattern having cut out your pattern in cartridge paper lay it down on the wrong side upon a board thinly spread with embroidery paste let it get thoroughly impregnated with the paste and then transfer it carefully to its proper place on the stuff press it closely down with the large presser and with the little convex one rub the stuff firmly from beneath to make it adhere closely to the pasted pattern small pointed leaves and flowers will be found to need sewing down besides as you will observe in fig 242 where each point is secured by stitches the embroidery should not be begun until the paste is perfectly dry and the pattern adheres firmly to the stuff the knife fig 240most gold embroideries require a foundation of stout cartridge paper and in the case of very delicate designs the paper should further be covered with kid pasted upon it illustration fig 240 the knife reduced scale transfer the design on to the paper or kid in the manner described in the concluding chapter and cut it out with the knife you can only make very short incisions with this tool which should be kept extremely sharp and held in cutting with the point outwards and the rounded part towards you as shown in the drawing tray to contain the materials fig 241cut out as many divisions in a thin board or sheet of stout cardboard as you will require materials for your embroidery these include not only gold thread of all kinds but likewise beads and spangles of all sorts and sizes as well as bright and dead gold and silver purl or bullion as it is also called for the pieces of purl alone which should be cut ready to hand you should have several divisions in order that the different lengths may be kept separate illustration fig 241 tray to contain the materials use of the spindle fig 242gold embroidery thread should be wound double upon the spindle it is laid backwards and forwards and secured with two stitches at each turn as described in fig 234 small holes where the stitches are to come have first to be pierced in the material with the pricker from the right side for the needle to pass through in soft stuffs this is unnecessary but in brocaded materials and in plush and leather where every prick shows and would often spoil the whole effect it is indispensable illustration fig 242 use of the spindle gold thread which is stiff and difficult to work with can be rendered soft and pliable by putting it into the oven or any other warm place for a short time embroidery with gold purl fig 243embroidery is the easiest kind of gold embroidery you have only to thread the little pieces of purl cut into the required lengths beforehand like beads on your needle and fasten them down upon the foundation like the beads in beadwork smooth and crimped gold purl or silver and gold purl used together look exceedingly well particularly where the pattern requires effects of light and shade to be reproduced illustration fig 243 embroidery with gold purl embroidery in diamond stitch fig 244the diamond stitch is a charming novelty in gold embroidery short lengths of purl not more than 1 mm long are threaded on the needle and the needle is put in and drawn out at the same hole these stitches which resemble knot stitches form so many little glittering knots turned alternately to the right and left and look like seeddiamonds in appearance more especially when they are made in silver purl the shorter the pieces are and the more closely you set the knots together the handsomer and richer the effect will be illustration fig 244 diamond stitch chinese gold embroidery figs 245 and 246we recommend the imitation of chinese gold embroidery to our readers as an easy and grateful recreation it consists simply in laying down a gold thread on a delicately outlined pattern and securing it by stitches it can be done on any material washing or other the costliest as well as the most ordinary illustration fig 245 chinese gold embroidery

effective used together thus in fig 245 the trees foliage and flowers are worked in plain gold the grasses in gold shot with green the butterflies in gold with red the two birds in gold with dark blue and gold with light blue two threads of gold should be laid down side by side and secured by small catching stitches set at regular intervals from one another and worked in fil dalsace dmc no 200a of the same colour where the design requires it you may separate the gold threads and work with one alone the second specimen of chinese embroidery fig 246 resembles the first as far as materials and execution are concerned but the design is different the grotesque animals flowers and shells it represents can be worked separately or connected together so as to form a running pattern stripe worked in various stitches fig 247all the designs described thus far are worked in the same way but the stripe now presented to our readers introduces them to several kinds of gold thread and a variety of stitches the small turnedback petals of the flowers are worked in plain gold thread and outlined with crimped the rest of the petals are worked in darning stitch with plain gold thread the latticed leaves are edged with picots worked with bright purl the other parts of the design are all worked with a double gold thread the stalks in dead gold the leaves in crimped the gold thread is secured by overcasting stitches in goldcoloured thread jaune dor 667 but it looks very well if you use black or red thread for fastening the crimped gold and dark or light green for the leaves and tendrils illustration fig 247 stripe worked in various stitches gold embroidery on a foundation of cords fig 248in the old ecclesiastical embroideries especially those representing the figures of saints we often find thick whip cords used as a foundation instead of cardboard for the good reason that the stiff cardboard does not give such soft and rounded contours as a cord foundation which will readily take every bend and turn that you give to it in the following illustrations we have adhered strictly to the originals as far as the manner of working the surface is concerned but have substituted for the cord which in their case has been used for the foundation cordonnet 6 fils dmc no 1 which is better for padding than the grey whip cord as it can be had in white or yellow according to whether it is intended to serve as a foundation to silver or gold work illustration fig 248 embroidery in flattened gold wire and purl lay down as many cords as are necessary to give the design the requisite thickness in many cases up to 8 or 10 mm in height taking care to lay them closely and solidly in the centre and graduate them down at the sides and ends when you have finished the foundation edge it with a thick gold cord such as cordonnet dor dmc no 6 and then only begin the actual embroidery all the directions just given applying merely to the preparatory work only four of the many stitches that are already in use and might be devised are described here for the pattern represented in fig 248 flattened gold or silver wire is necessary which should be cut into pieces long enough to be turned in at the ends so as to form a little loop through which the thread that fastens them down is passed over each length of gold or silver wire small lengths of purl are laid at regular intervals close enough just to leave room for the next stitch the pieces of one row alternating in position with those of the preceding one plaited stitch in gold purl on a cord foundation fig 249distribute the stitches as in the previous figure substituting purl for the flattened gold wire and covering the purl with short lengths of gold thread of the same kind all these stitches may be worked in gold and silver thread mixed or in the one or the other alone illustration fig 249 plaited stitch in gold purl on a cord foundation scale stitch worked in gold thread and purl on a cord foundation fig 250begin by covering the whole padded surface with gold or silver thread then sew on short lengths of purl long enough to cover six or eight threads 2 or 3 mm apart as shown in the engraving these stitches in

list of colours of the dmc threads and cottons illustration insertion in cross stitch alike on both sides the pattern left blank tapestry and linen embroidery tapestry is one of the oldest kinds of needlework and one which has always been popular every where there are two distinct sorts of canvas in use for tapestry called respectively plain single thread canvas and penelope double thread canvas the latter is generally preferred because it is easier to count the stitches upon it but both make an equally good foundation for the embroidery as the following examples will show besides canvas other fabrics bearing a close resemblance to it are often used especially java linen the close texture of which renders grounding unnecessary cloth velvet or plush can also be overlaid with canvas the threads of which are pulled away after the pattern is finished for work of this kind we however prefer a material with less dressing such as a twisted tammy or colbert linen because the pulling out of the harsh rough threads of the canvas is very apt to injure the material beneath stitches worked upon two stuffs must be drawn very tight or they will look loose and untidy when the auxiliary fabric is taken away tapestry can be done either in a frame or in the hand in the latter case the ends of the piece of canvas should be weighted with stones or lead to prevent its puckering the stitches which ought completely to hide the canvas should all lean one way and the underneath ones always from left to right as the letters in writing marking out the embroidery ground fig 252before beginning a piece of canvas work and tacking on the auxiliary fabric count how many stitches it will contain and mark them out in tens with a coloured thread as shown in fig 252 along two sides at least in the length and breadth having ascertained the number of stitches both ways divide them in two and starting each time from the middle stitch trace two lines one horizontal the other vertical right across the canvas the point of intersection will be the centre this sort of groundplan will be found most useful and should not be pulled out until at least half the work be finished if moreover you have corners to work or a pattern to reverse in the angle of a piece of embroidery trace a diagonal line besides from the corner to the centre illustration fig 252 marking out the embroidery ground materials suitable for tapestryhitherto wool and silk were the materials chiefly used for canvas work a very thick wool for carpets as being warmer and more durable silk is too delicate a fibre to resist much wear and tear and cannot therefore be recommended for articles that are intended for constant use and wool though stronger is subject to the destructive agency of moths whereas cotton which is cheaper than both and quite as brilliant is free from all these disadvantages and is extremely easy to clean for most kinds of tapestry we can therefore with perfect confidence recommend the use of coton tricoter dmc nos 6 to 20 cordonnet 6 fils dmc nos 3 to 15 and even coton repriser dmc no 25a cross stitch fig 253cross stitch is the foundation of every other stitch and the one in most common use it is also called markingstitch being used for marking linen it is worked in two lines in the first the thread is carried diagonally from left to right across a square of threads and then downwards underneath the two horizontal threads in the second the stitches are carried from the righthand lower corner of the square to the upper lefthand corner so that the four points of the two stitches form a perfect square illustration fig 253 cross stitch half cross stitch fig 254if the cotton is too coarse or the canvas too fine to make the double stitch carry the thread back along the whole line and make the halfstitches across it from left to right the same in the case of a piece of work which you buy with a part of the pattern readyworked illustration fig 254 half cross stitch gobelin stitch on plain canvas fig 255this is worked over two horizontal threads and one perpendicular in a frame you can work the second row from right to left otherwise you must turn the work round and bring out your needle behind the lastmade stitch illustration fig 255 gobelin stitch gobelin stitch on penelope canvas fig 256for the same stitch on penelope canvas you need rather a coarse needle which will make its way easily between the threads of the canvas illustration fig 256 gobelin stitch on penelope canvas reps stitch fig 257contrary to gobelin stitch this stitch which is an imitation of reps is worked in vertical lines over two vertical threads and one horizontal one illustration fig 257 reps stitch tent stitch fig 258this stitch is simply the first half of a cross or marking stitch worked over a single thread each way the illustration shows the working of a row from right to left the thread being carried forward underneath the vertical threads tent stitch is used for the most part in conjunction with cross stitch for the more delicate lines and the shaded parts of flowers and figures illustration fig 258 tent stitch wide gobelin stitch fig 259this stitch covers two vertical and two horizontal threads and advances one thread at a time illustration fig 259 wide gobelin stitch broad cross stitch fig 260worked over two vertical and four horizontal threads and very useful for filling in large surfaces as it can be done twice as quickly as the ordinary cross stitch it may be varied by turning the crosses first one way and then the other illustration fig 260 broad cross stitch double stitch fig 261begin with a simple cross stitch over every alternate intersection of the threads then make a second row of stitches between those of the first but in this case over two and six threads so that they extend beyond the first each way in the subsequent rows a square stitch should be opposed to a long one and a long stitch to a square one illustration fig 261 double stitch rice stitch fig 262fill in the whole ground first with large cross stitches over four threads each way then upon these make the socalled rice stitches these cross the four points of the large cross stitches and meet in the space between where they form another cross the large cross stitches should be worked in rather coarse cotton the rice stitches in one of a finer quality illustration fig 262 rice stitch double stitch set two ways fig 263this consists of diagonal and upright cross stitches alternately work from left to right and carry the thread over four vertical threads and downwards under two horizontal ones then diagonally upwards over four threads and downwards under two then again over four vertical threads and so on coming back you cross the first threads and pass the working thread each time in a straight line underneath the two threads of the canvas the stitches of the third and fourth rows are set as the illustration shows the opposite way to those of the

starting point illustration fig 264 plait stitch carry the thread from left to right over two horizontal threads and downwards under four perpendicular ones then under two threads from right to left as the figure indicates stem stitch fig 265here the stitches are worked in separate rows over four threads each way the working thread passes first under the two middle threads from right to left and then under the two upper ones illustration fig 265 stem stitch leaf stitch fig 266carry the thread diagonally over two double threads each way and back under one double thread to the row whence the stitch started make rows of backstitches in a different colour between the rows of long ones illustration fig 266 leaf stitch fishbone stitch fig 267the difference between this and the preceding stitch is that the working thread after passing over three perpendicular and three horizontal threads is secured by a backstitch over the last intersection of the canvas threads these backstitches lean to the right or left according to the direction of the long stitches illustration fig 267 fishbone stitch diagonal web stitch fig 268stretch diagonal threads across the whole surface you are going to embroider and secure them with rows of overcasting stitches set if you are working on penelope canvas between the double threads of the canvas in the next rows the stitches must be set the opposite way which produces the effect of diagonal or twilled cloth illustration fig 268 diagonal web stitch cashmere stitch fig 269to imitate this texture in needlework first make one stitch over one crossing of the canvas threads and then two stitches over two crossings illustration fig 269 cashmere stitch florentine stitch fig 270florentine stitch is worked in slanting lines the thread being carried diagonally first over one and then over two double threads of the canvas illustration fig 270 florentine stitch mosaic stitch fig 271the first row consists of one short and one long stitch alternately the second of short stitches only set between the long stitches of the first row the third row is a repetition of the first and so on illustration fig 271 mosaic stitch knotted stitch fig 272carry the working thread over two threads in width and six in height bring the needle back four threads lower down in front of the double threads and insert it behind the preceding stitch and over the middle threads and then carry it down to the line of the stitches in the subsequent rows the stitches extend over four threads and encroach on two of the previous row so that the stitches of the second row lie between those of the first illustration fig 272 knotted stitch star or smyrna stitch fig 273make a plain cross stitch over four threads each way and then over that another cross stitch standing upright the same stitch can be made over six or seven threads if you work over more than four threads it follows that you increase the number of stitches accordingly illustration fig 273 star or smyrna stitch rococo stitch figs 274 275 276after fastening in your thread lay it over four single or two double threads as the case may be and carry the needle through to the left under one double thread then as fig 274 shows bring it back over the first stitch put it in by the side of it and bring it out below under half the horizontal threads covered by the first stitch then make a stitch to the right similar to the one just made to the left illustration fig 274 rococo stitch first stitches on the wrong side when you have finished one stitch carry the needle under one thread in an oblique line to the next stitch see fig 273 the whole pattern is worked in diagonal lines illustration fig 275 rococo stitch stitches on the right side illustration fig 276 rococo stitch completed parisian stitch fig 277this stitch though it is generally worked on silk canvas can also be worked on the different cotton and linen materials already referred to more than once in this encyclopedia it makes a very good grounding in cases where the material is not intended to be completely hidden it consists of a long stitch over three threads and a short stitch over one thread alternately illustration fig 277 parisian stitch greek stitch fig 278this differs from the ordinary cross stitch in the oblique inclination given to the threads and the manner in which it is begun instead of taking up the two threads that follow the first stitch you bring your needle back from right to left under the vertical threads of the first stitch carry it downwards and then from right to left to a distance of four threads beyond the first stitch the next stitch is made like the first the rows may be joined together either by the short or the long stitches but you must follow one rule throughout this stitch is much used in slavonic countries for the adornment of linen garments and there we have observed that the short stitches are generally made to encounter the long ones a coarse material that covers the ground well such as coton tricoter dmc nos 6 to 12 is the best one to use for this stitch illustration fig 278 greek stitch scotch stitch fig 279squares composed of slanting stitches made over one three five three threads respectively and then again over one thread and separated from each other by rows of gobelin stitches constitute what is ordinarily known by the name of scotch stitch illustration fig 279 scotch stitch moorish stitch fig 280for this stitch instead of surrounding squares of stitches made in the way we have just described with gobelin stitch the squares are made to touch rising like steps one above the other and bordered only at the sides by gobelin stitch illustration fig 280 moorish stitch oriental stitch fig 281here you make four diagonal stitches over one two three and four double threads respectively which four stitches form so many triangles one above the other the empty spaces between are filled up with gobelin stitches covering two threads illustration fig 281 oriental stitch shell stitch fig 282carry your thread upwards over six horizontal threads then from right to left under one vertical thread and downwards over six horizontal ones when you have made four vertical stitches in this way bring the needle out behind the third double thread counted lengthways and between the third and fourth counted across and fasten the four long stitches together with a backstitch to the middle thread of the canvas draw a thread of a different colour twice through these backstitches so as to form small knots like shells and then fill in the ground between the rows of long stitches with backstitches illustration fig 282 shell stitch jacquard stitch fig 283if you have a large plain surface to cover you should choose a stitch that forms a pattern in itself jacquard stitch and others which we shall describe later on will be found to produce the effect of brocaded stuff to work jacquard stitch make six stitches underneath one another over two double threads and six by the side of one another from left to right over two double threads the second row consists of the same number of stitches similarly worked downwards and to the side but over one double thread only illustration fig 283 jacquard stitch byzantine stitch fig 284here you make the same number of stitches as in the preceding figure but with this difference that the two rows of stitches are made either over two or four threads illustration fig 284 byzantine stitch milanese stitch fig 285in the first row the backstitch is made alternately first over four diagonal crosses and then over one in the second row over three and two in the third over two and three in the fourth over one and four the last long stitches should come under the last short ones and the short ones in the middle of the last long ones illustration fig 285 milanese stitch plush stitch fig 286this stitch also called astrachan stitch by means of which a very good imitation of an oriental rug can be produced consists of loops each secured by a cross stitch the best way to ensure these loops being even and regular is to make them over a narrow wooden ruler or a piece of whalebone the effect can be varied by cutting the loops which gives the surface the appearance of velvet illustration fig 286 plush stitch the illustration represents the middle loops only as cut for the cut and the uncut stitch can both be introduced into the same piece of embroidery for example the borders in figs 290 and 291 are worked in open or cut plush stitch whilst in the centres the stitch is left uncut two stitches of a similar kind called smyrna and malta stitch suitable for making rugs or carpets are described in the last chapter but one in the book chain stitch fig 287generally speaking this stitch is only used for the adornment of underlinen or small articles of fancywork but it can also be employed in copying cross stitch patterns in old collections we often meet with very interesting pieces of needlework which were used for hangings or screens where the figuresubjects are executed in chain stitch patterns in many colours gain immensely by being worked in this stitch the colours blend together better than in any other and even the shape of the stitch contributes to soften the contrasts of colour chain stitch cannot like other stitches be worked to and fro nor can all the stitches of one row be finished first as is generally possible in cross stitch work each row must be begun separately and always from the same side and a different needle should be used for each colour as the material has often to be changed illustration fig 287 chain stitch the stitch is worked as follows after fastening in your thread insert the needle at the same hole it came out of and bring it out two threads lower down keep the loop formed by the working thread under the point of the needle the thread should not be drawn up tightly but left to form a rather loose round loop for the next stitches insert the needle close to the thread that issues from the last loop pattern for borders or grounding fig 288this simple but most effective design copied from one of the most beautiful of oriental carpets can be executed in either cross stitch plush stitch or chain stitch to make a wider border still the diagonal lines that divide the figures shaped like an s have only to

embroidery are very similar to those used in canvas work the ordinary cross stitch as represented in fig 253 is the one most commonly used but it is not so effective as the twosided stitches which in the beautiful old needlework of the 15th 16th and 17th centuries have always excited our wonder and admiration stuffs suitable for linen embroiderymost embroidery of this kind and more especially the italian is done on very fine linen such fine work however requires more time and patience than people in these days are as a rule disposed to bestow on work intended merely for pleasure and recreation to meet the requirements of the day therefore in addition to the finer kinds of linen a great variety of textures are now manufactured the threads of which being thick and round can be easily counted the cross stitches that are worked on cuba ceylon or batavia linen are large and coarse those on linencanvas russian linen twisted tammy and rhodes linen small and fine linen fabrics are either white unbleached or creamcoloured all three are used for embroidery but the coloured cottons show up best on the cream ground on the white they look hard and crude and on the unbleached dull and faded materials suitable for linen embroideryas most linen embroidery is executed on articles that are subjected to frequent washing the dmc cottons which are to be had in every shade and colour are the best for the purpose for coarse stuffs coarse cotton should be used such as knitting cotton coton tricoter dmc nos 6 8 10 12 and 14a which will be found a very good substitute for wool or sixcord crochet cotton cordonnet 6 fils dmc nos 3 4 5 10 and 15a which gives quite as full and brilliant a stitch as silktwist finer cottons should be used for the finer stuffs such as embroidery cotton coton

the stuff plain cross stitch on auxiliary canvas fig 292plain cross stitch commonly called marking stitch has already been described in fig 253 but it may be well to observe that when an auxiliary material is used it should be most carefully tacked upon the stuff following the thread of the same and a sufficient margin left to allow of the drawing out of the canvas threads when the work is finished illustration fig 292 plain cross stitch on auxiliary canvas twosided cross stitch worked in four rows of stitches figs 293 294 295straight lines of cross stitch alike on both sides can be worked in two journeys to and fro working from left to right begin by fastening in your thread never with a knot but by two or three little running stitches which are hidden afterwards by your first cross stitch directing your needle to the right pass it diagonally over a double cross of the warp and woof of the canvas and so on to the end of the line having reached the last stitch draw out your thread in the middle of it make an auxiliary diagonal stitch downwards to the right bring the needle up in the middle of the last stitch take it thence upwards to the left across two threads and begin the return journey from right to left crossing and thus completing the first row of stitches in the auxiliary stitch with which you begin the backward journey the thread lies double on both sides fig 295 shows how to pass down to the next row illustration fig 293 first half of the first journey and auxiliary stitch for returning illustration fig 294 one journey and first half of the second finished and auxiliary stitch leading to the second return illustration fig 295 the two journeys to and fro completing one row of cross stitch both sides alike twosided marking stitch figs 296 and 297 the above mode of working twosided cross stitch cannot be applied to letters or patterns in broken lines which both consist chiefly of isolated stitches figs 296 and 297 explain the course of the stitches in embroidery of this kind the working detail a fig 296 indicates the spot for the thread to enter the stuff and the position of the needle for the first and second stitches b the first two stitches completed with an auxiliary stitch to the right the thread drawn out on the right and the position of the needle for the fifth stitch that completes the cross g shows the completion of the stitch begun at b and the position of the needle for a second stitch to the right d one cross stitch completed and another begun immediately beneath a in fig 297 e shows how to work stitches to the left f an auxiliary stitch to reach an isolated cross stitch on the right g auxiliary stitches between two isolated cross stitches and h a second and last auxiliary stitch to complete the cross it requires both practice and care to do this twosided marking stitch so as not to disfigure the stuff by superfluous stitches illustration fig 296 twosided marking stitch different positions of the needle illustration fig 297 twosided marking stitch different positions of the needle cross stitch forming a square at the back figs 298 and 299many of the alphabets we so admire in old samplers are worked in cross stitch that forms a square at the back each stitch has to be finished off before another is begun if you carefully examine figs 298 and 299 which show severally the right and the wrong sides of the stitch you will find no difficulty in mastering it letter a fig 296 shows the entrance of the thread the position of the needle for half the cross stitch on the right side and the second side of the square at the back as shown in fig 299 a letter b fig 298 shows the cross stitch finished and the position of the needle for the third side of the square on the wrong side indicated by the same letter in fig 299 c in both figures indicates a stitch which is double on the right side and on the wrong side forms the fourth side of the square whilst letter d explains how to continue the stitches illustration fig 298 right side of the cross stitch forming a square at the back illustration fig 299 square stitch forming the back of the cross stitch twosided italian stitch figs 300 301 302 303twosided italian stitch consists of cross stitches alike on both sides divided from each other by horizontal and vertical stitches the upper and lower stitches should all slope one way as in plain cross stitch italian stitch is worked in one journey to and fro fig 300 shows how to fasten in the thread and place the needle for the first stitch from right to left fig 301 the position of the needle from left to right to form the cross at the back and the vertical stitch to the left on the right side fig 302 the position of the needle for a twosided horizontal stitch at the bottom of the cross where upon you proceed as in fig 300 fig 303 explains the return of the thread which completes the double crosses and the lines between the horizontal lines not made on the first journey are added on the way back in conclusion pass the needle back horizontally from left to right to make the final stitch over the cross and then make the stitch between as shown in fig 303 on a thin stuff this stitch produces an extremely pretty effect resembling latticework provided the thread be tightly drawn in the working illustration fig 300 twosided italian stitch introduction of the thread and position of the needle for the first stitch illustration fig 301 twosided italian stitch position of the needle for the 2nd and 3rd stitches illustration fig 302 twosided italian stitch position of

southern districts of e europe especially the montenegrins have a great partiality for this stitch which has been rarely noticed hitherto in books on needlework the right side shows cross stitches with a double thread underneath and divided by vertical stitches the wrong side regular cross stitches also divided by vertical stitches coarse cotton should be used for this stitch it produces a richer effect and not only covers the stuff better but also the underneath stitch which in the slavonic work is entirely hidden by the cross stitches begin as letter a indicates with a long slanting stitch across 4 and 8 threads then bringing your needle back from right to left under four threads draw it out carry it over the first long stitch and insert it again from left to right under the first four threads of the canvas these four stitches finished proceed to the fifth and sixth which as b shows cross the first four then repeat the first stitch the threads that form the stitches on the wrong side should always be opposed to each other that is one cross should lean to the right the other to the left as shown in fig 305 this variation in the inclination of the stitches which is regarded as a fault in plain cross stitch is indispensable here and produces a charming effect on the wrong side illustration a b fig 304 montenegrin cross stitch 1st 2nd 3rd 4th and 5th stitch and transversal stitch illustration a b fig 305 montenegrin cross stitch position of the stitches on the wrong side illustration fig 306 montenegrin cross stitch a row of stitches finished plaited algerian stitch fig 307the distinguishing feature of this stitch is that it only advances one thread at a time it should be begun on an uneven number of threads and like the montenegrin stitch should be worked with coarse cotton the rows may touch either at the top or at the bottom of the stitch so long as you keep to one plan throughout illustration fig 307 plaited algerian stitch twosided spanish plaited stitch figs 308 and 309this stitch has the advantage of being not only very effective but also very quickly executed it is worked in two rows forwards and backwards all cross stitch patterns can be worked in spanish stitch the gaps which are occasioned by the long stitches have to be filled in with short ones in itself the stitch consists of slanting stitches three threads a part alike on both sides and advances three threads at a time as shown in figs 308 and 309 illustration fig 308 twosided plaited spanish stitch illustration fig 309 twosided plaited spanish stitch twosided line stitch figs 310 and 311square stitch holbein stitch line or stroke stitch as it is sometimes called and setting stitch are all worked on one principle though all these twosided stitches are related to each other and by no means difficult of execution those new to the work will find a little practice necessary to make the stitches follow in their proper order fig 310 explains how the needle has to pass alternately step by step over and under the threads of the stuff and fig 311 how the threads left blank the first time are covered on the way back the great difficulty is how to place your first row of stitches so as to ensure an unbroken course back it is as well before setting out to ascertain clearly the most direct course back so that you may not come to a standstill or be obliged to make unnecessary stitches on the wrong side if you have to pass obliquely across the stuff as in patterns figs 326 327 328 329 331 and 333 proceed in the same way as though you were covering the straight threads of a fabric illustration fig 310 twosided line stitch forward row illustration fig 311 twosided line stitch backward row twosided insertion figs 312 313 314 315 316 317 318we conclude this series of stitches with a description of a pretty twosided insertion suitable for joining stripes of work of different widths together in pieces of old needlework we often find handsome coloured patterns joined together by a piece of lace or some quite different kind of work the insertion represented in fig 317 is a very good substitute for either fig 312 explains the first stitch and the course of the second from left to right under 3 vertical and 3 horizontal threads the 3rd stitch to the left over 6 vertical threads and the beginning of the 4th stitch fig 313 shows the 4th stitch completed and the direction the 5th and 6th stitches have to take fig 314 the 6th completed and the position of the needle for the 7th and 8th fig 315 the 9th lower horizontal stitch over 6 vertical threads the 10th backward stitch and the position of the needle for the 11th and last stitch fig 317 represents a whole series of stitches and fig 318 the back of the work which though quite a different pattern will combine very well with any twosided embroidery illustration fig 312 twosided insertion first detail illustration fig 313 twosided insertion second detail illustration fig 314 twosided insertion third detail illustration fig 315 twosided insertion fourth detail illustration fig 316 twosided insertion fifth detail these insertions can be worked on any stuff but the stitches must be done both ways on a number of threads divisible by 3 thus the first stitch may cover 6 9 or 12 threads but never 8 10 12 or 14 transcribers note 12 here appears to be an error in the

valuables lying unheeded in a remote corner their simple graceful outlines render them peculiarly suitable for the decoration of tablecloths counterpanes curtains etc all embroideries of this kind

colour and design suggested the charming embroidery here represented in place of the somewhat violent colours which indicate an undeveloped taste we have substituted softer and more refined ones all the stroke stitches of the middle stripe and of the two border stripes top and bottom as well as the darker portions of the small dice subdivided into eight in the bottom border and of the small diagonal squares in the top border worked in gobelin stitch are in red colour 346 the setting of upright stroke stitches round the large centre figures as well as the straight lines that divide these

practice in working two sided square stitch the square represented in fig 339 forms the middle of the cloth the gobelin stitches set very closely unite and form a star in the centre of the principal subject they begin in the corners in red and continue in green violet and blue successively the little branches in stroke stitch on each side of the gobelin stitches correspond with them in colour and the small figures that form the border of the square may be worked indiscriminately in any of the colours used for the gobelin stitches of the centre four branches run inwards from the corners of the square and four more advance to meet and pass them from the inner angles of the wide border four figures copied from the outside border fig 339 and worked in yellow and the little star fig 337 besides the little subjects borrowed from the outside border fig 338 are strewn lightly over the foundation interspersed between the branches in fig 340 nevertheless which represents the whole tablecover the

the dmc threads and cottons illustration insertionplain stitches and overs knitting knitting is one of the earliest forms of needlework and one which has been carried to the highest perfection it would be difficult to invent new stitches or patterns and we shall therefore confine ourselves to describing the stitches in general use and reproducing those of the old patterns we consider the most useful that our readers may make their own selection in former days knitting served mainly for the manufacture of stockings and even now in spite of machines handknit stockings and numberless other useful and ornamental articles such as shawls counterpanes cradlecoverings gloves laces etc are in great request besides its practical use knitting is an easy and pleasant pastime that can be taken up at odd minutes and even carried on whilst talking or reading knitting consists of loops or stitches as they are generally called formed by means of a thread and two needles in round knitting four or five needles are necessary for the better handling of the work through the loops formed in knitting being connected together in unbroken continuity a very elastic fabric is produced which is specially suitable for making warm and closelyfitting wearingapparel materialsthreads with a slight twist such as coton tricoter dmc are the best with regard to the thickness of the needles whether they be of steel wood or bone your choice must be determined by the quality of the thread used the accompanying table is intended to help inexperienced knitters to match their needles and thread we advisedly say help as it is impossible exactly to determine the numbers that will correspond because every hand knits differently and a loose knitter has to use finer needles than a tight knitter other materials are enumerated here besides what is properly speaking called knittingcotton as for caps lace edgings insertions and so forth finer kinds of thread and threads with a stronger twist which show up the pattern better should be used illustration table of the approximate relation of the dmc threads and cottons to the numbers of the knitting needlesa position of the hands in knitting fig 341lay the thread over the fifth finger of the right hand and twist it round it then carry it over the forefinger which should be kept close to the work the work being held between the third finger and the thumb the left hand remains more or less inactive having merely by a slight movement of the forefinger to pass the loops in succession on to the needle in the right hand which forms the stitches this position of the hands which is the one usually adopted in england and france is the one represented in our illustration the germans on the contrary lay the thread over the left hand and can move the hands much more quickly in consequence there are some ways of casting on which can only be done in the german fashion to prevent the irregularity in stitches the needles should never be allowed to protrude more than 1 or 1 cm from the work all exaggerated movement of the arms which renders knitting a very tiring occupation should be avoided illustration fig 341 position of the hands in knitting casting oncasting or setting on as it is sometimes called is the formation of the first row of stitches which are to constitute the foundation of the work there are four methods of casting on 1 crossed casting on done in four different ways 2 knitting on 3 slipping on also done in two ways 4 casting on with picots 1 crossed casting on with a single thread fig 342 lay the thread over your fingers as though you were beginning a chain of plain stitches fig 403 leaving a long end sufficient to make the number of stitches required lying within the palm of the hand put the needle in from below into the loop on the thumb and pass it from right to left under that part of the thread which lies between the forefinger and the thumb then bring the thread through the loop on the thumb draw the thumb out and lay the loop on the needle in making the next stitches lay the thread over the thumb so that the end lies outside put in the needle under the front thread and complete the stitch as before this method of casting on is generally done over two needles one of them being drawn out before the knittingoff is begun to ensure a loose edge illustration fig 342 crossed casting on with a single thread crossed casting on with a threefold threadthis method is similar to the last only that the thread is taken threefold and is drawn by the needle through the loop which is formed at the bend of the thread then you pass the single thread over the left hand and the triple one over the thumb as shown in fig 342 and make the same stitches as above the threefold thread makes a broad chain at the bottom of the loops double crossed casting on fig 343this can be done either with a single or a threefold thread in our drawing it is done with the latter the first stitch is made as we have already described only that you have to keep the loop on your thumb put the needle into it a second time lay hold of the thread behind cast on a second stitch and then only withdraw your thumb in this manner two loops are made at once close together illustration fig 343 double crossed casting on crossed casting on forming a chain fig 344begin by making one such stitch as we have described in fig 341 for the second and following stitches bring the end of the thread to the inside of the palm of the hand so that it lies between the thumb and the forefinger illustration fig 344 crossed casting on forming a chain 2 knitting on stitches fig 345begin with a plain crossed stitch then take the thread and the needle in the left hand a second needle in the right and catch it into the stitch on the left needle lay the thread under the right needle and draw it through in a loop through the loop on the left needle then transfer it as a fresh stitch to the left needle catch the needle into this second stitch and draw the thread through it to form the third and so on this method of casting on is used for articles that are to have a double edge see figs 355 356 because stitches made in this way are easier to pick up than the tighter ones but it should not be used where it will form the actual edge as the loops are always too open illustration fig 345 knitting on stitches 3 casting on with slip loops fig 346begin by casting on one loop in the ordinary way next lay the thread as in german knitting over the left hand twisting it once only round the forefinger then put the needle in upwards from below under the thread that lies on the outside of the forefinger draw out the finger from the loop put the loop on the needle to the right take the thread on the forefinger again and so on illustration fig 346 casting on with slip loops casting on with double slip loops fig 347begin by casting on a stitch in the ordinary way then lay the thread over the forefinger the reverse way so that it crosses between not outside the hand and the body of the knitter pass the needle upwards from below under the inside thread and slip this thread as a loop on to the needle continue to cast on inserting the needle under the front and back threads alternately this method is specially suitable for open patterns where you have to increase several times in succession illustration fig 347 casting on with double slip loops 4 casting on with picots fig 348cast on two stitches in the ordinary way and turn the work lay the thread over the needle put the needle into the first stitch from right to left and slip it on to the right needle knit off the second stitch plain and draw the slipped one over it illustration fig 348 casting on with picots cast on as many stitches as you want in this manner and then pick up the picots thus formed with an auxiliary needle and knit them off like ordinary stitches this method of casting on may be varied thus in the following manner having cast on the stitches as in fig 348 throw the thread over the needle and knit two stitches together plain stitch fig 349this is the easiest stitch and the first which a knitter has to learn it is executed as follows put the righthand needle in upwards from below under the front part of the first stitch on the lefthand needle lay the thread from right to left under the needle draw it through the loop and drop the loop off the left needle illustration fig 349 plain stitch plain knitting is employed wherever a perfectly smooth even surface is required it looks quite differently on the wrong side from what it does on the right where it presents the appearance of vertical rows of plaiting back or seamstitch fig 350you may intentionally knit the wrong side of plain knitting this is called purling and is done in the following way lay the thread over the left needle and put the right one downwards from above behind the thread into the loop on the left needle lay the thread upwards from below over the right needle draw it through the loop and drop the loop off the left needle this stitch is used in knitting patterns and for marking horizontal lines in smooth surfaces such as the seam of a stocking for instance illustration fig 350 back or seamstitch plain stitch taken from behind fig 351put the needle in from right to left under the back part of the stitch leave the thread behind the needle then pass it from right to left over the needle and draw it through the stitch illustration fig 351 plain stitch taken from behind back or seamstitch taken from behind fig 352put the needle into the second part of the stitch upwards from below and knit it as a back or seamstitch illustration fig 352 back or seamstitch taken from behind in plain stitch taken from behind the two threads of the loop are crossed instead of lying side by side as they do in plain knitting backstitch taken from behind is only used for certain openwork patterns overs fig 353these form holes in plain knitting and are used for openwork patterns and for increasing illustration fig 353 overs to make an over lay the thread over the needle and in the next row knit this loop like any other stitch each over adds one to the existing number of stitches in cases therefore where the number is to remain the same you have to make as many intakes as overs overs can only be used in conjunction with other stitches knot stitch fig 354this forms a raised spot in plain knitting and is executed as follows knit 1 and leave it on the lefthand needle put the stitch you have made with the right needle back on the left and knit it off make 4 or 5 similar stitches all issuing from the same stitch on the left needle so that you have 4 or 5 loops on the right needle then drop the stitch off the left needle and pull the 4 first loops over the last one illustration fig 354 knot stitch cable or chain stitchchain stitches are used for strengthening and equalizing the edges of articles that are made in stripes they can be made in two ways either you knit off all the stitches on one needle turn the work put the needle into the first stitch as if you were going to knit it from the back and take it off the left needle without knitting it the thread to lie behind the needle or you knit off all the stitches on one needle turn the work and knit off the first stitch the names of the stitchesout of the stitches that have been already described other stitches are formed which as they are frequently alluded to in knitting directions we shall here enumerate explaining all the terms usually employed in such directions over or increaseexplained in fig 353 throwing the thread once over the right needle double over or two increasesthrowing the thread twice over the needle plain intakeknitting two stitches together plain this is done when the intake is to lie from left to right purled intakepurling two stitches together this is done to make the stitches that are knitted together visible or in the case of a piece of work composed of stripes on the wrong side when the intake is to lean to the right on the right side plain decrease taken from behindknitting off two stitches together plain from behind this is done when the intake is to lie to the left purled decrease taken from behindpurling two stitches together from behind this is done when in articles composed of stripes the decrease has to be made on the wrong side and is to lie to the left on the right side pulling overslipping a stitch from the left needle to the right without knitting it knitting the next plain and pulling the slipped stitch over the knitted one in this manner two or three stitches can be pulled over the knitted one casting offto prevent the stitches from unravelling they are finished off in the following manner knit off two plain pull the first over the second and drop it so that only one remains on the needle knit the next stitch and pull the one behind over it and so on this chain of stitches must neither be too tight nor too loose but just as elastic as the rest of the work materials for stockingsstockings can be made of silk wool or cotton entirely according to fancy but for coloured stockings we cannot too highly recommend the dmc knitting cottons as more durable in all respects than either silk or wool they are manufactured in 360 different shades whereas wool and silk are only to be had in a very limited assortment of colours for handknit stockings nos 25 30 35a are the best for machineknit nos 40 and 50 stocking knittinga stocking consists of five parts 1 the top 2 the knee 3 the leg 4 the heel 5 the foot 1 the top may be either ribbed or knitted in an openwork stitch of same kind or with a doubletoothed edge fig 356 2 and 3 the knee and the leg down to the heel are generally plain knitted it is only childrens stockings that are fancy knitted 4 the heel is worked as straight knitting backwards and forwards by knitting first one row plain and then turning back and knitting it purl it is shaped to the foot by the intakes at the top 5 the foot is knitted plain with intakes from the heel onwards to get rid of the superfluous stitches then knit a plain piece without a seamstitch till you begin to decrease for the toe which can be worked in several different ways to ensure the right proportions between the several parts of a stocking the following directions should be attended to an ornamental top must never be taken into account in measuring the length of the leg when the top part is finished you make the seam at the beginning of the first needle of the round of one or two purled stitches or sometimes a narrow pattern of purled stitches this marks the middle of the stocking for ordinarysized stockings knit plain from the topband till the knitted piece forms a square for stockings that are to cover the knee knit half as much again that is one and a half times the width of the stocking this brings you to the calf of the leg pull the third stitch after the seam over the second and knit together the two last but one before the seam there should be 12 rounds between each of the first 3 or 4 intakes and after that 8 until this part is one and a half times the width of the knee in length and a quarter narrower for the ankle knit a plain piece half the width of the knee in length without intakes for the heel count the stitches on the four needles exclusive of the seam and put two stitches more than the quarter of the whole number on to the needles to the right and left of the seam for a heel to fit well it should be as long as it is wide in order that they should wear better the heel and the toe are often knitted with double thread coton feutrer dmca is made expressly for that purpose and should be wound round the thread of which the whole stocking is made for the instep the part between the heel and toe you must go on decreasing from the heel until you have 2 stitches less on each needle than you had at the ankle then knit the plain part of the foot which should be as wide as the ankle after which proceed to decrease for the toe which should be a quarter the length of the whole foot in spite of this careful subdivision it is always well to count the stitches to ensure perfect regularity the number of stitches cast on at the outset for the samesized stockings must depend upon the size of the wool or cotton we can only give the numbers approximately our calculation is based on the use of 5 needles the given number has therefore to be cast on four times coton tricoter dmc number of stitches to number of stitches

figs 355 and 356this is the simplest and strongest edge you can have for a stocking and is called the catsteeth edge illustration fig 355 scalloped stocking edge edge open illustration fig 356 scalloped stocking edge edge folded together having cast on the stitches knit 6 to 10 rounds plain according to the size of the cotton then one round of alternate intakes and overs knit as many plain rounds as before and with a sixth needle take up as many of the cast on stitches as you have stitches on one of the upper needles turn this needle inwards and place it against the outside needle and knit off both needles together see that you knit the corresponding stitches off together otherwise the scallops that form the edge will be crooked common heel fig 357this is the simplest form of heel and can be knitted either with or without an outside seam divide the stitches into four and put two more on each of the heel needles than on the others then make according to the size of the cotton from 15 to 20 seams knit off all the stitches on the right needle and a third of those on the left supposing that you have 24 stitches knit off 8 then slip 1 knit 1 and pull the slipped stitch over knit 2 plain turn the work slip the first and purl the next 8 stitches of the second needle purl the 9th and 10th together purl 2 turn the work to the right side and slip the first stitch on to the right needle by means of these successive intakes after the 8 stitches the knitting forms a plait on both sides of the heel illustration fig 357 common heel in all heels that are made after this pattern the intakes must begin on the right side and the last one must be made on the wrong so that once the heel is finished and the work turned you can go on knitting plain when you have finished the stitches of the two heel needles up to the outside seams take up the stitches on the sides of the heel with a spare needle and knit them on to the left heel needle then knit the stitches reserved for the instep take up the stitches on the right side of the heel again and knit them on to the fourth needle in the next round knit all the stitches of the first needle plain excepting the 4 last knit the first and second of these together and the two last plain knit the two first stitches of the fourth needle plain slip the third knit the fourth and pull the slipped stitch over heel in steps fig 358after dividing the stitches make from 12 to 14 seams then knit as many stitches of the first needle as you have seams at the side turn the work and begin the needle with the seam you made first knit off as many stitches from the second needle as from the first make the same number of seams as for the first part of the heel when the seams are finished take up the chain stitches on both sides make a decrease by knitting the last stitch of the small part and the first of the large together knit two turn the work slip the first stitch knit to the second side and decrease as in the first part illustration fig 358 heel in steps when you have decreased all the stitches up to the last take up the slipped stitches of the first part and begin the intakes for the instep in the ordinary way there is not more work in this pattern of heel than in any other it fits closely and consequently wears well plain heel figs 359 and 360those who are not fond of purling will appreciate this and the following pattern for a plain heel illustration fig 359 plain heel illustration fig 360 heel knitted on the right side knit off the stitches of the first needle after the seam then on to two spare needles cast on 8 more stitches than you had on one needle after dividing the stitches put the stitches of the third and fourth needles together and knit the first round plain 2nd roundknit together the 1st and 2nd and the 9th and 10th of the first auxiliary needle and the 10th and 9th and 2nd and 1st of the second 3rd roundplain 4th roundknit together the 1st and 2nd and the 7th and 8th of the

and 4th needles knit the last stitches plain go on decreasing in this way until the purled stitches meet after the plain round over the intakes add four plain rounds divide the stitches that remain for the sole on two needles and cast off on the wrong side now take up the auxiliary stitches and in the first 3 plain rounds knit together the last and the first of the 1st and 2nd needles and the last and the first of the 3rd and 4th with the rest of the extra stitches make purled intakes knitting two plain rounds after each round with an intake for the other kind of plain heel also fig 360 auxiliary stitches are required supposing that you have 20 stitches on each needle you must cast on 28 stitches on to each auxiliary needle knit together the 4th and 3rd stitches at the end of the 1st and 3rd needles and the 3rd and 4th of the 2nd and 3rd needles so that you may have 4 plain stitches between both intakes go on decreasing knitting 2 plain rounds after each round with an intake until you have 6 stitches left on each needle then knit together the first and last stitches of each needle one plain round over it and finish with a chain on the wrong side of the heel then take up the auxiliary stitches and knit the instep italian stocking fig 361the heel sole and toe of a stocking always wear out before the instep the italians and greeks economise time and material and facilitate the renewal of those parts that wear out by knitting the upper part of the foot in two pieces after knitting the heel in on or other of the above ways work the foot as straight knitting with the two upper needles only until you have the necessary length then knit the underneath part separately in the same way you must keep a chain along all edges and a narrow seam of one or two stitches in the sole which you make after finishing the upper part your intakes must come directly after and before the seam when you have got the same number of rounds in each piece join them together and begin the toe illustration fig 361 italian stocking sew up the slits left open on either side with a needle and thread taking care to fit the corresponding stitches together in this manner when one part wears out you have only to unpick these sideseams and resole or reheel the stocking as the case may be toe fig 362to begin as before with the simplest and most ordinary way of making this part of the stocking divide the stitches equally on to the 4 needles knit together the 4th and 3rd stitches before the end of the 1st and 3rd needles knit the 2 last and 2 first stitches of the 2nd and 4th needles plain and make an intake by slipping the 3rd stitch knitting the 4th and pulling the slipped stitch over begin by knitting 2 plain rounds after each of the first 4 rounds with an intake and afterwards only one when you have only 4 stitches left on each needle collect them on two and knit them together two and two on the wrong side of the stocking illustration fig 362 toe toe fig 363here before beginning to decrease divide the stitches by 8 10 or 12 supposing that they have been divided by 10 knit 8 plain knit the 9th and 10th together 8 plain knit two together and so on the whole way round then knit as many plain rounds as there are plain stitches between 2 intakes in the next rounds with intakes you will have one stitch less between each intake in the second therefore there should be 7 plain stitches between each intake and you knit 7 plain rounds and so on to the 7th round when 2 stitches will remain followed by 2 plain rounds when there are only 4 stitches left on the needles turn them in to the wrong side of the stocking and finish off with a chain illustration fig 363 toe toe fig 364begin the intakes with the two first stitches of each needle by the slip and pull over process knit one plain round after each round with an intake in the following rounds make the intake in the 2nd round with the 3rd and 4th stitches in the 3rd with the 5th and 6th stitches in the 4th with the 7th and 8th stitches so that when finished the intakes form a kind of spiral finish off in the ordinary way illustration fig 364 toe toe fig 365we will describe one other kind of toe quite as shapely and easy to make as the others illustration fig 365 toe 1st roundpurl the first 2 stitches on each needle together 2nd and 3rd 5th and 6th 8th and 9th 11th and 12th 14th and 15th 17th and 18th roundsplain 4th round1 plain 1 intake with the 2nd and 3rd stitches and with the last 2 on each needle 7th roundknit the 2 first plain make 1 intake with the 3rd and 4th stitches and 1 with the 2 last in each of the next rounds with intakes knit 1 plain stitch more when the two seams meet pull the last stitch on each needle over the first of the next knit the stitches between the intakes plain continue to decrease in this manner until the last stitches are reached mending knittingknitted articles are repaired by reconstructing the web with a needle and thread when the stitches are not actually broken they can be strengthened by new ones made over them by means of a needle and thread materials for darning stockingsthe thread used for darning a stocking should be a little finer than that of which it is made coton repriser dmca is the best for as it consists of several strands it can be subdivided as occasion requires strengthening the stitches figs 366 and 367this can be done in two ways in fig 366 the thread is brought out between two horizontal bars passed upwards over a perpendicular bar put in by the side of the same and brought out between the next horizontal bars work the second row of stitches backwards take up two threads on the left pass downwards to the right over one thread take up the thread you passed over and so on illustration fig 366 strengthening the loops first way illustration fig 367 strengthening the loops second way the other way fig 367 is when you have brought out your needle to carry it over one thread to the right and upwards over two take up the next two threads on the left pass downwards over two horizontal threads and over one thread to the right and put in the needle where it first came out then working from right to left take up two threads pass over one to the right and downwards over two horizontal ones and so on in the next row hold your work the finished part uppermost carry the needle downwards over one horizontal thread bring it out between two threads that lie separately and take it downwards again over two horizontal threads pick up two threads working from right to left pass upwards over two threads and over one to the right take up two to the left and so on repairing plain knitting fig 368when a broken piece of stocking web requires to be replaced by new draw the new and the old pieces together with a needle and thread using the same thread the stocking is made of illustration fig 368 repairing plain knitting for this purpose you must clear the loops by ravelling them out top and bottom and slip them on to knitting needles the loops that are to be connected must lie exactly opposite to each other enter your threaded needle upwards from below through the first disengaged upper loop and slip it off the knitting needle then enter the needle downwards from above through the first lower loop and upwards from below through the next and draw out just enough thread to make the new loop the same size as the old ones then enter the needle downwards from above through the same upper loop you took up before taking up also the one next to it and passing your needle through it from underneath draw out the thread to form the new loop and descend again to the next and so on repairing purled knitting fig 369to repair ribbed surfaces consisting of alternate rows of plain and purl proceed as follows hold the article so that the row of purled stitches is exactly opposite the upper part enter your needle upwards from below through the first loop of the upper part join the two lower loops together as in fig 368 carry the needle upwards again and enter it upwards from below through the first loop of the upper part and downwards from above through the loop next it join the lower loops again as in plain knitting illustration fig 369 repairing purled knitting disengaging the loops for darning fig 370where the threads are broken new loops have to be made and the broken ones ravelled out and cut so that the horizontal loops may stand out clear and distinct cut the threads on the vertical sides so that the loops form an edge and the hole is square clear two or four loops in the corners of the hole fold them in and fasten them off at the back by a stitch or two the darns we are next going to describe should be made upon a ball to prevent drawing the threads too tightly illustration fig 370 disengaging the loops for darning darning on threads stretched horizontally figs 371 and 372carry a horizontal thread across on the wrong side in the place of each broken thread securing it in the sound part of the stocking about two threads from the edge of the hole when you have made this foundation put the needle in on the right side near the stitch that is nearest to the sound part on the left fig 371 illustration fig 371 darning on threads stretched horizontally position of the horizontal threads illustration fig 372 darning on threads stretched horizontally how to cover the horizontal threads then descending pick up the nearest horizontal thread from below so that the working thread lies to the right of the needle and cover all the horizontal threads you have laid in this manner when you have taken up the last thread pass the needle downwards from above through the nearest loop and bring it back through the one at which you entered it to make in reascending the second half of the loop you must lay your thread to the right of the needle fig 372 when you have reached the last thread enter the needle at the loop opposite the one it came out of darning on threads stretched obliquely across figs 373 and 374as the illustration shows you have to pick up all the cleared loops besides two or three on either side of the empty space the number and length of the threads which you carry across must correspond with those of the threads you have to replace illustration fig 373 darning on threads stretched obliquely across position of the threads illustration fig 374 darning on threads stretched obliquely across how to cover the oblique threads fasten in from the right side a rather finer thread than the one the original web is made of and make a few stitches over the existing ones in the row you are about to complete enter the needle upwards from below through the first disengaged loop pass it under two threads issuing from one loop and then bring it back again into the same loop between the two slanting threads drawing it out again upwards from below through the next loop and so on the new loop must be just equal to the old ones in size make in the same manner as at the beginning two or three stitches at the end of the row within the edge of the hole work back in a similar way with this difference only that you turn your work round

for a piece of work the dark cotton should always be one or two numbers finer than the light because the dark dyes thicken the cotton more than the light ones do the blue red and dark brown dyes sink

concluding chapter the table of numbers and sizes and the list of colours of the dmc threads and cottons illustration crochet laceclose leaves and bars with picots crochet work crochet work so called from the hook french croche or croc with which it is done is not only one of the easiest but in comparison with the cost and labour one of the most effective kinds of fancywork it is also one of the most useful as it can be applied to the domestic requirements of everyday life to wearing apparel houselinen and upholstery and we are sure that the patterns contained in this chapter which have in addition to their other merits that of novelty will meet with a favorable reception hooks or needles as they are generally called made of wood bone or tortoiseshell are used for all the heavier kinds of crochet work in thick wool or cotton and steel ones for the finer kinds the tunisian crochet is done with a long straight hook which is made all in one piece the points should be well polished inside and not too sharp the backs slightly curved and the handles whether of bone steel or wood so light as not to tire the hand those represented here we consider the best as regards shape as it is most essential that the needle should be suited to the cotton in size we subjoin a comparative table of the numbers of the dmc threads and cottons and of the different needles illustration fig 400

in crochet as in knitting you frequently have to repeat the same series of stitches such repetitions will be indicated by the signs etc as the case may be crochet stitchesin point of fact there is only one because all crochet work consists of loops made by means of the hook or needle and connected together by being drawn the one through the other crochet work may however be divided into two kinds german crochet and victoria or tunisian crochet the latter is known also under the name of tricotcrochet in german crochet there are eight different kinds of stitches 1 chain stitch 2 single stitch 3 plain stitch 4 treble stitch 5 knot stitch 6 bullion stitch 7 cluster or scale stitch 8 double stitch the rows are worked according to the kind of stitch either to and fro or all from one end in the former case the work has to be turned at the end of each row and the subsequent row begun with 1 2 or 3 chain stitches to prevent the contraction of the outside edge when the rows are all worked one way the thread must be fastened on afresh each time which is done by putting the needle into the first chain stitch of the preceding row drawing the thread through it so as to form a loop and making one or more chain stitches according to the height required at the end of each row cut the thread and draw the end through the last loop in this manner all crochet work is finished off some crochet workers make a few extra chain stitches with the ends of the thread at the beginning and end of each row or fasten them off with a few stitches on the wrong side they can also when the occasion requires be formed into a fringe or tassels as a finish to the work position of the hands and explanation of 1 chain stitch fig 403take the thread in the left hand between the finger and thumb hold the needle between the thumb and first finger of the right hand letting it rest on the second finger in the same manner in which you hold your pen and put it into the loop which you hold between the finger and thumb of the left hand take up the thread lying on your finger with the needle and make your first stitch as you do in knitting tightening the loop just enough to leave an easy passage through it for the needle the end of the thread must be held by the thumb and forefinger the next stitches are made by taking up the thread with the needle and drawing it through the loop the throwing of the thread round the needle by a jerk of the wrist is called an over illustration fig 403 position of the hands and explanation of chain stitch 2 single stitch fig 404put the needle in from the right side of the work into the uppermost loop of the preceding row take up the thread on the needle and draw it through both loops illustration fig 404 single stitch 3 plain stitch fig 405put the needle through as in fig 404 from the right side to the wrong under the upper side either of a chain or of a stitch of the preceding row draw the thread through it in a loop turn the thread round the needle and draw it through both loops on the needle by making the rows of plain stitches follow each other in different ways a great variety of stitches can be produced as the illustrations and written instructions here given will show illustration fig 405 plain stitch rose stitch fig 406this consists of rows of plain stitches worked backwards and forwards insert the needle from the right side under both the horizontal loops of the preceding row illustration fig 406 rose stitch russian stitch fig 407this is worked like the foregoing only that all the rows have to be begun from the same end and the thread has to be cut off at the end of each row illustration fig 407 russian stitch ribbed stitch fig 408worked backwards and forwards the hook being passed through the back part only of the stitches of the preceding row illustration fig 408 ribbed stitch chain stitchworked like fig 408 but on one side only piqu stitchthis stitch also is only worked on one side put the needle in under one of the vertical threads of a stitch and complete the plain stitch this is a stitch that looks very well on the wrong side the bars of the loop lie quite close together which makes it particularly suitable for unlined articles of clothing it requires a largesized needle to do this stitch well especially if the material be a heavy one slanting stitch fig 409worked entirely on the right side take up the back thread of a stitch in the preceding row take hold of the crochet thread without turning it round the needle and draw it through in a loop and then finish the stitch like a plain stitch illustration fig 409 slanting stitch crossed stitchthe name which is given to the preceding stitch when both the threads of the stitches in the row before are taken up together instead of the back one only russian crossed stitch fig 410to work this stitch which runs in slanting lines put the needle in between the vertical threads of the stitches and underneath the two horizontal ones illustration fig 410 russian crossed stitch counterpane stitch fig 411counterpanes can be made in a less close stitch than those just described illustration fig 411 counterpane stitch to produce a soft and elastic fabric turn the thread round the needle and insert it under both the horizontal threads of a loop take up the thread without turning it round the needle draw it through in a loop make an over and draw the thread through all the three loops that you have on the needle knotted stitch fig 412this stitch likewise is composed of plain stitches which however differ in a slight degree from those we have described hitherto illustration fig 412 knotted stitch make an over put the needle through the two horizontal threads of the stitch below make another over and draw it back through the two loops and the first over make another over and draw the thread through the last two loops loop stitch fig 413worked as follows when you have put the needle into the loop of a stitch below carry the thread downwards from above round a stripe of cardboard or a flat wooden ruler then finish the stitch in the usual way these long loops each about 2 cm in length can also be made over the forefinger and held fast by the thumb as you work but it is more difficult to make them regular in this way each row of long stitches is followed by a row of plain stitches the side where the long loops lie becomes the right side if you wish this stitch to be very thick and handsome wind the thread three times round the ruler or finger and secure it with a plain stitch in this case you should make one plain stitch between every two clusters a loose fleecy thread is generally used for this stitch and for washing articles more especially we recommend coton repriser dmc illustration fig 413 loop stitch plain stitches for a chain fig 414begin with two chain stitches put the needle in between the two threads of the first chain stitch turn the thread round the needle and draw it through in a loop turn it round again and draw it through the two loops then put the needle into the left part of the stitch that was just made turn the thread round the needle draw it through the two loops and so on to the end illustration fig 414 plain stitches for a chain a chain of this kind makes a very good substitute for mignardise when that can not be got of the right size and colour for the required purpose 4 treblestrebles are little columns or bars made of loops or stitches they can be worked like all other crochet either to and fro or all one way there are different kinds of trebles half or short trebles trebles double trebles called also long stitch and quadruple and quintuple trebles called extra long stitch connected trebles and crossed trebles half trebles fig 415turn the cotton round the needle from behind put the needle in between the trebles of the preceding row or into one edge of a chain stitch make an over bring the needle forward again with the thread make another over and draw the needle through all three loops illustration fig 415 half trebles trebles figs 416 and 417begin as for the half treble by turning the thread round the needle and putting it in under one edge of the stitch beneath then take up the thread on the needle and bring it through two of the loops take it up again and draw it through the two remaining loops illustration fig 416 trebles made directly above one another illustration fig 417 trebles set between those of the preceding row in fig 417 we have trebles made in the same manner as fig 416 only that instead of putting the needle under one edge of the stitch beneath you put it under both and between the trebles of the last row illustration fig 418 double trebles or long stitch double trebles or long stitch fig 418turn the thread twice round the needle put it into a stitch of the work and bring the thread through in a loop then take up the thread on the needle and bring it through two of the loops three times in succession illustration fig 419 triple and quadruple trebles or extra long stitch triple and quadruple trebles or extra long stitch fig 419for a triple treble twist the cotton three times round the needle for a quadruple one four times then form the treble in the usual way by bringing the needle through two of the loops at a time to make a series of trebles of gradually increasing length bring the needle at every other treble through the last three loops so that before making a triple treble you will have to make columns respectively 1 treble 1 treble 2 trebles and 2 trebles long columns like these of different lengths are often required in crochet work for leaves and scalloped edgings connected trebles fig 420trebles connected together can be worked to and fro and take the place of plain stitches begin with a chain then make a treble of the required height form as many loops as you made overs for the treble take up the upper thread of the stitch nearest the treble turn the thread round the needle bring it back to the right side and draw the needle through the trebles two at a time illustration fig 420 connected trebles crossed trebles figs 421 and 422trebles of this sort produce an open stitch which is often used for the footing of lace or for an insertion make a foundation of chain or other stitches and proceed as follows 3 chain miss 2 stitches of the row beneath make 1 treble in the third stitch 5 chain 1 over put the needle in between the loops of the connected trebles and finish with a treble then make a double over put the needle into the next loop of the preceding row make another over draw the needle through the loops make another over and join the two next loops this leaves 3 loops on the needle make an over put the needle into the third stitch of the row beneath make an over and bring the needle back to the right side illustration fig 421 crossed trebles illustration fig 422 crossed trebles set between those of the preceding row join the 5 loops on the needle together 2 and 2 make 2 chain 1 over put the needle into the upper parts of the connected trebles and finish with a treble and so on these trebles also can be lengthened if necessary but in that case the width of the crossed treble must correspond with the height generally speaking you make the trebles over the same number of stitches as you made overs on the needle which should always be an even number trebles for a chaina quicker way of making a wide footing for a crochet lace is to make the trebles in the following manner make 4 chain stitches 2 overs put the needle into the first of the 4 chain 1 over draw the thread through the stitch 1 over draw the thread through the next 2 loops and repeat twice from 2 overs put the needle into the left bottom part of the treble close the treble as before and repeat from 5 knot stitch fig 423this stitch which is composed of several loops forming a tuft can only be worked from one side consequently all one way it looks best in a coarse material to show the interlacing of the threads enter the needle through the two loops of the stitches of the bottom row turn the thread round the needle but away from you towards the back bring it forward to the right side put the needle again through one of the bottom stitches make another over like the first and draw the needle through all the bars at once illustration fig 423 knot stitch 6 bullion stitch figs 424 and 425for bullion stitch select a needle a little thicker towards the handle and finer than you would use for any other crochet stitch illustration fig 424 bullion stitch illustration fig 425 bullion stitch begin by making a chain of very loose stitches then wind the thread several times very evenly round the needle insert the needle into a loop of the chain make a single over and draw it with the last over upon it through all the other overs trebles in bullion stitch fig 425 are worked in just the same manner only that you have to turn the thread at least 10 or 12 times round the needle and draw it through all the overs at once to facilitate the passage of the needle keep the overs in their place with the thumb and forefinger of the left hand bullion stitch can only be worked with wool or a very fleecy thread such as coton repriser dmca but trebles in bullion stitch can be worked in any of the dmc threads and cottons 7 cluster stitch fig 426generally used as an insertion between rows of plain crochet illustration fig 426 cluster stitch put the needle under one stitch of the preceding row make an over draw the thread through in a loop make another over put the needle in again under the same stitch bring it back make a third over and pass a third time under the same stitch bring the needle back make a fourth over and pass the needle through all the loops that are upon it then after making a chain stitch begin the same stitch over again placing it in the second stitch of the lower row cluster stitch may also be finished off by retaining the two last loops on the needle making an over and ending with a plain stitch 8 double stitch fig 427a rather coarse thread such as coton tricoter dmc nos 6 to 12 cordonnet 6 fils dmc nos 3 to 10 or fil pointer dmc nos 10 to 30a is better for this stitch than a loose fleecy thread which is apt to render it indistinct take up a loop right and left of a stitch of the preceding row so that counting the loop of the last stitch you have 3 loops on the needle make an over and draw it through the 3 loops then take up a loop again by the side of the one you made on the left and which now lies on the right take 2 loops in the next stitch make an over and draw it through all the loops illustration fig 427 double stitch raised stitch fig 428all the stitches that come under this heading require a foundation of a few plain rows for the raised trebles in fig 428 you will observe that the fourth stitch in the fourth row is a double treble connected with a loop of the fourth stitch of the first row illustration fig 428 raised stitch miss the stitch of the preceding row which is hidden under the treble make 3 plain stitches 1 double treble and so on having finished this row turn the work and make a plain row in the next row begin with 4 plain stitches then make 1 double treble between the 3 stitches that are between the first trebles 3 plain stitches 2 double trebles and so on in the 8th row of plain stitches the trebles must be placed in the same order as in the 4th raised stitch with crossed trebles fig 429begin as in fig 428 by 3 rows of plain stitches the 4th row begins with 2 plain stitches followed by 1 double treble joined to the upper part of the 1st stitch of the 1st row keep the 2 last loops of this treble on the needle make a double over for the next treble pass the needle through the fourth stitch of the first row make an over turn the thread round the needle bring it back finish the treble all but the last 3 loops which you crochet together miss the stitch behind the treble make 3 plain stitches and repeat from illustration fig 429 raised stitch with crossed trebles then turn the work make one plain row and turn the work back to the right side the second row of trebles begins with a plain stitch the way in which the trebles are to be crossed is shewn in the illustration raised stitch with dots fig 430after making 3 plain rows begin the 4th with 3 plain stitches and proceed as follows 6 trebles into the 4th plain stitch of the preceding row leaving the last loop of each treble on the needle so that altogether you have 7 loops upon it then you turn the thread once round the needle and draw it through the loops miss the stitch that is underneath the dot make 3 plain stitches and repeat from illustration fig 430 raised stitch with dots then make 3 rows of plain stitches in the 4th row the 1st dot is made in the 4th stitch so that the dots stand out in relief raised dots with trebles fig 431turn the work after making 3 rows of plain stitches make 3 stitches more in the 4th stitch of the 1st row 6 trebles drop the last stitch of the 6th treble put the needle into the stitch between the last plain stitch and the 1st treble take the dropped loop of the last treble and draw it through the one on the needle miss the stitch under the dot make 5 plain stitches and repeat from illustration fig 431 raised dots with trebles raised dots in slanting lines fig 432on the rows of stitches that have been previously prepared make for the 4th stitch of the 4th row a cluster stitch as in fig 426 with 1 quadruple over and then 4 plain stitches 1 cluster stitch and so on the next row is plain in the second you have to make 1 plain stitch more and fasten the cluster stitches into the loops to the left of the second of the 3 covered rows in this way you have to make each raised stitch one stitch in advance and to the left of the last so that they run in slanting lines over the surface illustration fig 432 raised dots in slanting lines close shell stitch fig 433this pretty stitch which can only be worked in rows all one way is more especially suitable for childrens jackets and petticoats it is easy and has the merit of being quickly done on a foundation of chain or other stitches make 2 chain 7 trebles on the 4th stitch 1 chain 7 trebles on the 5th stitch of the last row and repeat from illustration fig 433 close shell stitch 2nd row 7 trebles on the chain stitch of the last row which connects 7 bars 1 plain stitch on the 4th of the 7 trebles of the first row and repeat from picotsthe edges of most crochet work are ornamented with picots or small points of different shapes called severally close picots chain picots and lace picots close picots may be subdivided into large and small pointed and rounded picots with rounded leaves and picots with pointed leaves small rounded picotsthese may either be made separately and then sewn on or made at once on to a crochet border in the first case begin with 3 chain then coming back make 1 plain stitch on the second and on the first chain stitch in the second case make 1 chain take the needle out of the stitch and put it in from the right side

pattern illustration fig 438 plain crochet made after a tapestry pattern method for copying tapestry patterns in crochet work figs 437 and 438printed cross stitch and embroidery patterns can very well be copied in crochet work especially when they are in two colours only or rather are drawn in one colour on a plain ground the way in which such patterns are copied in crochet is by means of chain stitches and trebles which rising one above the other in rows form little squares for each square marked on the pattern you must count in the grounding 1 treble and 2 chain stitches in the solid parts 3 trebles the squares formed by the chain stitches should always begin and end with a treble when therefore a solid square comes between empty or foundation squares count 4 trebles for the solid square because the last treble of the last empty square touches the third treble of the solid one thus for 2 solid squares side by side count 7 trebles and for 3 squares 10 embroidery patterns worked in several colours can be reproduced in crochet either by trebles and rows worked one way only cutting off the thread at the end of each row or by plain stitches worked in rows to and fro when only three colours are used pass two threads under the stitches when more than two leave those which are not in use at the back of the work and only bring them to the front as they are wanted the thread you lay aside takes at the back the place of the one in use of course the threads not in use can only can be disposed of in this way when the work has a wrong side otherwise they must be passed underneath the stitches the colours should alternate in the order the pattern prescribes moreover the last stitch before you take another colour cannot be finished with the same thread you must pass the new thread through the last loop and draw it up with that illustration fig 439 crochet with soutache or lacet braid illustration fig 440 crochet with soutache or lacet braid materials coton

first stitch on one side of the square turn the thread round and draw it through here you must be careful to observe in the first instance that the second part which is now to be joined to the square should always remain on the left side of the square and secondly that the thread with which you join the two parts together should lie to the left and be drawn through from the wrong side to the right

beginning of each row are joined to those of the first stripe as the stitches of the 3rd are to those of the 2nd and so on when you have made sufficient big squares each consisting of 9 small ones border them with seven rows of plain stitches worked to and fro the 4 squares that form the corners are only to be bordered in this manner on two sides the squares along the straight edges on 3 sides and only those that are intended for the centre of the counterpane on all 4 sides the separate parts are then either sewn or crocheted together on the wrong side the dark squares are ornamented with small stars worked in the light colour the light ones with scallops in the dark colour for the small stars4 chain close the ring 2 plain on each stitch of the chain 8 plain in all after the 8th stitch

formed of chain stitches at regular distances from each other the scallops are worked from left to right fasten the thread on at the point where 4 squares touch then make a chain of 18 stitches and

of red cotton to form the fringe and knot them together with blue or if you prefer it you may finish off the coverlet with a hairpin fringe counterpane composed of squares and olive shaped figures fig 480there are many who shrink from undertaking a large piece of work because it becomes inconvenient to handle and carry about the counterpane here represented has the advantage of being made up of a number of quite little pieces which are worked separately and joined together afterwards two colours which can be clearly distinguished from each other in the engraving should be chosen from among the various combinations suggested one of them should be very light say cream or white for the olive shaped figures and squares and the other of some soft shade only darker for the connecting rows and the knotted fringe described in the chapter on macram the olive shaped figures begin with 9 chain stitches on which you make 8 plain stitches and on the 9th 3 plain for the corner on the second side of the chain 8 plain and 3 besides on the corner stitch and so on for 3 rows in the last row there should be 28 stitches these 3 rows are to be considered as one only 2nd row3 chain 1 treble on the plain

insertiondouble knots single picots and josephine picots tatting on account of a similarity in their construction a chapter on tatting seems to form a natural sequence to the one on crochet and is in some ways a preparation for that on macram which succeeds it the english name of tatting is said to be derived from tatters and to denote the frail disconnected character of the fabric by the italians it was formerly called occhi whilst in the east it still bears the name of makouk from the shuttle used in making it in the eighteenth century when tatting was in great vogue much larger shuttles than our present ones were used because of the voluminous materials they had to carry silk cord being one shuttlesthe tatting shuttle consists of two oval blades of either bone ivory mother of pearl or tortoiseshell pointed at both ends and joined together in the middle a good shuttle contributes materially to the rapid and perfect execution of the work and attention should be paid in its selection to the following particulars that it be not more than 7 cm long and 2 or 3 cm wide that the two ends be close enough to prevent the thread from protruding this is more especially important in tatting with two shuttles and lastly that the centre piece that joins the two oval blades together should have a hole bored in it large enough for the thread to pass through in filling the shuttle be careful not to wind on too much thread at once or the blades will gape open at the ends and the thread get soiled by constant contact with the workers hands materialsa strongly twisted thread such as fil dalsace dmc fil dentelle dmc or cordonnet 6 fils dmc is best for tatting we particularly recommend fil dalsace as forming the best shaped knots and picots a soft material such as coton tricoter dmc can also be used where it suits the purpose better illustration fig 486 first position of the hands first position of the hands fig 486the construction of the knots or stitches appears at first sight to present great difficulties but will be easily mastered by attention to the indications here given one thing to be constantly borne in mind is that when the right hand has passed the shuttle through the loop it must stop with a sudden jerk and hold the thread tightly extended until the left hand has drawn up the knot after filling the shuttle take the end of the thread between the thumb and forefinger of the left hand and the shuttle in the right pass the thread over the third and fourth fingers of the left hand bring it back towards the thumb and cross the two threads under the fingers as indicated in fig 486 pass the thread that comes from the shuttle round the little finger of the right hand and give the shuttle the direction shown in the engraving second and third position of the hands figs 487 and 488make the shuttle pass between the first and third fingers in the direction indicated by the arrow in fig 487 and bring it out behind the loop illustration fig 487 second position of the hands illustration fig 488 third position of the hands here the first difficulties for beginners arise and until they have sufficiently mastered the movements of both hands not to confuse them we advise them to pay careful attention to the following instructions as soon as you have put the shuttle through the loop place the right hand on the table with the thread tightly extended leaving the left hand perfectly passive then raising the third and fourth fingers of the left hand with the loop upon them pull up the loop stretching the thread tightly in so doing by extending the fingers by this movement a knot is formed the first part of the double knot which is the most common one in tatting remember that the right hand must be kept perfectly still as long as the left is in motion and that the knot must be formed of the loop thread that is in the left hand the right hand or shuttle thread must always be free to run through the knots if it were itself formed into knots it would not have the free play needed for loosening and tightening the loop on the left hand as required illustration fig 489 fourth position of the hands fourth position of the hands fig 489the second part of a knot is formed by the following movements pass the shuttle as indicated in fig 489 from left to right between the first and third fingers through the extended loop the right hand seizes the shuttle in front of the empty loop and extends the thread the left hand pulls up this second part of the knot as it did the first illustration fig 490 single or half knots small josephine picot illustration fig 491 single or half knots large josephine picot single or half knots josephine picots figs 490 and 491the josephine picot or purl as it is also called in tatting consists of a series of single or half knots formed of the first knot only these picots may be made of 4 or 5 knots as in fig 490 or of 10 or 12 knots as in fig 491 fifth position of the hands fig 492when the second knot forming the double knot has been made the two hands resume the position shown in fig 487 fig 492 reproduces the same and shows us a few finished knots as well illustration fig 492 fifth position of the hands illustration fig 493 position of the hands for making a picot position of the hands for making a picot fig 493picots are introduced into tatting patterns as they are into knitting and crochet they also serve to connect the different parts of a pattern together and render a great many pretty combinations feasible open and close picot figs 494 and 495these are formed of single knots leaving a loop on the extended thread as shown in fig 494 and a short length of thread between the knots finish the second half knot and when you have pulled it up join it to the preceding knot in this manner the picot represented in fig 495 is formed quite naturally illustration fig 494 open picot illustration fig 495 close picot in every kind of tatting the knot that comes after the picot is independent of the loop thus if the directions say 2 knots 1 picot 3 knots 1 picot 2 knots etc you must count the knot that served to form the loop and not make 2 knots 1 picot 4 knots etc to join the different rings ovals etc together by means of picots take up the thread that runs over the left hand with a crochet needle inserting it into the picot downwards from above draw the thread through and pull it up like any other knot illustration fig 496 tatting with two shuttles tatting with two shuttles fig 496two shuttles are used in tatting when the little rings are not to be connected together at the bottom by a thread when you want to hide the passage of the thread to another group of knots and when threads of several colours are used when you work with two shuttles tie the two threads together pass one thread over the third finger of the left hand wind it twice round the fourth finger and leave the shuttle hanging down pass the second shuttle into the right hand and make the same movements with it as you do in working with one shuttle only detached scallops fig 497make 12 double knots with one shuttle then tighten the thread so as to draw them together into a half ring the

cottons illustration macram stripearabic subject macram macram is an arabic word signifying an ornamental fringe or trimming which has been adopted as the term for a certain kind of handwork known also as knotted fringe or mexican lace and produced by the knotting interweaving and tying together of threads we have given the preference to the arabic name because of its less definite meaning seeing that not only fringe and lace but trimmings of all kinds in the shape of bands and stripes and headings can be worked in macram until its revival about ten years ago when it was regarded by many as a new invention the art of macram making had for centuries become almost extinct and save here and there in the convents was quite unknown the multitude of uses to which it can be turned as a trimming the infinite variety it admits of and its great durability and strength make macram well worth a study the difficulties that repel many at first sight are only on the surface and any one who carefully follows the instructions given in the following pages will soon overcome them and be able without pains to copy the charming designs that accompany them which remind us of the wooden lattices in the windows of eastern houses doubtless familiar to many of our readers under the name of moucharabieh materialsthese may be of almost any kind silk gold thread cord wool or cotton can all be employed with good effect almost any of the dmc cottons can be used for macram but the ones especially to be recommended are fil dentelle dmca cordonnet 6 fils dmca and coton broder dmca for the finer kinds of work and for the coarser fil pointer dmca coton tricoter dmca and ganse turque dmca the twist in all these is so regular as to admit of a high degree of perfection being attained with them they are moreover very agreeable to the touch a great recommendation considering how much they have to be handled by the worker illustration fig 513 macram cushion macram cushion and other accessories figs 513 and 514the only really important requisite for macram work is the cushion which should be well stuffed and weighted with lead fig 513 it is convenient to have it made to screw on to a table like the swiss tambour frames there are other kinds of macram cushions but none in our opinion as practical as these because any pattern can be worked upon them and patterns that have a heading or a border of picots can not be worked on any others the pegs at the ends of the cushion are for fixing and winding the long threads upon which carry the knots and which we shall in future call cords for making long lengths of macram fringe metal clamps with roundheaded pegs attached to them top and bottom to fasten the cords to as represented in fig 514 will be found far better than a cushion as any number of threads can be knotted on to them at a time by pushing them more or less closely together on the cord illustration fig 514 clamps for macram fringe besides the cushion and clamps you will require some big glassheaded pins made expressly for the purpose a crochet needle for pulling the threads through the stuff when they have to be knotted on to an edge and a french mtre or yard measure to measure the threads with to these implements may further be added scissors and a metal comb and ruler for cutting and straightening the ends of the threads the length of the threads must depend on their substance and size that is to say that a knot will take up more of a coarse stiff thread than of a fine pliable one on which account to avoid the necessity of preliminary trials the right length of thread for the quality and size of material is given with each pattern if for any reason our workers should not follow the directions given they must bear in mind that the thicker and stiffer the material the more they will have to allow for the knots and vice versa formation of the knotsbeginners must be careful in macram as in tatting not to move or slacken the cord or horizontal thread that carries the knots the knots made by the knottingthread as it will be called in future consist of loops formed over the cord and then tightened the knottingthread and the cord are constantly changing places as you work loops having to be made now with the one and now with the other illustration fig 515 knotting on the threads knotting on the threads fig 515excepting when you work with the threads of a material obtained by unravelling and drawing out the cross threads you must knot on lengths of thread on to a cord cut them double the length the fringe is to be and fold them in half so as to form a loop by means of which you attach them to the cord in the following manner put the loop over the cord from the front and bring it back underneath put the ends down through the loop detail a and tighten it detail b as shown in the engraving illustration fig 516 knotting on the threads on to a stuff edge and formation of a flat double knot knotting on the threads on to a stuff edge and formation of a flat double knot fig 516push your crochet needle through the edge of the stuff from the right to the wrong side and catch hold of the loop formed by the folding in half of the thread that is to be knotted on pull it out to the right side put the ends through and tighten the loop detail a detail b shows two double threads knotted on near to each other in this way and the first tying together of the two outer threads for the flat knot which is formed as follows you take the two outer of the four threads hanging down and cross the right hand one under and the left hand one over the two centre threads whilst doing this hold the inner ones tightly stretched out on the 3rd and 4th fingers of the left hand detail b the manner in which the two threads are brought back and tied together again is shown in detail c the drawing up of the threads completes the socalled flat double knot detail d detail e of the same figure shows two flat double knots side by side and the first step towards the formation of a third connecting together the two right threads of the one with the two left threads of the other illustration fig 517 knotting on threads onto a

519fasten the lengths of thread to the cushion with pins about half a cm apart fix the cord to one of the pegs at the left end of the cushion hold it tightly extended in a horizontal line with the right hand with the left hand knot the threads that are pinned down on to the cord looping each end twice round it upwards from below and then drawing it through between the two loops or knots thus formed pulling each knot to the left as you tighten it round the cord make the second row of knots in the same way taking care to lay the second cord as close to the first as possible that the vertical threads may not be visible between one series of knots forms a bar there are both horizontal and slanting bars as will be seen later on illustration fig 519 knotting on threads with round

collecting knots fig 530as explained in fig 525 these are flat double knots made over more than two threads the engraving shows in the first place on the left a flat double knot made over two threads completed and the first crossing of the thread for the collecting knot secondly the second crossing of the threads thirdly how the collecting knot can if necessary be continued over 4 threads and fourthly how the collecting knot should be made to finish with a flat double knot plaited and waved knots fig 531plaited knots are formed by a continuous repetition of the first crossing of the threads for making a flat knot detail a waved knots by a slight twist given to the plaited knots from left to right detail b these plaits of waved knots are secured by joining together the threads of opposite meshes two and two by a flat double knot illustration fig 529 flat double knots with half knots illustration fig 530 collecting knots single crossed knots and double crossed knots figs 532

knot all the white threads on the left of it and in the last place the cord itself over the 3 red threads make the same series of threads on the left this is succeeded by a second bar of white knots the last thread of which is left unknotted make 4 double knots with the 8 white threads and close the square by a double bar add a supplementary thread to the first bar so that you may have 10 threads coming from each side of the second bar and over these you knot the red threads which form a dark setting to the leaves illustration fig 600 gradual increase of the threads working detail of fig 599 when this is done on both sides make 10 flat double knots with a supplementary knot taking 4 single threads for each knot and decreasing the number of knots successively to 2 at the point of the inside square knot the white threads over the red ones and turn back the second white thread to serve as a cord to the first of the outside bars join the first thread on the left and the first on the right to form a flat knot with them in the middle the threads of which are then passed over the red threads the last white threads become the cords for the second outer bar make a group of bars with the red threads and cross them 3 times then finish with a handsome tassel and join the white threads together all round the square with tassels in the case of your wishing to use these squares for making a larger piece of work through joining several of them together you can knot the ends of the threads into short double chains finishing off these again with ring knots fig 608 and loops through these loops when you come to join on the next square the knotting thread is drawn forming them thus into connecting picots like those which you make in tatting fringe with corner figs 601 602 603macram fringes are not capable of being drawn up as knitted crochet and netted fringes are on the inside so as to turn the corners consequently according to the pattern a greater or less number of

and the list of colours of the dmc threads and cottons illustration insertion in embroidered nettingornament with various stitches netting netting is a handicraft so ancient that it would be difficult to trace it to its origin or determine the date of its invention there is evidence to show that the making of nets for fishing and game catching was as familiar to the earlier races of mankind as it is to us practised in the first instance for the wants of life it by degrees developed into an art in conjunction with embroidery to which it was made to serve as a foundation the netting of every country almost has a distinctive character of its own that of persia is known by its fine silken meshes and rich gold and silver embroidery that of italy by the varied size and shape of its meshes and a resemblance in the style of its embroidery to the punto tagliato whilst the netting of france known by the name of cluny guipure consists of a groundwork of fine meshes with stiff close designs embroidered upon it outlined in coarse glazed thread netting which divides itself under two headings netting proper or plain netting and net embroidery has never yet gone out of fashion and places are still to be found where the entire population is engaged in this industry plain netting and the implements used in netting figs 611 612 613plain netting consists of loops secured and rendered independent of one another by knots for forming and tightening these loops and knots the following implements are necessary in the first place a netting needle these are generally made of steel split and flattened at both ends with a hole bored through them below the fork at the one end in which the thread fig 611 is secured before it is wound on lengthwise between the forks they are numbered as to size like knitting needles there are netting needles likewise of bone ivory wood and tortoiseshell for twine and thick materials these are without hole fig 612 illustration fig 611 netting needle of steel illustration fig 612 netting needle of ivory the thread must be wound on very tightly and not too much of it at a time that the needle may slip easily through the loops the mesh or spool fig 613 whether of ivory bone steel or wood should be smooth and round and of the same thickness throughout so that the loops made upon it may be all of one size and easily slipped off illustration fig 613 mesh or spool of ivory for long loops a flat mesh is best and in all cases the needle and mesh should be selected with a view both to the material employed and the size of loop required in addition to these two implements a cushion weighted with lead will be required to pin the foundation loop to on which the first row of netting is worked materials suitable for nettingthese of course depend on the purpose of the netting silk twine wool and cotton can all be used and each possesses its advantages and disadvantages silk has the finest gloss but when it is strongly twisted it is very apt to knot and when loosely twisted does not make firm knots it is difficult to get linen thread with a smooth uniform twist and moreover it soon frays in the working wool is too elastic a fibre and is unsuitable for washing purposes cotton remains therefore in every respect the most desirable material being both smooth and uniformly twisted as qualities more especially adapted for netting we may mention the following fil pointer dmc cordonnet 6 fils dmc crochet cotton fil dentelle dmc lace thread and even coton tricoter dmca knitting cotton netting stitchesthe loops are always the samefourcornered whether they be square or oblongand connected together though secured and rendered independent of one another by knots by different ways of passing the thread over the mesh and connecting the loops together the following stitches are produced 1 plain loop 2 double loop 3 oblong loop 4 honeycomb loop 5 twisted loop illustration fig 614 first position of the hands 1 plain loop first position of the hands fig 614every kind of netting requires a foundation loop from 10 to 20 cm long made either of cordonnet 6 fils dmc nos 3 to 10 or fil pointer dmc no 10a which is pinned to the cushion fasten the working thread to the foundation loop then take the mesh in the left hand holding it between the thumb and forefinger with the other fingers extended beneath take the needle filled with thread in the right hand and pass the thread downwards over the mesh and over the second third and fourth fingers inside carry it up behind the third finger and lay it to the left under the thumb by which it has to be held fast illustration fig 615 second position of the hands second and third position of the hands figs 615 and 616carry the thread down behind the second third fourth and fifth fingers and put the needle through the loop on the fingers and behind the mesh through the foundation loop thus forming a second loop which you hold back with the little finger of the left hand then gradually drawing up the thread that runs from the mesh let go the loop held down by the thumb then by degrees let go also the loop which lies over the second third and fourth fingers still holding the last loop fast with the little finger finally you release this too and pull up the knot thus formed close to the mesh with the right hand this completes the stitch the next stitches are made in the same way whether they are to serve for casting on or for a netted foundation the mesh is drawn out at the end of each row the work turned and the mesh held beneath the last row in readiness for the next in making which you pass your needle through each loop these diamondshaped loops form a diagonal net illustration fig 616 third position of the hands 2 double loopto make a double loop put the thread two or three times round the mesh 3 oblong loopfor oblong loops the knots must be made a little distance from the mesh 4 honeycomb loopmake an oblong loop pass the thread round the fingers but not over the mesh as in plain netting put the needle not into the loop of the previous row but between the loop just made the knot which is made in the same way as in plain netting must be drawn close up to the mesh the two threads of the loop should lie side by side on the mesh the loops in honeycomb netting are sixsided 5 twisted loopspass the thread as in plain netting over the mesh and fingers but before letting the thread which is under the thumb go pass the needle from right to left under the loop you are making and the thread and only then draw up the knot although in netting the loops cannot be formed in as many different ways as in knitting or crochet they admit of a certain variety as the following explanations will show patterns produced in netting by using meshes of different widthsplain netting can be varied by making one row of loops over a large mesh and one over a small one or several rows over the large and several over the small alternately changing the meshes at regular intervals illustration fig 617 patterns produced in netting by increasing and decreasing patterns produced in netting by increasing and decreasing fig 617patterns of this kind are made by netting the meshes together in regular sequence and taking up as many meshes as you have netted together or vice versa you may increase and decrease in the same rows or at an interval of so many rows illustration fig 618 loose loops in clusters two sizes of thread should be used for this patterns to show the relation they should bear to one another we instance fil pointer dmc no 30 with fil dentelle dmc no 50a or coton tricoter dmc nos 14 and 30a with coton tricoter dmc no 50a or coton repriser dmc no 25 with no 100a begin by 3 rows of plain netting with the finer thread over the small mesh followed by one row with the coarser thread over the large mesh then with the coarse thread over the large mesh one row in which you net every two loops together and one row with two loops in every one so that the number of loops remains the same these are followed by 3 rows of plain netting with the fine thread on the small mesh illustration fig 619 loose loops in clusters working detail of fig 618 loose loops in clusters figs 618 and 619these clusters of loose loops are made in the following manner 1st rowone loop the knot of which must be a little distance from the mesh put the thread over the mesh and the needle through the loop where the knot is repeat this three or four times making the loops all of the same length then unite all the loops with one knot carrying the needle from right to left round the loops instead of putting it through the loop of the previous row 2nd rowmake one loop over each loop of the first row leaving out the loops that form the cluster as may be gathered from the drawing many different patterns can be worked upon the netting in this manner illustration fig 620 netting composed of plain double and oblong loops netting composed of plain double and oblong loops fig 620netting composed of large and small loops is the kind generally used as a groundwork for embroidery the loops of it are straight diamond netting will serve the same purpose but as it is less commonly used we have given the preference to the straight the whole first row consists of a double and a plain loop alternately the second entirely of oblong loops which are made by passing the thread only once over the mesh and so that in netting on the double loop the knot is brought close to the needle where as in netting the plain loop it hangs free so that as shown in fig 620 all the loops of the 2nd row are of the same length in the 3rd row which is like the first the plain loops should come between the small holes and the double ones between the large holes illustration fig 621 circular netting composed of long and short loops circular netting composed of long and short loops fig 621make thirty or thirty one loops over a large mesh with a very stout material such as fil pointer dmc no 20 or a double thread of cordonnet 6 fils dmc no 30 then draw up the thread on which the loops are strung as tightly as possible so as to form quite a small ring for the centre and fasten off for the next row also made in coarse thread fasten the thread on to a long loop and make one loop into each loop of the first row over a small mesh use the same mesh for all the subsequent rows which should be worked in a finer thread such as cordonnet 6 fils dmc no 50 or 60 if you want to avoid fastening on the thread afresh for each row make a loop over the thumb making loops over the thumbput the thread as for a plain loop over the mesh and fingers and put the needle through the loop likewise as for a plain loop but before tightening the knot draw the mesh out of the loop just made and make it exactly as long as the loop above illustration fig 622 circular netting formed by increases circular netting formed by increases fig 622make 10 loops on the foundation loop close the ring then go on making a row with one knot in the first loop and two knots in the second until the net attains the right circumference in the subsequent rows increase by one loop that is to say make two knots in each of the previous increases illustration fig 623 square of netting begun square of netting figs 623 and 624to make squares of netting with straight loops begin by making two loops or three knots make two knots in each of the following rows so that each row is increased by one loop continue to increase until you have one loop more than the square should number illustration fig 624 square of netting completed following this row with the extra stitch make a row without either increase or intake and begin the intakes in the next row joining the two last loops of each row together by a knot finish the two last loops over the thumb illustration fig 625 square of netting begun from the middle begun illustration fig 626 square of netting begun from the middle completed square of netting begun from the middle figs 625 and 626instead of beginning a square from the corner in the manner just described it may be begun from the middle illustration fig 627 stripe of straight netting edged with empty loops cast on the required number of loops make an intake in each row by omitting to take up the last loop of a row in coming back your first knot will thus be made over the last loop but one of the previous row fig 625 to complete the square fasten the thread on again to the end of the thread of the last row then make a similar to it and repeat the same rows you made at the beginning see fig 626 illustration fig 628 stripe of straight netting stripes of straight netting figs 627 and 628these can be begun and finished in two ways the simplest way more especially when they are to be embroidered afterwards is to cast on the necessary number of loops to decrease on one side by dropping a loop fig 627 or by joining two loops together with a knot fig 628 and to increase on the other side by making two knots over one loop great care must be taken not to change the order of the intakes and increases as any mistake of the kind would break the lines of squares and interfere with the subsequent embroidery unless there happened to be more loops in the stripe than stitches in the pattern in which case the superfluous loops might be cut away when the embroidery is finished straight netting with a scalloped edge fig 629the second way of making stripes of straight netting is to begin by a square after making two loops on the foundation loop make rows with increases until you have the required number of loops then make an increase in every row to the left and leave the last loop empty in every row to the right continuing the increases on the left you net 4 rows without increasing or decreasing on the right whilst in the next 4 you again leave the outside loop empty illustration fig 629 straight netting with a scalloped edge square frame of netting fig 630handkerchief counterpane and chairback borders can be netted in one piece leaving an empty square in the centre after casting on the loops as for an ordinary square of netting letter a increase them to double the number required for the border thus for example if the border is to consist of 3 squares you make 6 loops then leave 3 loops empty on the left and continue to work to the right and decrease to the left up to the dotted line from c to c after this you begin to decrease on the right and increase on the left up to the dotted line from e to e illustration fig 630 square frame of netting leaving the right side of the net you now fasten on the thread at c where the 3 empty loops are and here you make your increases on the right side and your intakes on the left till you come to the corner from whence you decrease on the right and increase on the left up to letter g stop on the left side and then work from left to right passing over the row that is marked e the fourth corner letter b is worked like any other piece of straight netting with an intake in each row until there are only two loops left illustration fig 631

or coton repriser dmc nos 12 to 50a diagonal netting with crossed loops figs 631 and 632 to work this simple and effective pattern begin by making a stripe of plain netting 14 loops in width for the middle when it is long enough for your purpose take up all the loops on one side on a strong thread fasten the work to the cushion again and work 3 rows along the other edge in the following manner 1st rowlong loops to be made by the thread being passed thrice over the mesh 2nd rowhere 3 loops are so made as to cross each other that is you begin by putting your nettingneedle at first into the 3rd loop counting from left to right then into the 1st and lastly into the middle one of the three so that the right loop leans to the left and the left one to the right 3rd rowone plain loop in each of the loops of the previous row you now draw out the thread run in on the other side and run it in through the loops last made in order to make 3 rows again as above described on the bottom side illustration fig 632 working detail of fig 631 when this is done you begin the scallops composed of 12 knots or 11 loops or 14 loops and 15 knots net 5 rows leaving the outside loops empty fig 632 stop on the left and proceed with 6 knots or 5 plain loops 2 or 3 long loops with 3 overs 3 plain loops turn the work 3 plain loops 3 knots turn the work 2 loops with 3 overs 3 knots turn the work 2 plain loops 2 knots turn the work cross 2 or 3 loops according to the number you crossed in the middle then carry the working thread to the middle of the long loops and connect them by 2 knots pass the needle under the knot of the last long loop then on the right side net 3 plain loops turn the work 3 plain loops 3 knots turn the work 2 plain loops 2 knots turn the work and continue the rows of plain netting until you have only 2 loops left to reach the next scallop pass the nettingneedle through each hole of the net and round each thread finish off the scallops with a row of plain netting made with a coarser thread than the foundation illustration fig 633 netted fringe materialsfor the netting cordonnet 6 fils dmc nos 10 to 30 or fil pointer dmc no 30a for the fringes soutache dmc no 3 or lacets superfins dmc no 4a these netted edgings are generally made in unbleached cotton because the patterns afterwards embroidered upon them in coarse white knitting or darning cotton show best upon it the thread for this purpose should be used double and the pattern worked in darning stitches made over 8 squares of the netting the 8th knot is then encircled by a loop and the thread carried down over 8 squares and a loop again made round the 8th knot after making 4 rows of stitches on the netting cut 3 bars between the rows of white stitches the row of openwork produced in this way has a very good effect and greatly improves the look of the lace netted fringe fig 633plain netting pretty as it is looks rather poor unless ornamented with embroidery of some kind the double netting illustrated in fig 633 will prove a welcome novelty the footing is worked in crochet with braid secured on both sides by chain stitches into every fourth of these chain stitches net one loop missing the 3 between at the end of the row turn the work and make the knot in the middle of the 3 chain stitches so that the 2 loops of netting cross each other in the second or rather the third row the knots are again made first into the front loops into those of the first row that is in the fourth row into those of the second row when the stripe is sufficiently wide finish it off with tassels made of soutache dmc no 3 instead of tying up the lengths of braid with a thread twisted round them and fastened off with a stitch make 2 looped knots round them with an end of the braid where the neck of the tassel should come illustration fig 634 wire frame for embroidered netting embroidered nettingembroidered netting also known as filet guipure cluny guipure and richelieu guipure is a netted ground with patterns of one kind or another worked upon it in a variety of stitches implements required for embroidered nettingbesides scissors needles and thread a light steel frame is the only thing required and this renders embroidered netting very popular the needles should be long and blunt those called saddlers needles are the best wire frame for embroidered netting fig 634the frame on which the net is stretched should be made of strong iron wire that will not bend in the using in shape it may be square or oblong according to whether squares or edgings are to be made upon it but the sides must be straight so that the net can be evenly stretched illustration fig 635 mounting the netting on the frame this wire frame must be covered first with wadding or tow as shown in fig 634 and then with silk ribbon which must be wound tightly round it and more particularly at the corners very closely so that it may be quite firm and not twist about when the netting is sewn in the ends of the ribbon should be secured by two or three stitches illustration fig 636 mounting the netting on the frame with an auxiliary tape mounting the netting on the frame fig 635when the netting is exactly the size of the inside of the frame it need only be secured to it with overcasting stitches set very closely at the corners mounting the netting on the frame with an auxiliary tape fig 636when the netting is smaller the space between it and the frame must be filled up with strong very evenly woven linen tape sewn on all round the netting the tape must be very tightly held in the sewing so that it even forms little gathers all round this will help you to stretch the netting in mounting it without injuring it and is especially necessary when the netting is not quite evenly made fig 636 shows how the tape is sewn on the fold that has to be made at the corners and the way to fix the netting into the frame long stripes or large pieces of work can be mounted on waxcloth but we cannot recommend shortening the preparatory work in this manner as the squares of netting are never so regular as when they are made in a frame materials for embroidered nettingthick threads with a strong twist are the best for darned or embroidered netting such as cordonnet 6 fils dmca crochet cotton or fil dentelle dmca lace thread there are however certain old kinds of embroidered netting made in soft loose silk for imitating which it is best to use coton repriser dmca that being quite the best substitute for the original material the stitches used for embroidered nettingthese are so multifarious and admit of so many different combinations that not a few of them seeing that be quite new to our readers willsome we have never yet come across in any book on the subject that has come under our notice ordinary darning stitch fig 637the simplest stitch of all for covering a netted ground is the ordinary darning stitch drawing the thread that is to say in and out of the number of squares prescribed by the pattern and backwards and forwards as many times as is necessary to fill them up illustration fig 637 ordinary darning stitch illustration fig 638 linen stitch first stitches the number of stitches depends to a certain extent on the material employed with coton broder dmc for example you will have to make more stitches than with one of the coarser numbers of coton repriser dmc this is the stitch generally used for reproducing a cross stitch pattern on a netted ground and is especially to be recommended for covering large surfaces curtains counterpanes and so forth as it is quickly done and shows up the pattern well illustration fig 639 linen stitch second stitches illustration fig 640 linen stitch formation of the corners linen stitch figs 638 and 639this is the stitch most often met with in the old embroideries it being the one the solid parts of the leaves and flowers and the borders are generally worked in fasten on the thread to a knot of the netting and carry it twice to and fro over and under the threads of the netting so that at the end of the row every second thread passes under and over the thread of the netting as it is carried upwards again this constitutes the first layer of threads the second completes the linen stitch and is made in the same way only across the first alternately taking up and missing a thread as is done in darning the thread may also be carried both ways over the threads of the squares in this case you must draw an uneven number of threads through the squares otherwise the crossing of the threads will be irregular in the last square linen stitch formation of the corners fig 640when linen stitch is used for the border of a pattern and a corner has to be formed you begin by carrying the threads over a given number of squares this first layer especially in the case of long stripes must be kept very slack and to ensure the threads being all of the same length lay a fine mesh or a thick knitting needle at one end and stretch the threads over it after carrying the second layer across a few squares take away the mesh or needle the threads of the first layer become gradually shorter from the passage of the cross threads in and out between them and end by being just long enough to prevent the last embroidered squares from being too tightly stretched on reaching the corner you cross the threads of the next row as shown in fig 640 the first threads of the second side form the foundation of the corner square from the second corner square you pass to the third from the third to the fourth carrying your thread alternately over and under the threads that were stretched for the first corner loop stitch point desprit figs 641 and 642this is a light open stitch chiefly used for making a less transparent foundation than plain netting fasten the thread to the middle of one bar of the netting then make a loose loop to the middle of the top bar of the same square fig 641 by carrying the thread from left to right over one vertical and one horizontal bar of the net and inserting the needle downwards from above under the bar and in front of the working thread for the second row back also represented in fig 641 you draw the needle through underneath the bar above the loop stitch and make the loop upwards from below in doing this the working thread must lie to the left in front of the needle fig 642 shows how to join the rows and pass the needle through the stitches of the preceding row illustration fig 641 loop stitch 1st and 2nd course of the thread illustration fig 642 loop stitch several rows completed illustration fig 643 star formed of loose threads laying the underneath threads illustration fig 644 star formed of loose threads laying the upper threads star composed of loose threads figs 643 644 645this star covers 16 squares of netting fasten the thread to the middle knot of the 16 squares then carry it diagonally over 4 squares three times from left to right under a knot of the foundation and three times from right to left in this way the bottom rays of the star are formed for the stitches that complete the figure you start from the middle and following the direction of the little arrow in the illustration you cover the netting with 3 horizontal and 3 vertical threads carried over 4 squares when you have laid the vertical threads slip the needle 4 or 5 times round in a circle under the diagonal and over the straight threads but always over the bars of the netting this completes the star as it is represented in fig 645 care must be taken to make the stitches lie quite flat side by side and not one on the top of the other illustration fig 645 star formed of loose threads finished darning stitch point de reprise figs 646 and 647little flowers and leaves are generally executed in this stitch the first course of the thread is shown in fig 646 leaves can be made with one two or three veins carry the needle invariably from the middle first to the right and then to the left under the threads of the foundation and push the stitches close together as they are made with the point of your needle this you will be able to do most easily by holding the work so as to make the stitches towards you illustration fig 646 leaves worked in darning stitch begun illustration fig 647 leaves worked in darning stitch completed for a leaf with only one division or vein like the left leaf in fig 646 merely run the needle through the middle of the threads whereas for a leaf with two or three veins you must run it over and under either one or two threads see the right leaf in fig 646 in working leaves of this kind in darning stitch you must draw your stitches at the top and bottom of the leaf rather tighter than in the middle so as to give them the proper shape if you wish to make them very slender at the bottom you can finish them off with a few overcasting stitches fig 647 represents two leaves completed one with one vein and the other with two pointed scallops in darning stitch fig 648the simplest way to work these scallops is to carry a thread as shown in the illustration to and fro over the square from the knot in one corner to the middle of the bar above and downwards to the opposite knot round which the thread is carried and passed upwards again to the middle as the scallop must always be begun from the top you will have two foundation threads on one side and three on the other here likewise you must push the threads as closely together as possible with the needle illustration fig 648 pointed scallops in darning stitch illustration fig 649 pointed scallops in buttonhole stitch pointed scallops in buttonhole stitch fig 649another quite as pretty and easy way of working pointed scallops on a netted foundation is by making two buttonhole stitches before crossing to the opposite side as shown in the foregoing illustration you begin by stretching single or double foundation threads across then beginning at the point you make alternately right and left 2 buttonhole stitches over the foundation threads so that the working thread is only carried across to the opposite side after every second stitch veined pointed scallops fig 650a third way of making pointed scallops is by first stretching a thread to and fro across the middle of the square after which you slip the needle from left to right under the middle thread and underneath the left bar from above then you carry the needle from right to left over the foundation thread and under the right bar and so on the one thread must be drawn tightly round the other in order that the stitches may form close and evenly shaped veins like small cords on the wrong side of the scallop there must be enough stitches to completely cover the foundation thread that crosses the middle of the square illustration fig 650 veined pointed scallops illustration fig 651 pointed scallops in venetian stitch pointed scallops in venetian stitch fig 651the prettiest scallops of all are those worked in venetian stitch you begin by making from 8 to 10 buttonhole stitches over one bar of the netting then you work on with the same stitch backwards and forwards making one stitch less in each row until you come to the one which forms the point of the scallop and is fastened to the bar above you carry the working thread back on the wrong side to the lower bar and then under the buttonhole stitches to the next square of the netting scallops worked in this manner can be overcast round the edges in the way described further on in fig 660 wheels embroidered on netting figs 652 and 653to make wheels or spiders as they are also called you have first to fasten the thread to the middle knot of four squares thence you carry it diagonally right and left fig 652 right detail across the empty squares of netting and the knot and return to the middle overcasting your first thread by the way so as to form a closely twisted cord this is called cording a thread having reached the centre carry the working thread round and round under and over the corded threads and under the bars of the netting till the wheel covers half the bars illustration fig 652 laying the threads for a wheel and beginning of the wheel illustration fig 653 wheels worked in two ways fig 653 shows on the right a finished wheel and on the left another way in which it can be made and indicates the course of the thread over and under the lines as in a darn these details show also how when the foundation thread of the wheel starts from a corner it is left single in the first square until the wheel is finished then the needle is slipped back along the little spoke opposite to the single thread and through the wheel and the single thread is corded like the others illustration fig 654 ribbed wheels illustration fig 655 ribbed squares or lozenges ribbed wheels fig 654make the foundation of the wheels as before over 8 threads to form the ribs at the back of the wheels see fig 654 make a back stitch on the right side over a bar of the netting and carry on the needle under one bar so that the thread that lies outside always crosses 2 bars of the netting in this case you must make circles of thread enough to cover the bars completely not half as before the same stitches as fig 654 shows can be made on either side of the embroidery and so as to form either a square or a lozenge see fig 655 illustration fig 656 wheels set with buttonholing wheels set with buttonholing fig 656a very pretty lacelike effect is produced by encircling the wheels in large squares of netting with a double setting of stitches the left detail of fig 656 shows how the thread having been passed under the wheel and twisted once round the single thread is carried all round the square and forms 8 loops the arrow shows the way in which the loops are taken up and the first ring of stitches round the wheel is finished the second detail of the same figure explains the course the thread that forms the second ring has to take through the loops and between the bars whilst the white line shows the passage of the thread over the second ring the third detail represents a wheel completed illustration fig 657 star with onesided buttonhole stitches star with onesided buttonhole stitches fig 657the pattern represented in fig 657 is the quickest to work that we know of two buttonhole stitches made upon the outside bar of a square and a simple crossing of the thread at the bottom produce elongated triangles which should always be begun from the knot two triangles stand exactly opposite to each other in one square and the square that comes in the middle of the four thus filled is ornamented with a small wheel illustration fig 658 rounded corners on netting illustration fig 659 linen stitch set with darning stitch illustration fig 660 linen stitch set with cord stitch rounded corners of netting fig 658darning stitches made over a thread carried diagonally across one square and the adjacent corners of that and two other squares produce the figure illustrated in fig 658 the accompanying detail shows the mode of working the number of stitches depends on the material you use there should be no more than can lie quite flat side by side on the diagonal thread linen stitch set with darning stitch fig 659there are some patterns it would hardly be possible to work on netting unless you could soften the outlines by darning stitches as shown in the foregoing figure when employed as a setting to linen stitch there should be fewer than in fig 658 you may also instead of interrupting them at every corner carry them all round a square see the right detail of the figure linen stitch set with cord stitch fig 660many figures are also either corded or edged with twisted thread both ways are represented in the illustration in the latter case you can use the same thread as for the linen stitch or if you wish the setting to be very pronounced a thicker one for instance if the netting be made of cordonnet 6 fils dmc no 25a we recommend fil pointer dmc no 15 or 20a for the setting this difference of material is especially noticeable in the old cluny guipure where the figures worked in linen stitch are edged with a thread like a cord but if the linen stitch be bound with cord stitch the same thread must be used for it as for the foundation a soft material like coton repriser makes the best padding for the overcasting stitches illustration fig 661 flower in dot stitch on a foundation of linen stitch flower in dot stitch on a foundation of linen stitch fig 661with the help of this stitch which is described in the chapter on white embroidery and represented in fig 179 a great variety of little supplementary ornaments can be made on every description of netted ground illustration fig 662 bordering in buttonhole stitch bordering in buttonhole stitch fig 662scalloped edges in netting should be buttonholed 2 or 3 padding threads should be run in first following the bars of the netting over which the buttonholing is done the bars of the netting must not be cut away until the edge be finished cut work in embroidered netting fig 663cut work here means half covering the bars of the netting with buttonhole stitches and half cutting them away with scissors the inner bars are frequently ornamented with a double buttonhole edging and knotted picots see figs 698 and 699 in the next chapter you slightly separate the stitches of the first row of buttonholing so as to be able to introduce the thread of the second row between them illustration fig 663 cut work in embroidered netting illustration fig 664 straight loop stitch straight loop stitch fig 664in the first row you carry the thread over one bar and slip it through behind a knot in the second you do the same thing only that above your needle will pass under 3 threads two of them the threads of the loop of the first row and the third a bar of the net in every square 4 threads cross each other illustration fig 665 waved stitch waved stitch fig 665this stitch which forms a close waved ground is produced by passing the thread in each row of the netting over a square and behind a knot when the pattern admits of it as it mostly does a considerably thicker thread is used for this stitch and for the stitches represented in figs 667 668 669 and 670 than that in which the netting is made when the netted ground is of fil dentelle dmc no 50a the embroidery upon it may very well be done in cordonnet 6 fils dmc no 10a or fil pointer dmc no

stitches one set of threads running over the stitches and under the knots of the netting the other under the first and second threads of the loop stitches and over the first crossed threads and the knots the laying and stretching of these threads must it is hardly necessary to say be systematically and regularly done illustration fig 666 intersected loop stitch ground worked in horizontal lines

the first row as is shown in our engraving ground worked in stitches placed one above the other fig 668cover a whole row of squares with cross stitches and leave 3 rows of squares empty when you have a sufficient number of rows of cross stitches take a long needle and pass it upwards from below and from right to left under the two bars of the third upper square then pass downwards to the first square of the 3 bottom rows and under the bars from right to left so as again to leave 3 squares between the fresh stitches the next row of stitches is made in the same manner so that the stitches are not only set contrary ways but reciprocally cover each other latticed ground fig 669begin by running the thread to and fro under two vertical bars and over three horizontal ones when the ground is entirely covered carry your thread from right to left under the bars over which the first rows of threads are crossed then take it over the long crosses that correspond to 5 squares of netting and pass it in the same line under the bars of the netting in coming back the long stitches cross each other over the stitches of the first rows illustration fig 667 ground worked in horizontal lines

so on the stitches of the next rows are made in the same manner you have only to see that the loops formed by the stitches all come on the same line of knots ground worked in two sizes of thread fig 671herewith begins the series of stitches referred to at the beginning of the chapter copied in part from one of the oldest and most curious pieces of embroidered netting we have ever met with the copies were worked with cordonnet 6 fils dmc no 25 and cru fil dentelle dmc no 70a the former being used for the darning and the almondshaped stitches between the latter for the buttonhole stitches wherever two sizes of thread are used for one pattern all the stitches in the coarse thread should be put in first and those in the fine last illustration fig 671 ground worked in two sizes of thread ground with wheels and loop stitch fig 672you begin with the coarse thread and finish all the wheels first making them each over 4 threads of the netting then with the fine thread you make loop stitches between them in rows as shown in figs 641 and 642 ground worked in darning and loop stitch fig 673the darning stitches are made in the coarse thread over 4 squares of the netting in a horizontal direction with loop stitches in the fine thread made between them over the same number of squares illustration fig 672 ground with wheels and loop stitch ground worked in two sizes of thread fig 674carry the coarse thread from right to left under the first knot of the netting and then under the next from left to right this has to be done twice to and fro so that the squares of the netting are edged on both sides with a double layer of threads when the whole foundation has been thus covered take the fine thread and make loop stitches in the squares between the other rows of stitches passing the needle for that purpose over the double stitch lastly intersect the loop stitches with straight threads and pass the needle each time through the knot of the netting illustration fig 673 ground worked in darning and loop stitch illustration fig 674 ground worked in two sizes of thread illustration fig 675 ground worked with cross stitches in one size of thread ground worked with cross stitches in one size of thread fig 675this pattern very like the foregoing one consists of 3 diagonal rows of stitches worked to and fro with cross stitches made over them you may also begin with the cross stitches in the fine thread and work the triple stitches over them in the coarse ground worked with darning and cord stitches fig 676patterns executed chiefly in darning stitches in a comparatively coarse thread present a closer and heavier appearance than those we have been describing here every other square of the netting is filled as closely as possible with stitches the empty squares between are intersected diagonally with corded threads illustration fig 676 ground worked with darning and cord stitches illustration fig 677 ground worked with squares and wheels illustration fig 678 ground worked with squares and wheels ground worked with squares and wheels figs 677 678 679a ground very often met with in old embroidered netting consists of diagonal lines of squares closely filled with darning stitches alternating with diagonal lines of squares each with a small wheel in the middle in fig 678 the darning stitches and the wheels which are both worked with the same material cover 4 squares of the netting larger expanses of netting may also be entirely filled with wheels fig 679 to make a really satisfactory grounding of this kind you should be careful always to carry your thread over the bars of the netting and under the threads that are stretched diagonally across ground worked in cross and darning stitch fig 680you begin as before by making the close darning stitches and then proceed to the cross stitches to give them the right shape finish all the rows of stitches one way first in the subsequent rows that cross the first ones you introduce the thread between the stitches that were first crossed illustration fig 679 ground with large wheels ground of geometrical figures fig 681this pattern quite different from all the others consists of simple geometrical lines fasten the thread to a knot of the netting then carry it always diagonally under 3 other knots and repeat this 3 times after which carry it once round the bar of the netting to fasten it and back again to the knot which it already encircles and from thence begin a new square owing to your having always to bring the thread back to the knot whence the next square is to begin you will have 4 threads on two of the sides and 6 on the two others illustration fig 680 ground worked in cross and darning stitch in the second and subsequent rows the needle has to pass twice under the angles that were first formed in order that over the whole surface all the corners may be equally covered and connected netted insertion worked in plain darning stitch fig 682the taste for ornamenting not only curtains but bed and table linen also with lace and insertion of all kinds to break the monotony of the large white surfaces is becoming more and more general and the insertion here described will be welcome to such of our readers as have neither time nor patience for work of a more elaborate nature the way to make straight netting has already been fully described in figs 625 626 627 628 629 and 630 and darning stitch in fig 637 to those who wish to be saved the trouble of making the netting themselves we can strongly recommend various fabrics intended to take its place more especially filet canevas which is an exact imitation of the finest handmade netting the centre part of the pattern in fig 682 is worked in rows of horizontal darning stitches the narrow

embroidered fig 683we have already had occasion in the foregoing explanations to point out the advantage of embroidering with two sizes of thread but it is only in a piece of work of a certain size that it is possible really to judge of the excellent effect produced by the use of two threads of different sizes the principal lines of the pattern which are in darning stitch are worked in a very coarse thread with a strong twist fil pointer dmc whilst the loop stitches are in cordonnet 6 fils dmc our model was worked in cru thread but there is nothing to prevent several colours being

to be arranged with some system fig 685 represents a lace edging intended for the square fig 684 which shows how even in such a simple pattern as this several colours may be successfully introduced fig 686 is a handsomer and more elaborate pattern for the same kind of purpose the loop stitches and the linen stitches should be worked in a very light shade instead of the colour indicated at the

a coarser thread than the ground then raised wheels buttonholed bars with picots in the centre plain wheels very close together and long ribbed bars worked in darning stitch the edging to match the square is worked in the original in pale shades in contrast to the square which is executed entirely in cru thread the squares in the netted footing of the lace are loosely overcast with pale violetmauve 316 the same colour is also used for the wheels in the outside edge each of which fills a square and for the loop stitches round them whilst the middle one of the three upper ribbed wheels and the star are worked in dark violetmauve 315 the crosses in linen stitch the three lower ribbed wheels and the long ribbed bars in darning stitch are in gristilleul 392 netted insertion fig 691this is a copy of a beautiful piece of embroidered netting to all appearance several centuries old and in a state that rendered even the most delicate handling almost impossible after several experiments the best result has been arrived at and the turkish cord in which the original is made has now been manufactured for netting purposes as well as for other kinds of decorative work already alluded to and referred to again later on the first foundation that is the actual netting for a thing of this kind should be made in white or cru thread with very small meshes the pattern itself is embroidered on the netting with ganse turque dmc no 12 this material cru and gold mixed gives the work a glittering and peculiarly elegant appearance unobtainable in any other the execution is extremely easy it being worked entirely in darning stitch but the drawing should be copied with great accuracy and the wide braid very carefully sewn on with close stitches round the squares which are filled in with darning stitches made in ganse turque no 12 any netting pattern can be copied in this braid and the simplest piece of work of the kind is worth mounting on a rich foundation of silk brocade velvet or plush to give a single example the insertion here described and illustrated was mounted on slateblue plush and has been universally admired footnotes a see at the end of the concluding chapter the table of numbers and sizes and the list of colours of the dmc threads and cottons illustration insertionirish lace with raised ornaments irish lace irish lace also known under the name of renaissance lace from its having been first made in the sixteenth century is an imitation of the earliest pillow laces it ought properly speaking to be called french lace having been invented in france and thence introduced into england and ireland it is composed of braid or tape formed into figures joined together by needlemade corded or buttonhole bars and fillings of different kinds or by bars alone the lace stitches and bars are almost the same as those used in fine venetian point but they are executed in a coarser material so that this section of our work may be considered as a preparation for the different kinds of lace to be described in the next chapter materials fig 692the braids used for making irish lace are an english speciality and manufactured exclusively in england they are very various in shade width and thickness and are to be had white unbleached grey and pale yellow narrow and wide coarse and fine in texture with and without holes open edge and picots with large medallions and small fig 692 represents the kinds most commonly used in their original size together with a specimen picot or purl as they are called in england for the outside edge also to be had ready made for those who do not care for the trouble of making them themselves for the stitches and bars by which the braids are joined together the best material is fil dentelle dmca lace thread a smooth even thread now made in every colour to match the braids illustration fig 692 patterns of the different tapes and braids used for irish lace transferring designs for irish lacethe best way is to trace them on oiled tracing linen with a watery ink free from greasy matter this tracing linen which is of english make is white glazed on one side only the unglazed surface should be turned uppermost as it takes the ink better as this tracing linen is quite transparent the pattern can be transferred to it at once without recourse to any other process it will be found less trying for the eyes to lay a piece of transparent coloured paper or stuff under the pattern whilst you are copying it the irish lace designs are almost all drawn with double lines between which the braid is tacked on with small back stitches we may mention at once that it is advisable to make the stitches longer on the right side than on the other or at any rate to make them of the same length tacking down and gathering in the braids fig 693where the lines of the pattern describe a curve or a circle the outside edge of the braid as shown in fig 693 must be sewn down firmly so as to form little folds or gathers on the inside edge which are first tacked down and then gathered in with small overcasting stitches in fine thread so as to fit exactly to the pattern illustration fig 693 tacking down and drawing in the braids the stitches made for the bars and the fillings must never be drawn so tightly as to drag out the edges of the braids and thus spoil the outlines of the pattern nor should the stitches be caught into the tracing cloth but only rest upon it when the embroidery is finished turn the work the wrong side up cut every second or third tacking stitch and pull the threads carefully out from the wrong side when the lace will separate itself from the backing without difficulty it has then to be damped and ironed also on the wrong side see the concluding chapter on the different processes for finishing off needlework it is of no consequence which are made first the bars or the fillings we however incline to the former more especially in the case of buttonhole bars as they are easier to do than the fillings and once done there is less risk of puckering or drawing the edges together in making the fillings the stitcheswe shall now proceed to describe a series of bars and stitches which if carefully studied will serve as a preparation for making all the finer kinds of laces described in the ensuing chapter without pretending to have exhausted the infinite variety of lace stitches that exists we hope to have brought before our readers notice a sufficiently numerous selection to satisfy all tastes and capacities with regard to the names the same stitches are known by so many different ones that excepting in the case of those universally accepted we have disregarded them altogether and merely numbered the stitches in their order illustration fig 694 plain twisted bar plain twisted bar fig 694secure the thread to the braid and throw it across from one braid edge to the other put the needle in downwards from above and overcast the first thread so as to form the two into a cord if you do not make enough overcasting stitches to tighten the two threads the bars will be loose and untidy and spoil the general appearance of the work illustration fig 695 double twisted bar double twisted bar fig 695throw three foundation threads across the space to be filled and overcast them loosely so that they remain visible between the stitches plain buttonhole bar fig 696throw three threads across and cover them with buttonhole stitches made from right to left in making this and the subsequent bars we recommend turning the needle round and holding it as it were the reverse way so that the eye not the point passes first under the threads strange as it may seem it is easier in this manner to avoid splitting the threads the working thread should always issue from the edge of the braid one or two threads before the foundation threads of the bar to prevent the bars being of unequal width or getting twisted at the beginning buttonhole bars with pinned picots figs 697 and 698 after covering half or a third of the bar with buttonhole stitches pass the thread without making a loop under the foundation threads and fasten the loop with a pin fig 697 then slip the needle horizontally from right to left under the 3 threads and tighten the knot close to the last buttonhole stitch illustration fig 696 plain buttonhole bar illustration fig 697 buttonhole bar with pinned picots illustration fig 698 buttonhole bar with pinned picots illustration fig 699 bar with lace picot fig 698 shows a picot made in the same manner but with several buttonhole stitches inserted between the loop and the buttonholed bar bar with lace picot fig 699here the picot is made by bringing the thread out through the loop and beginning the buttonhole stitches 4 or 5 in number according to the size of the thread quite close to the pin so that they entirely cover the loop the pin must be stuck in the width of 4 stitches distant from the bar and the foundation threads should be completely hidden under the bar bar with picot made in bullion stitch fig 700put the needle halfway into the last buttonhole stitch twist the thread ten or twelve times round it from left to right draw it through and tighten the thread so that the spiral on the thread form a semicircle then continue the bar see also for the bullion stitch figs 179 and 661 bar with buttonhole picot fig 701cover rather more than half the bar with buttonhole stitches carry the thread three times to the 6th stitch and back then buttonhole these threads that are attached to the bar in the same way as the bar itself and finish the bar in the usual way these buttonhole picots are generally used for edging lace they may in their turn be adorned with small pinned picots to produce a richer effect illustration fig 700 bar with picot made in bullion stitch illustration fig 701 bar with buttonhole picot illustration fig 702 bar with two rows of knots bar with two rows of knots fig 702over two foundation threads make double knots far enough apart to leave room for the knots of the next row between these double knots consist in the first place of one plain buttonhole stitch and then one reversed that is made by bringing the needle out in front of the thread and passing it under the loop the result being that the thread will lie behind the thread and not before it as in an ordinary buttonhole stitch illustration fig 703 branched bars branched bars fig 703where you have a larger surface to cover with bars you are generally obliged to make them with branches for this purpose you prepare the threads as for an ordinary bar and cover them halfway with buttonhole stitches then you carry on the foundation thread to the next bar buttonhole it also halfway lay the next foundation thread and finally buttonhole all the halfcovered bars till you reach the dotted line from whence you lay the last foundation threads the last bar is worked over 2 or 4 threads so that the working thread can be taken back to the edge of the braid by means of the last buttonhole stitches illustration fig 704 plain russian stitch plain russian stitch fig 704stitches of all kinds can be used as well as bars for joining braids together that run parallel to each other and for filling up the spaces between these stitches which serve as an insertion are some of them very elementary whilst others require great skill and patience to execute the simplest of all is the russian stitch which bears a great resemblance to the crossed stitch shown in fig 39 and the crossed backstitch fig 176 you pass the needle from left to right under the edge of the braid then again from right to left under the opposite edge taking care always to leave the thread in front of the needle illustration fig 705 twisted russian stitch twisted russian stitch fig 705instead of passing the needle behind the thread pass it before it and round it so that the needle always comes out again beneath the thread which will then be twice twisted illustration fig 706 column stitch column stitch fig 706at the bottom the stitch is made like the plain russian stitch and at the top like the one in fig 705 with the difference that the second thread is passed three times round the first illustration fig 707 insertion of single buttonhole stitches illustration fig 708 insertion of plain buttonhole stitches insertion of single buttonhole stitches figs 707 and 708make very loose buttonhole stitches along both edges of the braid all the same size and the same distance apart and vertically opposite to each other when these two rows are finished pick up each loop with russian stitch either single fig 704 or twisted fig 705 fig 708 shows the double russian stitch made in each loop it may be trebled or quadrupled according to whether you wish your insertion to be very transparent or not illustration fig 709 insertion with bead stitches insertion with bead stitches fig 709join the opposite rows of loops together by four stitches the threads of these stitches must lie quite flat side by side and not one on the top of the other after the fourth stitch you wind the thread round the bottom loop and then carry it on to the next whence you repeat the four stitches as above cluster insertion fig 710over the middle of two finished plain bars and one halffinished one a short distance apart you make five buttonhole stitches and overcast the remainder of the third bar the first bar of the next cluster must be set quite close to the last insertion with branches figs 711 and 712throw the thread across the middle of the space between two edges of braid and lengthways from one end to the other pass the needle horizontally under four or five threads of the braid across the insertion then carry it in a similar manner first to the left and then to the right take up the same number of threads of the braid and connect the three loops together by a knot as is clearly shown in fig 711 illustration fig 710 cluster insertion illustration fig 711 insertion with plain branches illustration fig 712 insertion with branches and wheels fig 712 represents a similar beginning and a similar interlacing of the threads but ornamented this time with a wheel added after the knot has been made over the loops illustration fig 713 insertion with leaves worked in darning stitch insertion with leaves in darning stitch fig 713fasten on the thread where according to the illustration the first leaf in the insertion ought to come carry it across to the opposite side draw it through the edge of the braid and bring it back to the point whence it started lay threads across to both sides like in figs 711 and 712 unite them by a knot such as described in fig 711 lay the thread once more round the middle leaf and finish the leaf in darning stitch working downwards from the top as described in the preceding chapter in figs 646 and 647 as may be seen from the second middle leaf your darning stitches have to be made over five threads subdivided into two and three illustration fig 714 insertion with small wheels insertion with small wheels fig 714here you have to make two rows of russian stitches opposite each other and carry the thread to the point of intersection then you make a wheel over five threads and pass the needle under the completed wheel to reach the next point of intersection half wheels may also be added at the edge of the braid as in figs 658 and 659 illustration fig 715 insertion with big wheels insertion with big wheels fig 715carry the thread horizontally across the middle of the space intended for the insertion to the opposite side and then conduct it by means of overcasting stitches into the corner thence make a loose loop over to the opposite corner pass the needle under six or eight threads of the braid edge slip it under the horizontal thread first laid and behind the loop and finish the stitch on the other side in the edge of the braid throw the thread again across the empty space and over the first thread bring your needle back to the middle make a big wheel over four threads passing each time under the same threads then overcast the single thread come back to the edge of the braid and make the second loop bringing out the thread at the same place where the other stitches came out insertion with cones figs 716 and 717over plain but very distended russian stitch make darning stitches backwards and forwards beginning at the point and reaching to the middle so as to form small coneshaped figures to reach the point of the next cone you overcast the thread of the russian stitch several times you may also as in fig 717 double the russian stitch and make the darning stitches in such a manner that the points of the cones touch each other and their bases meet the edge of the braid the same thing worked the reverse way that is with the points turned outwards to the edge produces a not less pretty effect illustration fig 716 insertion with cones illustration fig 717 insertion with cones illustration fig 718 insertion with embroidered squares insertion with embroidered squares fig 718after making rows of loose buttonhole stitches along the braid edges as in figs 707 708 709 run a thread through the buttonhole stitches this thread serves as the foundation to the russian stitches by which the two edges are joined together the empty square space left between the russian stitches is then filled up with buttonhole stitches like those in fig 651 in the foregoing chapter illustration fig 719 insertion with half bars insertion with half bars fig 719fasten on the thread in one of the corners of the braid and conduct it by means of overcasting stitches to the middle of the insertion draw it through the edge of the braid on the right and make buttonhole stitches over it to the middle of the space to be filled then carry the thread to the left draw it through the left edge a little higher up than on the other side and make the same number of stitches over it as over the first you can vary this insertion with very good result by making more stitches on one side than on the other but it should never be more than 10 or 12 stitches wide illustration fig 720 plain net stitch first lace stitch plain net stitch first lace stitch fig 720make rows of buttonhole stitches to and fro loose enough to form loops into which the stitches of each subsequent row are set you must be careful to make the same number of stitches in all the spaces that are of the same size and also when you begin a row with a whole stitch to begin the return row with a half and so on in regular rotation the number of stitches should vary with the width of the pattern and the decreasing and increasing should always be done at the edge the loops must be as many threads of the braid edge long as they are wide illustration fig 721 double net stitch second lace stitch double net stitch second lace stitch fig 721you leave the same distance between the stitches here as in the preceding figure but in each of the loops of the first row you must make two buttonhole stitches close together it is as well to round the loop a little less than is usually done in net stitch illustration fig 722 third lace stitch third lace stitch fig 722here you make three buttonhole stitches close together joined to the next three by a loop of thread just long enough to hold the three buttonhole stitches of the subsequent row illustration fig 723 fourth lace stitch fourth lace stitch fig 723working from left to right make two buttonhole stitches rather near together and leave twice as long a loop between them and the next two stitches as between the two first in the next row which is worked from right to left make one stitch in the loop between the two stitches that are close together and three or four in the long loop illustration fig 724 fifth lace stitch fifth lace stitch fig 724as in fig 723 you begin this stitch from left to right but making three stitches very close together with an intermediate loop as long as the three stitches in one in the second row you make one buttonhole stitch in each of the loops between the three stitches and six or eight in the long intermediate loop illustration fig 725 sixth lace stitch sixth lace stitch fig 725over wide loops made from left to right in the first row make in the second enough buttonhole stitches entirely to cover the thread in the third row of stitches put the needle into the small loop between two sets of buttonhole stitches so that the close stitches shall form vertical lines across the surface they cover this stitch admits of every sort of modification such as for instance making the third row of stitches on the buttonhole stitches in the middle of the ones on the small loop or making one row of close stitches first and then three open rows in the former case you should always make an uneven number of buttonhole stitches so that you have the same number on both sides of the needle which you must put in between the two threads that form the middle buttonhole stitch illustration fig 726 seventh lace stitch seventh lace stitch fig 726begin working from right to left by making one row of pairs of buttonhole stitches a very short distance apart in the second row you make one buttonhole stitch between each of these pairs and in the third row two buttonhole stitches in every long loop here the stitches must not be crowded together but have a small gap left between them illustration fig 727 eighth lace stitch eighth lace stitch fig 727this stitch is generally known as the peastitch on account of the holes occasioned by the different distribution of the stitches the first row consists of stitches set rather closely together and all the same distance apart in the second row you make one buttonhole stitch in the last stitch of the first row then missing two loops and three buttonhole stitches you make two stitches in the next loops and so on in the third row you make three stitches in the big loop and one in the loop between the stitches of the second row illustration fig 728 ninth lace stitch illustration fig 729 tenth lace stitch ninth and tenth lace stitch figs 728 and 729both the small and the big pointed groups of stitches begin with a row of close buttonhole stitches fig 728 requires three rows in the second you miss two stitches and make two in the next loops in the third only one stitch is introduced between the two loops of the lower row fig 729 requires five rows the stitches of the first must be set as closely together as possible in the second row you make four stitches and miss two of the first row in the third row you make three stitches in the fourth two and in the fifth one only the long loops of the last row must not be too slack so that the first stitches of the next scallop may quite cover them illustration fig 730 eleventh lace stitch eleventh lace stitch fig 730this stitch is not really more difficult to work than those we have been describing but requires rather more attention to learn the first row consists of plain net stitches in the second you have three buttonhole stitches in the middle net stitch in the third three buttonhole stitches in the whole loops on either side of the three buttonhole stitches of the second row and one stitch in the half loops that precede and immediately follow them the fourth row is similar to the second in the fifth row the close stitches are changed the three buttonhole stitches are made in the third whole loop before and after those of the fourth row so that between two groups of three stitches you have six single buttonhole stitches and seven loops illustration fig 731 twelfth lace stitch twelfth lace stitch fig 731fasten on your thread take it by overcasting stitches over the braid edge half a cm from the corner and make three buttonhole stitches downwards quite close together the next loops over four or six threads of the braid must be left long enough to be on a level with the first stitch reaching downwards from the edge in the second row you cover the long loops with three buttonhole stitches and draw the intervening thread quite tight the third row is like the first with the difference that you put the needle in between the two threads of the buttonhole stitch instead of through the loops illustration fig 732 thirteenth lace stitch thirteenth lace stitch fig 732the stitch here represented as well as the two next ones are looped from left to right and then again from right to left as it is more unusual to make the loops from left to right than the reverse way the proper position of the needle and the course of the thread are shown in the illustrations fig 732 requires in the first place two buttonhole stitches very close together in the edge of the braid then a third stitch covering the two first stitches and set quite close to them the connecting thread between these stitches must be tightly stretched so as to lie almost vertically that the stitches may form straight lines illustration fig 733 fourteenth lace stitch fourteenth lace stitch fig 733this begins likewise with two buttonhole stitches above which you make two buttonhole stitches instead of one as in fig 732 producing an open ground with vertical bars illustration fig 734 fifteenth lace stitch fifteenth lace stitch fig 734this resembles the two foregoing stitches and consists of three buttonhole stitches made over the edge of the braid or the intermediate bars and joined together afterwards under one transverse stitch illustration fig 735 sixteenth lace stitch sixteenth lace stitch fig 735you begin this by a row of net stitches worked from right to left or as the engraving shows by a row of stitches called seed stitches illustration fig 736 seventeenth lace stitch the second row worked from left to right consists of short bars set slanting and shaped like a seed and made the same way as the picot in fig 699 the first stitch is carried through the loop of the row below the second over both threads and far enough from the loop to leave room for three other stitches the first of the four buttonhole stitches of the next group must be set quite close to the last seventeenth lace stitch fig 786here we have the same pattern as the preceding one without the row of net stitches the engraving shows us at the same time the proper direction of the needle and thread for the row that is worked from right to left illustration fig 737 eighteenth lace stitch eighteenth lace stitch fig 737this is the first of a series of lace stitches often met with in old venetian lace and which can therefore with perfect right be called venetian stitches owing to the manner and order in which the rows of stitches are connected and placed above one another they form less transparent grounds than those we have hitherto described in these grounds you begin by making the row of loops then you throw a thread across on the same level and in coming back pass the needle through the row of loops under the thread stretched across and under the stitch of the previous row illustration fig 738 nineteenth lace stitch nineteenth lace stitch fig 738the close stitch here represented is more common in venetian lace than the loose stitch given in fig 737 illustration fig 739 twentieth lace stitch twentieth lace stitch fig 739by missing some loops of the close ground in one row and replacing them by the same number in the next small gaps are formed and by a regular and systematic missing and taking up of stitches in this way extremely pretty grounds can be produced illustration fig 740 twentyfirst lace stitch twentyfirst lace stitch fig 740these close lace stitches can be varied in all sorts of other ways by embroidering the needlemade grounds in fig 740 you have little tufts in darning stitch and in a less twisted material than the close stitches of the ground worked upon the ground if you use fil dentelle dmc lace thread for the ground you should take either coton repriser dmc darning cotton or better still coton surfin dmca for the tufts the ground can also be ornamented with little rings of buttonholing stars or flowerets in bullion or some other fancy stitch illustration fig 741 twentysecond lace stitch twentysecond lace stitch fig 741for the above three stitches and the three that follow the work has to be held so that the finished rows are turned to the worker and the needle points to the outside of the hand in the first row from left to right take hold of the thread near the end that is in the braid lay it from left to right under the point of the needle and bring it back again to the right over the same whilst twisting the thread in this way round the needle with the right hand you must hold the eye of the needle under the left thumb when you have laid the thread round draw the needle through the loops the bars must stand straight and be of uniform length were they to slant or be at all uneven we should consider the work badly done in the row that is worked from left to right the thread must be twisted round the needle likewise from left to right illustration fig 742 twentythird lace stitch twentythird lace stitch fig 742this is begun with the same stitches as fig 741 worked from right to left you then take up every loop that comes between the vertical bars with an overcasting stitch drawing the thread quite out and tightening it as much as is necessary after each stitch you cannot take several stitches on the needle at the same time and draw out the thread for them all at once as this pulls the bars out of their place illustration fig 743 twentyfourth lace stitch twentyfourth lace stitch fig 743this is often called the sorrento stitch every group of three bars of stitches is separated from the next by a long loop round which the thread is twisted in its backward course in each of the succeeding rows you place the first bar between the first and second of the preceding row and the third one in the long loop so that the pattern advances as it were in steps illustration fig 744 twentyfifth lace stitch illustration fig 745 twentysixth lace stitch twentyfifth and twentysixth lace stitches figs 744 and 745these two figures show how the relative position of the groups of bars may be varied both consist of the same stitches as those described in fig 741 the thread that connects the groups should be tightly stretched so that the rows may form straight horizontal lines illustration fig 746 twentyseventh lace stitch twentyseventh lace stitch fig 746begin by making two rows of net stitches fig 720 then two of close ones fig 738 and one row like those of fig 741 if you want to lengthen the bars twist the thread once or twice more round the needle you can also make one row of bars surmounted by wheels as shown in fig 765 then one more row of bars and continue with close stitches twentyeighth lace stitch fig 747between every group of three bars set close together leave a space of a corresponding width then bring the thread back over the bars as in figs 737 738 and 739 without going through the loops in the second row you make three bars in the empty space two over the three bars of the first row and again three in the next empty space the third row is like the first illustration fig 747 twentyeighth lace stitch illustration fig 748 twentyninth lace stitch twentyninth lace stitch fig 748this stitch known as greek net stitch can be used instead of buttonhole bars for filling in large surfaces make bars from left to right a little distance apart as in fig 741 leaving the loops between rather slack so that when they have been twice overcast by the returning thread they may still be slightly rounded in the next row you make the bar in the middle of the loop and lift it up sufficiently with the needle for the threads to form a hexagon like a net mesh illustration fig 749 thirtieth lace stitch thirtieth lace stitch fig 749 after a row of pairs of buttonhole stitches set closely together with long loops between as long as the space between the pairs throw the thread across in a line with the extremities of the loops fasten it to the edge of the braid and make pairs of buttonhole stitches as in the first row above it the loops must be perfectly regular to facilitate which guide lines may be traced across the pattern and pins stuck in as shown in the figure round which to carry the thread illustration fig 750 thirtyfirst lace stitch thirtyfirst lace stitch fig 750at first sight this stitch looks very much like the preceding one but it differs entirely from it in the way in which the threads are knotted you pass the needle under the loop and the laid thread then stick in the pin at the right distance for making the long loop bring the thread round behind the pin make a loop round the point of the needle as shows in the engraving and pull up the knot illustration fig 751 thirtysecond lace stitch thirtysecond lace stitch fig 751to introduce a greater variety into lace stitches netting can also be imitated with the needle you begin with a loop in the corner of a square and work in diagonal lines the loops are secured by means of the same stitch shown in fig 750 and the regularity of the loops ensured as it is there by making them round a pin stuck in at the proper distance the squares or meshes must be made with the greatest accuracy that being the case most of the stitches described in the preceding chapter can be worked upon them and the smallest spaces can be filled with delicate embroidery thirtythird lace stitch fig 752this stitch is frequently met with in the oldest irish lace especially in the kind where the braids are joined together by fillings not bars at first sight it looks merely like a close net stitch the ground and filling all alike so uniform is it in appearance but on a closer observation it will be found to be quite a different stitch from any of those we have been describing the first stitch is made like a plain net stitch the second consists of a knot that ties up the loop of the first stitch fillings of this kind must be worked as compactly as possible so that hardly any spaces are visible between the individual rows illustration fig 752 thirtythird lace stitch illustration fig 753 thirtyfourth lace stitch thirtyfourth lace stitch fig 753to fill in a surface with this stitch known as the wheel or spider stitch begin by laying double diagonal threads to and fro at regular distances apart so that they lie side by side and are not twisted when the whole surface is covered with these double threads throw a second similar series across them the opposite way the return thread in making this second layer must be conducted under the double threads of the first layer and over the single thread just laid and wound two or three times round them thereby forming little wheels or spiders like those already described in the preceding chapter in figs 653 and 654 thirtyfifth lace stitch fig 754begin by making a very regular netted foundation but without knots where the two layers of threads intersect each other then make a third layer of diagonal threads across the two first layers so that all meet at the same points of intersection thus forming six rays divergent from one centre with the fourth and last thread which forms the seventh and eighth ray you make the wheel over seven threads then slip the needle under it and carry it on to the point for the next wheel illustration fig 754 thirtyfifth lace stitch illustration fig 755 thirtysixth lace stitch thirtysixth lace stitch fig 755after covering all the surface to be embroidered with threads stretched in horizontal lines you cover them with loops going from one to the other and joining themselves in the subsequent row to the preceding loops the needle will thus have to pass underneath two threads then cover this needlemade canvas with cones worked in close darning stitches as in figs 648 716 and 717 illustration fig 756 thirtyseventh lace stitch thirtyseventh lace stitch fig 756here by means of the first threads that you lay you make an imitation of the penelope canvas used for tapestry work covering the surface with double threads a very little distance apart stretched both ways the second layer of threads must pass alternately under and over the first where they cross each other and the small squares thus left between must be encircled several times with thread and then buttonholed the thicker the foundation and the more raised and compact the buttonholing upon it is the better the effect will be each of these little buttonholed rings should be begun and finished off independently of the others thirtyeighth lace stitch fig 757plain net stitch being quicker to do than any other one is tempted to use it more frequently but as it is a little monotonous some openwork ornament upon it is a great improvement such for instance as small buttonholed rings worked all over the ground at regular intervals here again as in the preceding figure the rings must be made independently of each other illustration fig 757 thirtyeighth lace stitch illustration fig 758 thirtyninth lace stitch thirtyninth lace stitch fig 758corded bars branching out into other bars worked in overcasting stitches may also serve as a lace ground you lay five or six threads according to the course the bars are to take you overcast the branches up to the point of their junction with the principal line thence you throw across the foundation threads for another branch so that having reached a given point and coming back to finish the threads left uncovered in going you will often have from six to eight short lengths of thread to overcast overcasting stitches are always worked from right to left fortieth lace stitch fig 759of all the different kinds of stitches here given this which terminates the series is perhaps the one requiring the most patience it was copied from a piece of very old and valuable brabant lace of which it formed the entire ground our figure of course represents it on a very magnified scale the original being worked in the finest imaginable material over a single foundation thread in the first row after the three usual foundation threads are laid you make the buttonhole stitches to the number of eight or ten up to the point from which the next branch issues from the edge of the braid that is upwards then you bring the needle down again and buttonhole the second part of the bar working from right to left illustration fig 759 fortieth lace stitch a picot like the one described in fig 701 marks the point where the bars join more picots of the same kind may be added at discretion illustration fig 760 wheel composed of buttonhole bars making and taking up the loops illustration fig 761 wheel composed of buttonhole bars the buttonholing begun wheel composed of buttonhole bars figs 760 761 762 763as we have already more than once given directions for making wheels not only in the present chapter but also in the one on netting there is no need to enlarge on the kind of stitches to be used here but we will explain the course of the thread in making wheels composed of buttonhole bars in a square opening fig 760 shows how the first eight loops which form the foundation of the bars are made illustration fig 762 wheel composed of buttonhole bars passing from one bar to the other illustration fig 763 wheel composed of buttonhole bars bars and ring finished in fig 761 you will see that a thread has been passed through the loops for the purpose of drawing them in and making a ring in addition to which two threads added to the loop serve as padding for the buttonhole stitches the latter should always be begun on the braid side fig 762 represents the bar begun in fig 761 completed and the passage of the thread to the next bar and fig 763 the ring buttonholed after the completion of all the bars illustration fig 764 filling in a round space with net stitch filling in round spaces figs 764 765 766the stitches best adapted for filling in round spaces are those that can be drawn in and tightened to the required circumference or those that admit of the number being reduced regularly in each round in tacking braids on to circular patterns the inside edges as we pointed out at the beginning of this chapter have to be drawn in with overcasting stitches in very fine thread fig 764 shows how to fill in a round space with net stitches it will be observed that the loop which begins the row has the thread of the loop with which it terminates wound round it which thread then passes on to the second series of stitches in the same manner you pass to the third row after which you pick up all the loops and fasten off the thread by working back to the braid edge over all the rows of loops following the course indicated by the dotted line illustration fig 765 filling in round spaces first circle of wheels begun illustration fig 766 filling in round spaces the two circles of wheels finished fig 765 shows how to finish a row of loops with wheels worked upon three threads only in the first row you make a wheel over each bar in the second you make a bar between every two wheels in the third the wheels are only made over every second bar a fourth row of bars which you pick up with a thread completes the interior of the circle then you work along the bars with overcasting stitches fig 766 to carry the thread back to the edge of the braid where you fasten it off needlemade picots figs 767 768 769the edges and outlines of irish lace are generally bordered with picots which as we have already said can be bought readymade see fig 692 they are not however very strong and we cannot recommend them for lace that any one has taken the pains to make by hand illustration fig 767 connected needlemade picots illustration fig 768 isolated needlemade picots illustration fig 769 buttonhole picots with picots in bullion stitch in fig 767 the way to make picots all joined together is described you begin as in fig 762 by a knot over which the thread is twisted as indicated in the engraving it is needless to repeat that the loops should all be knotted in a line all be of the same length and all the same distance apart fig 768 represents the kind of needlemade picots which most resemble the machinemade ones and fig 769 show us the use of little scallops surmounted by picots made in bullion stitch one or two rows of lace stitch fig 736 or the first rows of figs 749 750 can also be used in the place of picots irish lace fig 770english braids or those braids which are indicated at the foot of the engraving must be tacked down on to the pattern and gathered on the inside edge wherever the lines are curved as explained in fig 693 in cases however where only lacet superfin dmca is used the needle should be slipped in underneath the outside threads so that the thread with which you draw in the braid be hidden the braids are joined together where they meet with a few overcasting stitches as shown in the illustration here we find one of the lace stitches used instead of picots the first row of fig 736 always makes a nice border for irish lace irish lace fig 771this pattern which is more complicated and takes more time and stitches than the preceding one can also be executed with one or other of the braids mentioned at the beginning of the chapter but it looks best made with a close braid illustration fig 770 irish lace illustration fig 771 irish lace materials lacet surfin dmc no 5 white or cru and fil dalsace dmc nos 40 to 150 or fil dentelle dmc

with corded bars with one of the lace stitches we have described either fig 720 721 or 732 any one of which is suitable for filling in small spaces like these in the figure on the right the ring of braid may be replaced by close buttonhole stitches made over several foundation threads or over one thick thread such as fil pointer dmc no 10 or 20a to make them full and round you begin the ring on the inside and increase the number of stitches as the circumference increases illustration fig 772 irish lace materials english braid with open edgefor the lattice work fil dalsace dmc in balls nos 50

finished you sew upon the braid a thin cord made of cru cordonnet 6 fils dmc as described in the chapter on different kinds of fancy work cords of this kind can be had ready made but the handmade ones

thread must not as in lace made with braid be carried on from one point to the other by overcasting stitches along the braid edges but should be drawn out horizontally through the cord and back again the same way giving the needle in so doing a slightly slanting direction footnotes a see at the end of the concluding chapter the table of numbers and sizes and the list of colours of the dmc threads and cottons illustration venetian lace of the xvi century laces of different kinds in general to the uninitiated the word lace signifies exclusively the delicate and elaborate fabrics that owe their origin to venice and the netherlands and were thence imported into other countries but besides venetian french english chantilly brussels sedan point names familiar to every one there are all kinds of other laces likewise of great antiquity and named as the above are after the country they belong to as it would be impossible in these pages to give a comprehensive account of them all we have restricted ourselves to such as seem more especially suited to the amateur to whom needlework is a mere recreation and pastime worked like the abovenamed entirely with the needle but much less elaborate and minute in character and workmanship they are quicker and easier to make and we are sure that by the help of the directions that accompany the illustrations any careful worker will be able to imitate them without difficulty materialsit will be observed that we do not bind ourselves in the following directions to one size of cotton that as in point of fact one and the same piece of work can be executed in either fine or coarse cotton we have only indicated the most suitable kind of material to use as for instance for armenian lace fil pointer dmca or cordonnet 6 fils dmca for smyrna or knotted lace fil pointer dmc cordonnet 6 fils dmc and fil dentelle dmca for reticella and venetian lace fil dalsace dmca for brussels lace the finest numbers of fil dentelle and for pillow lace any one of those enumerated excepting coton broder surfin pillow lace and the necessary articles for its manufacturepillow lace derives its name from the cushion or pillow on which all bobbin lace is made which distinguishes it from point lace socalled because it consists of points or stitches made with a needle and thread various articles are required for the making of pillow lace in the first place a cushion or pillow then bobbins and a winder parchment patterns pins and a pricker the lace pillow figs 774 775 776the pillows used for pillow lace are of different kinds and vary in shape with where the country and the manner in which the lace is made illustration fig 774 the lace pillow fig 774 represents the shape in use in the mountains of bohemia and saxony where pillow lace has always been one of the chief industries of the inhabitants any one can make a cushion of this kind themselves with a piece of stuff 60 cm long and 40 wide the long sides are firmly sewn together and the short ones turned in with a narrow hem through which you run a cord to draw them up a disc of stout cardboard is put inside the case after you have gathered up the one end you then stuff the case as full as possible with bran sawdust or horsehair lay a second disc of cardboard in at the top and draw up the other end these pillows are then put into cardboard boxes with rather high sides or into a kind of basket weighted at the bottom to keep it firm and steady pillows of this most primitive kind have the great advantage of being perfectly easy to make illustration fig 775 pillow with movable cylinder for making lace illustration fig 776 position of the bobbins and the work on the cushion fig 775 fig 775 represents a pillow of a more complicated kind which can be stood upon the table or mounted on a stand the cylinder is movable so that you can go on working without interruption the whole apparatus consists of a board or stand 50 cm long and 40 wide resting upon two transverse pieces of wood 3 cm high behind and 1 cm in front the board should be covered first with a very thick flannel or bath coating and then with a fine dark green flannel or cloth two small supports are fixed on to the outside edge of the stand to hold the cylinder which consists of two discs that revolve on a rod about 22 cm long this rod should be covered in the first place with a thick layer of tow and then with flannel or cloth on the left side of the cylinder is a cogwheel and a metal spring is attached to the board by means of which the wheel is prevented from turning the wrong way fig 776 shows how the bobbins are placed upon the pillow in normandy a kind of stuffed box is used instead of a pillow the board is 3 cm higher behind than in front and is deeply grooved to hold the cylinder which is stuffed and shaped like the one represented in fig 775 this cylinder scarcely projects above the stand a second groove in the back edge receives the lace as it is worked off the cylinder the pillows used for valenciennes lace are of again a different construction but as it is not our intention in the present work to describe the finer kinds of lace it appeared superfluous to give any illustration of the pillows on which they are made illustration fig 777 the bobbin jamnigs patent the bobbins fig 777a bobbin is a sort of little wooden spool with a handle to it there are several varieties of them but we have confined ourselves to a representation of the kind considered best for beginners as a considerable number are wanted for every pattern and they are apt to slip about and get entangled in inexperienced hands they are now to be had with the handles weighted with lead to steady them and counteract any independent motion of their own we cannot help again laying great stress on the importance of seeing that the size of the bobbins and the number of the cotton be well assorted to the kind of lace the winder fig 778every one who means to take the work seriously should provide themselves with a winder as here represented which is affixed to a polished wooden stand this stand has to be firmly screwed to the table and the bobbin is squeezed in between the two little rods fitted into the supports at the left end of the stand one of these rods serves as the axle to the little wheel the other can be drawn in and out and fitted to the length of the bobbin illustration fig 778 the winder jamnigs patent when the bobbin is fixed in its place you take the thread in the left hand and wind it round it turning the wheel with the right hand from right to left in the direction indicated by the arrow the thread is wound round the handles of the bobbins that are used for making very fine lace and a wooden shield that is so contrived that you can slip it over the handle prevents the thread from getting soiled illustration fig 779 stoppage of the thread at the end of the bobbin stoppage of the thread at the end of the bobbin fig 779after cutting off the thread you make a loop close to the top of the bobbin to prevent it from unwinding too easily this loop is formed by taking the bobbin in the right hand the thread between the fourth and fifth fingers of the left hand and laying it away from you round the left thumb then lifting up the bottom thread with the second finger of the left hand you pass the bobbin upwards from below through the loop on the left hand machine for crossing the threads fig 780this ingenious little machine is of great assistance in making straight running patterns and irish lace braids and is particularly useful for russian lace and braid lace of all kinds it renders the even crossing of the threads in those parts of a pattern that imitate linen in texture comparatively easy two implements like combs fitting into one another and movable are mounted at two thirds of their length on a steel axle the long teeth have holes bored through the ends from the sides to the middle of the points and through these holes the threads from the bobbins are passed illustration fig 780 machine for crossing the threads jamnigs patent the short teeth also are pierced with transverse holes through which a needle with the threads threaded in the long teeth resting upon it is passed the points of the short teeth are covered with a hollow metal cylinder split through from end to end which can be removed when new threads have to be added when the threads are all on a small spring is fixed to the two ends of the axle which is independent of the machine and the two ends of the spring are introduced into the hollow of the cylinder by the pressure you exercise on the teeth in the cylinder the long teeth change their position the lower ones rise and the upper ones fall and the threads cross each other as in a loom after each movement of the machine the bobbin that makes the woof must be passed between the crossed threads the edges are made like those of any other kind of lace fig 781 explains how the bobbins are passed between the threads that are held between the teeth of the machine illustration fig 781 passage of the bobbins through the machine the patternthe pattern is one of the most important things in making pillow lace the outlines must be clear and exact as upon that in great measure the perfection of the lace depends the drawing transferred to parchment paper or cardboard usually of a yellowish tint should be lined with a very thin stuff such as muslin to prevent its tearing illustration fig 782 pricker and holder a stripe of quadrille or point paper as it is called should be laid upon the pattern and then holes pricked with a mediumsized needle at every intersection of the lines all the curved long lines of the pattern must first be traced upon the point paper with ink and then pricked the pattern should be adapted to the thickness of the thread the lace is to be made of for a coarse lace large point paper should be used and small for the finer kinds of lace the pricking of the pattern beforehand is particularly important in the case of the common torchon lace where the real beauty of the design consists in its regularity in the case of fine close patterns the pricking can only be done as you proceed prickers and holders of the kind represented in fig 782 or very much resembling it are to be had at every stationers shop illustration fig 783 position and movements of the hands the holes made by the prickers are to receive the pins stuck in as you go along round which you form and by which these are kept in their place the pins must be long with round heads and of a size suited to the thread when your pattern is ready fasten it to the pillow or cylinder as the case may be stretching it as smoothly as possible and being careful in so doing to fit the lines of the pattern together if it be too long it must be cut to the required length or you may make the cylinder bigger by wrapping several folds of flannel round it the value of lace depends not only on the work but on the thread it is made of all the dmc cottonsa can be recommended for lacemaking and coloured laces of all kinds are greatly improved by the addition of a little chin dor dmc or or fin dmc pour la broderiea position and movements of the hands fig 783pillow lace is always made with two pairs of bobbins at once and the stitches are formed by the different ways of passing plaiting crossing and twisting the threads to begin with the simplest operation making a plait hang 2 pairs of bobbins to a pin take 2 bobbins in each hand and lay the right bobbin of each pair over its left fellow and draw up the threads slightly then take the bobbins in the 2nd 3rd and 4th fingers of the right hand and with the same fingers of the left lay the 2nd bobbin over the 3rd with the 2nd and 3rd fingers of the left so that the two middle bobbins are crossed then take the 4th bobbin in the 2nd and 3rd fingers of the right hand and the bobbin that is now the 2nd in the 3rd and 4th fingers of the left hand and lay the former over the 3rd the latter over the 1st this constitutes a half passing the plait fig 784 is formed by the repetition of the half passing two half passings make a whole or double passing on the kind of lace you are making depends how many pairs of bobbins you will have to use but as one part of the lace is often made before the other or you have to put on supernumerary bobbins you fasten up those not in use on one side with pins as shown in fig 783 illustration fig 784 passing with two pairs of bobbins net pattern or ground figs 785 and 786this consists of half passings worked in rows to and fro the pins are stuck in at the end of each row the pattern fig 785 is fastened upon the pillow and 6 pins are stuck in at the top at regular intervals from each other hang one pair of bobbins on every pin and lay the second bobbin of each pair over its fellow so that the threads cross each other illustration fig 785 pattern for net passings 1 half passing with the 1st and 2nd pair lay the 1st pair aside 1 half passing with the 2nd and 3rd pair lay the 2nd pair aside 1 half passing with the 3rd and 4th pair lay the 3rd pair aside 1 half passing with the 4th and 5th pair lay the 4th pair aside 1 half passing with the 5th and 6th pair stick in a pin at point 2 then work back from right to left surround the pin with a half passing made with the 5th and 6th pair lay the 6th pair aside 1 half passing with the 5th and 4th pair lay the 5th pair aside 1 half passing with the 4th and 3rd pairs lay the 4th pair aside 1 half passing with the 3rd and 2nd pair lay the 3rd pair aside 1 half passing with the 2nd and 1st pair stick in a pin at point 3 and repeat from the beginning fig 786 shows the net ground completed the thread that runs to and fro to make it more clear is represented in a darker shade than the others before proceeding further it is as well to prepare our readers for the many trials they will have to make even with the help of the most minute explanations before they succeed in carrying out the directions for the whole art of making pillow lace lies in a manual dexterity only attainable by practice illustration fig 786 net ground completed even copying the patterns from description is only possible at first in a qualified sense the surest way of attaining a satisfactory result is by constantly comparing the drawing and the work in progress and wherever the latter does not correspond with the former trying at once to rectify the difference linen or cloth groundthe pattern used for net passing can also be used for linen passing or ground but 7 pins instead of 6 have to be stuck in at the top first as in net passing you work first from left to right running 2 threads to and fro in perfectly horizontal lines so as to produce a ground resembling linen in its texture the threads that run to and fro are held at the edge with pins and changed by a half passing so that the one that was first in going is first also in returning illustration fig 787 pattern for plain hole ground illustration fig 788 plain hole ground the use of the machine for crossing the threads is especially to be recommended in working linen ground by pressing the short branches of the machine the position of the threads is changed and the bobbin is pushed through by a second pressure the second bobbin is driven through the pin is stuck in for the picot or the cord when the bobbins are taken back again four movements being thus all that is required illustration fig 789 wheel begun in hole ground illustration fig 790 wheel in hole ground completed plain hole ground figs 787 and 788hole ground can be worked in various ways we will begin by describing the plain hole ground which as a rule forms the ground of all torchon laces after fixing the pattern as represented in fig 787 upon the pillow stick in 5 pins hang 2 pairs of bobbins on to each and throw the 2nd bobbin of each pair over its fellow 1 half passing with

cru and bruncaroubier 303a illustration fig 812 working detail of fig 811 armenian lace figs 811 and 812the dresses of the turkish women are often ornamented with flowers and leaves executed in needlework which take the place of fringe and braid trimmings and are often even employed as adornments for the neck and arms instead of necklets and bracelets in metal work though as such they do not always accord with our western notions of good taste the armenian work is in itself both sufficiently interesting and easy of execution to deserve description here amongst other kinds of needlework that are adaptable to use it may be imitated with capital effect in strong stiff washing materials such as those indicated in our illustration either upon a linen or cotton foundation or upon plush or silk the thread is first drawn into the edge of the stuff you then carry it from right to left determine the length of the squares and working from left to right make on this first thread as many knots as you have room for fig 812 shows the formation of the knot the manner in which the thread passing from left to right forms a loop and how to pass your needle under the straightly extended thread and through the loop you leave a space of one or two mm between the knots according to the thickness of the thread you are using having covered the first thread with knots you return to the edge for the next row of knots but passing your needle this time under three threads the number of knots should be the same in each row and the four sides of the square should be all equal when the squares are finished they are edged with picots on the two lower sides as shown in fig 812 thread of two colours was used for fig 811 the squares being worked alternately in cru and bruncaroubier and the picots all in the latter colour lace and insertion in knotted stitch fig 813excepting in the case of the returning thread the same stitches are used for the pretty border and insertion given in fig 813 as for the armenian lace the stitches that form the insertion are attached on both sides to an english braid something of the nature of rhodes linen which is openworked before the knotted work upon it is begun as in the preceding figure two colours are used alternately the change from one to the other is distinctly marked in the engraving the outside edge consists of light scallops formed by the regular increase and decrease of the stitches the original piece of work from which our drawing was taken forms the border of a dark blue plush carpet the red and cru hues of the lace harmonize

supposed to be of italian origin but we have met with quite as perfect specimens of work done in the same way which were the products of persia and asia minor we have called it by the same name as the preceding patterns for even the way in which the stitch is worked is almost the same through some slight difference however in the interlacing of the threads shown by the open loops in fig 817 the stitches lie closer together and are alike on both sides of the work illustration fig 816 insertion in knotted stitch materials the same as for fig 814a illustration fig 817 working detail of fig 816 no difficulty will be found in making out the course of the rows it is best to begin by the two rows of stitches that form the perpendicular bars and make the stitches that compose the 4 staves

jaunerouille 363 you overcast the slanting bars and pass over the stitches that connect the two picots illustration fig 821 working detail of fig 820 reticella lace figs 820 and 821the reticella laces are generally made on a design traced upon parchment similar to those required for the laces described later on but as the manner of working has been modified in the lace represented here we thought it as well to adopt the same simplification often used in beautiful pieces of old needlework which consists in substituting a braid made upon a pillow for the bars made with the needle illustration fig 822 venetian lace illustration fig 823 venetian lace you begin by laying and fastening down the braid by means of very small stitches upon the lines of the pattern which should be traced upon black paper you next proceed to make the centre bars covered with plain buttonhole stitches on which you mount a row of stitches like those of fig 755 these are followed by another bar to make which you pick up the loop of the stitches of the preceding row and by another row like the second finished off with picots like those illustrated in fig 700 the bases of the pyramids likewise consist of bars buttonholed on both sides and edged on the inside with picots the stitches of the first row should not be too close together that there may be room for those of the second row between as we have already explained in fig 702 in the chapter on irish lace the inside of the pyramids is worked in the stitch represented in fig 755 the picots round them are like the ones in fig 599 illustration fig 824 venetian lace illustration fig 825 venetian lace the lace represented in fig 820 in its original size was worked in fil dentelle dmc no 80 whilst the second engraving representing the same subject shows us how perfectly well it can also be made in heavier and coarser materials these being in this instance lacets superfins dmc no 4 and cordonnet 6 fils dmc no 20 venetian laces figs 822 823 824 825 826 827 828under the name of venetian point are comprised not only certain kinds of pillow lace but even more generally the beautiful needlemade lace the outlines of which are bordered with handsome scallops in high relief we shall confine our attention in the present instance to the needlemade venetian lace as the other can be learnt without any great difficulty by following the instructions already given for the making of pillow lace illustration fig 826 venetian lace illustration fig 827 venetian lace the preparation of the pattern in most kinds of needlework is a most important matter and one requiring the greatest care but in the case of needlemade lace and pillow lace the processes are different the paper on which the design is traced must first be backed or lined with unglazed black paper made specially for this purpose prick holes all along the lines of the pattern at exactly the same distance from each other remove the tracing and tack the black paper upon rather coarse linen this done you take from three to five lengths of the thread of which the lace is to be made lay them down together upon the lines marked by the prickings and secure them at each hole by a stitch made over the threads fig 822 with the others of the same series in their natural size show the proper distance that should be left between the prickings and the laying down of the threads begun whilst in fig 823 we have the threads laid down throughout even for the little eyelet holes which are to be openworked afterwards illustration fig 828 venetian lace materialsfor the open stitches fil dentelle dmc nos 100 to 200 for the outlining and for the padding coton surfin dmc nos 120 to 150a when all this preliminary work is finished the pattern is ready for the lace stitches that are to form the filling in between the raised outlines in order to keep your work perfectly clean and preserve it from unnecessary contact with your fingers cover all those parts of the pattern you are not immediately engaged on with a piece of blue paper with a hole about the size of a pea cut in it this you move along as you go working only at the part of the pattern which is visible through the hole keeping all the rest carefully covered up and sewing paper over each part as soon as it is finished this should not be removed until you are ready to join all the separate parts together with bars or latticed ground and work the buttonhole edges all the different lace stitches that are used as fillings must be begun and fastened off at the outline threads which you must be careful not to drag out of their place we again remark for the benefit of those of our readers who may not have read the preceding chapter attentively that in working all the finer lace stitches the needle should be held with the eye towards the worker and the point turned outwards all the inside portions of the pattern have to be worked in separately for a choice of stitches to serve as fillings see figs 720 to 762 until all the spaces are filled as represented in figs 825 and 826 the stitches should be selected as far as possible to suit the style of the design flowers look best worked in an open or lattice stitch leaves on the other hand in a thick close stitch when all the insides are done the edges and outlines have to be closely buttonholed the old venetian laces are bordered with scallops in high relief worked over a thick pad of laid threads as described on p 83 fig 191 relating to venetian embroidery illustration fig 829 venetian lace with net ground materialsfor the open stitches fil dentelle dmc nos 100 to 200for the outlining and for the padding coton surfin dmc nos 120 to 150 venetian lace with net ground fig 829the outlining of the figures with several strands of coton surfin dmc should in the case of detached pieces of lace be done at once but where the figures are connected by bars or by a net ground as in fig 825 the buttonholed outlines should be done last thus in making the lace fig 829 you should begin by working all the insides of the flowers and foliage then the net ground which may be replaced by bars with picots and then only proceed to the outside buttonholing and the scallops as all this kind of lacework is very laborious and takes a long time to do we advise our readers to use thread that is slightly tinted in the first place it does not turn yellow as white thread is liable to do and secondly being softer and less twisted it takes every bend and turn more readily than the stiffer white material does of all the different kinds of thread so frequently alluded to in these pages the higher numbers of fil dalsace dmc and fil dentelle dmc are the best for the finer kinds of lace and they all have the soft ivory tint we so admire in the old needlework illustration fig 830 spray in needlepoint materialsfor the open stitches fil dentelle dmc no 200for the outlining coton surfin dmc nos 120 to 150a spray in needlepoint fig 830needlepoint lace also called brussels lace requires the same preparatory work as venetian lace but it seldom contains such a variety of stitches and openwork as the latter the flowers are generally worked in one of the stitches represented in figs 720 and 740 the outlines are less thickly buttonholed and the stitches set everywhere less closely here also the finished parts should be carefully covered with paper to keep them from getting soiled the needlepoint lace designs are ordinarily speaking more realistic and as regards the composition less artistic and severe than the venetian point ones the spray represented in our engraving is a specimen of an ordinary brussels lace pattern and of the stitches it is worked in footnotes a see at the end of the concluding chapter the table of numbers and sizes and the list of colours of the dmc threads and cottons illustration appliqu work on satin set with fine cord miscellaneous fancy work as the plan on which this book was constructed rendered a systematic classification of the different subjects it treats of necessary a certain amount of miscellaneous fancy work which does not come under any of the previous headings remains to be dealt with in the present chapter in most cases the illustrations and the accompanying directions are but an application to a practical use of the different kinds of stitches already described in previous chapters and those who are familiar with all these various branches of needlework will have no difficulty in understanding what follows knotted cord figs 831 832 833 834 835the knotted cord referred to in the letter press belonging to figs 772 and 773 in the chapter on irish lace comes under the present heading in making it the fingers take the place of a crochet needle you tie two ends of thread or braid together take one thread in the left hand fig 831 and with the forefinger of the right pull out a loop long enough for the left forefinger to pass through and hold the end of the thread tight with the little finger of the right hand then draw the left forefinger backwards through the loop and behind the thread that is round the loop and lies in the left hand fig 832 as you lay the thread round the left forefinger you must pass the knot and the ends of thread as well over into the left hand and with the right hand pull the thread that lies on the right and draw up the loop fig 833 illustration fig 831 knotted cord first position of the hands illustration fig 832 knotted cord second position of the hands illustration fig 833 knotted cord third position of the hands in fig 834 representing the fourth position of the hands you are shown how the forefinger of the right hand lifts up the thread and passes through the loop on the left hand the end will consequently also pass immediately into the right hand and the left hand will tighten the knot it is by thus drawing up first a loop on the right and then one on the left that this pretty cord is produced skilful hands will soon learn to make a cord of the same kind with four threads as follows knot the four ends of thread together make a few knots using two threads as one then dropping the loop on your forefinger put the next one upon it and draw up the knot passing however the threads over those that you dropped then drop the loop you have on your finger again and take up the first loops illustration fig 834 knotted cord fourth position of the hands for the cord made with double threads represented in fig 835 on a magnified scale use cordonnet 6 fils dmc or one of the

knitting cotton or coton repriser dmc darning cottona when the round is entirely covered put the scissors in between the two circles of cardboard and cut open the stitches all round the outer edge fig 838 then draw a piece of thread between the two circles and knot it firmly round the stitches that meet in the centre hole fig 839 leave sufficiently long ends of thread hanging to form a loop by which the ball can afterwards be fastened to the heading of the fringe when the stitches are knotted together you cut and pull out the cardboard fig 840 and snip the thread with your scissors until it becomes quite fluffy and the ball is perfectly round as shown in fig 841 tambour work figs 842 843 844 845since the introduction of the sewing machine by means of which this charming kind of embroidery can be so quickly and easily executed it has somewhat gone out of favour as however the fine patterns with a good deal of shading in them can be far more accurately worked by hand than by machine tambouring which is in point of fact merely a form of crochet has lately been revived the piece of stuff on which the tambour work is to be done must be mounted on a frame illustration fig 842 thimble for tambouring illustration fig 843 tambour needle the loops which are made with a small hook called a tambour needle form a fine chain stitch and must be regular and even to facilitate this a sort of thimble fig 842 is worn on the forefinger of the right hand formed of a small plate of sheet brass rolled up but not joined so as to fit any finger it is open at the top like a tailors thimble and has a little notch on the side which is placed above the nail and in which you lay the tambour needle whilst you work from the thimble being cut slightly slanting at the top it follows that the inside where the two ends meet is a little shorter than the outside the thread is drawn through in a loop to the front of the work by means of the hook whilst it is held at the back in the left hand and when the needle is put downwards through the stuff laid round it the needle in its downward and upward passage should be kept in the notch in the thimble and the stuff pressed down with the thimble as the needle is drawn up to the surface of the work fig 844 illustration fig 844 position of the hands in tambouring a little practice is necessary to acquire the right action of the hands there being always a tendency the same as in tatting and macram to confuse the movements of the two as soon as you realize that the upward drawing of the needle and the downward pressure of the stuff with the thimble must be simultaneous you will find that you can work with great rapidity and with admirable results thread with a very strong twist which the hook will not split is the only suitable kind for tambouring of the dmc materials fil dalsacea and fil dentellea are the most to be recommended numbers of patterns originally intended for other kinds of embroidery can be executed in tambour work amongst those contained in this encyclopedia figs 192 210 216 219 and 227 are the ones that are best adapted to the purpose illustration fig 845 drawing out the thread with the needle smyrna

lengths together in half stick in the crochet needle from above under two threads of the canvas take hold of the loop with the hook fig 846 and draw it in then push out the hook to seize the ends of the cotton and draw them through the loop which is on the needle as indicated by the little arrow in fig 847 the stitches or tassels should be two or three double threads of the canvas apart as you finish each row comb the ends of the tassels out carefully with a fine metal comb when the whole piece of work is finished shear the entire surface quite even with a pair of sharp scissors fig 849

as the point tricot excepting that in the latter the loops formed by the return of the thread are open and the stitches packed very closely together whereas in the maltese work there is always one close loop and two open tassels illustration fig 854 malta embroidery materials coton repriser dmc no 25a colours jaunevieilor 680 vertmousse 469 bleuindigo 311 and rougecornouille 449a it is worked as follows take a thick bunch of lengths of coton repriser dmc pass it under two vertical threads of the stuff from right to left fig 850 leaving an end 1 or 2 cm long lying on the surface of the work put the needle in again under the two threads that are in front of the first stitch and leave the tassel formed by the first stitch above the one by which you bring the needle back between the two stitches the needle must now follow the same course it took for the first stitch and the thread must be drawn out far enough to form a loop as long as the tassel you then repeat the second stitch carrying back the working thread however this time above the loop after which you cut the two open ends the same length as the loop in the maltese work three times as many threads have to be left between the tassels as are covered by the stitch thus if your stitch cover 4 threads of the foundation you should leave 12 threads between the tassels and if it cover 6 you should leave an interval of 18 threads that the stuff may always be visible between the little tassels or balls fig 854 represents a portion of a curtain embroidered on flemish linen in the colours indicated at the foot of the engraving these may be arranged according to the taste of the worker malta embroidery is mostly done on coarse coloured linen fabrics or on single thread canvas triangular turkish stitch figs 855 856 857 858 859 amongst the many pretty stitches for which turkish embroideries are distinguished there is one in particular which though apparently very difficult is in reality quite the reverse it resembles line stitch upon straight threads only that in the east it is generally worked in diagonal lines each row requiring two journeys to and fro in the first fig 855 the needle must always be carried first over then under two threads in a diagonal line and so on to the end of the row coming back you pass the needle under the stuff and the stitch on the right side and bring it out at the bottom of the stitch then you make a back stitch over two horizontal and two vertical threads pass the needle over two straight threads put it in behind the same bring it out again near the upper stitch and then insert it near the bottom vertical stitch after this you carry it to the second stitch lower down and pass it over the same four threads should meet in every hole which the needle makes the third and fourth row should be worked in a colour that forms a sharp contrast with the one in which the two first rows are worked and constitute with these one complete row of stitches fig 856 figs 857 858 and 859 show how the same stitch can be worked in straight instead of in diagonal rows illustration fig 855 triangular turkish stitch worked diagonally first journey completed and second back begun illustration fig 856 triangular turkish stitch worked diagonally two journeys to and fro forming the complete row the dark shade in fig 859 shows the first row of stitches the light

gobelin stitch illustration fig 859 triangular turkish stitch worked horizontally second journey back the running foundation is divided into slanting squares the diagonal lines are all worked in gold

framed on all sides by one kind say gold and blue for instance the next by the other gold and red illustration fig 860 pattern worked in triangular turkish stitch materials chin dor dmc colours gold and red gold and dark blue gold and light blue gold and green the stalk that divides the two little leaves and has a small lozenge at the top is begun above the fifth of the 9 stitches you make 5 stitches but in such a manner as to end at the top of these 5 with the stitch that runs in a diagonal direction over the threads turned to the inside of the stalk so that the last stitch of the first row may form with the first stitch of the second row a triangle at the top of the stalk which is surmounted by the aforesaid lozenge the lozenges in chin gold and light blue of which there are three in each of the half squares besides those that terminate the stalk consist of 9 stitches the first extending over 3 threads the second over 5 the third over 7 the fourth over 9 and the fifth over 11 the four next decreasing in a similar manner the leaves in chin gold and green on either side of the stalk also begin with a stitch over 3 threads of the stuff followed by 8 each increasing in length by one thread on the side of the stalk but all equal on the other the last extending over 12 threads of the stuff after these 9 the subsequent 8 must decrease in the same manner by one thread on the opposite side then you make 4 more extending over only 3 threads and set the contrary way to the others the zigzag border and the small squares of 5 stitches within it are worked entirely in chin gold

noir grandteint 310a turkish embroidery fig 861the powdering of flowers and also the border are worked like the preceding pattern in twosided gobelin stitch embroidery of this kind looks best on algerian linen which is exactly like the turkish stuff it is not absolutely necessary to count the threads for the little flowers and stalks but it is as well to do so for the border that you may be sure to get the zigzags perfectly regular the petals of the flowers are worked alternately in chin gold and red and gold and blue the centre in or fin dmc pour la broderie and the leaves and stalks in chin gold and green the petals are set with stem stitch in fine black coton broder and if the embroidery is to be the same on both sides this setting must be repeated at the back the distribution of colours in the border is left to the taste of the worker but we should recommend for the zigzags chin gold and red as being the most effective appliqu work fig 862appliqu work means the laying on of pieces of one kind of stuff on to a foundation of a different kind so as to form a patternthese pieces of stuff of various shapes and sizes taking the place of solid needlemade embroidery appliqu work may be done on linen silk velvet plush and leather the stuff out of which the pattern is cut has in most cases to be backed first with very fine tissue paper this is done in the following manner with starch paste which dries quicker than any other spread the paste on the paper with a brush carefully removing all the little lumps it should only be just liquid enough to make the stuff and the paper adhere perfectly together and above all must never penetrate to the right side of the stuff when the paper has been evenly spread with the paste lay your stuff upon it and smooth and press it down with a clean cloth stroking it out carefully in the line of the thread to prevent its becoming in the least dragged or puckered or any air remaining between it and the paper you next lay several sheets of paper without a mark or a fold in them on a perfectly smooth flat board and upon these your paperlined stuff covered in its turn with several loose sheets of paper all being kept in their place by another board with several stones or heavy weights laid upon it to act as a press leave the stuff in the press until it be quite dry you will find that any kind of fabric even the slightest can be rendered available in this manner for appliqu work not even plush or velvet being in the least injured by the process you then transfer the whole pattern on to the foundation whatever it happen to be but only the detached figures on to the paperlined stuff carefully cutting out the latter with a very sharp pair of scissors so as to avoid unravelling the threads along the edges the foundation stretched in a frame as described on page 115 fig 236 is to be placed on a board or table in such a manner that only the stuff rests upon it whilst the frame projects on all four sides then cover the cutout figures with paste on the wrong side and fit them into their proper places upon the foundation in larger pieces of work especially this should be done as quickly as possible so that a board with weights upon it to serve as a press may be laid over them all at once the board must not be removed until the paste be dry then you can begin the needlework fastening down the appliqu figures and finishing them off round the edges by laying down a fine round cord or by flat stitches illustration fig 862 appliqu work you either sew on the cord with invisible stitches opening it a little at each stitch so as to slip the needle and thread in between the twist or else with ordinary overcasting stitches illustration fig 863 morocco embroidery materialsaccording to the stuff fil pointer dmc cordonnet 6 fils dmc coton broder dmc or coton repriser dmca colour rougecardinal 346a in either case it must be so laid on as completely to hide the cut edges and keep them from fraying should you wish to frame the appliqu figures with flat embroidery you must bring your needle out close to the cut edge and enter it 1 or 2 mm within the edge from above both cord and flat stitch setting should be of a subdued shade and if possible of a colour to match the foundation morocco embroidery figs 863 864 865 866this work named after the country where it was originated belongs both to the class of darned and damask embroidery illustration fig 864 morocco embroidery quarter of the subjects of fig 863 in fig 864 the stitches are formed by passing over 5 threads and taking up the sixth coming back you take up the third of the 5 threads first missed and proceed in the same manner over the whole surface of the work unless the lines of the pattern require you to depart from this rule as for instance in certain parts of fig 864 where you will notice stitches carried over 7 or 8 threads also in the borders fig 865 and 866 where the stitches are arranged in a rather arbitrary manner in order to bring out the pattern more clearly fig 864 represents the fourth part of one of the subjects that make up the design fig 863 that is four such joined together form one of the squares of fig 863 illustration fig 865 morocco embroidery small outer border of fig 863 figs 865 and 866 are patterns of two little borders and an insertion suitable as a finish to fig 863 which can be enlarged to

alluded to in this work can be used as a foundation for this kind of embroidery provided the right working materials to go with it are chosen coton tricoter or fil pointer should only be used for the coarser stuffs such as rhodes linen no 1 or russian linen and the different kinds of tammy cloth whereas the other kinds of dmc threads and cottons and especially the finer numbers are best adapted for embroidery on fine stuffs such as rhodes linen no 2 and spanish or algerian linen spanish embroidery figs 867 and 868spanish embroidery consists almost exclusively of buttonhole stitch fig 171 and

334 and bleu ple 668a the buttonhole stitches for which the more subdued shade of the colours indicated should always be taken or else yellow dark or pale to match the gold thread are made over two threads of gold and follow the outlines of the pattern which should be more or less appropriate to this style of embroidery one of the gold threads always keeps the inside of the line and follows it throughout in an unbroken course whilst with the second the outside one you form picots folding the gold thread over from right to left and catching down the loop by a buttonhole stitch which is introduced into the loop itself and carried over the combined gold threads as shown in the left corner of fig 868 representing one quarter of the whole design where the position of the needle and the way in which the picot is secured are plainly indicated for the scallops a round material with rather a strong twist should be used such as soie de coton dmc no 100a or fil dentelle dmc nos 70 to 100a wound on reels illustration fig 868 quarter of the pattern for fig 867 in the natural size where the picots have to fill up empty spaces of a larger size you can join several together by connecting them each in turn with the first when you have bordered all the outlines with buttonhole stitches and picots fill up the spaces enclosed within the lines which properly speaking form the pattern with flat stitch embroidery worked in coton broder or coton repriser after which the whole surface is sewn over with fine little spangles which give the sparkling look that constitutes the peculiar charm of this kind of embroidery the flowers are covered with a fancy stitch that forms regular little lozenges and every second row of stitches is hidden under a spangle with regard to the colours indicated at the foot of fig 867 this is how they were distributed in the original from which our engraving was taken all the outlines in buttonhole stitch in bleu ple 668 the tops of the flowers in bleuindigo 334 the bottom parts in bleuindigo 332 and all three shades of blue so blended together in the solid parts of the design as to be undistinguishable from each other it is not absolutely necessary to keep to the colours here indicated there is no reason whatever why a greater variety should not be introduced but in every case the more subdued shades should be selected a pale red for instance for the flowers a green and a brown for the arabesques will always be found to produce a very pretty and harmonious effect when all the needlework is finished you cut away the stuff underneath the network formed by the picots with a pair of sharp scissors a word remains to be said with regard to the copying of fig 868 our readers will notice that in fig 867 the flowers and arabesques succeed and grow out of each other that whilst the four quarters are symmetrical yet at the same time the curves in each quarter take a different inclination you cannot therefore simply repeat the subject four times when you have copied the one quarter given in fig 868 you must lay this first quarter on again at the cross on the left side when the second quarter is finished you again turn the copy to the left and tack it on at the when you come to the fourth quarter the lines of the first quarter must exactly meet those of the last we beg here to draw attention to the directions relative to the copying of patterns given in the subsequent chapter basket stitch on linen fig 869this stitch has some resemblance with the greek stitch fig 278 and the montenegrin fig 306 only that it is not crossed like the latter illustration fig 869 basket stitch on linen basket stitch can be worked on all kinds of stuffs on counted threads or on a wide or narrow tracing with fine or coarse thread and more or less closely according to the taste of the worker you insert the needle from right and pass it under from 3 to 6 threads of the foundation according to the stuff and the material you are using then downwards from left to right and over from 6 to 8 threads into the stuff again from right to left then you push it under the stuff in an upward direction and bring it out on the left in the middle of the space left between the last stitch and the top of the second the dotted line in the engraving indicates the course of the stitches illustration fig 870 old german knotted stitch old german knotted stitch fig 870this is a stitch often met with in old church and house linen embroidery a beautiful design worked in this way is given further on contrary to most stitches this is worked upwards the needle is put in horizontally under the stuff the thread tightly drawn then laid from left to right and drawn through underneath the first stitch and a tight knot made we find the same stitch worked in a variety of ways according to the taste and skill of the worker for instance the knots may be set slanting as in fig 870 or else straight and very close together as in fig 873 where they present the appearance of a close string of beads or again wide apart as they are in fig 876 all these ways are admissible but care should be taken in each case to make the stitches perfectly regular it is the direction which is given to the stitch and the number of threads taken up with the needle that changes the appearance of the stitch illustration fig 871 raised stem stitch

bring out the needle on the left 2 or 6 threads beyond the line your embroidery is to follow with regard to the number of threads you take up you must be guided by the quality of the stuff and the material you have selected put the needle in on the right the same distance in advance of the line as before and bring it out in the middle of the stitch then passing the needle over the first stitch put it in again one or two threads in advance of the point where it came out and draw it out close to where the first stitch began the border represented in fig 875 is worked in great part in roumanian stitch illustration fig 874 roumanian stitch the original still very well preserved notwithstanding its age is worked in silk of a brilliant red on a stiff stuff which has been coloured by time and use willems satin rhodes linen no 2 and algerian linen make very suitable foundations for this kind of embroidery and have that soft tint which is almost indispensable to a satisfactory imitation of old needlework any one of the shades of red named at the foot of the illustration will be found to be a good match for the original colours roumanian stitch is used wherever the lines of the pattern are widest there where they narrow in the indentures of the leaves and the twists of the stalks flat stitch is used instead by the repetition of the detached subject this pattern may be made to serve either for a stripe or for a grounding if you use it for a stripe the centre flower of the principal subject with the stalks lengthened will look very well worked as a separate subject between the large bouquets worked in a double row base to base on any stuff and in any material these large figures form a very handsome border which makes an effective trimming for furniture and curtains pattern for piqu embroidery fig 876the stuff called piqu such as it is now manufactured is simply an imitation of an old kind of needlework almost unknown in these days but very popular in the fifteenth and sixteenth century in italy for making coverlets and more especially curtains and blinds the latter being highly esteemed because without intercepting the light altogether they tempered it agreeably a similar kind of work was common in bohemia until a recent date for the making of caps it is done on two layers of stuff of different kinds the upper one fine and transparent the lower more substantial the pattern is drawn upon the fine stuff because on that side the different kinds of stitches are made illustration fig 875 border in roumanian stitch materials coton broder

colours of the dmc colour card a very pretty running pattern can be formed out of the spray fig 883 by turning the flowers first to the right and then to the left and making the stalks come out underneath the ears of corn in order to reverse the position of the flowers thus you will have to make two tracings of the spray one negative and one positive thread a tapestry needle with the soutache and draw it into the stuff and then pass it through from the right side to the wrong at the bottom of one of the petals of the flowers secure it on the wrong side by two or three stitches and then bring the working thread which should be of the same colour as the soutache out again at the point of the petal then carry the soutache back to the bottom of the petal and fasten it down like the gold threads in fig 242 by a stitch rather wider than the soutache fold the soutache over again to the starting point and secure it by a stitch and so on in order to give a different character to the flowers use soutache of different widths fold it over more or less closely and lay it down in shorter or longer lengths as required the natural irregularity of the petals of a flower can be very faithfully imitated in this manner fig 883 shows the way in which for the ears of corn the braid is folded back upon itself and fastened down whilst in the white flowers the two layers of the braid that form each petal are separated at the bottom the stamens of the marguerites are worked in knot stitch with yellow cotton and those of the cornflowers with dark blue the other little details are

colours of the dmc threads and cottons illustration ornament after holbein practical directions hitherto we have been chiefly occupied with descriptions and explanations of the different kinds of needlework to render these complete it remains for us to give a few practical directions with regard to the copying adjustment and transposition of the patterns as well as to the different processes often so essential to the ultimate success of a piece of needlework for this success will soon be found not to depend on the stitches only but very largely on the proper adaptation of the design to the space it is intended to fill then in the case of new lace it is necessary to know the amount of dressing it will require to give it the right stiffness and when this dressing has worn off how to renew it whilst in the case of appliqu work more especially it is indispensable to know exactly what the ingredients are of which the paste should be composed and how to make and lay it on in the proper manner tracing patterns against a window panein order to copy a pattern in this way the first step is to tack or pin the piece of stuff or paper on which the copy is to be made upon the pattern in the case of a small pattern the tacking or pinning may be dispensed with and the two sheets held firmly pressed against the window pane with the left hand whilst the right hand does the tracing but even then it is safer to pin or gum the four corners of the two sheets together in case of interruption as it is difficult to fit them together again exactly the tracing may be done with a pencil or better still with a brush dipped in indian ink or watercolour paint the process of tracing is easy enough so long as the hand does not get tired but as this generally comes to pass very soon it is best if the pattern be a large and complicated one to stick the sheets to the pane with strong gum or suspend them on a string fastened across the pane by pins stuck into the window frame on either side to take off a pattern by rubbingif you want to take a pattern of a piece of embroidery direct from the work itself lay it the right side up flat upon a board or table and cover it with letter or tissue paper the paper should be of a good medium thickness if it be too thick it will not take a clear impression of the pattern and if very thin it is apt to tear fasten the paper down upon the embroidery with drawingpins and rub off the pattern with drawingwax in default of the right kind of wax the bowl or handle of a spoon or a large silver coin will serve the purpose equally well as will also some powdered graphite or charcoal the outlines will not of course in any case be very clearly defined upon the paper and will have to be gone over and carefully supplemented afterwards with a pencil taking off the pattern with charcoal or graphite is less injurious to the embroidery than rubbing it off with wax or metal as the pressure required in the latter case flattens the needlework very considerably as soon as you have fixed the lines of the pattern by drawing them over with ink it is ready for use to transfer a pattern direct on to the stuffpatterns cannot be copied by either of the above methods direct on to the stuff and can only be used when the stuff on which the embroidery is to be executed is transparent in the case of thick close fabrics the drawing must be made on the stuff itself the following is the simplest way of transferring a pattern on to a transparent stuff begin by going over all the lines of the drawing with indian ink so as to make them quite thick and distinct and tacking the paper with large stitches on to the back of the stuff then mix some very dark powdered indigo diluted with water in a glass with a small pinch of sugar and powdered gum arabic and using this as ink and a fine pen very slightly split trace the pattern that shines through on the stuff the tracing must be very slight for if the embroidery be not done till some time afterwards the lines get so firmly fixed in the stuff that one washing will not obliterate them the tracing ink moreover makes the work unpleasantly sticky to copy with oiled paperanother rather expeditious mode of transferring patterns on to thin and more especially smooth glossy stuffs is by means of a special kind of tinted paper called autographic paper which is impregnated with a coloured oily substance and is to be had at any stationers shop this you place between the pattern and the stuff having previously fastened the stuff perfectly straight by the line of the thread to a board with drawingpins when you have fitted the two papers likewise exactly together you go over all the lines of the pattern with a blunt pencil or with what is better still the point of a bone crochet needle or the edge of a folder you must be careful not to press so heavily upon the pattern paper as to tear it by the pressure exercised on the two sheets of paper the oily substance of the blue paper discharges itself on to the stuff so that when it is removed all the lines you have traced are imprinted upon the stuff this blue tracing paper is however only available for the reproduction of patterns on washing stuffs as satin and all other silky textures are discoloured by it to pounce patterns upon stuffsthe modes of copying hitherto described cannot be indiscriminately used for all kinds of stuff for cloth velvet and plush for instance they are not available and pouncing is the only way that answers the patterns after having been transferred to straw or parchment paper have to be pricked through to do this you lay the paper upon cloth or felt and prick out all the lines of the drawing making the holes which should be clear and round all exactly the same distance apart the closer and more complicated the pattern is the finer and closer the holes should be every line of the outline must be carefully pricked out if the paper be sufficiently thin several pouncings can be pricked at the same time and a symmetrical design can be folded together into four and all pricked at once the pricked pattern has next to be tacked upon the material the side from which the pricking was done next to the stuff and the little funnelshaped holes uppermost paper and stuff must be firmly fastened down and kept in position by drawing pins so that neither of them may move during the process otherwise you will have double lines on the stuff which you will find very confusing afterwards for the pouncing use either powdered chalk or charcoal according to whether the stuff be dark or light in colour dip the pouncing implement a thing like a small drumstick stuffed and covered with cloth into the powder and rub it lightly over the whole surface of the pricked pattern so that the powder penetrates through the pinholes to the stuff in default of a proper pouncing implement take a small stripe of cloth roll it up round a stick and wind a string round and dip this into the powder when the powder has penetrated to the stuff remove the paper and if the pattern is to be repeated lay it on again further on taking care to make the lines meet exactly so that the join may not be seen when you have finished the pouncing and taken off the paper you proceed to draw or rather paint in the pattern with watercolour paints ackermanns are the best for the purpose no others as far as our experience has proved adhere so well to even the roughest fabrics or so little affect the brilliancy of the embroidery thread four paints blue black yellow and white are sufficient for all purposes whatever the colour of the stuff may be on a smooth surface the tracing may be done with a pen but a small sablehair brush is preferable under all circumstances the rougher and more hairy the surface the finer the brush ought to be in order that the colour may sink well in between the fibres before beginning to paint in the pattern gently blow away all the superfluous powder from the surface this process may be objected to as being an old one which has been superseded by new inventions a resinous powder for instance by the use of which patterns can be fixed as soon as they have been pounced by passing a hot iron over the stuff a sheet of paper having first been laid upon it to protect it or else a mixture of gum and powder which can be dissolved on the stuff itself by the steam of spiritsofwine and various other processes needless to mention here as some are only useful in tracing patterns on a large scale whilst others require a variety of appliances not as a rule within the reach of those to whom needlework is a simple recreation the preparation of the stuffs and the subdivision of the patternslong years of experience and practice have brought us in contact with a good many designers many of them artists in their way so long as it was only a question of putting their own compositions on paper but who yet found themselves confronted by real difficulties the moment they were called upon to transfer them to stuff we shall as far as possible point out to our readers the precautions to be taken in tracing patterns and must for that purpose go back to one of the first operations namely that of pricking to begin with the paper on which the pattern is should always be large enough for there to be a clear margin of from 4 to 5 cm all round the pattern so that the pouncing instrument may never come in contact with the stuff beneath in transferring patterns to stuff no lines of division should ever be made directly upon it either with lead chalk or charcoal as it is hardly ever possible entirely to obliterate them and they often become very confusing afterwards before beginning the tracing divide your stuff into four then decide what the width of the border outside the pattern is to be it is quite an exceptional thing to carry a pattern right up to the edge stuffs that will take a bend such as all linen and cotton textures can be folded in four like the paper the folds ought then to be pinched and pressed down so that the lines may remain clear and distinct until the tracing be finished after dividing it into four mark out the diagonal lines these are absolutely necessary in order to get the corner figures rightly placed though most of our readers know how to make these lines on paper with a pencil and ruler few easy as it is know how to make them upon stuff you have only to fold over the corner of your piece of stuff so that the outside thread of the warp or cut edge run parallel with the woof edge which marks the angle of the foldover this double folding over divides the ground into 8 parts to arrange for the outside border or margin is easy enough if the stuff and the kind of work you are going to do upon it admit of the drawing out of threads as then a thread drawn out each way serves as a guide for tracing the pattern straight to the line of the stuff it is often better however not to draw out the threads for an openwork border till the pattern be traced if you do not wish or are not able to draw out threads to mark the pattern and you are working on a stuff of which the threads can be counted follow the directions given on page 128 and explained in fig 252 you cannot mark cloth silk stuffs or plush by folding them in the above way cloth and some kinds of silken textures will not take a bend and others that will would be spoiled by it all such stuffs should be mounted in a frame before the pattern be traced and the ground be then divided out in the following way take a strong thread make a knot at one end stick a pin into it and tighten the knot round it with a pair of compasses divide one of the sides into two equal parts stick the pin with the knot round it in at the middle and the same on the opposite side putting in a second pin by means of which you stretch the thread carry other threads across in a similar way in the width of the stuff and from corner to corner and you will have your ground correctly marked out in such a manner as to leave no marks when after pouncing in the pattern you remove the threads before finishing the pouncing of a pattern see that it is the right size for the purpose it is intended for supposing that you are tracing a border with a corner you should measure the length it will occupy and then by a very light pouncing you can mark the points from which the pattern will have to be repeated it may be that a gap will be left in the middle which if not too large can be got rid of without altering the pattern by pushing the whole thing a little further in and so shortening the distance between the two corners should the gap however be too large for this you will have to make a supplementary design to fill up the place the same thing would be necessary in the case of your having to shorten a pattern to transpose and repeat patterns by means of lookingglasses fig 885we have referred to the necessity that often occurs of adapting patterns to certain given proportions this can in most cases be done easily enough without the help of a draughtsman especially in the case of cross stitch embroideries by means of two unframed lookingglasses penelope mirrors as they are called used in the following manner if you want to utilize a piece only of a straight border or after repeating it several times to form a corner with it you place the mirror in the first instance across it at right angles at the place from which the pattern is to be repeated and then exactly diagonally inwards to make a square out of a straight pattern you take two mirrors and so place them that they touch at the point where the diagonal lines meet as represented in fig 885 and you have your square at once this is all easy enough but before beginning any large piece of work it is necessary to consider carefully which parts of the drawing will best fill the centre and which are best suited to form the corners as it is not every part of a straight pattern that is adapted for repetition a few preliminary trials with the help of the mirrors will better show the importance of these explanations than anything further we can say on the subject illustration fig 885 to transpose and repeat a straight pattern by means of looking glasses to alter the proportions of a pattern by dividing the ground into squares figs 886 and 887cases will occur where it will be found necessary to subject the pattern to greater modifications still than those we have hitherto been dealing with you want for example to embroider a rather large running ground pattern on a piece of stuff that is relatively too small for the subject or a small and rather minute pattern on a large surface on which it is likely to look either too insignificant or too crowded and confused and the chances are if you do not know how to draw you will either think it necessary to get a draughtsman to help you or you will give up the piece of work altogether deterred by the difficulties that confront you you need not do either if you will follow the directions here given take a sheet of largesized quadrille paper which if necessary you can prepare for yourself trace your pattern upon it or rule the squares direct upon the drawing as shown in fig 886 illustration fig 886 dividing the ground into squares before copying on a second sheet of vegetable paper rule squares a fourth a third or half as small again as those on the first sheet thus if the sides of the first squares be 15 mm long and you want to reduce your pattern by one fifth the sides of your new squares should measure only 12 mm if on the contrary you want to enlarge the pattern by one fifth make the sides of your squares 18 mm long then you follow square by square the lines of the drawing extending or contracting them according to whether the pattern is to be enlarged or diminished to copy a pattern directly from a piece of embroidery and enlarge or diminish it at the same time proceed as follows fix the embroidery on a board stretching it equally in every direction then measure the length of the drawing divide the centimetres by the number of units corresponding to whatever the proportions of your copy are to be and if there be any fractions of centimetres over subdivide them into millimetres if necessary into half millimetres and make your division by whatever measure you have adopted take a pair of compasses with dry points open them sufficiently for the opening to correspond to the number and the distance obtained by the division plant a pin with a thread fastened to it at the point indicated by the point of the compasses and repeat the last operation all along one side of the embroidery and if possible a little beyond it so that it may not be defaced by the marks of the pins all you now have to do is to pull the threads in perfectly straight lines to the opposite side and carry other threads across them in a similar manner so that the whole surface be divided into squares illustration fig 887 pattern reduced by marking out the ground in small squares it is needless to say that if you have to trace a pattern from a mounted piece of work you cannot stretch it on a board with a little invention however some way can always be found of planting the pins so as not to injure the work illustration fig 888 pattern in soutache original size illustration fig 889 pattern in fig 888 drawn out in the width illustration fig 890 pattern in fig 888 compressed in the width to alter the width of a pattern retaining the original height figs 888 889 890sometimes it is necessary to lengthen out a pattern without however altering its height in this case you modify the shape of the square and make long or narrow squares according to the general shape of the design you wish to reproduce fig 888 represents a pattern in soutache dmc marked out in squares in fig 889 the squares are lengthened out a third beyond their original size and the pattern is expanded in fig 890 the squares are compressed to a third less than their original size this method of subdividing patterns greatly facilitates the alterations they have so often to undergo and we are sure that there are few amongst those who have any real aptitude for needlework who cannot draw enough to be able to copy the contents of a square to prepare the paste for appliqu workit may seem strange to devote a separate paragraph to such an apparently simple operation but in appliqu work it is a most important one as not only the stuff on which the work is done but all the expensive accessories are liable to be spoilt by paste that has been badly prepared put some wheaten not rice starch into a vessel with a rounded bottom pour on just enough water to dissolve the starch and stir it with a wooden spoon till it becomes perfectly smooth in the meantime put about of a pint of clean water on the fire to boil and when it boils add to it a little powdered pitch or carpenters glue in quantity about the size of a pea and pour in the starch stirring it the whole time when the mixture has boiled up several times take it off the fire and go on stirring it till it gets cold otherwise lumps will form in it which as we specially pointed out in the preceding chapter must never be allowed to get in between the stuff and the paper this kind of paste makes no spots and does not injure even the most delicate colours as it contains no acid in winter it will keep for several days but in hot weather it very soon begins to ferment and should then on no account be used gum arabic ought never to be used for appliqu work as it becomes so hard that it is impossible to get the needle through whilst the saccharine it contains almost always causes ugly spots to appear in the stuff when it dries when the work is finished it is a good plan to spread a very thin layer of paste over the entire back of it with a fine brush made of hogs bristles and not to take it out of the frame until it is perfectly dry to stiffen new needleworkin the chapter on irish lace page 441 we said that new needlework of that kind had to be ironed this should be done in the following manner when the lace has been taken off its foundation lay it face downwards on a piece of fine white flannel then dip a piece of very stiff new organdie muslin into water take it out again almost immediately and wring it slightly so that no drops may fall from it and then dab the wrong side of the lace all over with this pad of damp muslin and iron it with a hot iron which should be moved slowly forwards so that the moisture which the organdie has imparted to the lace may evaporate slowly not until you are quite sure that the lace is dry should it be taken off the board there is no better way than this of giving new lace that almost imperceptible degree of stiffness by which alone it is often to be distinguished from old water only does not stiffen the thread sufficiently and it is difficult with starch to hit upon exactly the right consistency whereas the organdie muslin supplies just the needful quantity embroidered network can be stiffened in the same manner and should be damped in the frame on the wrong side and not taken off until it is quite dry we even recommend embroidery on linen being treated in the same way but when the linen is very creased cover it with a damp cloth and iron upon that first then take the cloth away and iron the embroidery itself so as to dry it completely to wash ordinary lacewind it round a bottle the same width top and bottom and cover it entirely with muslin fastened to the lace by a few stitches fill the bottle half full of sand so that it may not get knocked about too violently when the water boils immerse the bottle in a saucepan of cold water with a piece of soap the size of a nut in it and if the lace be very dirty a small pinch of salt and let it boil for about an hour pouring off the water as it gets dirty and adding clean when all the dirt has been boiled out of the lace which you will know to be the case when the water remains perfectly clear rinse out the soap before you take the lace off the bottle by plunging it into cold water to wash real lacethe process is the same as the above but as real lace is so seldom washed and is generally very yellow and fragile particularly if it has been roughly used it is rather difficult to clean if stained or greasy it should be left to soak for some hours or even days in good olive oil this restores to the thread that softness and smoothness which use and bad washing had impaired after the oil bath it should be washed on a bottle in the manner already described to stiffen lacedip the lace when perfectly dry in thin starch prepared as follows take as much fine wheaten starch as you think you will require divide it into two portions and dissolve both in cold water boil the one portion and when it has so far cooled as to have ceased to steam stir the cold starch into it and dilute the whole with cold water to the consistency of thick cream if the lace is to be slightly coloured add a few drops of black coffee or dilute the starch with weak tea or guimauve water the coffee will give it a dark cream colour either of the latter a pale greenish hue dip the lace in the mixture and squeeze it out gently without wringing it to get rid of all the superfluous liquid then lay it flat on the left hand and beat it for a few minutes with the right to work the starch well in repeat the whole process twice then roll the lace in fine linen and leave it there till you are ready to iron or pin it out as the case may be to iron laceafter the lace has lain for an hour or two in the cloth iron it if it be machinemade and if it be irish guipure or real point lace of any sort pin it out before you begin to iron hold the lace tight in your left hand by the footing and with the right hand pull out all the picots along the edge of the lace to an equal length then lay it out flat upon a board covered with white flannel and iron it with a moderately hot iron passing the iron backwards and forwards over it until it be quite dry if creases should come in the ironing where they ought not to be dab them over lightly with a sponge moistened with water and a few drops of starch and pass the iron over them again after ironing the whole length of lace pull it out crossways from left to right and from right to left and iron it all over once more this does away with the artificial stiffness and gives it the agreeable softness and pliancy of new lace to pin out lacein order to pin out lace in a thoroughly satisfactory manner you should provide yourself with a wooden drum about 30 cm high and from 50 to 60 cm in diameter large enough to rest upon the knees the outside circumference of the wood should be padded and covered with grey or white ticking the pins must be exactly the size of the picots they are to pin down you will require extremely fine ones for valenciennes and coarser for other kinds of lace steel pins are of no use whatever because of their liability to rust cover the cylinder with blue paper less trying for the eyes than any other and take only just as much lace out of the damp cloth as you are likely to be able to pin out before it gets dry keeping the remainder covered up lay the lace upon the drum and pin the footing down first in a straight line sticking the pins in pretty closely and at regular distances apart then pin down each picot separately taking care not to open them if they have kept their original shape and to shut them up by twisting them if they have got untwisted if you find the pinning out troublesome and cannot get it all done before the lace dries damp the picots with a sponge as you proceed lace should never be pinned out when it is dry as the threads of the picots are then very apt to break and torn picots destroy the value of even the choicest lace raised lace has to be stamped out from the wrong side with a lace awl or kind of pricker of bone made for the purpose some professional lacecleaners use this implement even for valenciennes lace but we cannot recommend it seeing that it is a lace that is by nature perfectly flat let the length of lace you have pinned out remain on the drum till it be quite dry if you have several yards to pin out wind it round and round the cylinder cover up the lace as you proceed and put each length away as soon as it is ready in a blue paper bag so as to keep the whole perfectly clean in conclusion we may remark that the cleaning of lace should only be undertaken when you are fairly sure of not being interrupted as more especially the pinning requires to be finished off as quickly as possible to wash coloured cottons and work done with the samein order to test the fastness of the dyes untie the skeins and pour boiling water upon them leave them to soak for about a quarter of an hour soap and rub them lightly with the hand from end to end and rinse them out thoroughly in as many changes of cold water as may be found necessary until the water remain perfectly colourless squeeze out all the water you can and let them dry quickly without exposing them to the sun coloured cottons are often washed in vinegar because it is supposed to affect the colour less than water does we have come to the conclusion after several trials that this is a delusion for the good dyes keep their colour without the aid of vinegar and the bad ones wash out in spite of it the fast colours lose none of their beauty in the process nor does it affect the quality of the cotton any excess of colouring matter which the fibres of the cotton may have absorbed in the process of dyeing is got rid of by this means if a piece of work has been done with unwashed cottons and the colours run in the first washing you have only to rinse it out in several changes of tepid water to restore it to its original freshness and if you want to give it a yellowish tinge it should be dipped it in weak tea or coffee materialsit was stated in the preface that our readers would find the choice of colours and material rendered comparatively easy to them by the notes affixed to the illustrations but these notes in spite of all the care bestowed upon them must still have remained very incomplete had it not been for the following tables which we were fortunately enabled to append to our work and which will help every one to choose their own materials without having them actually before them the strokes that are affixed to each number indicate the exact size of the thread so that to find out the number you want to buy you have but to lay your pattern thread stretching it slightly on the strokes in succession till you come to the one that matches it in size with regard to the colours the names and shades of which have been classed in the second table with the greatest care and of which our workers have no less than 460 to choose from 3 all those referred to in connection with our illustrations are quite fast dyes 4 save in a few instances in which we were forced to make an exception in favour of a doubtful colour to secure a harmonious effect a complete table of colours must of necessity include certain more or less staring shades which though they may not be to every ones taste cannot on that account be left out we conclude our work with the wellmeant and by no means useless recommendation to our readers never to begin a piece of work of any considerable size without first making sure that the colours they intend to use are fast and providing themselves with a larger supply of materials than even on a close calculation they think they are likely to require lest they should find themselves under the disagreeable necessity of having either to leave their work unfinished or finish it with materials that do not match there is generally a slight difference in tone between cottons that have been bought at different times and there is also a reasonable likelihood considering their great variety of some mistake being made in the number by either buyer or seller in ordering a fresh supply
