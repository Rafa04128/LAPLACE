revised with many additional illustrations may 1897 general preface this series of monographs has been planned to supply visitors to the great english cathedrals with accurate and well illustrated guide books at a popular price the aim of each writer has been to produce a work compiled with sufficient knowledge and scholarship to be of value to the student of archology and history and yet not too technical in language for the use of an ordinary visitor or tourist to specify all the authorities which have been made use of in each case would be difficult and tedious in this place but amongst the general sources of information which have been almost invariably found useful arefirstly the great county histories the value of which especially in questions of genealogy and local records is generally recognized secondly the numerous papers by experts which appear from time to time in the transactions of the antiquarian and archological societies thirdly the important documents made accessible in the series issued by the master of the rolls fourthly the wellknown works of britton and willis on the english cathedrals and lastly the very excellent series of handbooks to the cathedrals originated by the late mr john murray to which the reader may in most cases be referred for fuller detail especially in reference to the histories of the respective sees gleeson white ef

from a photograph by carl norman and co canterbury cathedral chapter i the history of the building more than four hundred years passed by between the beginning of the building of this cathedral by archbishop lanfranc 10701089 and its completion by the addition of the great central tower at the end of the fifteenth century but before tracing the history of the construction of the present wellknown fabric a few words will not be out of place concerning the church which preceded it on the same site a british or roman church said to have been built by a certain mythical king lucius was given to st augustine by ethelbert in ad 597 it was designed broadly speaking on the plan of the old basilica of st peter at rome but as to the latest date of any alterations which may or may not have been made by augustine and his immediate successors we have no accurate information it is however definitely stated that archbishop odo who held the see from ad 942959 raised the walls and rebuilt the roof in the course of these alterations the church was roofless for three years and we are told that no rain fell within the precincts during this time in ad 1011 canterbury was pillaged by the danes who carried off archbishop alphege to greenwich butchered the monks and did much damage to the church the building was however restored by canute who made further atonement by hanging up his crown within its walls and bringing back the body of alphege who had been martyred by the danes in the year 1067 the storms of the norman conquest overwhelmed st augustines church which was completely destroyed by fire together with many royal deeds of privilege and papal bulls and other valuable documents a description of the church thus destroyed is given by prof willis who quotes all the ancient writers who mention it the chief authority is eadmer who was a boy at the monastery school when the saxon church was pulled down and was afterwards a monk and singer in the cathedral it is he who tells us that it was arranged in some parts in imitation of the church of st peter at rome odo had translated the body of wilfrid archbishop of york from ripon to canterbury and had worthily placed it in a more lofty receptacle to use his own words that is to say in the great altar which was constructed of rough stones and mortar close to the wall at the eastern part of the presbytery afterwards another altar was placed at a convenient distance before the aforesaid altar in this altar the blessed elphege had solemnly deposited the head of st swithin and also many relics of other saints to reach these altars a certain crypt which the romans call a confessionary had to be ascended by means of several steps from the choir of the singers this crypt was fabricated beneath in the likeness of the confessionary of st peter the vault of which was raised so high that the part above could only be reached by many steps the restingplace of st dunstan was separated from the crypt itself by a strong wall for that most holy father was interred before the aforesaid steps at a great depth in the ground and at the head of the saint stood the matutinal altar thence the choir of the singers was extended westward into the body of the church in the next place beyond the middle of the length of the body there were two towers which projected beyond the aisles of the church the south tower had an altar in the midst of it which was dedicated in honour of the blessed pope gregory opposite to this tower and on the north the other tower was built in honour of the blessed martin and had about it cloisters for the use of the monks the extremity of the church was adorned by the oratory of mary at its eastern part there was an altar consecrated to the worship of that lady when the priest performed the divine mysteries at this altar he had his face turned to the east behind him to the west was the pontifical chair constructed with handsome workmanship and of large stones and cement and far removed from the lords table being contiguous to the wall of the church which embraced the entire area of the building lanfranc the first norman archbishop was granted the see in 1070 he quickly set about the task of building himself a cathedral making no attempt to restore the old fabric he even destroyed what was left of the monastic building and built up an entirely new church and monastery seven years sufficed to complete his cathedral which stood on the same ground as the earlier fane his work however was not long left undisturbed it had not stood for twenty years before the east end of the church was pulled down during the archiepiscopate of anselm and rebuilt in a much more splendid style by ernulph the prior of the monastery conrad who succeeded ernulph as prior finished the choir decorating it with great magnificence and in the course of his reconstruction nearly doubling the area of the building thus completed anew the cathedral was dedicated by archbishop william in ad 1130 at this notable ceremony the kings of england and scotland both assisted as well as all the english bishops forty years later this church was the scene of thomas beckets murder ad 1170 and it was in conrads choir that the monks watched over his body during the night after his death eadmer also gives some description of the church raised by lanfranc the new archbishop filled with consternation when he found that the church of the saviour which he undertakes to rule was reduced to almost nothing by fire and ruin proceeded to set about to destroy it utterly and erect a more noble one and in the space of seven years he raised this new church from the very foundations and rendered it nearly perfect archbishop anselm who succeeded lanfranc appointed ernulf to be prior having taken down the eastern part of the church which lanfranc had built he erected it so much more magnificently that nothing like it could be seen in england either for the brilliancy of its glass windows the beauty of its marble pavement or the many coloured pictures which led the wondering eyes to the very summit of the ceiling it was this part of the church however that was completed by ernulfs successor conrad and afterwards known as conrads choir it appears that anselm allowed the monks to manage their own affairs and gave them for priors ernulf and then conrad both monks of their own monastery and thus it happened that in addition to the general prosperity and good order of their property which resulted from this freedom they were enabled to enlarge their church by all that part which stretches from the great tower to the east which work anselm himself provided for having granted to the said church the revenues of his town of peckham for seven years the whole of which were expended upon the new work prof willis unable to account for the haste with which the east end of lanfrancs church was pulled down assumes that the monks did not think their church large enough for the importance of their monastery and moreover wanted shrineroom for the display of relics the main body of lanfrancs church was left standing and is described as follows by gervase the tower raised upon great pillars is placed in the midst of the church like the centre in the middle of a circle it had on its apex a gilt cherub on the west of the tower is the nave of the church supported on either side upon eight pillars two lofty towers with gilded pinnacles terminate this nave or aula a gilded corona hangs in the midst of the church a screen with a loft pulpitum separated in a manner the aforesaid tower from the nave and had in the middle and on the side towards the nave the altar of the holy cross above the pulpitum and placed across the church was the beam which sustained a great cross two cherubim and the images of st mary and st john the apostle the great tower had a cross from each side to wit a south cross and a north cross each of which had in the midst a strong pillar this pillar sustained a vault which proceeded from the walls on three of its sides etc prof willis considers that as far as these parts of the building are concerned the present fabric stands exactly on the site of lanfrancs in the existing building he says it happens that the nave and transepts have been transformed into the perpendicular style of the fourteenth century and the central tower carried up to about double its original altitude in the same style nevertheless indications may be detected that these changed parts stand upon the old foundations of lanfranc the building however was not destined to remain long intact in ad 1174 the whole of conrads choir was destroyed by a fire which was described fully by gervase a monk who witnessed it he gives an extraordinary account of the rage and grief of the people at the sight of the burning cathedral the work of rebuilding was immediately set on foot in september 1174 one william of sens undertook the task and wrought thereat until 1178 when he was disabled by an unfortunate fall from a scaffolding and had to give up his charge and return to france another william an englishman this time took up the direction of the work and under his supervision the choir and eastern portion of the church were finished in ad 1184 further alterations were made under prior chillenden at the end of the fourteenth century lanfrancs nave was pulled down and a new nave and transepts were constructed leaving but little of the original building set up by the first norman archbishop finally about ad 1495 the cathedral was completed by the addition of the great central tower illustration plan of canterbury cathedral about ad 1165 from a norman drawing inserted in the great psalter of eadwin in the library of trinity college cambridge first published in vetusta monumenta society of antiquaries 1755 for full description and a plan of the waterworks see archologia cantiana vol vii 1868 during the four centuries which passed during the construction and reconstruction of the fabric considerable changes had manifested themselves in the science and art of architecture hence it is that canterbury cathedral is a history written in solid stone of architectural progress illustrating in itself almost all the various kinds of the style commonly called pointed of these the earliest form of gothic and perpendicular chiefly predominate the shape and arrangement of the building was doubtless largely influenced by the extraordinary number of precious relics which it contained and which had to be properly displayed and fittingly enshrined augustines church had possessed the bodies of st blaize and st wilfrid brought respectively from rome and from ripon of st dunstan st alphege and st ouen as well as the heads of st swithin and st furseus and the arm of st bartholomew these were all carefully removed and placed each in separate altars and chapels in lanfrancs new cathedral here their number was added to by the acquisition of new relics and sacred treasures as time went on and finally canterbury enshrined its chiefest glory the hallowed body of st thomas becket who was martyred within its walls since owing to an almost incredible act of royal vindictiveness in ad 1538 beckets glorious shrine belongs only to the history of the past some account of its splendours will not be out of place in this part of our account of the cathedral it stood on the site of the ancient chapel of the trinity which was burnt down along with conrads choir in the destructive fire of ad 1174 it was in this chapel that thomas becket had first solemnized mass after becoming archbishop for this reason as we may fairly suppose this position was chosen to enshrine the martyrs bones after the rebuilding of the injured portion of the fabric though the shrine itself has been ruthlessly destroyed a mosaic pavement similar to that which may be seen round the tomb of edward the confessor in westminster abbey marks the exact spot on which it stood the mosaic is of the kind with which the floors of the roman basilicas were generally adorned and contains signs of the zodiacs and emblems of virtues and vices this pavement was directly in front of the west side of the shrine on each side of the site is a deep mark in the pavement running towards the east this indentation was certainly worn in the soft pinkish marble by the knees of generations of pilgrims who prostrated themselves here while the treasures were displayed to their gaze in the roof above there is fixed a crescent carved out of some foreign wood which has proved deeply puzzling to antiquaries a suggestion which hardly seems very plausible connects this mysterious crescent with the fact that becket was closely related as patron with the hospital of st john at acre it was believed that his prayers had once repulsed the saracens from the walls of the fortress and he received the title of st thomas acrensis near this crescent a number of iron staples were to be seen at one time and it is likely that a trophy of some sort depended from them the watching tower was set high upon the tower of st anselm on the south side of the shrine it contained a fireplace so that the watchman might keep himself warm during the winter nights and from a gallery between the pillars he commanded a view of the sacred spot and its treasures a troop of fierce bandogs shared the task of guarding the shrine from theft how necessary such precautions were is shown by the fact that such a spot had to be guarded not only from common robbers in search of rich booty but also from holy men who were quite unscrupulous in their desire to possess themselves and their own churches of sacred relics within the first six years after beckets death we read of two striking instances of the lengths to which distinguished churchmen were carried by what dean stanley calls the first frenzy of desire for the relics of st thomas benedict a monk of christ church and probably the most distinguished of his body was created abbot of peterburgh in ad 1176 disappointed to find that his cathedral was very poor in the matter of relics he returned to canterbury took away with him the flagstones immediately surrounding the sacred spot with which he formed two altars in the conventual church of his new appointment besides two vases of blood and parts of beckets clothing still more striking and characteristic of the prevalent passion for relics is the story of roger who was keeper of the altars of the martyrdom or custos martyrii the brothers of st augustines abbey were so eager to obtain a share in the glory which their great rival the neighbouring cathedral had won from the circumstances of beckets martyrdom within its walls that they actually offered roger no less a reward than the position of abbot in their own institution on condition that he should purloin for them some part of the remains of the martyrs skull and not only did roger though he had been specially selected from amongst the monks of christ church to watch over this very treasure agree to their conditions and after duly carrying out this piece of sacrilegious burglary become abbot of st augustines but the chroniclers of the abbey were not ashamed to boast of this transaction as an instance of cleverness and wellapplied zeal the translation of beckets remains from the tomb to his shrine took place ad 1220 fifty years after his martyrdom the young henry iii who had just laid the foundation of the new abbey at westminster assisted at the ceremony the primate then ruling at canterbury was the great stephen langton who had won renown both as a scholar and a statesman he had carried out the division of the bible into chapters as it is now arranged and had won a decisive victory for english liberty by forcing king john to sign the great charter he was now advanced in years and had recently assisted at the coronation of king henry at westminster the translation was carried out with imposing ceremony the scene must have been one of surpassing splendour never had such an assemblage been gathered together in england robert of gloucester relates that not only canterbury but the surrounding countryside was full to overflowing of bishops and abbots priors and parsons of earls and of barons and of many knights thereto of serjeants and of squires and of husbandmen enow and of simple men eke of the landso thick thither drew the archbishop had given notice two years before proclaiming the day of the solemnity throughout europe as well as england the episcopal manors had been bidden to furnish provisions for the huge concourse not only in the cathedral city but along all the roads by which it was approached hay and provisions were given to all who asked it between london and canterbury at the gates of the city and in the four licensed cellars tuns of wine were set up that all who thirsted might drink freely and wine ran in the street channels on the day of the festival during the night before the ceremony the primate together with the bishop of salisbury and all the members of the brotherhood who were headed by walter the prior solemnly with psalms and hymns entered the crypt in which the martyrs body lay and removed the stones which covered the tomb four priests specially conspicuous for their piety were selected to take out the relics which were then placed in a strong coffer studded with iron nails and fastened with iron hasps next day a procession was formed headed by the young king henry iii after him came pandulf the italian bishop of norwich and papal nuncio and langton the archbishop with whom was the archbishop of rheims primate of france the great hubert de burgh lord high justiciary together with four other barons completed the company which was selected to bear the chest to its restingplace when this had been duly deposited a solemn mass was celebrated by the french archbishop the anniversary of this great festival was commemorated as the feast of the translation of the blessed st thomas until it was suppressed by a royal injunction of henry viii in 1536 a picture of the shrine itself is preserved among the cottonian mss and a representation of it also exists in one of the stained windows of the cathedral at the end of it the altar of the saint had its place the lower part of its walls were of stone and against them the lame and diseased pilgrims used to rub their bodies hoping to be cured of their afflictions the shrine itself was supported on marble arches and remained concealed under a wooden covering doubtless intended to enhance the effect produced by the sudden revelation of the glories beneath it for when the pilgrims were duly assembled on their knees round the shrine the cover was suddenly raised at a given signal and though such a device may appear slightly theatrical in these days it is easy to imagine how the devotees of the middle ages must have been thrilled at the sight of this hallowed tomb and all the bravery of gold and precious stones which the piety of that day had heaped upon it the beauties of the shrine were pointed out by the prior who named the giver of the several jewels many of these were of enormous value especially a huge carbuncle as large as an egg which had been offered to the memory of st thomas by louis vii of france who visited the shrine in ad 1179 after having thrice seen the saint in a vision a curious legend thoroughly in keeping with the mystic halo of miraculous power which surrounds the martyred archbishops fame relates that the french king could not make up his mind to part with this invaluable gem which was called the regale of france but when he visited the tomb the stone so runs the story leapt forth from the ring in which it was set and fixed itself of its own will firmly in the wall of the shrine thus baffling the unwilling monarchs halfheartedness louis also presented a gold cup and gave the monks a hundred measures medii of wine to be delivered annually at poissy also ordaining that they should be exempt from toll tax and tallage when journeying in his realm he himself was made a member of the brotherhood after duly spending a night in prayer at the tomb it is said that because he was very fearful of the water the french king received a promise from the saint that neither he nor any other that crossed over from dover to whitsand should suffer any manner of loss or shipwreck we are told that louiss piety was afterwards rewarded by the miraculous recovery through st thomass intercession of his son from a dangerous illness louis was the first of a series of royal pilgrims to the shrine richard the lion heart set free from durance in austria walked thither from sandwich to return thanks to god and st thomas after him all the english kings and all the continental potentates who visited the shores of britain paid due homage and doubtless made due offering at the shrine of the sainted archbishop the crown of scotland was presented in ad 1299 by edward longshanks and henry v gave thanks here after his victory over the french at agincourt emperors both of the east and west humbled themselves before the relics of the famous english martyr henry viii and the emperor charles v came together at whitsuntide ad 1520 in more than royal splendour and with a great retinue of english and spanish noblemen and worshipped at the shrine which had then reached the zenith of its glory but though the stately stories of these royal progresses to the tomb of the martyred archbishop strike the imagination vividly yet the picture presented by chaucers canterbury tales is in reality much more impressive for we find there all ranks of society alike making the pilgrimagethe knight the yeoman the prioress the monk the friar the merchant the scholar from oxford the lawyer the squire the tradesman the cook the shipman the physician the clothier from bath the priest the miller the reeve the manciple the seller of indulgences and lastly the poet himselfall these various sorts and conditions of men and women we find journeying down to canterbury in a sort of motley caravan foreign pilgrims also came to the sacred shrine in great numbers a curious record preserved in a latin translation of the journey of a bohemian noble leo von rotzmital who visited england in 1446 gives a quaint description of canterbury and its approaches sailing up the channel the narrator writes as we drew near to england we saw lofty mountains full of chalk these mountains seem from a distance to be clad with snows on them lies a citadel built by devils a cacodmonibus extructa so stoutly fortified that its peer could not be found in any province of christendom passing by these mountains and citadel we put in at the city of sandwich sandvicum but at nothing did i marvel more greatly than at the sailors climbing up the masts and foretelling the distance and approach of the winds and which sails should be set and which furled among them i saw one sailor so nimble that scarce could any man be compared with him journeying on to canterbury our pilgrim proceeds there we saw the tomb and head of the martyr the tomb is of pure gold and embellished with jewels and so enriched with splendid offerings that i know not its peer among other precious things upon it is beholden the carbuncle jewel which is wont to shine by night half a hens egg in size for that tomb has been lavishly enriched by many kings princes wealthy traders and other righteous men such was canterbury cathedral in the middle ages the resort of emperors kings and all classes of humble folk english and foreign it was in the spring chiefly as chaucer tells us that whanne that april with his showres sote the droughte of march hath perced to the rote and bathed every veine in swiche licour of whiche vertue engendred is the flour when zephyrus eke with his sote brethe enspired hath in every holt and hethe the tendre croppes and the yonge sonne hath in the ram his halfe cours yronne and smale foules maken

londes and specially from every shires ende of englelonde to canterbury they wende the holy blissful martyr for to seke that hem hath holpen when that they were seke the miracles performed by the bones of the blessed martyr are stated by contemporary writers to have been extraordinarily numerous we have it on the authority of gervase that two volumes full of these marvels were preserved at canterbury and in those days a volume meant a tome of formidable dimensions but scarcely any record of these most interesting occurrences has been preserved at the time of henry viiis quarrel with the dead archbishopof which more anonthe name of st thomas and all account of his deeds was erased from every book that the strictest investigation could lay hands on so thoroughly was this spiteful edict carried out that the records of the greatest of english saints are astonishingly meagre a letter however has been preserved written about ad 1390 by richard ii to congratulate the then archbishop william courtenay on a fresh miracle performed by st thomas litera domini regis graciosa missa domino archiepiscopo regraciando sibi de novo miraculo sancti thome martiris sibi denunciato the letter refers in its quaint normanfrench to the good influence that will be exercised by such a manifestation as a practical argument against the various enemies of our faith and beliefnoz foie et creaunce ount plousours enemys these were the lollards and the pious king says that he hopes and believes that they will be brought back to the right path by the effect of this miracle which seems to have been worked to heal a distinguished foreigneren une persone estraunge another document dated ad 1455 preserves the story of the miraculous cure of a young scotsman from aberdeen allexander stephani filius in scocia de aberdyn oppido natus alexander was lame pedibus contractus from his birth we are told that after twentyfour years of pain and discomfortvigintiquatuor annis penaliter laborabathe made a pilgrimage to canterbury and there the sainted thomas the divine clemency aiding him on the second day of the month of may did straightway restore his legs and feet bases et plantas to the same alexander other miracles performed by the saint are pictured in the painted windows of trinity chapel of which we shall treat fully later on the fame of the martyr spread through the whole of christendom stanley tells us that there is probably no country in europe which does not exhibit traces of becket a tooth of his is preserved in the church of san thomaso cantuariense at verona part of an arm in a convent at florence and another part in the church of st waldetrude at mons in fullers time both arms were displayed in the english convent at lisbon while bourbourg preserves his chalice douay his hair shirt and st omer his mitre the cathedral of sens contains his vestments and an ancient altar at which he said mass his story is pictured in the painted windows at chartres and sens and st omer and his figure is to be seen in the church of monreale at palermo in england almost every county contained a church or convent dedicated to st thomas most notable of these was the abbey of aberbrothock raised within seven years after the martyrdom to the memory of the saint by william the lion king of scotland william had been defeated by the english forces on the very day on which henry ii had done penance at the tomb and made his peace with the saint and attributing his misfortunes to the miraculous influence of st thomas endeavoured to propitiate him by the dedication of this magnificent abbey a mutilated image of the saint has been preserved among the ruins of the monastery this is perhaps the most notable of the gifts to st thomas the volume of the offerings which were poured into the canterbury coffers by grateful invalids who had been cured of their ailments and by others who like the scotch king were anxious to propitiate the power of the saint must have been enormous we know that at the beginning of the sixteenth century the yearly offerings though their sums had already greatly diminished were worth about 4000 according to the present value of money the story of the fall of the shrine and the overthrow of the power of the martyr is so remarkable and was so implicitly believed at the time that it cannot be passed over in spite of the doubts which modern criticism casts on its authenticity it is said that in april ad 1538 a writ of summons was issued in the name of king henry viii against thomas becket sometime archbishop of canterbury accusing him of treason contumacy and rebellion this document was read before the martyrs tomb and thirty days were allowed for his answer to the summons as the defendant did not appear the suit was formally tried at westminster the attorney general held a brief for henry ii and the deceased defendant was represented by an advocate named by henry viii needless to relate judgment was given in favour of henry ii and the condemned archbishop was ordered to have his bones burnt and all his gorgeous offerings escheated to the crown the first part of the sentence was remitted and beckets body was buried but he was deprived of the title of saint his images were destroyed throughout the kingdom and his name was erased from all books the shrine was destroyed and the gold and jewels thereof were taken away in twentysix carts henry viii himself wore the regale of france in a ring on his thumb improbable as the story of beckets trial may seem such a procedure was strictly in accordance with the forms of the roman catholic church of which henry still at that time professed himself a member moreover it is not without authentic parallels in history exactly the same measures of reprisal had been taken against wycliffe at lutterworth and queen mary shortly afterwards acted in a similar manner towards bucer and fagius at cambridge the last recorded pilgrim to the shrine of st thomas was madame de montreuil a great french dame who had been waiting on mary of guise in scotland she visited canterbury in august ad 1538 and we are told that she was taken to see the wonders of the place and marvelled at all the riches thereof and said that if she had not seen it all the men in the world could never a made her believe it though she would not kiss the head of st thomas the prior did send her a present of coneys capons chickens with divers fruitsplentyinsomuch that she said what shall we do with so many capons let the lord prior come and eat and help us to eat them tomorrow at dinner and so thanked him heartily for the said present such was the history of beckets shrine we have dwelt on it at some length because it is no exaggeration to say that in the middle ages canterbury cathedral owed its european fame and enormous riches to the fact that it contained the shrine within its walls and because the story of the influence of the saint and the miracles that he worked and the millions of pilgrims who flocked from the whole civilized world to do homage to him throws a brighter and more vivid light on the lives and thoughts and beliefs of medival men than many volumes stuffed with historical research no visitor to canterbury can appreciate what he sees unless he realizes to some extent the glamour which overhung the resting place of st thomas in the days of geoffrey chaucer we have no certain knowledge as to whether the other shrines and relics which enriched the cathedral were destroyed along with those of st thomas dunstan and elphege at least can hardly have escaped and it is probable that most of the monuments and relics perished at the time of the reformation we know that in ad 1541 cranmer deplored the slight effect which had been wrought by the royal orders for the destruction of the bones and images of supposed saints and that he forthwith received letters from the king enjoining him to cause due search to be made in his cathedral churches and if any shrine covering of shrine table monument of miracles or other pilgrimage do there continue to cause it to be taken away so as there remain no memory of it this order probably brought about the destruction of the tombs and monuments of the early archbishops most of whom had been officially canonised or been at least enrolled in the popular calendar and were accordingly doomed to have their restingplaces desecrated we know that about this time the tomb of winchelsey was destroyed because he was adored by the people as a reputed saint any monuments that may have escaped royal vandalism at the reformation period fell before the even more effective fanaticism of the puritans who seem to have exercised their iconoclastic energies with especial zeal and vigour at canterbury just before their time archbishop laud spent a good deal of trouble and money on the adornment of the high altar a letter to him from the dean dated july 8th ad 1634 is quoted by prynne we have obeyed your graces direction in pulling down the exorbitant seates within our quire whereby the church is very much beautified lastly wee most humbly beseech your grace to take notice that many and most necessary have beene the occasions of extraordinary expences this yeare for ornaments etc and another puritan scribe tells us that at the east end of the cathedral they have placed an altar as they call it dressed after the romish fashion for which altar they have lately provided a most idolatrous costly glory cloth or back cloth these embellishments were not destined to remain long undisturbed in ad 1642 the puritan troopers hewed the altarrails to pieces and then threw the altar over and over down the three altar steps and left it lying with the heels upwards this was only the beginning we read that during the time of the great rebellion the newly erected font was pulled down the inscriptions figures and coats of arms engraven upon brass were torn off from the ancient monuments and whatsoever there was of beauty or decency in the holy place was despoiled a manuscript compiled in 1662 and preserved in the chapter library gives a more minute account of this work of destruction the windows were generally battered and broken down the whole roof with that of the steeples the chapterhouse and cloister externally impaired and ruined both in timberwork and lead watertanks pipes and much other lead cut off the choir stripped and robbed of her fair and goodly hangings the organ and organloft communiontable and the best and chiefest of the furniture with the rail before it and the screen of tabernacle work richly overlaid with gold behind it goodly monuments shamefully abused defaced and rifled of brasses iron grates and bars the ringleader in this work of destruction was a fanatic named richard culmer commonly known as blue dick a paper preserved in the chapter library in the writing of somner the great antiquarian scholar describes the state in which the fabric of the cathedral was left at the time of the restoration of king charles ii in 1660 so little says this document had the fury of the late reformers left remaining of it besides the bare walles and roofe and these partly through neglect and partly by the daily assaults and batteries of the disaffected so shattered ruinated and defaced as it was not more unserviceable in the way of a cathedral than justly scandalous to all who delight to serve god in the beauty of holines most of the windows had been broken the churchs guardians her faire and strong gates turned off the hooks and burned the buildings and houses of the clergy had been pulled down or greatly damaged and lastly the goodly oaks in our common gardens of good value in themselves and in their time very beneficial to our church by their shelter quite eradicated and set to sale this last touch is interesting as showing that the reforming zeal of the puritans was not always altogether disinterested after the restoration some attempt was made to render the cathedral once more a fitting place of worship and the sum of 10000 was devoted to repairs and other public and pious uses a screen was put up in the same position as the former one and the altar was placed in front but in ad 1729 this screen no longer suited the taste of the period and a sum of 500 bequeathed by one of the prebendaries was devoted to the erection of a screen in the corinthian style designed by a certain mr burrough afterwards master of caius college cambridge a little before this time the old stalls which had survived the puritan period were replaced a writer describes them in the early half of the seventeenth century as standing in two rows an upper and lower on each side with the archbishops wood throne above them on the south side this chair he mentions as sometime richly guilt and otherwise well set forth but now nothing specious through age and late neglect it is a close seat made after the old fashion of such stalls called thence faldistoria only in this they differ that they were moveable this is fixt thus wrote somner in ad 1640 the dilapidated throne of which he speaks was replaced in ad 1704 by a splendid throne with a tall corinthian canopy and decorated with carving by grinling gibbons the gift of archbishop tenison who also set up new stalls at the same time queen mary the second presented new and magnificent furniture for the altar throne stalls of the chief clergy and pulpit since then many alterations have been made the old altar and screen have been removed and a new reredos set up copied from the screen work of the lady chapel in the crypt and archbishop tenisons throne has given place to a lofty stone canopy in 1834 owing to its tottering condition the northwest tower of the nave had to be pulled down it was rebuilt on an entirely different plan by mr george austin who with his son also conducted a good deal of repairing and other work in the cathedral and the buildings connected with it a good deal of the external stonework had to be renewed but the work was carried out judiciously and only where it was absolutely necessary on the west side of the south transept a turret has been pulled down and set up again stone by stone the crypt has been cleared out and restored and its windows have been reopened the least satisfactory evidences of the modern hand are the stained glass windows which have been put up in the nave and transepts of the cathedral the puritan trooper had wrought havoc in the ancient glass smashing it wherever a pikethrust could reach and modern piety has been almost as ruthless in erecting windows which are quite incredibly hideous in september 1872 canterbury was once more damaged by fire just about seven hundred years after the memorable conflagration described by gervase on this occasion however the damage did not go beyond the outer roof of the trinity chapel the fire broke out at about halfpast ten in the morning and was luckily discovered before it had made much progress by two plumbers who were at work in the south gutter according to the builder of that month a peculiar whirring noise caused them to look inside the roof and they found three of the main rooftimbers blazing the best conjecture seems to be that the dry twigs straw and similar dbris carried into the roof by birds and which it has been the custom to clear at intervals out of the vault pockets had caught fire from a spark that had in some way passed through the roof covering perhaps under a sheet raised a little at the bottom by the wind assistance was quickly summoned and by halfpast twelve the whole was seen to be extinguished at four oclock the authorities held the evening service so as not to break a continuity of custom extending over centuries and in the smokefilled choir the whole of the chapter in residence in the proper psalm xviii found expression for the sense of victory over a conquered enemy thus little harm was done but it must have been an exciting crisis while it lasted the bosses of the vaulting pierced with cradleholes happened to be wellplaced for the passage of the liquid lead dripping on the back of the vault from the blazing roof which poured down on to the pavement below on the very spot which beckets shrine had once occupied through the holes further westward water came sufficient to float over the surfaces of the polished purbeck marble floor and the steps of the altar and alarmed the wellintentioned assistants into removing the altar tearing up the altarrails etc etc the relics of the black prince attached to a beam over his tomb at the level of the caps of the piers on the south side of trinity chapel were all taken down and placed away in safety the eastern end of the church is said to have been filled with steam from water rushing through with and falling on the molten lead on the floor and in time by every opening woodsmoke reached the inside of the building filling all down to the west of the nave with a blue haze the scene in the building is said to have been one of extraordinary beauty but most lovers of architecture would probably prefer to view the fabric with its own loveliness unenhanced by numerous streams of molten lead pouring down from the roof since that date canterbury cathedral has been happy in the possession of no history and we pass on therefore to the examination in detail of its exterior illustration the cloisters chapter ii exterior and precinctsthe monastery the external beauties of canterbury cathedral can best be viewed in their entirety from a distance the old town has nestled in close under the walls of the church that dominates it preventing anything like a complete view of the building from the immediate precincts but canterbury is girt with a ring of hills from which we may enjoy a strikingly beautiful view of the ancient city lying asleep in the rich peaceful valley of the stour and the mighty cathedral towering over the redtiled roofs of the town and looking as a rustic remarked as he gazed down upon it like a hen brooding over her chickens erasmus must have been struck by some such aspect of the cathedral for he says it rears its crest erigit se with so great majesty to the sky that it inspires a feeling of awe even in those who look at it from afar such a view may well be got from the hills of harbledown a village about two miles from canterbury containing in itself many objects of antiquarian and sthetic interest it stands on the road by which chaucers pilgrims wended their way to the shrine of st thomas and it is almost certainly referred to in the lines in which the poet speaks of a little town which that yeleped is bob up and down under the blee in canterbury way the name harbledown is derived by local philologists from bob up and down and the hilly nature of the country fully justifies the title here stands lanfrancs lazarhouse so picturesque even now in its decay and in spite of modern alterations which have swept away all but the ivyclad chapel of lanfranc in this hospital a shoe of st thomas was preserved which pilgrims were expected to kiss as they passed by and in an old chest the modern visitor may still behold a rude moneybox with a slit in the lid into which the great erasmus is said to have dropped a coin when he visited canterbury at the time when st thomass glory was just beginning to wane behind the hospital is an ancient well called the black princes well the black prince as is well known passed through canterbury on his way from sandwich to london whither he was escorting his royal prisoner king john of france whom he had captured at the battle of poitiers ad 1357 we need not doubt that he halted at harbledown to salute the martyrs shoe and he may have washed in the water of the well which was henceforward called by his name another tradition relates that he had water brought to him from this well when he lay sick ten years later in the archbishops palace at canterbury illustration view on the stour another good view may be had from the crest on which stands st martins church which was formerly believed to be the oldest in england so ancient that its origin was connected with the mythical king lucius modern research has decided that it is of later date but there is no doubt that on the spot on which it now stands bertha the wife of ethelbertwho was ruling when augustine landed with his monkshad a little chapel as bede relates in the east of the city where she worshipped before her husbands conversion with her chaplain luidhard a french priest dean stanley has described this view in a fine passage let any one sit on the hill of the little church of st martin and look on the view which is there spread before his eyes immediately below are the towers of the great abbey of st augustine where christian learning and civilization first struck root in the anglosaxon race and within which now after a lapse of many centuries a new institution has arisen intended to carry far and wide to countries of which gregory and augustine never heard the blessings which they gave to us carry your view onand there rises high above all the magnificent pile of our cathedral equal in splendour and state to any the noblest temple or church that augustine could have seen in ancient rome rising on the very ground which derives its consecration from him and still more than the grandeur of the outward building that rose from the little church of augustine and the little palace of ethelbert have been the institutions of all kinds of which these were the earliest cradle from the first english christian cityfrom kent the first english christian kingdomhas by degrees arisen the whole constitution of church and state in england which now binds together the whole british empire and from the christianity here established in england has flowed by direct consequence first the christianity of germanythen after a long interval of north america and lastly we may trust in time of all india and all australasia the view from st martins church is indeed one of the most inspiriting that can be found in the world there is none to which i would more willingly take any one who doubted whether a small beginning could lead to a great and lasting goodnone which carries us more vividly back into the past or more hopefully forward to the future in the town itself the best point of vantage from which the visitor can get a good view of the cathedral is the summit of the dane john a lofty mound crowned by an obelisk from this height we look across at the roof and towers of the cathedral rising above thickly clustering trees from here also there is a fine view over the beautiful valley of the stour in the direction of thanington and chartham in the immediate precincts a delightful picture is presented from the green court which was once the main outer court of the monastery here are noble trees and beautifully kept turf at once in perfect harmony and agreeable contrast with the rugged walls of the weatherbeaten cathedral the quiet soft colouring of the ancient buildings and that look of cloistered seclusion only to be found in the peaceful nooks of cathedral cities are seen here at their very best illustration bell harry the central tower the chief glory of the exterior of canterbury cathedral is the central angel or bell tower this is one of the most perfect structures that gothic architecture inspired by the loftiest purpose that ever stimulated the work of any art has produced it was completed by prior selling who held office in 1472 and has been variously called the bell harry tower from the mighty dunstan bell weighing three tons and three hundredweight and the angel tower from the gilded figure of an angel poised on one of the pinnacles which has long ago disappeared the tower itself is of two stages with two twolight windows in each stage the windows are transomed in each face and the lower tier is canopied each angle is rounded off with an octagonal turret and the whole structure is a marvellous example of architectural harmony and in every way a work of transcendent beauty the two buttressing arches and the ornamental braces which support it were added at the end of the fifteenth century by prior goldstone to whom the building of the whole tower is apparently attributed in the following quaint passage from a medival authority he by the influence and help of those honourable men cardinal john morton and prior william sellyng erected and magnificently completed that lofty tower commonly called angyll stepyll in the midst of the church between the choir and the navevaulted with a most beautiful vault and with excellent and artistic workmanship in every part sculptured and gilt with ample windows glazed and ironed he also with great care and industry annexed to the columns which support the same tower two arches or vaults of stone work curiously carved and four smaller ones to assist in sustaining the said tower ang sac i 147 translated by professor willis the western front of the cathedral is flanked by two towers of great beauty a point in which medival architecture has risen above that of all other ages is the skill which it displays in the use of towers of different heights breaking the dull straight line of the roof and carrying the eye gradually up to the loftiest point of the building canterbury presents an excellent example of the beauty of this subordination of lower towers to the chief we invite the visitor when looking at the exterior to compare it mentally on the one hand with the dull severity of the roof line of a greek temple and on the other to take a fair example of modern socalled gothic with the ugly straight line of the houses of parliament as seen from the lambeth embankment broken only by the two stark and stiff erections at each end the two towers at the west end of canterbury were not always uniform at the northern corner an old norman tower formerly uplifted a leaden spire one hundred feet high this rather anomalous arrangement must have had a decidedly lopsided effect and it is probable that the appearance of the cathedral was changed very much for the better when the spire which had been taken down in 1705 was replaced by mr austin in 1840 by a tower uniform with the southernmost tower called the chicele or oxford steeple this tower was completed by prior goldstone who during his tenure of office from 144968 also built the lady chapel on its south side stands the porch with a remarkable central niche which formerly contained a representation of beckets martyrdom the figures of the archbishops assassins now no longer remain but their place has been filled up with figures of various worthies who have lived under the shadow of the cathedral dean alford suggested about 1863 that the many vacant niches should be peopled in this manner and since then the work has proceeded steadily the western towers are built each of six stages each of the two upper tiers contains two twolight windows while below there is a large fourlight window uniform with the windows of the aisles the base tier is ornamented with rich panelling the parapet is battlemented and the angles are finished with fine double pinnacles at the west end there is a large window of seven lights with three transoms the gable contains a window of very curious shape filled with intricate tracery the space above the aisle windows is ornamented with quatrefoiled squares and the clerestory is pierced by windows of three lights in the main transept there is a fine perpendicular window of eight lights the choir or southeast transept has a norman front with arcades and a large round window also an arcaded west turret surmounted by a short spire beyond this the line is again broken by the projection of st anselms socalled tower this chapel hardly merits such a title unless we adopt the theory that it and the corresponding building on the north side were at one time a good deal more lofty but lost their upper portions at the time of the great fire the end of the cathedral has a rather untidy appearance owing to the fact that the exterior of the corona was never completed on the northern side the building is so closely interwoven with the cloister and monastic buildings that it can only be considered in conjunction with them the length of the cathedral is 514 feet the height of the central tower 235 feet and that of the western towers 130 feet the chief interest of ancient buildings to the ordinary observer as apart from the architectural specialist is the fact that they are after all the most authentic documents in our possession from which we can gain any insight into the lives and modes of thought of our ancestors to tell us how ordinary men lived and busied themselves is beneath the dignity of history as carlyle says the thing i want to see is not redbook lists and court calendars and parliamentary registers but the life of man in england what men did thought suffered enjoyed mournful in truth is it to behold what the business called history in these so enlightened and illuminated times still continues to be can you gather from it read till your eyes go out any dimmest shadow of an answer to that great question how men lived and had their being were it but economically as what wages they got and what they bought with these unhappily they cannot history as it stands all bound up in gilt volumes is but a shade more instructive than the wooden volumes of a backgammonboard most of us have felt at one time or another the truth of these words though it is only fair to add that the fault lies not so much at the door of the modern historian as of our ancestors themselves who were too busy with fighting and revelling to leave any but the most meagre account of their own lives behind them so that redbook lists and parliamentary registers are all that the veracious chronicler who will not let his imagination run riot can find to put before us but happily in the wildest days of the middle ages there were found some peaceloving souls who preferred to drone away their lives in quiet meditation behind the walls of the great monasteries undisturbed by the clash of swords some outlet had to be found for their innate energies and their intense religious enthusiasm missionary zeal had not yet been invented and the writing of books would have seemed to them a waste of good parchment for in their eyes the scriptures and the aristotelian writings supplied all the food that the most voracious intellect could crave for so they applied all their geniusand it is probable that the flower of the european race as far as intelligence and culture are concerned was gathered in those days into the churchand all the ecstatic fervour of their religious devotion the strength of which men of these latter days can hardly realize to the construction of beautiful buildings for the worship of god they have written a history in stone from which a thoughtful student can supply much that is left out by the dryasdust annalists for it is not only the history but the actual result and expression of the lives of the most gifted men of the middle ages if we would read this history aright it is necessary that we should look at it as far as possible as it was originally published if the old binding has been torn off and the volume hedged in by a crowd of modern literature we must try to put these aside and consider the book as it was first issued in other words to drop metaphor altogether in considering a building like canterbury cathedral we must forget the busy little country town with its crowded streets and noisy railway stations though from one point of view the contrast that they present is agreeable and valuable and try to conceive the church as it once stood the centre of a harmonious group of monastic buildings the founder of the monastic system in the west was the famous benedict of nursia who had adapted the strict code of st basil mitigating its severity and making it more in accordance with the climate manners and general circumstances of western peoples his code was described by gregory the great as excellent in its discretion lucid in its expressiondiscretione prcipuam sermone luculentam he founded the monasteries of montecassino and subiaco in the beginning of the sixth century in the ninth and tenth centuriesthe worst period of the dark agescorruption and laxity pervaded society in general and the benedictine monasteries especially at the end of this deplorable epoch many efforts were made in the direction of reform gregory the great himself was a member of the benedictine brotherhood so also was augustine who founded the great monastery of christ church the venerable bede relates that when augustine the first archbishop of canterbury assumed the episcopal throne in that royal city he recovered therein by the kings assistance a church which as he was told had been constructed by the original labour of roman believers this church he consecrated in the name of the saviour our god and lord jesus christ and there he established an habitation for himself and all his successors this was the basilicachurch mentioned in an earlier part of this work an imitation of the original basilica of st peter at rome augustines monastery was handsomely endowed a large stretch of country was given to the monks and they were the first who brought the soil into cultivation and built churches and preached in them the monks says bede were the principal of those who came to the work of preaching in the city itself there were thirtytwo mansur or mansions held by the clergy rendering 35s a year and a mill worth 5s per annum augustines monastery lived and prosperedthough as we shall see it did not escape the general corruption of the eighth and ninth centuriesuntil the time of the norman invasion in 1067 a fire destroyed the saxon cathedral and the greater part of the monastic buildings but the year 1070 marks an epoch in the history of the monastery for it was then that william the conqueror having deposed stigand the saxon primate invited lanfranc the abbot of caen to accept the vacant see he being overcome by the will of god as much as by the apostolic authority passed over into england and not forgetful of the object for which he had come directed all his endeavours to the correction of the manners of his people and settling the state of the church and first he laboured to renew the church of canterbury and built also necessary offices for the use of the monks and which is very remarkable he caused to be brought over the sea in swift sailing vessels squared stones from caen in order to build with he also built a house for his own dwelling near the church and surrounded all these buildings with a vast and lofty wall also he duly arranged all that was necessary for the table and clothing of the monks and many lands which had been taken away he brought back into the property of the church and restored to it twentyfive manors he also added one hundred to the original number of the monks and drew up a new system of discipline to correct the laxity which was rife when he entered on the primacy he tells anselm in a letter that the land in which he is is daily shaken with so many and so great tribulations is stained with so many adulteries and other impurities that no order of men consults for the benefit of his soul or even desires to hear the salutary doctrine of god for his increase in holiness perhaps the most interesting feature of his reconstruction of the regula or rule for the monks discipline was his enactment with regard to the library and the studies of the brethren in the first week in lent the monks had to bring back and place in the chapter house the books which had been provided for their instruction during the previous year those who had not duly performed the yearly portion of reading prostrated themselves confessing their fault and asking pardon a fresh distribution was then made and the brethren retired each furnished with a years literary task apparently no examination was held no test applied to discover whether the last years instruction had been digested and assimilated it was assumed that anything like a perfunctory performance of the allotted task was out of the question another important alteration introduced by lanfranc was his inauguration of the system under which the monastery was in immediate charge no longer of the archbishop but of a prior henceforward the primate stood forth as the head of the church rather than as merely the chief of her most ancient foundation we have dwelt at some length on the subject of the monastery at canterbury because as we have said it is impossible to learn the lesson of the cathedral truly unless we regard the fabric in its original setting surrounded by monastic buildings and it is impossible to interest ourselves in the monastic buildings without knowing something of the institution which they housed illustration detail of st anselms tower the buildings which contained a great monastery like that of canterbury were necessarily very extensive chief among them was the chapter house which generally adjoined the principal cloister bounded by the nave of the church and one of the transepts then there were the buildings necessary for the actual housing and daily living of the monksthe dormitory refectory kitchen buttery and other indispensable offices another highly important building usually standing eastward of the church was the infirmary or hospital for sick brethren with its chapel duly attached further the rules of benedictine monasteries always enjoined the strict observance of the duty of hospitality and some part of the buildings was invariably set aside for the due entertainment of strangers of various ranks visitors of distinction were entertained in special rooms which generally were attached to the house of the prior or abbot guests of a lower order were lodged hard by the hall of the cellarer while poor pilgrims and chance wanderers who craved a nights shelter were bestowed as a rule near the main gate of the monastery lastly it must not be forgotten that a wellendowed monastery was always the steward of a great estate so that many storehouses and farmbuildingsbarns granaries bakehouse etcwere a necessary part of the institution extensive stabling was also required to shelter the horses of illustrious visitors and their suites moreover the clergy themselves were often greatly addicted to the chase and we know that the pious st thomas found time to cultivate a taste for horseflesh which was remarkable even in those days when all men who wanted to move at all were bound to ride the knights who murdered him thought it worth while to pillage his stable after accomplishing their errand illustration the christchurch gate from a photograph by carl norman and co the centre round which all these manifold buildings and offices were ranged was of course the cathedral wherever available space and the nature of the ground permitted it the cloister and chief buildings were placed under the shelter of the church on its southern side as may be seen for instance at westminster where the cloisters chapter house deanery refectory now the college hall etc are all gathered on the south side of the abbey at canterbury however the builders were not able to follow the usual practice owing to the fact that they were hemmed in closely by the houses of the city on the south side so that we find that the space between the north side of the cathedral and the city wall all of which belonged to the monks was the site of the monastic buildings the whole group formed by the cathedral and the subsidiary buildings was girt by a massive wall which was restored and made more effective as a defence by lanfranc it is probable that some of the remains of this wall which still survive may be considered as dating from his time the chief gate both in ancient and modern days is prior goldstones gate usually known as christ church gate an exceedingly good example of the later perpendicular style a contemporary inscription tells us that it was built in 1517 it stands at the end of mercery lane a lofty building with towers at its corners and two storeys above the archway in front there is a central niche in which an image of our saviour originally stood while below a row of shields much battered and weatherbeaten display armorial bearings doubtless those of pious contributors to the cost of the building an early work of turners has preserved the corner pinnacles which once decorated the top of the gate these were removed some thirty years ago illustration the southwest porch of the cathedral illustration cloisters of the monks infirmary entering the precincts through this gateway we find ourselves in what was the outer cemetery in which members of the laity were allowed to be buried the inner cemetery reserved as a restingplace for the brethren themselves was formerly divided from the outer by a wall which extended from st anselms chapel a norman door which was at one time part of this wall has now been put into a wall at the east end of the monks burying ground this space is now called the oaks a bell tower campanile doubtless used for tolling the passing bell once stood on a mound in the cemetery close to the dividing wall the houses on the south side of this space are of no great antiquity or interest and the site on which they stand did not become part of the monastery grounds before a comparatively late period but if we skirt the east end of the cathedral we come to the space formerly known as the homors a word supposed to be a corruption of ormeaux a french word meaning elms1 here stood the building in which guests of rank and distinction were entertained and the great hall with its kitchen and offices is still preserved in a house in the northeast corner of the inclosure now the residence of one of the prebendaries the original building was one of great importance in a monastery like canterbury which was so often visited as has already been shown by royal pilgrims it is said to have been rebuilt from top to bottom by prior chillenden and the nature of the architecture as far as it can be traced is not in any way at variance with this statement the hall as it originally stood was pierced with oriel windows rising to the roof and at its western end a walledoff portion was divided into two storeys the lower one containing the kitchens while the upper one was either a distinct room separated from the hall or it may have been a gallery opening upon it 1 though it is also derived from one dr omerus who lived on the spot in the thirteenth century to the west of this house we find the ruins of the infirmary which contained a long hall with aisles and a chapel at the east end the hall was used as the hospital and the aisles were sometimes divided into separate compartments the chapel was really part of the hall with only a screen intervening so that the sick brethren could take part in the services this infirmary survived until the reformation period but not without undergoing alterations before the fifteenth century the south aisle was devoted to the use of the subprior and the chancel at the east end of the chapel was partially restored about the middle of the fourteenth century a large east window was put in with threelight windows on each side in the north wall there is a curious opening through which perhaps sufferers from infectious diseases were allowed to assist at the services on the southern side the whole row of the pillars and arches of the chapel and some traces of a clerestory still remain on the wall are some traces of paintings which are too faded to be deciphered such of the pillars and arches of the hall as still survive are strongly coloured by the great fire of 1174 in which prior conrads choir was destroyed illustration ruins of the monks infirmary illustration the baptistery tower westward of the infirmary and connected with st andrews tower stands a strikingly beautiful building which was once the vestiarium or treasury it consists of two storeys of which the lower is open on the east and west while the upper contained the treasury chamber a finely proportioned room decorated with an arcade of intersecting arches an archway leads us from the infirmary into what is called the dark entry whence a passage leads to the priors gate and onward into the priors court more commonly known as the green court this passage was the eastern boundary of the infirmary cloister over it prior de estria raised the scaccarium or checkerbuilding the countinghouse of the monastery turning back towards the infirmary entrance we come to the lavatory tower which stands out from the west end of the substructure of the priors chapel the chapel itself was pulled down at the close of the seventeenth century and a brickbuilt library was erected on its site the lavatory tower is now more commonly called the baptistery but this name gives a false impression and only came into use because the building now contains a font given to the cathedral by bishop warner the lower part of the tower is late norman in style and was built in the latter half of the twelfth century when the monastery was supplied with a system of works by which water was drawn from some distant springs which still supply the cathedral and precincts the water was distributed from this tower to the various buildings the original designs of the engineer are preserved at trinity college cambridge the upper part of the tower was rebuilt by prior chillenden from the lavatory tower a covered passage leads into the great cloister which can also be approached from a door in the northwest transept the cloister though it stands upon the space covered by that built by lanfranc is largely the work of the indefatigable prior chillenden it shows traces of many architectural periods the east walk contains a door leading into the transept embellished with a triple arcade of early english under the central arch of the arcade is the doorway itself a later addition in perpendicular there is also a norman doorway which once communicated with the monks dormitory after the reformation it was walled up but in 1813 the plaster which concealed it was taken away and since then it has been carefully restored the rest of the work in this part of the cloister is chiefly perpendicular the north walk is adorned with an early english arcade against which the shafts which support chillendens vaulting work are placed with rather unsatisfactory effect towards the western end of this walk is the door of the refectory illustration turret of southwest transept the cellarers quarters were outside the west walk and they were connected with the cloister by a doorway at the northwest corner opposite this entrance was a door leading to the archbishops palace and through this becket made his way towards the cathedral when his murderers were in pursuit of him the great dormitory of the monks was built along the east walk of the cloister extending some way beyond it it was pulled down in 1547 but the substructure was left standing and some private houses were erected upon it these were removed in the middle of the last century and a good deal of the substructure remained until 1867 when the vaulting which survived was pulled down to make way for the new library which was erected on the dormitory site some of the pillars on which the vault of the substructure rested are preserved in a garden in the precincts and a fragment of the upper part of the dormitory building which escaped the demolition in 1547 may be seen in the gable of the new library the substructure was a fine building 148 feet by 78 feet the vaulting was as described by professor willis of the earliest kind constructed of light tufa having no transverse ribs and retaining the impressions of the rough boarded centring upon which they had been formed a second minor dormitory ran eastward from the larger one while outside this was the third dormitory fronting the green court some portion of the vaults of this building is still preserved in the garden before the lavatory tower the chapter house lies eastward of the wall of the cloister on the site of the original norman building which was rather less extensive the present structure is oblong in shape measuring 90 feet by 35 feet the roof consists of a barrel vault and was built by prior chillenden along with the whole of the upper storey at the end of the fourteenth century the windows high and fourlighted are also his work those at the east and west ends exceed in size all those of the cathedral having seven lights the lower storey was built by prior de estria about a century before the work was completed by chillenden de estria also erected the choirscreen in the cathedral which will be described in its proper place the walls of the chapter house are embellished with an arcade of trefoiled arches surmounted by a cornice at the east end stands a throne with a splendid canopy this building was at one time after the reformation used as a sermon house but the inconvenience caused by moving the congregation from the choir where service was held across to the chapter house to hear the discourse was so great that the practice was not long continued it has been restored and its opening by hrh the prince of wales may 29th 1897 is announced just as this edition goes to press

preserved which once were part of the ancient church at reculverformerly regulbium whither ethelbert retired after making over his palace in canterbury to augustine these columns were brought to canterbury after the destruction nearly a hundred years ago of the church to which they belonged after lying neglected for some time they were placed in their present position by mr sheppard who bestowed so much care on all the antiquities connected with the cathedral these columns are believed by experts to be undoubted relics of roman work they are of circular form with ionic capitals a curious ropework decoration on the bases is said to be characteristically roman occurs on a monument outside the porta maggiore at rome the deanery is a very much revised version of what once was the

his day the building has been very materially altered illustration norman staircase in the close from a photograph by carl norman and co illustration details of the norman staircase in the close the

so many royal and imperial guests had been entertained with solemne dauncing and other good cheer was pillaged and destroyed by the puritans since then the archbishops have had no official house in their cathedral city illustration details of ornament chapter iii interior dean stanley tells us that in the days of our saxon forefathers and for some time after all disputes throughout the whole kingdom that could not be legally referred to the kings court or to the hundreds of counties were heard and judged on in the south porch of canterbury cathedral this was always the principal entrance and was known in early days as the suthdure by which name it is often mentioned in the law books of the ancient kings through this door we enter the nave of the cathedral this part of the building was erected towards the end of the fourteenth century lanfrancs nave seems to have fallen into an unsafe and ruinous state so much so that in december 1378 sudbury who was then archbishop issued a mandate addressed to all ecclesiastical persons in his diocese enjoining them to solicit subscriptions for rebuilding the nave of the church propter ipsius notoriam et evidentem ruinam and granting forty days indulgence to all contributors archbishop courtenay gave a thousand marks and more for the building fund and archbishop arundell gave a similar contribution as well as the five bells which were known as the arundell ryng we are told also that king henry the 4th helped to build up a good part of the body of the chirch the immediate direction of the work was in the hands of prior chillenden already frequently mentioned his epitaph quoted by professor willis states that here lieth thomas chyllindene formerly prior of this church decretorum doctor egregius who caused the nave of this church and divers other buildings to be made anew who after nobly ruling as prior of this church for twenty years twenty five weeks and five days at length on the day of the assumption of the blessed virgin mary closed his last day in the year of the lord 1411 it is not certain that chillenden actually designed the buildings which were erected under his care with which his name is connected for we know that work which was conceived and executed by humble monks was ascribed as a matter of course to the head of the monastery under whose auspices and sanction it was carried out matthew paris records that a new oaken roof well covered with lead was built for the aisles and tower of st albans by michael of thydenhanger monk and camerarius but he adds that these works must be ascribed to the abbot out of respect for his office for he who sanctions the performance of a thing by his authority is really the person who does the thing prior chillenden became prior in 1390 and seems at any rate to have devoted a considerable amount of zeal to the work of renovating the ruined portions of the church illustration the murder of st thomas becket restoration by t carter of a painting on board hung on a column near the tomb of henry iv illustration the shrine of st thomas becket specially reproduced from a drawing among the cottonian mss brit mus the new nave replaced the original building of lanfranc professor willis says the whole of lanfrancs piers and all that rested on them appear to have been utterly demolished nothing remaining but the plinth of the sideaisle walls the style of chillendens new work is a light perpendicular and the arrangement of the parts has a considerable resemblance to that of the nave of winchester although the latter is of a much bolder character winchester nave was going on at the same time with canterbury nave and a similar uncertainty exists about the exact commencement in both a norman nave was to be transformed but at winchester the original piers were either clothed with new ashlaring or the old ashlaring was wrought into new forms and mouldings where possible while in canterbury the piers were altogether rebuilt hence the piers of winchester are much more massive the sideaisles of canterbury are higher in proportion the tracery of the side windows different but those of the clerestory are almost identical in pattern although they differ in the management of the mouldings both have lierne vaults ie vaults in which short transverse ribs or liernes are mixed with the ribs that branch from the vaulting capitals and in both the triforium is obtained by prolonging the clerestory windows downward and making panels of the lower lights which panels have a plain opening cut through them by which the triforium space communicates with the passage over the roof of the sideaisles chillenden then setting to work with the thoroughness that marks his handiwork throughout rebuilt the nave from top to bottom leaving nothing of lanfrancs original structure save the plinth of the sideaisle walls which still remains the resemblance between the naves of canterbury and winchester pointed out by professor willis will at once strike a close observer though the greater boldness of character shown in the winchester architecture is by no means the only point of difference the most obvious feature in the canterbury navea point which renders its arrangement unique among the cathedrals both of england and the continentis the curious manner in which the choir is raised aloft above the level of the floor this is owing to the fact that it stands immediately above the crypt the flight of steps which is therefore necessarily placed between the choir and the nave adds considerably to the general effect of our first view of the interior on the other hand the raising of the choir is probably to some extent responsible for the great height of the nave in comparison with its length a point which spoils its effectiveness when we view it from end to end stanley in describing the entrance of the pilgrims into the cathedral points out how different a scene must have met their eyes the external aspect of the cathedral itself he says with the exception of the numerous statues which then filled its now vacant niches must have been much what it is now not so its interior bright colours on the roof on the windows on the monuments hangings suspended from the rods which may still be seen running from pillar to pillar chapels and altars and chantries intercepting the view where now all is clear must have rendered it so different that at first we should hardly recognize it to be the same building the pilgrims on entering were met by a monk who sprinkled their heads with holy water from a sprengel and owing to the crowd of devout visitors they generally had to wait some time before they could proceed towards a view of the shrine chaucer relates that the pardoner and the miller and other lewd sots whiled away the time with staring at the painted windows which then adorned the nave and wondering what they were supposed to represent he beareth a ballstaff quoth the one and also a rakes end thou failest quoth the miller thou hast not well thy mind it is a spear if thou canst see with a prick set before to push adown his enemy and through the shoulder bore illustration capitals of columns in the eastern apse none of these windows now remain entire though the west window has been put together out of fragments of the ancient glass the latterday pilgrims will do well to look as little as possible at the hideous glass which the philistinism of modern piety has inserted during the last halfcentury in the windows of the clerestory and the nave its obtrusive unpleasantness make one wish that blue dick and his puritan troopers might once more be let loose under judicious direction for half an hour on the cathedral when erasmus visited canterbury the nave contained nothing but some books chained to the pillars among them the gospel of nicodemusprinted by wynkyn de worde in 1509and the tomb of some person unknown the last words must refer either to the chapel in the south wall which was built by lady joan brenchley in 1447 and removed in 1787 or to the monument of archbishop william wittlesey who died in 1374 and was interred in the south side of the nave in a marble tomb with a brass now destroyed at present the south aisle contains a monument in alabaster to dr broughton sometime bishop of sydney who was educated in the kings school under the shadow of the cathedral the figure is recumbent and the base of the monument which is by lough is decorated with the arms of the six australian sees in the north aisle we find monuments to orlando gibbons charles is organist adrian saravia prebendary of canterbury and the friend of hooker the author of the ecclesiastical polity sir john boys who founded a hospital for the poor outside the north gate of the town and died in 1614 dean lyall who died in 1857 and archbishop sumner who died in 1862 these last two monuments are by phillips and h weekes ra respectively the central towerin the nave the whole of lanfrancs work was destroyed but in the central tower which we will next examine the original supporting piers were left standing though they were covered over by prior chillenden with work more in keeping with the style in which he had renewed the nave of the tower piers says willis the western are probably mere casings of the original and the eastern certainly appendages to the original of course i have no evidence to show how much of lanfrancs piers was allowed to remain in the heart of the work the interior faces of the tower walls appear to have been brought forward by a lining so as to increase their thickness and the strength of the piers with a view to the erection of a lofty tower which however was not carried above the roof until another century had nearly elapsed it was prior goldstone the second who about 1500 carried upward the central tower which chillenden seems to have left level with the roof of the cathedral with the countenance and help of cardinal john morton and prior william sellyng he magnificently completed that lofty tower commonly called angyll stepyll in the middle of the church the vaulting of the tower is his worktestudine pulcherrim concameratam consummavitand he also added the buttressing archeswith great care and industry he annexed to the columns which support the same tower two arches or vaults of stonework curiously carved and four smaller ones to assist in sustaining the said tower the addition of these buttressing arches not altogether happy in its artistic effect was probably rendered necessary by some signs of weakness shown by the piers of the tower for the northwest pier which was not so substantially reinforced as the others now shows a considerable bend in an eastward direction the two arches or vaults of stonework were inserted under the western and southern tower arches the eastern arch having stronger piers did not require this precaution and the northern which opened upon the martyrium seems to have been left free out of reverence to the altar of the martyrdom and accordingly to have suffered the dislocation just mentioned the four smaller arches connected the two western towerpiers with the nearest navepier and the wall of the transept the buttressing arches are strongly built and are adorned with curious bands of reticulated work the central western arch occupies the place of the roodloft and it is probable that until the reformation the great rood was placed over it the rebus of prior thomas goldstonea shield with three gold stonesis carved upon these arches the western screen which separates the nave from the choir is now more commonly known as the organscreen it is a highly elaborate and beautiful piece of work and the carvings which decorate it are well worthy of examination in the lower niches there are six crowned figures one holding a church is believed to be ethelbert while it has been assumed that the figure on the extreme right represents richard ii probably henry iv who as has been already mentioned helped to build a good part of the body of the church has a place of honour here but no certainty on this matter is possible the thirteen mitred niches which encircle the arch once contained figures of christ and the twelve apostles but these were destroyed by the puritans the exact date of this outward screen is uncertain but it was set up at some time during the fifteenth century a little examination says willis of its central archway will detect the junction of this new work with the stone enclosure of the choir in fact this archway is considerably higher than that of de estria which still remains behind it the apex of this arch reaches but a little above the capitals of the new arch and the flat space or tympanum thus left between the two is filled with perpendicular tracery the choirin the year of grace one thousand one hundred and seventyfour by the just but occult judgment of god the church of christ at canterbury was consumed by fire in the fortyfourth year from its dedication that glorious choir to wit which had been so magnificently completed by the care and industry of prior conrad gervase translated by willis the work of rebuilding was immediately begun by william the architect of sens at the beginning of the fifth year of his work he was by a fall from the height of the capitals of the upper vault rendered helpless alike to himself and for the work but no other person than himself was in the least injured against the master only was the vengeance of god or spite of the devil directed he was succeeded in his charge by one william by name english by nation small in body but in workmanship of many kinds acute and honest now in the sixth year from the fire we read that the monks were seized with a violent longing to prepare the choir so that they might enter it at the coming easter and the master perceiving their desires set himself manfully to work to satisfy the wishes of the convent he constructed with all diligence the wall which encloses the choir and presbytery he carefully prepared a restingplace for st dunstan and st elfege the choir thus hardly completed even with the greatest labour and diligence the monks were resolved to enter on easter eve with the new fire that is the paschal candle which was lit on easter eve and burnt until ascension day the kindling of this light was carried out in a very ceremonious manner as enjoined in lanfrancs statutes a fire was made in the cloister and duly consecrated and the monks having lit a taper at this fire carried it on the end of a staff in solemn procession singing psalms and hymns and burning incense and lit the paschal candle in the choir with it thus was the new choir completed in the sixth year after the burning of conrads this part of the cathedral will be peculiarly interesting to the architectural student owing to the curious mixture of styles which enables him to compare the norman and early english characteristics side by side a striking feature in the aspect of the building as seen from the choir is the remarkable inward bend with which the walls turn towards one another at the end of the cathedral the choir itself is peculiar in the matter of length 180 feetthe longest in any english church and the lowness of the vaulting the pillars with their pierarches and the clerestory wall above are said by willis to be without doubt the work of william of sens but the whole question as to where the french william left off and his english namesake began is extremely uncertain as there can be no doubt that william of sens had fully planned out the work which he was destined never to complete and it is more than probable that his successor worked largely upon his plans we are on safer ground when we assert that the new choir was altogether different from the building which it replaced the style was much more ornate and considerably lighter the characteristics of the work of the williams are rich mouldings varied and elaborately carved capitals on the pillars and the introduction of gracefully slender shafts of purbeck marble gervase in pointing out the differences between the works before and after the fire mentions that the old capitals were plain the new ones most artistically sculptured the old arches and everything else either plain or sculptured with an axe and not with a chisel but in the new work first rate sculpture abounded everywhere in the old work no marble shafts in the new innumerable ones plain vaults instead of ribbed behind the choir sculptured with an axe reads rather curiously but professor willis points out that the axe is not quite so rude a weapon in the hands of a mason as it might appear at first sight the french masons use it to the present day with great dexterity in carving the mouldings used by ernulf were extremely simple and were decorated with a peculiar and shallow class of notched ornament of which many examples exist in other buildings of the period while the mouldings of william of sens exhibit much variety but are most remarkable for the profusion of billetwork zigzag and dogtooth that are lavished upon them the first two methods of ornamentation are norman the last an early english characteristic this mixture is not confined to the details of decoration but may be observed also in the indiscriminate employment of round and pointed arches this feature as willis remarks may have arisen either from the indifference of the artist as to the mixture of forms or else from deliberate contrivance for as he was compelled from the nature of his work to retain roundheaded arcades windows and arches in the sideaisles and yet was accustomed to and desirous of employing pointed arches in his new building he might discreetly mix some roundheaded arches with them in order to make the contrast less offensive by causing the mixture of forms to pervade the whole composition as if an intentional principle illustration the choir looking east from a photograph by carl norman and co whatever the motive this daring mixture renders the study of the architectural features of our cathedral peculiarly interesting in the triforium we find a semicircular outer arch circumscribing two inner pointed ones the clerestory arch is pointed while some of the transverse ribs of the great vault are pointed and some round the inward bend of the walls at the end of the choir was necessitated by the fact that the towers of st anselm and st andrew had survived the great fire of 1174 naturally the pious builders did not wish to pull down these relics of the former church so that a certain amount of contraction had to be effected in order that these towers should form part of the new plan this arrangement also fitted in with the determination to build a chapel of the martyred st thomas at the end of the church on the site of the former trinity chapel for the trinity chapel had been much narrower than the new choir but this contraction enabled the rebuilders to preserve its dimensions the altar when the choir was at first completed by william stood entirely alone and without a reredos behind it the archbishops chair was originally placed but this was afterwards transferred to the corona the remarkable height at which the altar was set up is due to the fact that it is placed over the new crypt which is a good deal higher than the older or western crypt before the reformation the high altar was richly embellished with all kinds of precious and sacred ornaments and vessels while beneath it in a vault were stored a priceless collection of gold and silver vessels such of these as escaped the rapacity of henry viii were destroyed by the bigotry of the puritan zealots the latter made havoc of the reredos which had been erected behind the high altar probably during the fourteenth century and also a most idolatrous costly glory cloth the gift of archbishop laud the reredos was replaced by a corinthian screen which was of elaborate design but must have been strangely out of keeping with its surroundings it was removed about 1870 to make way for the present reredos which was designed in the style of the screen work in the lady chapel in the crypt but which cannot be commended as an object of beauty the altar coverings which are now in use were presented to the cathedral by queen mary the wife of william iii when she visited canterbury a chalice given by the earl of arundel in 1636 is among the communionplate in his account of the building of the new choir gervase tells us that the master carefully prepared a restingplace for st dunstan and st elfegethe coexiles of the monks when the choir was ready prior alan taking with him nine of the brethren of the church in whom he could trust went by night to the tombs of the saints so that he might not be incommoded by a crowd and having locked the doors of the church he commanded the stonework that inclosed them to be taken down the monks and the servants of the church in obedience to the priors commands took the structure to pieces opened the stone coffins of the saints and bore their relics to the vestiarium then having removed the cloths in which they had been wrapped and which were halfconsumed from age and rottenness they covered them with other and more handsome palls and bound them with linen bands they bore the saints thus prepared to their altars and deposited them in wooden chests covered within and without with lead which chests thus leadcovered and strongly bound with iron were inclosed in stonework that was consolidated with melted lead this translation was thus carried out by prior alan on the night before the formal reentry into the choir the rest of the monks who had not assisted at the ceremony were highly incensed by the priors action for they had intended that the translation of the fathers should have been performed with great and devout solemnity they even went so far as to cite the prior and the trusty monks who had assisted him before the archbishop and it was only by the intervention of the latter and other men of authority and after due apology and repentance that harmony was restored in the convent illustration the choir before restoration the bones of st dunstan were long a cause of contention between the churches of canterbury and glastonbury the monks of glastonbury considered that they had a prior claim on the relics of the sainted archbishop and stoutly contended that his body had been conveyed to their own sanctuary after the sack of canterbury by the danes and they used to exhibit a coffin as containing dunstans remains but early in the fourteenth century they went so far as to set up a gorgeous shrine in which they placed with much pomp and circumstance the supposed relics archbishop warham who then ruled at canterbury accordingly replied by causing the shrine in our cathedral to be opened and was able to declare triumphantly that he had found therein the remains of a human body in the costume of an archbishop with a plate of lead on his breast inscribed with the words sanctus dunstanus in the course of the subsequent correspondence which passed between the two monasteries the abbot of glastonbury after trying to argue that perhaps part only of the saints relics had been conveyed to his church at last frankly confesses the people had believed in the genuineness of their saint for so long that he is afraid to tell them the truth this shrine of st dunstan stood on the south of the high altar and was erected after the manner of a tomb though the shrine itself perished at the time of the reformation there still remains on the south wall of the choir between the monuments of archbishops stratford and sudbury some very fine open diaperwork in what is known as the decorated style which once formed part of the ornamentation of st dunstans altar the shrine of st elfege or alphege who was archbishop at the time of the sacking of canterbury by the danes and was murdered by them has been altogether destroyed the choir screen a solid structure of stone we know to be the work of prior de estria ie of eastry in kent who was elected in 1285 and died in 1331 according to the obituary record he fairly decorated the choir of the church with most beautiful stonework cunningly carved in his register there is an entry which evidently refers to the same work anno 13045 reparation of the whole choir with three new doors and a new screen pulpito the three doors referred to are the north and south entrances and the western one it has already been pointed out that the present western screen is a later addition professor willis whose great work on the architectural history of canterbury cathedral should be studied by all who wish to examine the details of the building more closely than is allowed by the scope of this work describes de estrias screen as follows the lateral portions of this wall of enclosure are in excellent order in the western part of the choir namely between the eastern transepts and the organscreen this wall is built so that its inner face nearly ranges with the inner faces of the pillars but eastward of the transepts it is built between the pillars the north doorway remains perfect the present south doorway which is in a much later style is manifestly a subsequent insertion this enclosure consists of a solid wall seven feet nine inches in height from the pavement of the sideaisles it has a stonebench towards the sideaisles and above that a base of the age of william of sens so that it is clear that the work of de estria belongs to the upper part only of the enclosure which consists of delicate and elaborately worked tracery surmounted by an embattled crest the entire work is particularly valuable on account of its wellestablished date combined with its great beauty and singularity a portion of the choirpavement lying between the two transepts is interesting as being undoubtedly part of the original flooring of conrads choir and probably the only fragment of it that was left undisturbed after the great fire which destroyed that glorious choir which had been so magnificently completed by the care and industry of prior conrad this part of the pavement consists of large slabs of a peculiar stone or veined marble of a delicate brown colour when parts of this are taken up for repair or alteration it is usual to find lead which has run between the joints of the slabs and spread on each side below and which is with great reason supposed to be the effect of the fire of 1174 which melted the lead of the roof and caused it to run down between the paving stones in this manner it is said that when the choir was filled with pews in 1706 and it was necessary to remove part of the pavement the men engaged on the work picked up enough of this lead to make two large gluepots illustration a miserere in the choir the original wooden stalls of the choir were described by the writer of a book published in 1640 he relates that there were two rows on each side an upper and a lower and that above the stalls on the south side stood the archbishops wooden chair sometime richly guilt and otherwise richly set forth but now nothing specious through age and late neglect perhaps the battered and shabby condition of this part of the cathedral furniture accounts for its having survived the puritan period it is at least certain that it remained untouched until 1704 when the refurnishing of the choir was begun by archbishop tenison he himself presented a wainscoted throne with lofty corinthian canopy adorned with carving by gibbons while the altar the pulpit and the stalls for the dean and vicedean were provided with rich fittings by queen mary ii the tracery of the screen was hidden by a lining of wainscoting which was put before it this arrangement lasted little more than a century in the time of archbishop howley who held office from 1828 to 1848 the wainscoting which concealed the screen was taken away and archbishop tenisons throne has made way for a lofty canopy of tabernacle work some carved work which has been ascribed to gibbons still remains before the eastern front of the screen between the choir and the nave the position of the organ has been frequently shifted in conrads choir it was placed upon the vault of the south transept afterwards it was set up upon a large corbel of stone over the arch of st michael in the same transept this corbel has now been removed subsequently it was placed between two pillars on the north side of the choir and later on it was again transferred to a position over the west door of the choir the usual place for the organ in cathedral churches finally it has been ingeniously deposited out of sight in the triforium of the south aisle of the choir a low pedestal with its keys stands in the choir itself so as to place the organist close to the singers as he ought to be and the communication between the keys and the organ is effected by trackers passing under the pavement of the side aisles and conducted up to the triforium through a trunk let into the south wall this arrangement not only secures the retirement from view of the organ which with its tedious rows of straight and unsightly pipes is generally more or less an eyesore in cathedrals but is said to have caused a great improvement in the effect of its music the present organ which was built by samuel green is believed to have been used at the handel festival in westminster abbey in 1784 it was enlarged by hill in 1842 and entirely reconstructed in 1886 in this connection we may mention that archbishop theodore first introduced the ecclesiastical chant in canterbury cathedral the tombs in the choir are all occupied by famous archbishops and cardinals on the south side hard by the site of the shrine of st dunstan is the tomb of simon of sudbury who was archbishop from 1375 to 1381 he built the west gate of the city and a great part of the town walls in consideration of these benefits the mayor and aldermen used at one time to make an annual procession to his restingplace and offer prayers for his soul outside canterbury his acts were not regarded with so much gratitude for he was the inventor or reviver of the poll tax and was in consequence beheaded on tower hill by wat tyler and his followers stanley relates that not many years ago when this tomb was accidentally opened the body was seen within wrapped in cerecloth a leaden ball occupying the vacant place of the head sudbury is also famous as having spoken against the superstitious pilgrimages to st thomas shrine and his violent death was accordingly attributed to the avenging power of the incensed saint westward of his monument stands that of archbishop stratford 13331348 who was grand justiciary to edward iii during his absence in flanders and won fame by his struggle with the king between this tomb and the archbishops throne lies cardinal kemp 14521454 who was present at agincourt in the camp of henry v his tomb is surmounted by a remarkable wooden canopy opposite on the north side is the very interesting monument of archbishop henry chichele 14141443 shakespeare tells us that he was the instigator of henry vs war with france and it is supposed that out of remorse for this act he built during his lifetime the curious tomb which now conceals his bones it is kept in repair by all souls college which was founded by the penitent archbishop that its fellows might pray for the souls of all who had perished during the war the effigy in full canonicals with its head supported by angels and with two monks holding open books kneeling at its feet lies on the upper slab and underneath is a ghastly figure in a windingsheet supposed to represent the archbishop after death the diminutive figures which originally filled the niches were destroyed by the puritans but have been to some extent replaced the gaudy colours of the tomb enable one to form some idea of the appearance of the churches in the middle ages when they were bedizened with painted images hangings and frescoes to judge from this specimen the effect must have been distinctly tawdry further east we find the monument of archbishop howley he was chiefly remarkable as having crowned queen victoria and married her to the prince consort and his monument is noticeable as being the first erected to an archbishop in the cathedral since the reformation he himself lies at addington beyond is a fine tomb well worthy of examination crowned by an elaborate canopy which shows traces of rough usage at the hands of the restoring enthusiasts who surrounded the choir with classical wainscoting after the restoration it is the monument of archbishop bourchier a staunch supporter of the house of york he was primate for thirtytwo years from 1454 to 1486 and crowned edward iv richard iii and henry vii the bourchier knot is among the decorations which enrich the canopy of his tomb the southeast transeptaccording to the present custom of the canterbury vergers the visitor is led from the choir to the southeast transept in the choir of ernulf says willis the transepts were cut off from the body by the continuity of the pierarches and the wall above and each transept was therefore a separate room with a flat ceiling but in the new design of william the transepts were opened to the central portion and the triforium and clerestory of the choir were turned at right angles to their courses and thus formed the side walls of the transepts the entire interior of the eastern transept has been most skilfully converted from ernulfian architecture to willelmian if i may be allowed the phrase for the nonce it was necessary that the triforium and clerestory of the new design should be carried along the walls of these transepts which were before the fire probably ornamented by a continuation of those of ernulf but the respective level of these essential members were so different in the old and new works that the only parts of them that could be retained were the windows of the old clerestory which falls just above the new triforium tablet and accordingly these old windows may still be seen in the triforia of the transepts surmounted by the new pointed clerestory windows but the whole of the arcade work and mouldings in the interior of these transepts belongs to william of sens with the sole exception of the lower windows even the arches which open from the east wall of these transepts to the apses have been changed for pointed arches the piers of which have a singularly elegant base in the two apses of this transept altars to st gregory and st john once stood and here were shrines of four saxon primates there is a window in the south wall erected to the memory of dean alford below it is the spot on which the tomb of archbishop winchelsea 12941313 was placed he was famous for his contest with edward i concerning clerical subsidies and for having secured from the king the confirmation of the charter he was more practically endeared to the people by the generosity of his almsgivingit is said that he distributed two thousand loaves among the poor every sunday and thursday when corn was dear and three thousand when it was cheap his tomb was heaped with offerings like the shrine of a saint but the pope refused to confirm the popular enthusiasm by canonizing the archbishop the fact however that it had been so reverenced was enough to qualify it for destruction in the days of henry viii this transept is used at present as a chapel for the kings school a direct continuation of the monastery school at which archbishops winchelsea and kemp were both educated it contains the corinthian throne which was set up in the choir early in the last century the southwest choir aisleat the corner of this aisle we may notice the arcade which shows the combination of the norman rounded arch and double zigzag ornamentation with the pointed arch and dogtooth tracery of william here also are two tombs which have given rise to a good deal of speculation the more easterly one used to be regarded as the monument of hubert walter who was chancellor to richard coeur de lion and followed him and archbishop baldwin to palestine and on the death of the latter was made primate in the camp at acre it is thought more probable however in the light of recent research that he is buried in the trinity chapel the other tomb used to be the resting place of archbishop reynolds the favourite of edward ii but it also affords food for discussion as there is no trace of the palla yshaped strip of lambs wool marked with crosses a special mark of metropolitan dignity which was sent to each primate by the popeon the vestments of the effigy hence conjecture doubts whether these tombs are tenanted by archbishops at all and inclines to the theory that they contain the bones of two of the priors perhaps of destria from this point we can notice the ingenious apparatus connected with the organ st anselms tower and chapelproceeding eastward towards the trinity chapel we pause to examine the chapel or tower of st anselm which corresponds to that of st andrew on the north side of the cathedral both these chapels probably at one time were much more lofty as they are described as lofty towers by gervase it was in order to bring them into the church when it was reconstructed after the fire that the eastward contraction which presents such a curious effect as seen from the choir was found necessary they are now as willis points out only of the same height as the clerestory of the norman church to which they formed appendages and consequently they rose above the sideaisles of that church as much as the clerestory did the external faces of the inward walls of these towers are now inclosed under the roof of williams triforium and it may be seen that they were once exposed to the weather the arches in st anselms tower were originally set up by ernulf but there is reason to believe that they were rebuilt after the great conflagration the arch of communication says willis is a round arch at first sight plainly of the ernulfian period having plaitedwork capitals and mouldings with shallow hollows a similar arch opens on the eastern side of the tower into its apse but a close examination will shew that both these arches have undergone alteration i am inclined to believe that both these arches were reset and reduced in space after the fire probably to increase their strength and that of their piers on account of the loss of abutment when the circular wall of the choirapse was removed the alterations that were made in these arches were probably not important and did not extend beyond the remodelling of the mouldings on the side of the arch towards the choiraisle for we may notice that above both the arches we can still trace the notched decoration which is peculiar to ernulfs work this chapel was originally dedicated to st peter and st paul and a very interesting relic of this saintly patronage has lately been discovered apparently in order to strengthen the building two of the three windows in the chapel were blocked up and a buttress was built across a chord of the apse in the early part of the thirteenth century in the course of the restoration of the tower which was recently carried out this buttress was taken away and its removal laid bare a fresco painting representing st paul and the viper at melita this piece of decoration as need hardly be said must have been put in before the construction of the buttress which has concealed and preserved it for nearly seven centuries it is conjectured with a good deal of reason that a similar presentment of st paul transcriber st peter was painted at the same time on the opposite wall but as it had no buttress to protect it it has been altogether effaced a copy of the fresco of st paul has been placed in the cathedral library the altar of ss peter and paul stood at the east end and behind it was the tomb of the celebrated archbishop anselm by whose name the chapel is now commonly called a very interesting feature of this tower is a large and elaborate fivelight window of the decorated period it replaced the original south window of the chapel and was inserted by prior destria in 1336 it is remarkable as being one of the few instances of decorated architecture in the cathedral and also because of the detailed account that has been preserved of its erection and cost the passage in the archives runs as followsmemorandum that in the year 1336 there was made a new window in christ church canterbury that is to say in the chapel of the apostles st peter and st paul upon which there were expended the following sums s d imprimis for the workmanship or labour of the masons 21 17 9 item for the breaking down of the wall where the window now is 0 16 9 for lime and gravel 1 0 0 for 20 cwt of iron bought for said window 4 4 0 for the labour of the smiths 3 5 4 for caen stone bought for same 5 0 0 for glass and the labour of the glaziers 6 13 4 total 42 17 2 on the heads of the lights of this window were pendent bosses like those of the door in the choirscreen which as has been said was also the work of prior de estria these bosses and the stones from which they were suspended have altogether disappeared otherwise the internal tracery of the window is in good preservation the outside however is in a very bad condition for the purpose of the antiquarian for apparently on account of the decayed state of its surface the tracery has undergone the process of splitting namely the whole of the outer part has been faced down to the glass and fresh worked in portland stone portland stone mullions or monials as they are more properly called have also been supplied and as this repair was executed at a period when this class of architecture was ill understood the mouldings were very badly wrought which with the unfortunate colour and surface of the portland stone has given the window a most ungenuine air however the interior is as good as ever it was and it is on account of its date as well as for its beauty a most valuable example willis the insertion of the window in question probably had the effect of weakening the walls of the chapel at any rate they show signs of a tendency to settle beneath it is the tomb of archbishop bradwardine a great scholar and divine whose primacy only lasted three months opposite to him lies simon de mepehamarchbishop from 1328 to 1333whose tomb forms the screen of the chapel it is a black marble monument well worthy of examination with a double arcade and a richly decorated canopy the ornamentation has been greatly damaged but the shattered remains show traces of beautiful work mepehams short primacy was brought to an untimely end by the contumacy of grandisson bishop of exeter who refused to allow him to enter exeter cathedral actually guarding the west door with an armed force the pope sided with the recalcitrant bishop and mepeham died according to fuller of a broken heart in consequence of this humiliation the watching chamberabove the chapel of st anselm is a small room which is reached by a staircase from the northwest corner a window in it commands a view into the cathedral and from this circumstance it has been inferred that a watcher was stationed here at night to protect the priceless treasures of st thomass shrine from pillage by marauders some doubt has been thrown on this assumption since the site of the shrine is not fully seen from the window but the room is still generally known as the watching chamber probably the shrine was much more efficiently guarded than by the presence of a solitary monk in a chamber from which even if he could see thieves he certainly could not arrest them for we know that on the occasion of fires the shrine was additionally guarded by a troop of fierce bandogs stanley it is also said that king john of france was imprisoned in this chamber during his stay at canterbury but this is most unlikely seeing that he was treated by the black prince more as a sovereign than as a captive illustration some mosaics from the floor of trinity chapel trinity chapelpassing further east we ascend the flight of steps deeply worn by innumerable pilgrims and enter the precincts of the trinity chapel all this part of the cathedral from the choirscreen to the corona was rebuilt from the ground specially with a view to its receiving the shrine of st thomas it is still however called by the name of the trinity chapel which previously occupied this site and was burnt down by the fire which destroyed conrads choir in this chapel thomas becket celebrated his first mass after his installation as archbishop and his remains were laid for some time in the crypt below it this portion of the building was all carried out under the direction of english william gervase relates that when william of sens after his accident perceiving that he derived no benefit from the physicians returned to his home in france his successor english william laid the foundation for the enlargement of the church at the eastern part because a chapel of st thomas was to be built there for this was the place assigned to him namely the chapel of the holy trinity where he celebrated his first masswhere he was wont to prostrate himself with tears and prayers under whose crypt for so many years he was buried where god for his merits had performed so many miracles where poor and rich kings and princes had worshipped him and whence the sound of his praises had gone out into all lands as to the extent to which the second william was guided by the plans of his predecessor we have no means of judging accurately certainly the general outline of this part of the building must have been arranged by william of sens for the contraction of the choir in order to preserve the width of the ancient trinity chapel had been carried out up to the clerestory before his retirement willis deals with the subject at some length whether he says we are to attribute to the french artist the lofty elevation of the pavement of the new chapel by which also so handsome a crypt is obtained below must remain doubtful the bases of his columns as well as those of the shafts against the wall are hidden and smothered by the platform at the top of these steps and by the side steps that lead to beckets chapel this looks like an evidence of a change of plan and induces me to believe that the lofty crypt below may be considered as the unfettered composition of the english architect the trinity chapel of the englishman is under the influence of the french work of which it is a continuation and accordingly the same mouldings are employed throughout and the triforium and clerestory are continued at the same level but the greater level of the pavement wholly alters the proportion of the piers to their arches and gives a new and original and at the same time a very elegant character to this part of the church compared with the work of the frenchman of which at first sight it seems to be a mere continuation the triforium also of this trinity chapel differs from that of the choir in that its four pointed arches instead of being like them included under two circular ones are set in the form of an arcade of four arches of two orders of mouldings each the mouldings are the same as in the choir but the effect of their arrangement is richer also in the clerestory two windows are placed over each pierarch instead of the single window of the choir the mixture of the two forms of arches is still carried on for although the semicircular arch is banished from the triforium it is adopted for the pierarches however in the sideaisles of the trinity chapel and in the corona our english william appears to have freed himself almost as completely from the shackles of imitation as was possible in the sideaisles the mouldings of the ribs still remain the same but their management in connection with the side walls and the combination of their slender shafts with those of the twin lancet windows here for the first time introduced into the building is very happy slender shafts of marble are employed in profusion by william of sens and gervase expressly includes them in his list of characteristic novelties but here we find them either detached from the piers or combined with them in such a manner as to give a much greater lightness and elegance of effect than in the work of the previous architect this lightness of style is carried still farther in the corona where the slender shafts are carried round the walls and made principal supports to the pierarches over which is placed a light triforium and a clerestory and it must be remarked that all the arches in this part of the building are of a single order of mouldings instead of two orders as in the pierarches and triforium of the choir so much for the architectural details of the trinity chapel to the ordinary visitor its interest lies rather in the fact that it contained beckets shrine and that we here see the curious old windows portraying the sainted archbishops miracles and what is perhaps most important of all to many the tomb of edward the black prince this monument is the first feature that we notice as we enter by the southwest gate of the chapel it stands between the two first pillars and by the side of the site of the shrine by the princes will he had left directions that he should be buried in the crypt where he had already founded a chantry at the time of his marriage with the fair maid of kent in 1363 but for some unknown reason probably in order that the dead heros bones might be placed in the most sacred spot possiblehe was laid to rest by the side of the martyr then in the zenith of his sanctity one of the most romantic figures in english history is that of edward the black prince who fought the french as no briton except perhaps nelson has fought them since he was sixteen years old when he commanded the english army in person at the battle of cressy and was wounded in the thickest of that most sanguinary fray ten years later facing an army of 60000 men with a mere 8000 behind him he inflicted a still more severe defeat on the french at poitiers and captured their king whom he took with him to canterbury on his triumphant return to london in all our list of national heroes there is not one who upheld the prowess of the english arms more gallantly than this mighty warrior who was cut off while still in the flower of his years leaving england to the miseries of sedition and civil war his tomb is one of the most impressive of such monuments the gilding and bright colours have almost entirely disappeared but the striking effect of the effigy is probably only enhanced by the solemn sombreness of its present appearance it is a figure clad in full armour spurred and helmeted as the prince had ordained by his will the head rests on the helmet and the hands are joined in the attitude of prayer the face which is undoubtedly a portrait is stern and masterful there you can see his fine face with the plantagenet features the flat cheeks and the wellchiselled nose to be traced perhaps in the effigy of his father in westminster abbey and his grandfather in gloucester cathedral the tomb itself is worthy to support the figure and guard the ashes of the black prince carved on its side clearly that all might read it is the inscription which he had himself chosen it is in norman french which was still the language spoken by the english court and in the same spirit which moved the designer of archbishop chicheles tomb to portray the living man and the mouldering skeleton this epitaph contrasts the glories of the princes lifehis wealth beauty and powerwith the decay and corruption of the grave it is distinctly pagan in thought and reminds one strongly of the laments of the dead homeric heroes as they wail for the joys of life and strength and lordship stanley states that it is borrowed with a few variations from the anonymous french translation of the clericalis disciplina of petrus alphonsus composed between the years 1106 and 1110 but it is strangely unchristian in sentiment as a few lines will show tiel come tu es je autiel fu tu seras tiel come je su de la mort ne pensay je mie tant come javoy la vie en terre avoy grand richesse dont je y fys grand noblesse

and the motto ich diene i serve which according to timehonoured but unauthenticated tradition the prince won from the blind king of bohemia who was led into the thick of the fighting at cressy and died on the field welsh archologists however maintain that these words are celtic and mean behold the man their theory suggests that this was the phrase used by edward i when he presented his firstborn son to the welsh people as their prince and that the words thus became the motto of the princes of wales this is a rather farfetched piece of reasoning and one would certainly prefer to accept the more picturesque tradition which connects the phrase with the glories of cressy the other word found on these escutcheonshoumontis still more puzzling we know that the black prince was wont to sign himself houmont ich diene stanley explains the combination gracefully but not very convincingly if as seems most likely they are german words they exactly express what we have seen so often in his life the union of hoch muth that is high spirit with ich dien i serve they bring before us the very scene itself after the battle of poitiers where after having vanquished the whole french nation he stood behind the captive king and served him like an attendant illustration the black princes tomb from a photograph by carl norman and co the tomb is surmounted by a canopy on which is painted an interesting representation of the trinity the work is a good deal faded but still worthy of notice the absence of the figure of the dove is curious but is not unparalleled in such designs at the corners are symbols of the four evangelists the holy trinityon whose feastday he diedwas held in peculiar veneration by the black prince the ordinance of the chantry founded by him in the crypt contains the phrase ad honorem sancte trinitatis quam peculiari devocione semper colimus a curious metal badge preserved in the british museum is stamped with the figure of the prince kneeling before the almighty and our saviour whose representation is almost identical with the design on the canopy over the tomb here also the figure of the dove is absent round the canopy and in the pillars we can still see the hooks which upheld the black tapestry bordered with crimson and embroidered with cygnes avec ttes de dames which was hung as ordained by his will round the princes tomb and beckets shrine illustration shield coat etc of the black prince lastly above the canopy on a crossbeam between two pillars are suspended the brazen gauntlets the helmet the wooden shield with its moulded leather covering the velvet coat emblazoned with the arms of england and france and the empty sheath the gauntlets were once embellished with little figures of lions on the knuckles these have been detached by collectors vandals almost as ruthless as blue dick and his troopers and without their excuse of mistaken religious zeal the helmet still has its original lining of leather showing that it was actually worn the sword which fitted the now empty sheath is said to have been taken away by oliver cromwell it appeared in manchester at the beginning of this century under circumstances so curious that we may be excused for quoting the following letter from canon wray given in stanleys appendix on the black princes will the sword or supposed sword of the black prince which oliver cromwell is said to have carried away i have seen and many times have had in my hands there lived in manchester when i first came here a mr thomas barritt a saddler by trade he was a great antiquarian and had collected together helmets coats of mail horns etc and many coins but what he valued most of all was a sword the blade about two feet long and on the blade was let in in letters of gold edwardus wallie princeps he was in possession of this sword ad 1794 he told me he purchased many of the ancient relics of a pedlar who travelled through the country selling earthenware and i think he said he got this sword from this pedlar when barritt died in 1820 his curiosities were sold by his widow at a raffle but i believe this sword was not amongst the articles so disposed of it had probably been disposed of beforehand but to whom i never knew yet i think it not unlikely that it is still in the neighbourhood the sword was a little curved scimitarlike rather thick broad blade and had every appearance of being the black princes sword truly a most remarkable story this historic blade which may have hewn down the french ranks at poitiers is disposed of by an itinerant crockery vender to an antiquarian saddler on his death is or is not sold at a raffle andvanishes illustration west gate these arms that hang over the princes tomb are all that are left of two distinct suits one for war and one for use in the joust and the ceremonials of peace which were according to directions given in the will carried in the funeral procession through the west gate and along the high street to the cathedral the pieces which remain all belong to the suit worn in actual warfare the centre of the chapel looks curiously blank being left so by the thoroughness with which all trace of beckets shrine was removed by the reforming zeal and insatiable rapacity of henry viii and his minions the effect of the bare stone pavement presents an impressive contrast to the vanished glories of the shrine blazing with gold and jewels as we read of it for a description of the shrine and its history see chapter i the exact place on which it stood is plainly shown by the marks worn in the stones by the knees of generations of pilgrims as they knelt before it while the prior with his white wand pointed out the choicest of its treasures to the west between the altarscreenthe unhappy effect of which is painfully conspicuous from this pointand the site of the shrine there is some very interesting mosaic pavement containing the signs of the zodiac and emblems of virtue and vice an example of the opus alexandrinum which appears in the floors of most of the roman basilicas a similar piece of mosaic work may be seen round the shrine of edward the confessor at westminster above the eastern end of the shrine a gilded crescent was fixed in the roof which still remains the origin and meaning of this emblem have been disputed with considerable heat and many ingenious conjectures have been framed to account for its presence here one theory regards it as an allusion to the tradition according to which beckets mother was a saracen but this legend is believed to be comparatively modern and as mr george austin points out even if the legend of beckets mother had obtained credence at that early period it may be observed that in the painted windows around no reference is made to the subject though evidently capable of so much pictorial effect another solution would connect the crescent with the worship of the virgin mary who is often pictured as standing on the moon comp rev xii 1 supporters of this theory lay stress on the fact that the trinity chapel at canterbury occupies the extreme east end of the church which is generally the site of the lady chapel and that therefore the presence of this emblemif it can be connected with the virginwould be peculiarly appropriate here mr austin propounded the explanation which is now most generally accepted when the groined roof he says was relieved of the longaccumulated coats of whitewash and repaired the crescent was taken down and regilt it was found to be made of a foreign wood somewhat like in grain to the eastern wood known by the name of ironwood it had been fastened to the groining by a large nail of very singular shape with a large square head apparently of foreign manufacture he comes to the conclusion that the crescent is one of a number of trophies which he supposes to have once decorated this part of the cathedral and he is led to his conclusion by the fact that more than one fresco painting of encounters with the eastern infidels formerly ornamented the walls the last traces of which were removed during the restoration of the cathedral under dean percy afterwards bishop of carlisle and in one of which the green crescent flag of the enemy seems borne away by the english archers might not these frescoes have depicted the fights in which these trophies were won also in the hollows of the groining which radiate from the crescent there were a number of slight iron staples which mr austin having shown that they cannot have supported either hanging lamps or the covering of the shrine believes to have upheld flags horsetails etc which formed the trophy of which the gilded crescent was the centre we know that becket received the title of st thomas acrensis owing to his close connection with the knights of the hospital of st john at acre but none of these explanations seem very convincing and the history and significance of the crescent in the roof seem likely to remain a mystery before we turn from becket and his shrine to the other monuments in the trinity chapel we must call the attention of our readers to the stained windows which depict the miracles of the sainted martyr the chapel was at one time entirely surrounded with glass of this sort but only a portion has survived the ravages of the puritans of these windows says austin unfortunately but three remain but they are sufficient to attest their rare beauty and for excellence of drawing harmony of colouring and purity of design are justly considered unequalled the skill with which the minute figures are represented cannot even at this day be surpassed it is extraordinary to see how every feeling of joy or sorrow pain and enjoyment is expressed both in feature and position but in nothing is the superiority of these windows shown more than the beautiful scrolls and borders which surmount the windows and gracefully connect the groups of medallions most of these windows probably contained representations of becket and so were doomed to destruction by the decree of henry viii in which his grace straitly chargeth and commandeth that henceforth the said thomas becket shall not be esteemed named reputed nor called a saint but bishop becket and that his images and pictures throughout the whole realm shall be put down and avoided out of all churches and chapels and other places and that from henceforth the days used to be festivals in his name shall not be observed nor the service office antiphonies collects and prayers in his name read but rased and put out of all books this proclamation was rigorously carried out though the stained windows which come within its terms have in some cases escaped destruction for instance there remains a window in the south transept of christ church cathedral oxford representing the martyrdom of becket but it is interesting to note that even here the archbishops head was removed from the glass three of the windows of the trinity chapel have survived and fragments of others are scattered over the glass of the building they are entirely devoted to depicting the miracles of the martyr which began immediately after his death and receptionaccording to a vision of benedictin a place between the apostles and the martyrs above even st stephen the window towards the east on the north side of the shrine is divided into geometrical figures each figure composed of a group of fine medallions every group tells the story of a miracle or series of miracles performed by the influence of the saint the lower group portrays the story of a child who was drowned in the medway and afterwards restored to life by the efficacy of the saints blood mixed with water the first medallion shows the boy falling into the stream while his companions pelt the frogs in the reeds by the river side the next shows the companions relating the story of the accident to the boys parents and in the third we see the griefstricken parents watching their sons corpse being drawn out of the river the landscape in these medallions is exceedingly well rendered the trees are depicted with great grace austin unfortunately the medallions which complete this story have been destroyed the next group depicts the quaint story of a succession of miracles which were wrought in the family of a knight called jordan son of eisult his ten year old boy died and the knight who had been an intimate friend of becket in his lifetime resolved to try to restore his son with water mixed with the saints blood at the third draught as benedict tells the story the dead boy opened one eye and said why are you weeping father why are you crying lady the blessed martyr thomas has restored me to you at evening he sat up ate talked and was restored but the father forgot the vow which he made in the first moment of joy at his sons recovery namely that he would offer four silver pieces at the martyrs shrine before mid lent and once more all the household was stricken with sickness and the eldest son died then the parents though sore smitten themselves dragged themselves to canterbury and performed their vow the whole of this story with other details for which we have no space may be accurately traced on this unique window the most striking is the central medallion of the group in which the vengeance of the saint is shown forth in the middle of a large room we see a bier on which lies the dead son the father and mother overcome with despair stand at the head and feet of the body behind the bier are several figures which from their unusually violent attitudes expressive of grief mr austin considered to be professional mourners above unseen by the group below the figure of st thomas clad in full episcopal robes holding a sword in his right hand and pointing to the corpse with his left is seen appearing through the ceiling the expression says austin of the various figures in the above compartments both in gesture and feature is rendered with great skill in the execution of this story the points which doubtless the artists of the monastery were chiefly anxious to impress upon the minds of the devotees who thronged to the shrine are prominently brought out the extreme danger of delaying the performance of a vow under whatever circumstances made the expiation sternly required by the saint and the satisfaction with which the martyr viewed money offerings made at the shrine one of the other groups is noteworthy as proving that severe penances were sometimes performed before the shrine one medallion shows a woman prostrating herself before a priest at the altar while two men stand near holding formidablelooking rods the next picture represents the two men vigorously flagellating the woman with the rods while in the third one of the men is still beating the woman who now lies fainting on the ground while the other is addressing the priest who sits hard by composedly reading his book the other two windows contain representations of the healings effected by the saint which seem to have been of a very varied character to judge from the catalogue with which benedict sums them up what position he asks in the church what sex or age what rank or order is there which could not find something beneficial to itself aliquid sibi utile in this treasurehouse of ours here the light of truth is furnished to schismatics confidence to timid pastors health to the sick and pardon to the deserving penitent pnitentibus venia ejus meritis the last two words probably implying an offering the blind see the lame

the mad are restored to sense the epileptic are cured the feverstricken escape and to sum up omnimoda curatur infirmitas the last of these windows to which we must call the special attention of our readers is one on the north side representing a vision which benedict tells us that he saw himself the martyr is seen coming forth from his shrine in full pontifical robes and making his way towards the altar as if to celebrate mass this window is noticeable as containing the only representation that now exists of the shrine itselffor the picture in the cottonian mss evidently shows us not the shrine but its outer shell or covering the medallion says austin is the more interesting from being an undoubted work of the thirteenth century and having been designed for a position immediately opposite to and within a few yards of the shrine itself and occupying the place of honour in the largest and most important window without doubt represents the main features of the shrine faithfully on the north side of the trinity chapel immediately opposite the tomb of the black prince is that of king henry iv who died in 1413 and his second consort joan of navarre who followed him in 1437 this king had made liberal offerings towards the rebuilding of the nave of the cathedral and it has been conjectured that one of the figures on the organscreen represents him his will ordered that he should be laid to rest in the church at canterbury and here accordingly he was buried on the trinity sunday after his death the tomb with its rich canopy is a beautiful piece of work and the figures of the king and queen are probably faithful representations a curious story was circulated by the yorkists to the effect that henry was never buried here but that his body was thrown into the water between gravesend and barking during the voyage of the funeral cortge to faversham and that only an empty coffin was laid in the trinity chapel that this point might be cleared up the tomb was opened in 1832 in the presence of the dean and there the king was found in perfect preservation and bearing a close resemblance to the effigy on the monumentthe nose elevated the beard thick and matted and of a deep russet colour and the jaws perfect with all the teeth in them except one foretooth in the wall of the north aisle just opposite the kings tomb is a small chapel built according to the directions contained in his will that ther be a chauntre perpetuall with twey prestis for to sing and prey for my soul the roof shows the first piece of fanvaulting admitted into the cathedral on the eastern wall an account is scratched of the cost of a reredos which once stood here but has been entirely destroyed it tells us that the cost of ye middil image was xixs 11d this chapel was doubtless used at one time as a storehouse of sacred relics two recesses in the west wall have lately been chosen to receive certain archiepiscopal vestments which were discovered in a tomb on the south side of trinity chapel which was long believed to be that of archbishop theobald to the east of henry ivs monument is the tomb of dean wotton adorned with his kneeling figure he was the first dean of canterbury after the reorganization by henry viii opposite to him is an unsightly brick erection which was once intended as a temporary covering for the remains of odo coligny cardinal of chatillon and brother of admiral coligny who was one of the victims of the massacre of st bartholomew the cardinal fled from france in 1568 on account of his leanings towards the tenets of the huguenots and was welcomed by queen elizabeth it is believed that he died from the effects of a poisoned apple given to him by a servant it seems curious that the french huguenots who settled in canterbury never provided him with a more fitting monument between this tomb and that of the black prince is the monument of archbishop courtenay who was primate from 1381 to 1396 and was celebrated for his severity towards wycliffe and his followers he was a large contributor to the fund for the rebuilding of the nave which perhaps accounts for the distinguished position of his tomb the fact also that he was executor to the black prince may be responsible for his being buried at his feet it is not however certain that his body actually lies here though the ledger book of the cathedral states that he was buried within the walls of the church it is known however that he died at maidstone and that he ordered in his will that his remains should rest there and a slab in the pavement of all saints maidstone shows traces of a brass representing the figure of an archbishop whence it has been concluded that courtenay was in fact buried there and that his monument in canterbury is only a cenotaph illustration trinity chapel looking into the corona beckets crown with chair of st augustine beckets crownthe circular apse at the extreme east end of the church is known as beckets crown the name has caused a good deal of discussion the theory once generally received was to the effect that the portion of beckets skull which was cut away by richard le breton was preserved here as a relic of special sanctity we know that the black prince bequeathed by his will tapestry hangings for the high altar and for three others viz lautier la ou monsr saint thomas gistlautier la ou la teste estlautier la ou la poynte de lespie est the first and last are evidently the altars at the shrine and in the chapel of the martyrdom and it has been contended that the altar where the head is was the altar of which traces may still be seen in the pavement of the corona or beckets crown against this notion we must place the authority of erasmus whose words plainly show that the martyrs head was displayed in the crypt hinc digressi subimus cryptoporticum illic primum exhibetur calvaria martyris perforata the martyrs pierced tonsure reliqua tecta sunt argento summa cranii pars nuda patet osculo while willis considers that the term corona was a common one for an apse at the end of a church citing ducanges glossary which defines corona ecclesi as pars templi choro postica quod ea pars fere desinat in circulum at all events he concludes it was a general term and not peculiar to christ church canterbury the notion that this round chapel was called beckets crown because part of his skull was preserved here as a relic appears wholly untenable there is at least no doubt that a relic of some sort was preserved here because we know from a record of the offeringsoblaciones s thomduring ten years in the first half of the thirteenth century that the richest gifts were made at the shrine and in the corona and we know that the spot was one of peculiar sanctity from the fact that the shrines of st odo and st wilfrid were finally transferred thither corpus s odonis in feretro ad coronam versus austrum corpus s wilfridi in feretro ad coronam versus aquilonem illustration chair of st augustine on the north side of the corona is the tomb of cardinal pole the last archbishop of canterbury who acknowledged the supremacy of the pope he held office from 1556 to 1558 and died the day after queen mary here stands also the patriarchal chair made out of three pieces of purbeck marble it is called st augustines chair and is said to be the throne on which the old kings of kent were crowned according to the tradition ethelbert on being converted gave the chair to augustine from whom it has descended to the archbishops of canterbury it is needless to say that this eminently attractive legend has been attacked and overthrown by modern criticism it is pointed out that the original archiepiscopal throne was of one piece only and that purbeck marble did not come into use until some time after augustines death from its shape it is conjectured that the chair dates from the end of the twelfth century or the beginning of the thirteenth and that it may have been constructed for the ceremony of the translation of st thomas relics it is in this chair and not in the archiepiscopal throne in the choir that the archbishops are still enthroned from the corona we have a view of the full length of the cathedral which measures 514 feet and is one of the longest of english cathedrals of the windows in beckets crown the centre one is ancient while the rest are modern and afford a most instructive contrast st andrews tower or chapelleaving the trinity chapel and descending the steps we find on our right the door of st andrews chapel which is now used as a vestry formerly it was the sacristy a place from which the pilgrims of humble rank were excluded but where those of wealth and high station were allowed to gaze at a great array of silken vestments and golden candlesticks and also the martyrs pearwood pastoral staff with its black horn crook and his cloak and bloodstained kerchief here also was a chest cased with black leather and opened with the utmost reverence on bended knees containing scraps and rags of linen with which the story must be told throughout the saint wiped his forehead and blew his nose stanley erasmus describes this exhibition with a touch of scorn fragmenta linteorum lacera plerumque macci vestigium servantia his ut aiebant vir pius extergebat sudorem e facie etc the walls of this chapel show many traces of fresco decoration the pattern seems to have consisted of a clustering vine tree spread over the roof in the north wall is a norman chamber which originally served as the treasury the door is still secured by three locks the keys of which were held by different officials st andrews chapel is part of ernulfs work and the peculiar ornamentation which marks his hand may be noticed over the arch of the apse which terminates it the northeast transeptpassing along the choir aisle we see the old bible desk holding the bible which was originally placed there and was restored to this position by the late bishop parry next we enter the northeast transept which in its architectural features is practically a repetition of the southeast transept with which we have already dealt the monument to archbishop tait designed by boehm is well worthy of its surroundings above it in the north wall about ten feet from the ground we may notice three slits in the wall these are what are called hagioscopes on the other side of the wall was a recess connected with the priors chapel through these hagioscopesor holy spyholesthe prior could see mass being celebrated at the high altar and at the altars below in the transept without entering the cathedral these transeptal altars are in the chapels of st martin and st stephen which occupy two apses in the eastern wall st martin is represented in a medallion of ancient glass preserved in the modern window as dividing his coat with a beggar scratched on the walls are the names lanfrancus and ediva regina the bodies of lanfranc and queen ediva were removed to this transept after the fire lanfranc originally lay in the old trinity chapel and when this building was levelled to the ground he was carried to the vestiarium in his leaden covering and there deposited until the community should decide what should be done with so great a father apparently the heavy sheet of lead was removed for gervase goes on to say that lanfranc having remained untouched for sixtynine years his very bones were consumed with rottenness and nearly all reduced to powder the length of time the damp vestments the natural frigidity of lead and above all the frailty of the human structure had conspired to produce this corruption but the larger bones with the remaining dust were collected in a leaden coffer and deposited at the altar of st martin queen ediva as we learn from the same authority who before the fire reposed under a gilted feretrum in nearly the middle of the south cross was now deposited at the altar of st martin under the feretrum of living an archbishop who died in 1020 ediva the wife of edward the elder and a generous benefactress to the cathedral died about 960 from an early list of the subjects represented in the windows of the cathedral it appears that the north windows of the northeast transept depicted the parable of the sower the ancient glass however has been displaced and a good deal of it has been moved to the windows of the north choir aisle between the transept and the chapel of the martyrdom which are of great beauty and should be examined carefully in the transept itself are windows in memory of dean stanley dr spry and canon cheshyre on the wall of the choir aisle close to the transept we can trace the remains of a fresco representing the conversion of st hubert further on there hangs a picture by cross which is intended to represent the murder of becket as a work of art it is not without merit but its details are entirely inaccurate the northwest transept or chapel of the martyrdomthe actual site of the tragedy which rendered becket and his cathedral famous throughout christendom was the northwest transept or as it was more commonly called the chapel of the martyrdom hardly any portion however of this structure as it stands actually witnessed the murder in the time of becket the transept was of two storeys divided by a vault which was upheld by a single pillar the upper partition was dedicated to st blaise and the lower to st benedict in the west wall as now was a door which opened into the cloister illustration the martyrdom northwest transept the story of becket and his quarrel with henry ii will be dealt with in the next chapter but before examining the spot on which he was assassinated it is perhaps fitting to recall the events which immediately preceded his death henrys wrathful exclamation which stirred the four knights to set out on their bloodthirsty mission is well known whatever we may think of the methods employed by these warriorsfitzurse de moreville de tracy and le bret were their nameswe must at least concede that they were gifted with undaunted courage to slay an anointed archbishop in his own cathedral was to do a deed from which the boldest might well shrink in the days when excommunication was held to be a living reality and the church was believed to hold the power of eternal blessing or damnation in her hand these menwho were all closely attached to the kings person and were sometimes described as his cubicularii or grooms of the bedchamberarrived at the gate of the archbishops palace in the afternoon of tuesday december 29th 1170 with a curious want of directness they seem to have left their swords outside and entered and had a stormy interview with becket enraged by his unyielding firmness they went back for their weapons and in the meantime the archbishop was hurried by the terrified monks through the cloister and into the cathedral where the vesper service was being held the knights quickly forced their way after him and the monks locked and barricaded the cloister door but becket who bore himself heroically through the whole scene insisted that the door should be thrown open exclaiming that the church must not be turned into a castle then all the monks but three fled in terror those who stayed urged becket to hide himself in the crypt or in the chapel of st blaise above but he would not hear of concealment but preferred to make his way to the choir that he might die at his post by the high altar as he went up the steps towards the choir the knights rushed into the transept calling for the archbishop the traitor to the king and becket turned and came down and confronted them by the pillar of the chapel clad in his white rochet with a cloak and hood over his shoulders he faced his murderers who were now girt in mail from head to foot they tried to seize him and drag him out of the sacred precinct but he put his back against the pillar and hurled tracy fulllength on the pavement then commending his cause and the cause of the church to god to st denys the martyr of france to st alfege and to the saints of the church he fell under the blows of the knights swords the last stroke was from the hand of le bret it severed the crown of the archbishops head and the murderers sword was shivered into two pieces then the assassins left the church ransacked the palace and plundered its treasures and lastly rode off on horses from the stables in which becket had to the last taken especial pride such is the brief outline of the events of this remarkable tragedy for a fuller account of which we must refer our readers to the excellent description in stanleys memorials of canterbury as we have already said the present transept has been entirely rebuilt although not damaged by the fire it was reconstructed by prior chillenden at the time when he erected the present nave it is even doubtful whether the present pavement is the same as that which was trodden by becket and his murderers a small square stone is still shown in the floor of the transept as marking the exact spot on which the archbishop fell it is said to have been inserted in place of the original piece which was taken out and sent to rome but there is little or no authority for this statement on the other hand we read that benedict when he became abbot of peterborough in order to supply his new cathedral with relics in which it was sadly deficient came back to canterbury and carried off the stones which had been sprinkled with st thomass blood and made therewith two altars for peterborough in this transept an altar was erected called the altar of the martyrdom or the altar of the swords point altare ad punctum ensis from the fact that upon it was laid the broken fragment of le brets sword which had been left on the pavement also a portion of the martyrs brains were kept under a piece of rock crystal and a special official called the custos martyrii was appointed to guard these relics the chief window in this chapel was presented by edward iv in it we can still see the figures of himself and his queen and his two daughters and the two young princes who were murdered in the tower it originally contained representations of seven glorious appearances of the virgin and becket himself in the centre but all this portion was destroyed by blue dick the puritan zealot the west window was the gift of the rev robert moore sometime canon of canterbury it is an elaborate piece of work depicting beckets martyrdom and scenes in his life here also we see the very beautiful and interesting monument to archbishop peckham 12791292 the oldest canterbury monument which survives in its entirety even it has been encroached upon by the commonplace erection adjoining it which commemorates warham who was archbishop from 1503 to 1532 and was the friend of erasmus the deans chapeleastward of the northwest transept is the chapel which was formerly known as the lady chapel but has latterly been named the deans chapel from the number of deans whose monuments have been placed here it stands on the site of the chapel of st benedict and was built by prior goldstone who dedicated it to the blessed virgin in 1460 the usual place for the lady chapel in cathedrals is of course at the extreme east end but at canterbury the situation was occupied by the shrine of st thomas the principal altar to the virgin in our cathedral was that in the crypt in the chapel of our lady undercroft the vault of the deans chapel is noticeable it is a fan vault of the style developed to so great perfection in the tudor period as shown in henry viis chapel at westminster and in the roof of the staircase leading to the dininghall of christ church oxford the architecture of this chapel is perpendicular in style and its delicate decoration should be carefully noticed the screen which separates it from the martyrdom transept is also worthy of close attention the monuments here are interesting rather than beautiful dean fotherby is commemorated by a hideous erection bristling with skulls dean boys is represented as he died sitting among his books in his library it is curious that the books are all apparently turned with the backs of the covers towards the wall and the edges of the leaves outwards here also is the monument of dean turner the faithful follower of charles i illustration part of southwestern transept the southwest transeptcrossing the cathedral through the passage under the choir steps we find ourselves in the southwest transept which together with the nave and the northwest transept was rebuilt by prior chillenden in the pavement we see memorial stones to canons and other departed worthies among them is the tombstone of meric casaubon archbishop lauds prebendary and son of isaac casaubon the famous scholar st michaels or the warriors chapeleastward of the southwest transept is a small chapel generally known as that of st michael in position and size it closely corresponds with the deans chapel on the north side of the church in general style there is also some resemblance but the vaulting of the roof is quite different it is described by professor willis as as a complex lierne vault of an unusual pattern but resembling that of the north transept of gloucester cathedral which dates from 1367 to 1372 the exact date and the name of the builder of this chapel are alike uncertain but it probably replaced the old chapel of st michael at some time towards the end of the fourteenth century and willis comes to the conclusion that it is most probable that its erection may be ascribed to prior chillenden and that it formed part of the general scheme for the transformation of the western part of the church a curious effect is presented by the tomb of stephen langton who was archbishop from 1207 to 1228 and is famous as having compelled king john to sign the great charter and also as having divided the bible into chapters his tomb shaped like a stone coffin is half in the chapel and half under the eastern wall and professor willis considers that it was originally outside the wall in the churchyard and thus the new wall when the chapel was rebuilt and enlarged in the fourteenth century was made to stride over the coffin by means of an arch the reverence in which langtons memory was held is attested by the fact that his remains must have lain under the altar of the chapel a most unusual position except in the case of celebrated saints in the middle of the chapel is a very beautiful and interesting monument erected by margaret holland who died in 1437 to the memory of her two husbands and herself the monument is of alabaster and marble and represents the lady reposing with her first spouse john beaufort earl of somerset and son of john of gaunt on her left and thomas duke of clarence her second husband on her right the latter was the second son of henry iv and so nephew of john of somerset the first husband he was killed at the battle of baug in 1421 leland thinks that this chapel was built expressly for the reception of this tomb this chapel be likelihood was made new for the honor of erle john of somerset but it is probably of rather earlier date than would be allowed by this theory the figures of margaret and her two lords are very fine and are interesting examples of fifteenth century costume as such they may be contrasted with the effigy of lady thornhurst who exhibits all the beauty of an elizabethan ruff sir thomas thornhurst whose monument is hard by was killed in the illfated expedition to the isle of rh in the corner of the chapel is the bust of sir george rooke viceadmiral who led the assault on gibraltar by which it was first captured and the title of warriors chapel is further justified by the presence here of tattered standards memorials of dead comrades left by the famous kentish regiment the buffs illustration the crypt the main cryptreturning through the passage under the steps that lead up to the choir we turn to the right into the crypt which originally supported conrads glorious choir on the wall as we enter we may notice some diaperwork ornamentation interesting from the fact that a similar decoration may be traced on the wall of the chapter house at rochester for ernulf who built the westward crypt was afterwards made bishop of rochester willis tells us that there are five crypts in england under the eastern parts of cathedrals namely at canterbury winchester gloucester rochester and worcester and that they were all founded before 1085 after this they were discontinued except as a continuation of former ones as in canterbury and rochester this crypt of ernulfs replaced the earlier one set up by lanfranc willis thinks it not impossible that the whole of the piershafts may have been taken from the earlier crypt the capitals of the columns are either plain blocks or sculptured with norman enrichments some of them however are in an unfinished state he describes minutely one of the capitals on the southwest side of the four sides of the block two are quite plain one has the ornament roughed out or bosted as the workmen call it that is the pattern has been traced upon the block and the spaces between the figures roughly sunk down with square edges preparatory to the completion on the fourth side the pattern is quite finished this proves that the carving was executed after the stones were set in their places and probably the whole of these capitals would eventually have been so ornamented had not the fire and its results brought in a new school of carving in the rich foliated capitals which caused this merely superficial method of decoration to be neglected and abandoned in the same way some of the shafts are roughly fluted in various fashions the plain ones would probably have all gradually had the same ornament given to them had not the same reasons interfered the crypt then stands as it was left by ernulf except that some of the piers were afterwards strengthened and one new pillar was inserted in the aisle by william of sens in order to fit in with the new arrangement of the pillars in the choir which he was then rebuilding it is therefore of course the oldest part of the church and remains a most beautiful and interesting relic of norman work in spite of the hot water pipe apparatus which now disfigures it and its general air of unkempt untidiness there are signs however that in this respect there is likely to be some improvement the floor is being lowered to its original level by the removal of about a foot of accumulated dirt which had been heaping itself up for the last eight hundred years and had at last entirely smothered the bases of the columns and it is even whispered that the part now cut off and used as the french church may be opened out and restored to its original position as part of the main crypt according to gervase the whole of the crypt was dedicated to the virgin mary here stood the chapel of our lady undercroft surrounded by perpendicular stonework screens from which the altarscreen in the choir above was imitated the shrine of the virgin was exceedingly rich and was only shown to privileged worshippers traces of decoration may still be seen in the vault above it was at the back of this shrine that becket was laid between the time of his murder and his translation to the restingplace in the trinity chapel in the main crypt we may notice the monument of isabel countess of athol who died in 1292 she was heiress of chilham castle near canterbury and granddaughter of king john she was twice married her second husband being alexander brother of john baliol king of scotland the monument of lady mohun of dunster is in the south screen of the chapel of our lady she was ancestress of the present earl of derby and founded a perpetual chantry lastly here is the tomb of cardinal archbishop morton the friend of sir thomas more and the faithful servant of the house of lancaster it was he who brought about the union of the red and white roses by arranging the marriage of henry of richmond with elizabeth of york as henry viis chancellor he made great exactions under the euphonious title of benevolences and propounded the famous dilemma known as mortons fork by which he argued that those who lived lavishly must obviously have something to spare for the kings service while those who fared soberly must be grown rich on their savings and so were equally fair game to the royal plunderer he lies in the southwest corner of the crypt and his monument which has suffered considerably at the hands of the puritans bears the tudor portcullis and the archbishops rebus a hawk or mort standing on a tun illustration st gabriels chapel in the southeast corner under anselms tower is a chapel generally known as that of st john sometimes as that of st gabriel it has been divided into two compartments by a wall there are some very interesting paintings2 on the roof representing our lord in the centre of the angelic host the adoration of the magi and a figure of st john this work is believed to be of the thirteenth century the central pillar of this chapel with the curved fluting in the column and the quaintly grotesque devices of the figures carved on the capital is well worthy of close examination the grate that we see here was erected by the french protestants large numbers of whom fled to england during the persecution which was instituted against their sect in 1561 they were welcomed by queen elizabeth and allowed to settle in canterbury where the cathedral crypt was made over to them to use as a weaving factory it is possible that the ridges in the floor of st johns chapel are marks left by their looms but more evident trace of their occupation is afforded by the inscriptions in french painted on the pillars and arches of the main crypt and again by the custom which still survives of holding a french service in the south aisle of the crypt this part has been walled off especially as a place of worship for the descendants of the french exiles and here service is still held in the french tongue alterations have been lately made by which the french service is held in the black princes chantry and the part of the crypt formerly walled off has been merged with the rest of the crypt which is thus completely thrown open access to the french church is now obtained from the crypt and not from outside this chantry was founded by the black prince in 1363 to commemorate his marriage with his cousin joan the fair maid of kent here according to the princes ordinance two priests were to pray for his soul in his lifetime and after the situation of the two altars at which the priests prayed can still be traced on the vaulting we see the arms of the prince and of his father and what seems to be the face of his wife in return for the permission to institute this chantry the prince left to the monastery of canterbury an estate which still belongs to the chapter the manor of fawkes hall this was a piece of land in south lambeth which had been granted by king john to a baron called fawkes his name still survives in the word vauxhall 2 the above paintings are illustrated in darts history of canterbury 1726 and in archologia cantiana vol xviii illustration in the main crypt with tomb of cardinal morton see p 99 the eastern cryptthe eastern portion of the crypt under the trinity chapel and the corona is a good deal more lofty than ernulfs building we noticed the ascent from the choir and presbytery to the trinity chapel and it is of course this greater elevation of the cathedral floor at the east end which accounts for the greater height of the eastern crypt the effect both above and below is exceedingly happy the most striking thing about the interior of the cathedral is the manner in which it riseschurch piled upon churchfrom the nave to the corona and this characteristic enabled william the englishman to build a crypt below which has none of the cramped squatness which generally mars the effect of such buildings the lofty crypt below says willis may be considered the unfettered composition of the english architect its style and its details are wholly different from those of william of sens the work from its position and office is of a massive and bold character but its unusual loftiness prevents it from assuming the nature of a crypt there is one detail of this crypt which differs especially from the work above the abacus of each of the piers as well as that of each central shaft is round but in the whole of the choir the abacuses are either square or square with the corners cut off it was in the smaller eastern crypt which formerly occupied the site of williams building which we are now examining that becket was hastily buried after his assassination when his murderers were still threatening to come and drag his body out hang it on a gibbet tear it with horses cut it into pieces or throw it in some pond to be devoured by swine or birds of prey and from that time until the translation of the relics in 1220 this was the most sacred spot in the cathedral and it was known down to reformation times as beckets tomb hither came the earliest pilgrims in the first rush of enthusiasm for the newlycanonized martyr and here henry ii performed that penance which is one of the most striking examples of the churchs power presented by history we are told that he placed his head and shoulder in the tomb and there received five strokes from each bishop and abbot who was present and three from each of the eighty monks after this castigation he spent the night in the crypt fasting and barefooted his penitence and piety were rewarded by the victory gained at richmond on that very day by his forces over william the lion of scotland who was taken prisoner and afterwards recognizing the power of the saint founded the abbey of aberbrothwick to saint thomas of canterbury chapter iv the history of the see the history of the see of canterbury may be said to have begun with the coming of augustine for there can be no doubt that it is owing to its being the settlingplace of the first messengers of the gospel in saxon england that canterbury has been the metropolis of the english church pope gregory with his usual thoroughness sent to augustine soon after his arrival here an elaborate scheme for the division of our island into sees which were to be gradually developed as christianity spread according to his arrangement there were to be two archbishops one at london and one at york but we cannot regret that this scheme was not carried out as an archiepiscopal see is much more picturesquely framed by the hills which encircle canterbury than it could have been by the dingy vastness of the political and social capital augustine reached england in 597 and found that his path had been made easy by the fact that bertha wife of ethelbert king of kent was a christian he soon effected the conversion of the king himself and his labours were so rapidly successful that at christmas 597 no less than ten thousand saxons were baptized at the mouth of the medway the archiepiscopal pall and a papal bull creating augustine first english archbishop were duly sent from rome and the royal palace in canterbury with an old churchroman or britishclose by were handed over to him by ethelbert the first archbishop died in 605 and was buried according to the old roman custom by the side of the high road which had brought him to canterbury a few years later however his remains were transferred to the abbey of ss peter and paul which had then just been completed augustine was succeeded by one of the monks who had originally come with him from rome the new archbishops name was lawrence he had been already consecrated by augustine in his lifetime this unusual measure was thought to be necessary as the church had hardly yet established itself in a strong position indeed so weak was its hold over its rapidly acquired converts that when ethelberts son who succeeded his father in 616 backslid into the path of heathendom the great majority of the people followed the royal example and lawrence together with the bishops of london and rochester prepared to leave england altogether as a country hopelessly abandoned to paganism however the archbishop determined to make one more attempt to maintain his position and succeeded in terrifying the king by a pretended miracle into becoming a christian he then recalled the two bishops who had already crossed to france and on his death in 619 was succeeded by the bishop of london mellitus mellitus only held the primacy till 624 when his place was filled by justin who also had a brief archiepiscopal life being succeeded in 627 by honorius this archbishop held the see for twentysix years till 653 and it was not until 655 that his successor was appointed so far the archbishops had all been foreigners who had come over either with augustine or with the second company of missionaries who were despatched by gregory soon after ethelberts conversion in 655 however a native englishman named frithona was consecrated by the saxon bishop of rochester and adopted the name of deus dedit he ruled at canterbury till 664 and after his death the see remained vacant for four years probably owing to the plague which was then wasting all europe and caused the death of wighard a saxon who had started for rome to receive his consecration there but in 668 theodore a native of tarsus in cecilia was appointed and was welcomed by the members of the torn and divided english church he devoted all his energy to centralizing and consolidating the power of the archbishop which had been hitherto largely nominal he journeyed all over england correcting the prevalent laxity of discipline and establishing the control of the metropolitan authority he went so far as to interfere with the archbishopric of york and with the help of the king attempted to divide it into three sees he was moreover an enthusiastic scholar and first diffused the study of greek in england he had brought a copy of homer with him and is said to have established a school of greek in canterbury he died in 690 and after his death there was no archbishop for three years in 693 one brethwald an english monk some time abbot of reculver was appointed to the see the saxon church shows that it had benefited by theodores rigorous discipline in that it was henceforth able to supply its own archbishops it had now securely established itself all over the country and the last home of paganism which curiously enough held its own longest in sussex had been finally converted in theodores time brethwald ruled till 731 and was followed by tatwin 731734 and nothelm 734740 in 740 cuthbert became archbishop he seems to have been an interesting personage with a good deal of zeal for reform he is recorded to have assembled a synod at cliff to discuss measures for the improvement of the lives and behaviour both of clergy and laity probably at his instigation the synod ordained that the lords prayer and the creed should be taught in the vulgar tongue he was the first archbishop buried in the cathedral he was succeeded by bregwin who held the see from 759 to 765 he was an exception among the series of english primates being of german origin during the rule of the next archbishop jaenbert an attempt was made to transfer the primacy from canterbury offa the king of mercia had established himself in a position of commanding power and wishing that the seat of the chief ecclesiastical authority should be within his own dominion obtained a bull from pope adrian i by which an archbishop of lichfield was created with a larger see than that of canterbury jaenbert seems to have acquiesced though doubtless most unwillingly in this arrangement but in spite of the central situation of lichfield the traditional claims of canterbury were too strong and adulf was the first and last archbishop of lichfield athelard who succeeded jaenbert in 790 had the primacy restored to him the northmen began their raids on the english coasts at this time and their ravages probably continued through the days of his successors wulfred feologild ceolnoth and ethelred 805889 in 889 the learned plegmund formerly tutor of alfred was by his quondam pupils influence made archbishop of canterbury it was during his time that the sees of wells for somerset and crediton for devonshire were established athelm 914923 wulfhelm 923942 odo 942959 called the severe was born a pagan dane of east anglia but having been received into a noble saxon family was duly baptized into the faith he was appointed to the wiltshire bishopric by athelstane and combined in his person the characters of the warlike dane and the christian churchman like his successor dunstan odo made his chief objects in life the maintenance of the churchs supremacy and the reformation of the married clergy he bore his archbishopric with much pomp and dignity through the reigns of edmund edred and edwy he was responsible for dunstans conduct on the occasion of king edwys coronation though it is not known how far he sanctioned the cruelties subsequently practised on elgiva odo reconstructed and enlarged the cathedral his immediate successor was elsi bishop of winchester but this archbishop died while on his way to rome to receive his pall from the pope dunstan 960988 the next archbishop continued odos crusade against the married clergy which he conducted relentlessly in many cases the secular clergy were turned out of their livings to make room for members of the regular monkish orders even with these harsh measures and the employment of miracles the archbishop does not seem to have succeeded in enforcing celibacy among the clergy dunstan was born in somersetshire of noble parents and educated at the abbey of glastonbury he became abbot of that place and bishop of worcester and london at the coronation of edwy he intruded himself into the kings presence and was afterwards obliged to retire to ghent he held the see of canterbury for twentyseven years and on his death was buried in the cathedral where countless miracles are said to have been worked at his tomb ethelgar 988989 siricius 990994 lfric 9951005 alphege 10051012 prior of glastonbury migrated thence to bath where he founded the great abbey afterwards united to the see of wells after holding the see of winchester for twentytwo years he was translated to canterbury when in 1011 canterbury was sacked by the danes he was carried off a prisoner and on his refusal to ransom himself was barbarously murdered by his captors his body was ransomed by the people of london and buried at st pauls cathedral whence it was removed to canterbury by canute subsequently in the time of lanfranc he was canonized living 10131020 also suffered much from the danes who from this time continued their incursions until the reign of canute egelnoth 10201038 is described as the first dean of the canterbury canons who seem to have acquired an ascendancy over the monks ever since the massacre of the latter by the danes in 1011 he restored the cathedral after the damages inflicted by the invaders eadsi 10381050 robert of jumiges 10511052 was one of the many normans who were brought over into england by king edward the confessor he took an active part in the kings quarrel with the great earl godwin and in the reaction which followed against the normans retired to jumiges where he remained till his death stigand 10521070 bishop of winchester held this see conjointly with that of canterbury he was remarkable for his avarice his espousal of the cause of edgar the atheling led the conqueror to regard him with suspicion william took the archbishop with him when he returned into normandy and eventually dispossessed him along with some other bishops and abbots at a synod held at winchester in the year 1070 stigand was imprisoned at winchester where he eventually died resisting to the last the attempts made by the king to elicit information as to the whereabouts of the vast treasures which he had accumulated and hidden lanfranc 10701089 was the first norman archbishop of canterbury he was born at pavia and educated at the monastery of bec in normandy then the most remarkable seat of learning existing in europe his conspicuous abilities raised him to the position of prior of the monastery he was subsequently abbot of the new monastery which william of normandy founded at caen and on the deposition of stigand was called over by that king to complete the subjection and reform of the anglosaxon church which task he undertook with much zeal and not a little highhanded procedure he assisted the king in the removal of the saxon bishops and the substitution of normans in their places as also in the reformation of the great english monasteries which appear to have fallen into considerable disorder lanfrancs character was remarkable for its firmness and brought him into frequent collision with the imperious temper of his royal master on one occasion lanfranc insisted on the restoration of twentyfive manors which belonged to the archiepiscopal see and which had been appropriated by odo bishop of bayeux williams halfbrother william however continued to honour his able servant and during the kings absence in normandy lanfranc held the office of chief justiciary and viceregent within the realm and maintained his independent attitude against all the world refusing to go to rome at the summons of the pope lanfranc crowned william ii and as long as he lived did much to moderate that monarchs rapacious attacks on the wealth of the church he rebuilt the cathedral which had fallen into ruin and founded the great monastery of christ church he was the author of a celebrated treatise in refutation of the doctrine of berengarius of tours on the subject of the real presence and was present at the council held in rome by leo ix in which berengarius was condemned he lies buried in the nave of his cathedral but the exact spot is not known anselm 10931109 was born at aosta and studied under lanfranc at bec when he succeeded him as prior of the convent and subsequently became abbot he visited england on the invitation of hugh the fat earl of chester and while there was called in by the king and made archbishop of canterbury rufus had kept the see vacant and appropriated the revenues of this and many other church properties and was only induced by the fear of impending death to appoint anselm to the see anselm was with difficulty persuaded to accept the post but from that hour posed as the firm champion of the rights of the church and the opponent and denouncer of the kings exactions and the general immorality of the times he refused to receive his pall at the hands of the king but eventually agreed to take it himself from the high altar of the cathedral at canterbury though deserted by his bishops he held his own against the king until an accusation of failing in his duty to supply troops for the kings welsh expedition drove him into exile and he made his way to rome when his learning created much sensation and was enlisted against the errors of the greek church on the subject of the procession of the holy ghost on his accession to the throne henry i as part of his reversal of his brothers ecclesiastical policy recalled anselm from banishment and filled up the vacant see but anselm remained firm on the subject of the rights of the church in the matter of the investiture of the clergy and refused to consecrate the bishops who had received their investiture from the king or to do homage or swear fealty to henry the king on his side was determined to uphold the rights of the crown and the matter was referred to the pope anselm had to visit rome in person and meeting with but lukewarm support from the pope agreed at last to a compromise at bec in 1106 by which the king surrendered the symbols of the ring and crozier while retaining his right to the oaths of fealty and homage anselm returned to england and spent the last two years of his life in comparative repose he died at canterbury and was buried near lanfranc but his remains were afterwards removed to the tower that bears his name after his death the see was again vacant for five years and was managed by ralf bishop of rochester who was however made archbishop later he was a disciple of lanfranc but as an archbishop was unimportant william de corbeuil 11231136 was the first archbishop who received the title of papal legate he crowned king stephen after solemnly swearing to support the cause of matilda and is said to have died of remorse for his conduct in the matter he completed the restoration of the cathedral and dedicated it with much pomp and display theobald 11391161 the next archbishop had been abbot of bec and was a benedictine his importance as archbishop was much overshadowed by henry of blois bishop of winchester and brother of king stephen the pope granted him the title of legatus natus which was retained by his successors until the reformation the life of this prelate was one of varying fortunes and he was twice in exile he eventually along with henry of blois took an important part in the final compromise which was effected between the factions of stephen and matilda on his death the see remained vacant for more than a year thomas becket 11621170 was the son of a london merchant and was educated among the augustinian canons of merton in surrey he came under the patronage of archbishop theobald whom he accompanied when the latter visited rome while still only a deacon becket received many ecclesiastical benefices including the archdeaconry of canterbury about 1155 he was appointed chancellor through the influence of theobald and thenceforward until he became archbishop enjoyed the most intimate friendship and confidence of king henry ii his magnificence and authority during this period of his career exceeded that of the most powerful nobles and created much sensation in france whither he was dispatched to demand the hand of the princess margaret for the kings infant son when offered the archbishopric of canterbury he is said to have warned the king that his acceptance of the office would entail his devotion to god and his order in preference to the interests of the king he was however persuaded to accept the primacy and after being duly ordained priest was consecrated archbishop by henry of blois the bishop of winchester from this moment onwards the entire character and attitude of becket was changed he gave up his old pomp and magnificence and devoted himself to monastic severity and works of charity he furthermore insisted on resigning his temporal offices including that of chancellor and engaged on his lifelong struggle with the king on the subject of the privileges of the clergy since the separation of the bishops from the secular courts by the conqueror a gross system of abuse had arisen under which all persons who could read and write could claim exemption from the jurisdiction of the ordinary secular courts and insist on being tried only before their own ecclesiastical tribunal the spiritual courts could inflict no corporal punishment and the result was that many guilty persons escaped punishment at their hands and the benefit of clergy came to mean a practical licence to commit crimes this was naturally in radical opposition to the judicial policy of henry ii and matters were brought to a climax by the scandalous case of philip brois a murderer whom becket rescued from the kings justice and condemned to a totally inadequate sentence the king determined to clear the question of all doubt and to this end drew up the famous constitutions of clarendon in which the clergy was subjected equally with the laity to the common laws of the land the archbishop took the oath but refused to sign the constitution as he insisted on the immunity of the clergy from all secular jurisdiction on retiring from the council he sought and obtained absolution from his oath at the hands of the popealexander iiiwho insecure in his own position and unable to dispense with the friendship of the king of england maintained a vacillating attitude in the quarrel between becket and henry the king now began a systematic persecution of the archbishop he was pressed with various charges and finally was ordered to account for the moneys which he had received from the vacant see of canterbury and other ecclesiastical properties in his capacity as chancellor there seems small reason to doubt that the charge was an unjust one and was merely employed by the king as an instrument of offence against his political adversary the archbishop came before the council in all the pomp and panoply of his office and bearing his own cross as he had been deserted by most of his bishops after an exciting scene he escaped before any definite judgment was pronounced and took refuge in france where he was hospitably and honourably received by king louis vii here he continued his struggle with the king of england henry seized upon the revenues of the see of canterbury and banished all beckets kinsmen dependants and friends becket replied by solemnly denouncing the constitution of clarendon and excommunicating all who should enforce them after further contentions and fruitless negotiations henry issued a proclamation withdrawing his subjects obedience to the archbishop enforced by an oath from all freemen this oath many of the bishops refused to take the pope under temporary pressure from beckets enemies authorized the archbishop of york to crown the young prince henry and the supremacy of the see of canterbury over all england being thus called in question became thenceforward one of the principal subjects of dispute between becket and the king the action of the king was unpopular and henry seeing that he had gone too far consented to enter on some sort of reconciliation with becket who ventured to return to england in spite of the manifest danger in which he found himself becket on his return to england continued his highhanded policy excommunicating the archbishop of york and others of his enemies on hearing of this conduct henrys fury got the better of him and his famous exclamation led to the departure of the four knights to canterbury they demanded the immediate removal of the excommunication becket was hurried into the cathedral by the monks and murdered at the altar on his death he was immediately canonized and many miracles occurred at his tomb henry himself was ordered to do penance for his death the fame of his shrine brought countless pilgrims to canterbury which was thus for the first time raised to a position of importance throughout the whole of europe richard 11741184 prior of dover was the next archbishop he had been present at beckets murder and helped to convey his body to the crypt he was somewhat indifferent to spiritual matters and was chiefly occupied in supporting the supremacy of the see of canterbury over that of york a question which led to at least one scene of unseemly disturbance in which the archbishop of york nearly lost his life one result of the quarrel was the conferring of the title of primate of england and primate of all england on the archbishops of york and canterbury respectively by the pope baldwin 11851190 was the first monk of the cistercian order who held the see of canterbury he came into collision with the benedictine monks with whom the election to the primacy had always rested and whom he attempted in vain to deprive of that privilege in favour of a body of canons at lambeth which he purchased for the see he accompanied richard coeur de lion to the holy land and died in camp before acre reginald fitz jocelyn bishop of bath and wells was next elected but died before receiving the pall hubert walter 11931205 was born at west derham in norfolk and educated by ranulph de glanville he was made bishop of salisbury and accompanied richard i to the holy land when archbishop he held the office of justiciary but was removed from the latter by a papal bull since it compelled him to judge causes of blood he became chancellor and conducted the duties of his high offices in an admirable manner the laws enacted under richard i are said to have been drawn up by him and he completed the house of regular canons at lambeth he was buried in his own cathedral where his effigy still remains after some disputes on the subject of election the pope innocent iii was appealed to and decided in favour of stephen langton 12071228 who was an englishman of spotless character and profound theological learning he was consecrated at peterborough by innocent iii the fury of king john knew no bounds he drove the monks of canterbury to flanders and refused to allow langton to set foot in england the result of this conduct was the publication of the celebrated interdict followed soon after by the personal excommunication of the king and the absolution of his subjects from their oath of allegiance by the pope philip of france was ordered to depose the english king whose crown was declared forfeited hard pressed by his enemies and having alienated his people from his cause king john was driven to humiliating submission he promised to receive langton and to restore the church property and finally formally resigned his crown into the hands of pandulph the papal legate archbishop langton was received with honour and king john threw himself at his feet and reconciled himself with the church he also ordered a great council to meet at st albans to settle finally the restitution of the church property here however he was met by an open declaration of the complaints of all classes langton though elevated to the primacy entirely through the influence of the pope proved himself a staunch englishman and posed as the champion of national liberty against the claims of both pope and king it was he who produced to the malcontents the coronation charter of henry i which the barons accepted as a declaration of the views and demands of their party he was at the head of the barons in their struggle with the king and his name appears as that of the first witness to the famous magna charta john at once applied to the pope and obtained from him the abrogation of the charter and a papal order to langton to excommunicate the kings enemies this he refused to do john overran the country with foreign mercenaries and his cruelties eventually resulted in the barons summoning louis of france to their assistance langton was summoned to rome to attend the lateran council and was detained there until the deaths of innocent iii and king john after which he was permitted to return to his see and passed the remainder of his life in comparative tranquillity siding strongly with the national party under hubert de burgh he presided at the translation of beckets remains from the crypt to trinity chapel he rebuilt much of the archiepiscopal palace at canterbury and he lies buried in his own cathedral he was the first who divided the bible into chapters richard de wethershed 12291231 chancellor of lincoln was next appointed but died on his way back from italy after three more elections by the monks which were all set aside by the pope honorius iii the monks consented to accept edmund rich 12341240 treasurer of salisbury he was the son of a merchant of abingdon and was educated at oxford university he had a great reputation for learning and piety he came into disfavour with the king by his opposition to the marriage of his sister eleanor to simon de montfort his sympathies were all on the side of the national party he procured the downfall of des roches and maintained the struggle against the foreign favourites and papal exactions for which the reign of henry iii is notorious at length he retired to the cistercian abbey at pontigny which had formerly sheltered becket and langton in despair at the condition of england and of her church it was during his time that the great movements of the dominican and franciscan friars reached england and though the archbishop never actually joined their ranks he was doubtless much influenced by their teaching and example and was himself an itinerant preacher after leaving oxford he was canonized six years after his death he was succeeded by boniface of savoy 12411270 one of the kings uncles whose violence and warlike bearing made him a strange contrast to his predecessor his term of office was one long history of papal exactions from the english clergy and of the tyranny of foreigners creatures of henry iii over the rights of the nation the revenues of the see of canterbury and the enormous sums wrung from the clergy were squandered on foreign wars and the archbishop himself resided abroad boniface took a leading part in the spoliation of the english church he was one of the kings council at the socalled mad parliament robert kilwardby 12731278 was nominated by the pope after a fruitless election of their subprior by the monks he was a very learned dominican educated at oxford and paris john peckam 12791292 was like his predecessor nominated by the pope after an education at oxford and paris he also was a franciscan he was at first a staunch supporter of king edward i whom he accompanied to wales it is to be regretted that he supported the king in his cruelties to the conquered welsh and in the expulsion of the jews he firmly defended the privileges of his see against first the archbishop of york and secondly the king it was in his time 1279 that the famous statute of mortmain was passed the exactions of the papacy had been considerably lessened and the church was beginning to recover its wealth and national character peckam died at mortlake and was buried in the transept of the martyrdom at canterbury where his tomb and effigy still remain robert winchelsea 12921313 was next nominated king and clergy being unanimous on this occasion and at once proceeded to rome where he remained some time before returning to england meanwhile edward i had demanded the enormous subsidy of one half their annual revenue from the clergy winchelsea is said to have been responsible for the celebrated bull clericis laicis issued by boniface viii in defence of the property of the church on his return home the archbishop continued to lead the clergy in their opposition to the kings demands and paid the penalty in the seizure of his whole estate for the kings use he retired with a single chaplain to a country parsonage discharged the humble duties of a priest and lived on the alms of his flocks when the war broke out edward sought to propitiate the clergy by restoring the archbishop to his barony and summoning him to a parliament at westminster where the clergy abandoned their own ground of ecclesiastical immunity from taxation and took shelter under the liberties of the realm thus identifying themselves with the popular cause in their opposition to the exactions of the king on his return from flanders edward accused winchelsea of conspiring against him in his absence and the archbishop was again deprived of all his possessions and after many privations escaped to france on the accession of edward ii he was recalled and restored to his honour but subsequently became again the centre of revolution and himself excommunicated the kings favourite gaveston he nevertheless continued undisturbed in the discharge of his office until his death during his prosperous years winchelsea was famous for his charities and liberality after his death he was regarded as a saint and his shrine in the southeast transept was removed by the commissioners of henry viii at the same time as that of saint thomas becket walter reynolds 13131327 was appointed by the pope at the request of the king who had set aside an election of the monks he was tutor and subsequently chancellor to edward ii after gavestons death he became keeper of the great seal he obtained many bulls of privilege from rome in spite

he was opposed in his visitation by grandisson the powerful bishop of exeter who refused him admission to his cathedral by force he was unsupported by the pope and is said to have died of a broken heart in consequence his tomb forms the screen of st anselms chapel john stratford 13331348 was appointed by the pope at the request of edward iii he was educated at merton college oxford and became archdeacon of lincoln and bishop of winchester he was made lord treasurer by edward ii to whose cause he remained faithful during the shortlived triumph of isabella and the desertion of the archbishop edward iii made him lord chancellor in which office he was succeeded by his own brother robert stratford had endeavoured to dissuade the king from entering on the french war and the king hard pressed for money had the archbishop arraigned for high treason stratford fled from lambeth to canterbury where he excommunicated his accusers he subsequently returned to london and sheltered himself not under his ecclesiastical immunity but under his privileges of parliament as a member of the house of peers a significant landmark in the history of the english church the quarrel between the king and the archbishop was amicably settled stratford held exalted opinions on the subject of clerical superiority and his arraignment without the support of the pope was a decisive blow against the power of the church in his time also a layman was for the first time appointed to the office of chancellor and edward iii wrote a letter to the pope protesting against the frequent papal nominations to vacant english sees which was followed up by the statute of provisors in 1350 stratford died at mayfield in sussex and was buried in his own cathedral where his monument still remains thomas bradwardine 1349

crown of france and promised large subsidies from the church for its support there is no doubt that this was a successful attempt at diverting the popular attention from threatened attempts on the wealth of the church he was reproached by the pope martin v with lack of zeal in the interests of the papacy in not procuring the reversal of the statutes of provisors and of prmunire by which amongst others the papal power was held in check in england among his foundations are the colleges of st bernard afterwards st johns and all souls at oxford and a library at canterbury for the monks of christ

deprived of all his offices as a married priest and lived privately until the accession of elizabeth who made him archbishop he was duly elected by the new chapter of canterbury and held his post during a most difficult time with marvellous tact and judgment religious toleration for its own sake was an idea yet unknown but parker directed that great caution should be observed in administering the oath of supremacy to those of the clergy who still favoured the old religion it is much to his credit that he managed to preserve such good relations with the queen in face of elizabeths prejudice against the marriage of the clergy he was an enlightened patron of learning and did much to encourage all branches of art edmund grindall 15761583 was born at st bees and educated at cambridge where

puritans increased he insisted that every minister of the church should subscribe to three points the queens supremacy the common prayer and the thirtynine articles and enforced his principle with much vigour contrary to the advice of the more enlightened lord burleigh the severity of these measures called into existence the martin marprelate libels and produced much dissatisfaction and suffering among the more puritanical clergy which was by no means lessened by the accession of james who on his way to london rejected a petition signed by more than one thousand puritan ministers

bancroft was appointed to the primacy in contrast to his predecessor he connived at some irregularities of discipline in the puritanical clergy at the same time he was a zealous calvinist and hater of popery and disapproved of those who preached up the arbitrary power of the king these latter views rendered him unpopular with the courtiers and the party of laud the accidental death of a keeper at

kings right to tax his subjects without their consent he was obliged to retire to his palace of ford near canterbury he assisted at the coronation of charles i but never managed to win the favour of

general church persecution which produced his own unpopularity and downfall and was one of the main causes of the civil war prosecutions for nonconformity were enforced with the utmost severity the courts of star chamber and high commission were brought to bear on the puritans and laud became universally detested the superiority of the king over the law was openly preached and the irish and scotch puritans were alienated by the severity of the measures taken against them on the common idea of popular government the puritans were driven into coalition and identification with the national party while the king court bishops and judges represented the high church movement and the doctrine of the kings absolute authority in 1639 the palace at lambeth was attacked but the archbishop was removed to whitehall and escaped for the time in 1640 however he was impeached for high treason and confined in the tower various charges were brought against him and fines inflicted and his property
