attempts to prepare gaseous fluids industrially were premature as long as there were no means of carrying them under a sufficiently diminished volume for a few years past the trade has been delivering steel cylinders that permit of storing without the least danger a gas under a pressure of from 120 to 200 atmospheres the problem of delivery without pipe laying having been sufficiently solved that of the industrial production of gases could be confronted in its turn liquefied sulphurous acid chloride of methyl and carbonic acid have been successively delivered to commerce the carbonic acid is now being used right along in laboratories for the production of an intense coldness through its expansion oxygen and nitrogen prepared by chemical processes soon followed and now the industrial electrolysis of water is about to permit of the delivery in the same manner of very pure oxygen and hydrogen at a price within ones reach before describing the processes employed in this preparation we must answer a question that many of our readers might be led to ask us and that is what can these gases be used for we shall try to explain a prime and important application of pure hydrogen is that of inflating balloons illuminating gas which is usually employed for want of something better is sensibly denser than hydrogen and possesses less ascensional force whence the necessity of lightening the balloon or of increasing its volume such inconveniences become serious with dirigible balloons whose surface on the contrary it is necessary to diminish as much as possible when the increasing interest taken in aerostation at paris was observed an assured annual output of some hundreds of cubic meters of eras for the sole use of balloons was foreseen the adoption of pure hydrogen being only a question of the net cost pure or slightly carbureted hydrogen is capable of being substituted to advantage for coal gas for heating or lighting such an application is doubtless somewhat premature but we shall see that it has already got out of the domain of utopia finally the oxyhydrogen blowpipe which is indispensable for the treatment of very refractory metals consumes large quantities of hydrogen and oxygen for a few years past oxygen has been employed in therapeutics it is found in commerce either in a gaseous state or in solution in water in siphons it notably relieves persons afflicted with asthma or depression and the use of it is recommended in the treatment of albumenuria does it cure or at least does it contribute to cure anmia that terrible affection of large cities and the prime source of so many other troubles here the opinions of physicians and physiologists are divided and we limit ourselves to a mention of the question without discussing it only fifteen years ago it would have been folly to desire to obtain remunerative results through the electrolysis of water such research was subordinated to the industrial production of electric energy we shall not endeavor to establish the priority of the experiments and discoveries the question was in the air and was taken up almost simultaneously by three able experimentersa russian physicist prof latchinof of st petersburg dr darsonval the learned professor of the college of france and commandant renard director of the military establishment of aerostation at chalais mr darsonval collected oxygen for experiments in physiology while commandant renard naturally directed his attention to the production of pure hydrogen the solutions of the question are in fact alike in principle and yet they have been developed in a very different manner and we believe that commandant renards process is the completest from an industrial standpoint we shall give an account of it from a communication made by this eminent military engineer some time ago to the french society of physics transformations of the voltameterin a laboratory it is of no consequence whether a liter of hydrogen costs a centime or a franc so long as it is a question of a few liters one may at his ease waste his energy and employ costly substances the internal resistance of a voltameter and the cost of platinum electrodes of a few grammes should not arrest the physicist in an experiment but in a production on a large scale it is necessary to decrease the resistance of the liquid column to as great a degree as possiblethat is to say to increase its section and diminish its thickness the first condition leads to a suppression of the platinum and the second necessitates the use of new principles in the construction of the voltameter a laboratory voltameter consists either of a ushaped tube or of a trough in which the electrodes are covered by bell glasses fig 1 a and b in either case the electric current must follow a tortuous and narrow path in order to pass from one electrode to the other while if the electrodes be left entirely free in the bath the gases rising in a spreading form will mix at a certain height it is necessary to separate them by a partition fig 1 c if this is isolating and impermeable there will be no interest in raising the electrodes sensibly above its lower edge now the nearer together the electrodes are the more it is necessary to lower the partition the extension of the electrodes and the bringing of them together is the knotty part of the question this will be shown by a very simple calculation illustration fig 1a b commonest forms of laboratory voltameters c diagram showing ascent of bubbles in a voltameter the visible electrolysis of water begins at an emf of about 17 v below this there is no disengagement of bubbles if the emf be increased at the terminals of the voltameter the current and consequently the production of gas will become proportional to the excess of the value over 17 v but at the same time the current will heat the circuitthat is to say will produce a superfluous work and there will be waste at 17 v the rendering is at its maximum but the useful effect is nil in order to make an advantageous use of the instruments it is necessary to admit a certain loss of energy so much the less moreover in proportion as the voltameters cost less and as the saving is to be effected in the current rather than in the apparatus we may admit the use of three volts as a good proportionthat is to say a loss of about half the disposable energy under such conditions a voltameter having an internal resistance of 1 ohm produces 065 liter of hydrogen per hour while it will disengage 6500 liters if its resistance be but 00001 of an ohm it is true that in this case the current would be in the neighborhood of 15000 amperes laboratory voltameters frequently have a resistance of a hundred ohms it would require a million in derivation to produce the same effect the specific resistance of the solutions that can be employed in the production of gases by electrolysis is in round numbers twenty thousand times greater than that of mercury in order to obtain a resistance of 00001 of an ohm it is necessary to sensibly satisfy the equation 20000 ls 110000 l expressing the thickness of the voltameter expressed in meters and s being the section in square millimeters for example for l 110 s 20000000 say 20 square meters it will be seen from this example what should be the proportions of apparatus designed for a production on a large scale the new principles that permit of the construction of such voltameters are as follows 1 the substitution of an alkaline for the acid solution thus affording a possibility of employing iron electrodes 2 the introduction of a porous partition between the electrodes for the purpose of separating the gases electrolytic liquidcommandant renards experiments were made with 15 per cent solution of caustic soda and water containing 27 per cent of acid these are the proportions that give the maximum of conductivity experiments made with a voltameter having platinum electrodes separated by an interval of 3 or 4 centimeters showed that for a determinate emf the alkaline solution allows of the passage of a slighter intenser current than the acidulated water that is to say it is less resistant and more advantageous from the standpoint of the consumption of energy porous partitionlet us suppose that the two parts of the trough are separated by a partition containing small channels at right angles with its direction it is these channels alone that must conduct the electricity their conductivity inverse of resistance is proportional to their total section and inversely proportional to their common length whatever be their individual section it is therefore advantageous to employ partitions that contain as many openings as possible the separating effect of these partitions for the gas is wholly due to capillary phenomena we know in fact that water tends to expel gas from a narrow tube with a pressure inversely proportional to the tubes radius in order to traverse the tube the gaseous mass will have to exert a counterpressure greater than this capillary pressure as long as the pressure of one part and another of the wet wall differs to a degree less than the capillary pressure of the largest channel the gases disengaged in the two parts of the trough will remain entirely separate in order that the mixing may not take place through the partition above the level of the liquid dry partition the latter will have to be impenetrable in every part that emerges the study of the partitions should be directed to their separating effect on the gases and to their electric resistance in order to study the first of these properties the porous partition fixed by a hermetical joint to a glass tube is immersed in the water fig 2 an increasing pressure is exerted from the interior until the passage of bubbles is observed the pressure read at this moment on the manometer indicates transformed above the electrolytic solution the changes of level that the bath may undergo the different porcelains and earths behave from this point of view in a very unequal manner for example an earthen vessel from the pillivayt establishment supports some decimeters of water while the porcelain of boulanger at choisyleroi allows of the passage of the gas only at pressures greater than one atmosphere which is much more than is necessary wire gauze canvas and asbestos cloth resist a few centimeters of water it might be feared however that the gases violently projected against these partitions would not pass owing to the velocity acquired upon this point experiment is very reassuring after filling with water a canvas bag fixed to the extremity of a rubber tube it is possible to produce in the interior a tumultuous disengagement of gas without any bubbles passing through illustration fig 2arrangement for the study of capillary reaction in porous vessels from an electrical point of view partitions are of very unequal quality various partitions having been placed between electrodes spaced three centimeters apart currents were obtained which indicated that with the best of porcelains the rendering of the apparatus is diminished by onehalf asbestos cloth introduces but an insignificant resistance to this inconvenience of porous vessels is added their fragility their high price and the impossibility of obtaining them of the dimensions that large apparatus would call for the selection of asbestos cloth is therefore clearly indicated but as it does not entirely separate the gases except at a pressure that does not exceed a few centimeters of water it was always necessary to bring back the variation of the level to these narrow limits by a special arrangement we cannot in fact expect that the entire piping shall be always in such conditions that no difference in pressure can occur the levels are brought back to equality within the effective limits by interposing between the voltameter and the piping an apparatus called a compensator which consists of two vessels that communicate in the interior part through a large tube the gases enter each vessel through a pipe that debouches beneath the level of the water if a momentary stoppage occurs in one of the conduits the water changes level in the compensator but the pressure remains constant at the orifice of the tubes the compensator is as may be seen nothing more than a double mariotte flask when it is desired to obtain pure gases there is introduced into the compensator a solution of tartaric acid which retains the traces of alkalies carried along by the current of gas the alkaline solution moreover destroys the ozone at the moment of its formation it will be seen that laboratory studies have furnished all the elements of a problem which is now capable of entering the domain of practice the cheapness of the raw materials permits of constructing apparatus whose dimensions will no longer be limited except by reasons of another nature the electrodes may be placed in proximity at will owing to the use of the porous partition it may be seen then that the apparatus will have a considerable useful effect without its being necessary to waste the electric energy beyond measure industrial apparatuswe have shown how the very concise researches of commandant renard have fixed the best conditions for the construction of an industrial voltameter it remains for us to describe this voltameter itself and to show the rendering of it illustration fig 3plant for the industrial electrolysis of water the industrial voltameter consists of a large iron cylinder a battery of such voltameters is shown to the left of fig 3 and one of the apparatus isolated is represented in fig 4 the interior electrode is placed in an asbestos cloth bag which is closed below and tied at its upper part it is provided with apertures which permit of the ascent of the gases in the interior of the cylinder the apparatus is hermetically sealed at the top the two electrodes being naturally insulated with rubber above the level of the liquid the interior electrode is continuous and forms a channel for the gas the hydrogen and oxygen escaping through the upper orifices flow to the compensator the apparatus is provided with an emptying cock or a cock for filling with distilled water coming from a reservoir situated above the apparatus illustration fig 4details of an industrial voltameter the constants of the voltameter established by commandant renard are as follows height of external electrode 3405 m internal 3290 diameter of external 0300 internal 0174 the iron plate employed is 2 millimeters in thickness the electric resistance is about 00075 ohm the apparatus gives 365 amperes under 27 volts and consequently nearly 1 kilowatt its production in hydrogen is 158 liters per hour it is clear that in an industrial exploitation a dynamo working under 3 volts is never employed in order to properly utilize the power of the dynamo several voltameters will be put in seriesa dozen for example if the generating machine is in proximity to the apparatus or a larger number if the voltameters are actuated by a dynamo situated at a distance say in the vicinity of a waterfall fig 3 will give an idea of a plant for the electrolysis of water it remains for us to say a few words as to the net cost of the hydrogen and oxygen gases produced by the process that we have just described we may estimate the value of a voltameter at a hundred francs if the apparatus operates without appreciable wear the amortizement should be calculated at a very low figure say 10 per cent which is large in continuous operation it would produce more than 1500 cubic meters of gas a year say a little less than one centime per cubic meter the caustic soda is constantly recuperated and is never destroyed the sole product that disappears is the distilled water now one cubic meter of water produces more than 2000 cubic meters of gas the expense in water then does not amount to a centime per cubic meter the great factor of the expense resides in the electric energy the cost of surveillance will be minimum and the general expenses ad libitum let us take the case in which the energy has to be borrowed from a steam engine supposing very small losses in the dynamo and piping we may count upon a production of one cubic meter of hydrogen and 500 cubic decimeters of oxygen for 10 horsepower taken upon the main shaft say an expenditure of 10 kilogrammes of coal or of about 25 centimesa little more in paris and less in coal districts if consequently we fix the price of the cubic meter of gas at 50 centimes we shall preserve a sufficient margin in localities where a natural motive power is at our disposal this estimate will have to be greatly reduced we may therefore expect to see hydrogen and oxygen take an important place in ordinary usages from the standpoint alone of preservation of fuel that is to say of potential energy upon the earth this new conquest of electricity is very pleasing waterfalls furnish utilizable energy in every locality and in the future will perhaps console our greatgrandchildren for the unsparing waste that we are making of coalla nature continued from supplement no 818 page 13066 musical instruments their construction and capabilities by aj hipkins fsa lecture ii i will now invite your attention to the wind instruments which in handels time were chiefly used to double in unison the parts of stringed instruments their modern independent use dates from haydn it was extended and perfected by mozart beethoven and weber and the extraordinary changes and improvements which have been effected during the present century have given wind instruments an importance that is hardly exceeded by that of the stringed in the formation of the modern orchestra the military band as it now exists is a creation of the present century the socalled wood wind instruments are the flute oboe bassoon and clarinet it is as well to say at once that their particular qualities of tone do not absolutely depend upon the materials of which they are made the form is the most important factor in determining the distinction of tone quality so long as the sides of the tube are equally elastic as has been submitted to proof by instruments made of various materials including paper i consider this has been sufficiently demonstrated by the independent experiments of mr blaikley of london and mr victor mahillon of brussels but we must still allow mr richard shepherd rockstros plea clearly set forth in a recently published treatise on the flute that the nature and the substance of the tube by reciprocity of vibration exercise some influence although not so great as might have been expected on the quality of the tone but i consider this influence is already acknowledged in my reference to equality of elasticity in the sides of the tube the flute is an instrument of embouchurethat is to say one in which a stream of air is driven from the players lips against an edge of the blow hole to produce the sound the oboe and bassoon have double reeds and the clarinet a single reed made of a species of cane as intermediate agents of sound production there are other flutes than that of embouchurethose with flageolet or whistle heads which having become obsolete shall be reserved for later notice there are no real tenor or bass flutes now those in use being restricted to the upper part of the scale the present flute dates from 1832 when theobald boehm a bavarian flute player produced the instrument which is known by his name he entirely remodeled the flute being impelled to do so by suggestions from the performance of the english flautist charles nicholson who had increased the diameter of the lateral holes and by some improvements that had been attempted in the flute by a captain gordon of charles the tenths swiss guard boehm has been sufficiently vindicated from having unfairly appropriated gordons ideas the boehm flute since 1846 is a cylindrical tube for about threefourths of its length from the lower end after which it is continued in a curved conical prolongation to the cork stopper the finger holes are disposed in a geometrical division and the mechanism and position of the keys are entirely different from what had been before the full compass of the boehm flute is chromatic from middle c to c two octaves above the treble clef c a range of three octaves which is common to all concert flutes and is not peculiar to the boehm model of course this compass is partly produced by altering the pressure of blowing columns of air inclosed in pipes vibrate like strings in sections but unlike strings the vibrations progress in the direction of length not across the direction of length in the flute all notes below d in the treble clef are produced by the normal pressure of wind by an increasing pressure of overblowing the harmonics d in the treble clef and a and b above it are successively attained the fingerholes and keys by shortening the tube fill up the required intervals of the scale there are higher harmonics still but flautists generally prefer to do without them when they can get the note required by a lower harmonic in boehms flute his ingenious mechanism allows the production of the eleven chromatic semitones intermediate between the fundamental note of the flute and its first harmonic by holes so disposed that in opening them successively they shorten the column of air in exact proportion it is therefore ideally an equal temperament instrument and not a d major one as the conical flute was considered to be perhaps the most important thing boehm did for the flute was to enunciate the principle that to insure purity of tone and correct intonation the holes must be put in their correct theoretical positions and at least the hole below the one giving he sound must be open to insure perfect venting boehms flute however has not remained as he left it improvements applied by clinton pratten and carte have introduced certain modifications in the fingering while retaining the best features of boehms system but it seems to me that the reedy quality obtained from the adoption of the cylindrical bore which now prevails does away with the sweet and characteristic tone quality of the old conical german flute and gives us in its place one that is not sufficiently distinct from that of the clarinet the flute is the most facile of all orchestral wind instruments and the device of double tonguing the quick repetition of notes by taking a staccato tstop in blowing is well known the flute generally goes with the violins in the orchestra or sustains long notes with the other wood wind instruments or is used in those conversational passages with other instruments that lend such a charm to orchestral music the lower notes are not powerful mr henry carte has however designed an alto flute in a descending to violin g with excellent results there is a flute which transposes a minor third higher than the ordinary flute but it is not much used in the orchestra although used in the army as is also a flute one semitone higher than the concert flute the piccolo or octave flute is more employed in the orchestra and may double the melody in the highest octave or accentuate brilliant points of effect in the score it is very shrill and exciting in the overblown notes and without great care may give a vulgar character to the music and for this reason sir arthur sullivan has replaced it in the score of ivanhoe by a high g flute the piccolo is exactly an octave higher than the flute excepting the two lowest notes of which it is deficient the old cylindrical earpiercing fife is an obsolete instrument being superseded by a small army flute still however called a fife used with the side drum in the drum and fife band the transverse or german flute introduced into the orchestra by lulli came into general use in the time of handel before that the recorders or flute douces the flute bec with beak or whistle head were preferred these instruments were used in a family usually of eight members viz as many sizes from treble to bass or in three treble alto or tenor and bass a fine original set of those now rare instruments eight in number was shown in 1890 in the music gallery of the royal military exhibition at chelsea a loan collection admirably arranged by captain cb day they were obtained from hesse darmstadt and had their outer case to preserve them exactly like the recorder case represented in the painting by holbein of the ambassadors or rather the scholars recently acquired for the national gallery the flageolet was the latest form of the treble beak or whistle head flute the whistle head is furnished with a cavity containing air which shaped by a narrow groove strikes against the sharp edge and excites vibration in the conical pipe on the same principle that an organ pipe is made to sound or of the action of the players mouth and lips upon the blowhole of the flute as it will interest the audience to hear the tone of shakespeares recorder mr henry carte will play an air upon one the oboe takes the next place in the wood wind band the principle of sound excitement that of the double reed originating in the flattening of the end of an oat or wheat straw is of great antiquity but it could only be applied by insertion in tubes of very narrow diameter so that the column of air should not be wider than the tongue straw or reed acting upon it the little reed bound round and contracted below the vibrating ends in this primitive form permitted the adjustment of the lower open end in the tube it might be another longer reed or pipe which inclosed the air column and thus a conical pipe that gradually narrows to the diameter of the tongue reed must have been early discovered and was the original type of the pastoral and beautiful oboe of the modern orchestra like the flute the oboe has only the soprano register extending from b flat or natural below middle c to f above the treble clef two octaves and a fifth which a little exceeds the flute downward the foundation of the scale is d major the same as the flute was before boehm altered it triebert a skillful parisian maker tried to adapt boehms reform of the flute to the oboe but so far as the geometrical division of the scale was concerned he failed because it altered the characteristic tone quality of the instrument so desirable for the balance of orchestral coloration but the fingering has been modified with considerable success although it is true by a much greater complication of means than the more simple contrivances that preceded it which are still preferred by the players the oboe reed has been much altered since the earlier years of this century it was formerly more like the reed of the shawm an instrument from which the oboe has been derived and that of the present bassoon it is now made narrower with much advantage in the refinement of the tone as in the flute the notes up to c sharp in the treble clef are produced by the normal blowing and simply shortening the tube by opening the sound holes beyond that note increased pressure or overblowing assisted by a harmonic speaker key produces the first harmonic that of the octave and so on the lowest notes are rough and the highest shrill from a to d above the treble clef the tone quality of the oboe is of a tender charm in melody although not loud its tone is penetrating and prominent its staccato has an agreeable effect the place of the oboe in the wood wind band between the flute and the clarinet with the bassoon for a bass is beyond the possibility of improvement by any change like the flute there was a complete family of oboes in the sixteenth and early in the seventeenth century the little schalmey the discant schalmey from which the present oboe is derived the alto tenor pommer and bass pommers and the double quint or contrabass pommer in all these old finger hole instruments the scale begins with the first hole a note in the bagpipe with which the drones agree and not the entire tube from the bass and double quint pommers came ultimately the bassoon and contrabassoon and from the alto pommer an obsolete instrument for which bach wrote called the oboe di caccia or hunting oboe an appellation unexplained unless it had originally a hornlike tone and was as it has been suggested to me by mr blaikley used by those who could not make a real hunting horn sound it was bent to a knee shape to facilitate performance it was not exactly the cor anglais or english horn a modern instrument of the same pitch which is bent like it and of similar compass a fifth below the usual oboe the tenoroon with which the oboe di caccia has been compared was a high bassoon really on octave and a fifth below it has been sometimes overlooked that there are two octaves in pitch between the oboe and bassoon which has led to some confusion in recognizing these instruments there was an intermediate instrument a third lower than the oboe used by bach called the oboe damore which was probably used with the cornemuse or bagpipe and another a third higher than the oboe called musette not the small bagpipe of that name the cor anglais is in present use it is a melancholy even mournful instrument its sole use in the orchestra being very suitable for situations on the stage the effect of which it helps by depressing the mind to sadness those who have heard wagners tristan und isolde will remember when the faithful kurwenal sweeps the horizon and sees no help coming on the sea for the dying tristan how pathetically the reed pipe of a careless peasant near played in the orchestra on a cor anglais colors the painful situation the bassoon is the legitimate bass to the oboe and to the wood wind in general it was evolved in the sixteenth century from the pommers and bombards the tenors and basses of the shawm or oboe family with the older instruments the reeds were not taken hold of immediately by the lips but were held in a kind of cup called pirouette which only allowed a very small part of the reed to project in the oboe and bassoon the player has the full control of the reed with the lips which is of great importance both in expression and intonation the bassoon economizes length by being turned back upon itself and from its appearance obtains in italy and germany the satirical appellation of fagotto or fagott it is made of wood and has not owing to many difficulties as yet unsurmounted undergone those changes of construction that have partly transformed other wood wind instruments from this reasonand perhaps the necessity of a bassoon player becoming intimately familiar with his instrumentbassoons by some of the older makersnotably savoryare still sought after in preference to more modern ones the instrument although with extraordinary advantages in tone character and adaptability that render it valuable to the composer is yet complicated and capricious for the performer but its very imperfections remove it from the mechanical tendencies of the age often damaging to art and as the player has to rely very much upon his ear for correct intonation he gets in reality near to the manipulation of the stringed instruments the bassoons play readily with the violoncellos their united tone being often advantageous for effect when not so used it falls back into its natural relationship with the wood wind division of the orchestra the compass of the bassoon is from b flat an octave below that in the bass clef to b flat in the treble clef a range of three octaves produced by normal pressure as far as the bass clef f the f below the bass clef is the true lowest note the other seven semitones descending to the b flat being obtained by holes and keys in the long joint and bell these extra notes are not overblown the fundamental notes are extended as in the oboes and flutes by overflowing to another octave and afterward to the twelfth in modern instruments yet higher notes by the contrivance of small harmonic holes and cross fingerings can be secured long notes scales arpeggios are all practicable on this serviceable instrument and in full harmony with clarinets or oboes and horns it forms part of a rich and beautiful combination there is a very telling quality in the upper notes of the bassoon of which composers have made use structurally a bassoon consists of several pieces the wing butt long joints and bell and when fitted together they form a hollow cone of about eight feet long the air column tapering in diameter from threesixteenths of an inch at the reed to one and threequarter inches at the bell end the bending back at the butt joint is pierced in one piece of wood and the prolongation of the double tube is usually stopped by a flattened oval cork but in some modern bassoons this is replaced by a properly curved tube the height is thus reduced to a little over four feet and the holes assisted by the artifice of piercing them obliquely are brought within reach of the fingers the crook in the end of which the reed is inserted is about twelve inches long and is adjusted to the shorter branch the contrabassoon is an octave lower than the bassoon which implies that it should go down to the double b flat two octaves below that in the bass clef but it is customary to do without the lowest as well as the highest notes of this instrument it is rarely used but should not be dispensed with messrs mahillon of brussels produce a reed contrabass of metal intended to replace the contrabassoon of wood but probably more with the view of completing the military band than for orchestral use it is a conical brass tube of large proportions with seventeen lateral holes of wide diameter and in geometrical relation so that for each sound one key only is required the compass of this contrabass lies between d in the double bass octave and the lower f of the treble clef the sarrusophones of french invention are a complete family made in brass and with conical tubes pierced according to geometric relation so that the sarrusophone is more equal than the oboe it copies and is intended at least for military music to replace being on a larger scale the sarrusophones are louder than the corresponding instruments of the oboe family there are six sarrusophones from the sopranino in e flat to the contrabass in b flat and to replace the contrabassoon in the orchestra there is a lower contrabass sarrusophone made in c the compass of which is from the double bass octave b flat to the higher g in the bass clef before leaving the double reed wind instruments a few words should be said of a family of instruments in the sixteenth century as important as the schalmeys pommers and bombards but long since extinct this was the cromorne a wooden instrument with cylindrical column of air the name is considered to remain in the cremona stop of the organ the lower end is turned up like a shepherds crook reversed from whence the french name tournebout cromorne is the german krummhorn there is no english equivalent known the tone as in all the reed instruments of the period was strong and often bleating the double reed was inclosed in a pirouette or cup and the keys of the tenor or bass just the same as with similar flutes and bombards were hidden by a barrelshaped cover pierced with small openings apparently intended to modify the too searching tone as well as to protect the touch pieces which moved the keys the compass was limited to fundamental notes and from the cylindrical tube and reed was an octave lower in pitch than the length would show in all these instruments provision was made in the holes and keys for transposition of the hands according to the players habit of placing the right or left hand above the other the unused hole was stopped with wax there is a fine and complete set of four cromornes in the museum of the conservatoire at brussels we must also place among doublereed instruments the various bagpipes cornemuses and musettes which are shawm or oboe instruments with reservoirs of air and furnished with drones inclosing single reeds i shall have more to say about the drone in the third lecture in restricting our attention to the highland bagpipe with which we are more or less familiar it is surprising to find the peculiar scale of the chaunter or finger pipe in an old arabic scale still prevailing in syria and egypt dr aj ellis lecture on the musical scales of various nations read before the society of arts and printed in the journal of the society march 27 1885 no 1688 vol xxxiii and in an appendix october 30 1885 in the same volume should be consulted by any one who wishes to know more about this curious similarity we have now arrived at the clarinet although embodying a very ancient principlethe squeaker reed which our little children still make and continued in the egyptian arghoolthe clarinet is the most recent member of the wood wind band the reed initiating the tone by the players breath is a broad single striking or beating reed so called because the vibrating tongue touches the edges of the body of the cutting or framing a cylindrical pipe as that of the clarinet drops approximately an octave in pitch when the column of air it contains is set up in vibration by such a reed because the reed virtually closes the pipe at the end where it is inserted and like a stopped organ pipe sets up a node of maximum condensation or rarefaction at that end this peculiarity interferes with the resonance of the evennumbered partials of the harmonic scale and permits only the oddnumbered partials 1 3 5 and so on to sound the first harmonic as we find in the clarinet is therefore the third partial or twelfth of the fundamental note and not the octave as in the oboe and flute in the oboe the shifting of the nodes in a conical tube open at its base and narrowing to its apex permits the resonance of the complete series of the harmonic scale 1 2 3 4 5 and upward the flute has likewise the complete series because through the blowhole it is a pipe open at both ends but while stating the law which governs the pitch and harmonic scale of the clarinet affirmed equally by observation and demonstration we are left at present with only the former when regarding two very slender almost cylindrical reed pipes discovered in 1889 by mr flinders petrie while excavating at fayoum the tomb of an egyptian lady named maket mr petrie dates these pipes about 1100 bc and they were the principal subject of mr southgates recent lectures upon the egyptian scale now mr j finn who made these ancient pipes sound at these lectures with an arghool reed of straw was able upon the pipe which had by finger holes a tetrachord to repeat that tetrachord a fifth higher by increased pressure of blowing and thus form an octave scale comprising eight notes against the laws of nature says a friend of mine for the pipe having dropped more than an octave through the reed was at its fundamental pitch and should have overblown a twelfth but mr finn allows me to say with reference to those reeds perhaps the oldest sounding musical instruments known to exist that his experiments with straw reeds seem to indicate low medium and high octave registers the first and last difficult to obtain with reeds as made by us he seeks the fundamental tones of the maket pipes in the first or low register an octave below the normal pitch by this the fifths revert to twelfths i offer no opinion but will leave this curious phenomenon to the consideration of my friends mr blaikley mr victor mahillon and mr hermann smith acousticians intimate with wind instruments the clarinet was invented about ad 1700 by christopher denner of nuremberg by his invention an older and smaller instrument the chalumeau of eleven notes without producible harmonics was by an artifice of raising a key to give access to the air column at a certain point endowed with a harmonic series of eleven notes a twelfth higher the chalumeau being a cylindrical pipe the upper partials could only be in an odd series and when denner made them speak they were consequently not an octave but a twelfth above the fundamental notes thus an instrument which ranged with the help of eight finger holes and two keys from f in the bass clef to b flat in the treble had an addition given to it at once of a second register from c in the treble clef to e flat above it the scale of the original instrument is still called chalumeau by the clarinet player about the middle of the last century it was extended down to e the second register of notes which by this lengthening of pipe started from b natural received the name of clarinet or clarionet from the clarino or clarion the high solo trumpet of the time it was expected that this bright harmonic series would replace this name of clarinet or clarionet became accepted for the entire instrument including the chalumeau register it is the communication between the external air and the upper part of the air column in the instrument which initiating a ventral segment or loop of vibration forces the air column to divide for the next possible partial the twelfth that denner has the merit of having made practicable at the same time the manipulation of it presents a difficulty in learning the instrument it is in the nature of things that there should be a difference of tone quality between the lower and upper registers thus obtained and that the highest fundamental notes g sharp a and b flat should be colorless compared with the first notes of the overblown series this is a difficulty the player has to contend with as well as the complexity of fingering due to there being no less than eighteen sound holes much has been done to graft boehms system of fingering upon the clarinet but the thirteen key system invented early in this century by iwan muller is still most employed the increased complication of mechanism is against a change and there is even a stronger reason which i cannot do better than translate in the appropriate words of m lavoix fils the author of a wellknown and admirable work upon instrumentation many things have still to be done but inventors must not lose the point in view that no tone quality is more necessary to the composer than that of the clarinet in its full extent that it is very necessary especially to avoid melting together the two registers of chalumeau and clarinet so distinct from each other if absolute justness for these instruments is to be acquired at the price of those inestimable qualities it would be better a hundred times to leave it to virtuosi thanks to their ability to palliate the defects of their instrument rather than sacrifice one of the most beautiful and intensely colored voices of our orchestra there are several clarinets of various pitches and formerly more than are used now owing to the difficulty of playing except in handy keys in the modern orchestra the a and b flat clarinets are the most used in the military band b flat and e flat the c clarinet is not much used now all differ in tone and quality the a one is softer than the b flat the c is shrill the b flat is the virtuoso instrument in military bands the clarinet takes the place which would be that of the violin in the orchestra but the tone of it is always characteristically different although introduced in the time of handel and bach those composers made no use of it with mozart it first became a leading orchestral instrument the basset horn which has become the sensuously beautiful alto clarinet in e flat is related to the clarinet in the same way that the cor anglais is to the oboe basset is equivalent to baryton there is a basset flute figured in prtorius and this instrument appears to have been invented by one horn living at passau in bavaria about 1770 his name given to the instrument has been mistranslated into italian as corno di bassetto there is a bass clarinet employed with effect by meyerbeer in the huguenots but the characteristic clarinet tone is less noticeable it is however largely used in military bands the basset horn had the deep compass of the bass clarinet which separates it from the present alto clarinet although it was more like the alto in caliber the alto clarinet is also used in military bands and probably what the basset horn would have been written for is divided between the present bass and alto clarinets preceding the invention of the sarrusophone by which a perfected oboe was contrived in a brass instrument a modified brass instrument the saxophone bearing a similar relation to the clarinet was invented in 1846 by sax whose name will occur again and again in connection with important inventions in military band instruments the saxophone is played like the clarinet with the intervention of a beating reed but is not cylindrical it has a conical tube like the oboe the different shape of the column of air changes the first available harmonic obtained by overblowing to the octave instead of the twelfth and also in consequence of the greater strength of the even harmonics distinctly changing the tone quality the sarrusophone may fairly be regarded as an oboe or bassoon but the saxophone is not so closely related to the clarinet there are four sizes of saxophone now made between high soprano and bass starting from the fourth fundamental note each key can be employed in the next higher octave by the help of other two keys which being opened successively set up a vibrating loop the saxophones although difficult to play fill an important place in the military music of france and belgium and have been employed with advantage in the french orchestra the fingering of all saxophones is that attributed to boehm the cup shaped mouthpiece must now take the place of the reed in our attention here the lips fit against a hollow cup shaped reservoir and acting as vibrating membranes may be compared with the vocal chords of the larynx they have been described as acting as true reeds each instrument in which such a mouthpiece is employed requires a slightly different form of it the french horn is the most important brass instrument in modern music it consists of a body of conical shape about seven feet long without the crooks ending in a large bell which spreads out to a diameter of fifteen inches the crooks are fitted between the body and the mouthpiece they are a series of smaller interchangeable tubings which extend in length as they descend in pitch and set the instrument in different keys the mouthpiece is a funnel shaped tube of metal by preference silver and in the horn is exceptionally not cup shaped but the reverse it tapers as a cone from threequarters of an inch diameter to about a minimum of threesixteenths of an inch and is a quarter of an inch where the smaller end of the mouthpiece is inserted in the upper opening of the crook the first horn has a mouthpiece of rather less diameter than the second the peculiar mouthpiece and narrow tubing have very much to do with the soft voicelike tone quality of the horn for convenience of holding the tubing is bent in a spiral form there is a tuning slide attached to the body and of late years valves have been added to the horn similar to those applied to the cornet and other wind instruments they have to a considerable extent superseded hand stopping by which expedient the intonation could be altered a semitone or whole tone by depression of the natural notes of the instrument in brass or other instruments the natural harmonics depend on the pressure of blowing and the brass differs entirely from the wood wind in this respect that it is rare or with poor effect the lowest or fundamental note can be made to sound stopping the horn is done by extending the open hand some way up the bore there is half stopping and whole stopping according to the interval the half tone or whole tone required as may be imagined the stopped notes are weak and dull compared with the open on the other hand the tubing introduced for valves not being quite conformable in curve with the instrument and hampered with indispensable joins unless in the best form of modern valve affects the smoothness of tone no doubt there has been of late years a great improvement in the manufacture of valves many horns are still made with crooks covering an octave from b flat to b flat 8 feet 6 inches to 17 feet but most players now use only the f crook and trust to the valves rather than to change the crooks so that we lose the fullness of sound of those below f the natural horn was originally in d but was not always restricted to that key there have been horns for f g high a and b flat this may however be said for the valve horn that it does not limit or restrict composers in writing for the open or natural notes which are always more beautiful in effect valves were invented and first introduced in prussia about ad 1815 at first there were two but there are now generally three in this country and france they are worked by pistons which when pressed down give access for the air into channels or supplementary tubings on one side of the main bore thus lengthening it by a tone for the first valve a semitone for the second and a tone and a semitone for the third when released by the finger the piston returns by the action of a spring in large bass and contralto instruments a fourth piston is added which lowers the pitch two tones and a semitone by combining the use of three valves lower notes are obtainedthus for a major third the second is depressed with the third for a fourth the first and third and for the tritone the first second and third but the intonation becomes imperfect when valves are used together because the lengths of additional tubing being calculated for the single depressions when added to each other they are too short for the deeper notes required by an ingenious invention of compensating pistons mr blaikley of messrs booseys has practically rectified this error without extra moving parts or altered fingering in the valve section each altered note becomes a fundamental for another harmonic scale in germany a rotary valve a kind of stop cock is preferred to the piston it is said to give greater freedom of execution the closeness of the shake being its best point but is more expensive and liable to derangement the invention of m adolphe sax of a single ascending piston in place of a group of descending ones by which the tube is shortened instead of lengthened met for a time with influential support it is suitable for both conical and cylindrical instruments and has six valves which are always used independently however practical difficulties have interfered with its success with any valve system however a difficulty with the french horn is its great variation in length by crooks inimical to the principle of the valve system which relies upon an adjustment by aliquot parts it will however be seen that the invention of valves has by transforming and extending wind instruments so as to become chromatic given many advantages to the composer yet it must at the same time be conceded in spite of the increasing favor shown for valve instruments that the tone must issue more freely and with more purity and beauty from a simple tube than from tubes with joinings and other complications that interfere with the regularity and smoothness of vibration and by mechanical facilities tend to promote a dull uniformity of tone quality owing to the changes of pitch by crooks it is not easy to define the compass of the french horn between c in the bass clef and g above the treble will represent its serviceable notes it is better that the first horn should not descend below middle c or the second rise above the higher e of the treble clef four are generally used in modern scores the place of the horn is with the wood wind band from handel every composer has written for it and what is known as the small orchestra of string and wood wind bands combined is completed by this beautiful instrument the most prominent instruments that add to the splendor of the full orchestra are trumpets and trombones they are really members of one family as the name trombonebig trumpetimplies and blend well together the trumpet is an instrument of court and state functions and as the soprano instrument comes first it is what is known as an eight foot instrument in pitch and gives the different harmonics from the third to the twelfth and even to the sixteenth it is made of brass mixed metal or silver and is about five feet seven inches in real length when intended for the key of f without a slide but is twice turned back upon itself the first and third lengths lying contiguous and the second about two inches from them the diameter is threeeighths of an inch along the cylindrical length it then widens out for about fifteen inches to form the bell when fitted with a slide for transpositionan invention for the trumpet in the last centurythis double tubing about five inches in length on each side is connected with the second length it is worked from the center with the second and third fingers of the right band and when pulled back returns to its original position by a spring there are five crooks the mouthpiece is hemispherical and convex and the exact shape of it is of great importance it has a rim with slightly rounded surface the diameter of the mouthpiece varies according to the player and the pitch required with the first crook or rather shank and mouthpiece the length of the trumpet is increased to six feet and the instrument is then in the key of f the second shank transposes it to e the third to e flat and the fourth to d the fifth and largesttwo feet one and a half inches longextends the instrument to eight feet and lowers the key to c the slide is used for transposition by a semitone or a whole tone thus making new fundamentals and correcting certain notes of the natural harmonic scale as the seventh eleventh and thirteenth which do not agree with our musical scale mr w wyatt has recently taken out a patent for a doubleslide trumpet which possesses a complete chromatic scale in the required length of slide the ear has always to assist it is clear that the very short shifts of a double slide demand great nicety of manipulation it is of course different with the valve trumpet the natural trumpets are not limited to one or two keys but those in f e e flat d b flat and even a have been employed but usually the valve trumpets are in f and the higher b flat with a growing inclination but an unfortunate one to be restricted to the latter it being easier for cornet players the tone of the high b flat trumpet cannot however compare with the f one and with it the lowest notes are lost of course when there are two or three trumpets the high b flat one finds a place however the valve system applied to the trumpet is not regarded with satisfaction as it makes the tone dull for grand heroic effect valve trumpets cannot replace the natural trumpets with slides which are now only to be heard in this country the simple or field trumpet appears to exist now in one representative only the e flat cavalry trumpet bach wrote for trumpets up to the twentieth harmonicbut for this the trumpet had to be divided into a principal which ended at the tenth harmonicand the clarino in two divisions the first of which went from the eighth harmonic up to as high as the player could reach and the second clarino from the sixth to the twelfth the use of the clarinet by composers about the middle of the last century seems to have abolished these very high trumpets so completely had they gone by the time of mozart that he had to change handels trumpet parts to accommodate them to performers of his own time and transfer the high notes to the oboes and clarinets having alluded to the cornet piston it may be introduced here particularly as from being between a trumpet and a bugle and of four foot tone it is often made to do duty for the more noble trumpet but the distinctive feature of this as of nearly all brass instruments since the invention of valves tends to a compromise instrument which owes its origin to the bugle the cornet piston is now not very different from the valve bugle in b flat on the one hand and from the small valve trumpet in the same key on the other it is a hybrid between this high pitch trumpet and the bugle but compared with the latter it has a much smaller bell by the use of valves and pistons with which it was the first to be endowed the cornet can easily execute passages of consecutive notes that in the natural trumpet can only be got an octave higher it is a facile instrument and double tonguing which is also possible with the horn and trumpet is one of its popular means for display it has a harmonic compass from middle c to c above the treble clef and can go higher but with difficulty a few lower notes however are easily taken with the valves we now come to the trombones grand sonorous tubes which existing in three or four sizes since the sixteenth century are among the most potent additions on occasion to the full orchestra their treble can be regarded as the english slide trumpet but it is not exactly so there appears to have been as late as bach a soprano trombone and it is figured by virdung ad 1511 as no larger than the field trumpet the trumpet is not on so large a caliber and in the seventeenth century had its own family of two clarinos and three tubas the old english name of the trombone is sackbut the old wooden cornet or german zinke an obsolete cupped mouthpiece instrument the real bass of which according to family is the now obsolete serpent was used in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries as the treble instrument in combination with alto tenor and bass trombones the leading features of the trumpet are also found as already inferred in the trombone there is the cupped mouthpiece the cylindrical tubing and finally a gradual increase in diameter to the bell the slide used for the trumpet appears for four centuries and probably longer in the well known construction of the trombone in this instrument it consists of two cylindrical tubes parallel with each other upon which two other tubes communicating by a pipe at their lower ends curved in a half circle glide without loss of air the mouthpiece is fitted to an upper end and a bell to a lower end of the slide when the slide is closed the instrument is at its highest pitch and as the column of air is lengthened by drawing the slide out the pitch is lowered by this contrivance a complete chromatic scale can be obtained and as the determination of the notes it produces is by ear we have in it the only wind instrument that can compare in accuracy with stringed instruments the player holds a cross bar between the two lengths of the instrument which enables him to lengthen or shorten the slide at pleasure and in the bass trombone as the stretch would be too great for the length of a mans arm a jointed handle is attached to the cross bar the player has seven positions each a semitone apart for elongation and each note has its own system of harmonics but in practice he only occasionally goes beyond the fifth the present trombones are the alto in e flat descending to a in the seventh position the tenor in b flat descending to e the bass in f descending to b and a higher bass in g descending to c sharp wagner who has made several important innovations in writing for bass brass instruments requires an octave bass trombone in b flat an octave lower than the tenor one in the nibelungen the fundamental tones of the trombone are called pedal notes they are difficult to get and less valuable than harmonics because in all wind instruments notes produced by overblowing are richer than the fundamental notes in tone quality valve trombones do not however find favor the defects of intonation being more prominent than in shorter instruments but playing with wide bore tubas and their kindred is not advantageous to this noble instrument the serpent has been already mentioned as the bass of the obsolete zinken or wooden cornets straight or curved with cupped mouthpiece it gained its serpentine form from the facility given thereby to the player to cover the six holes with his fingers in course of time keys were added to it and when changed into a bassoon shape its name changed to the russian bass horn or basson russe a parisian instrument maker halary in 1817 made this a complete instrument after the manner of the keyed bugle of halliday and producing it in brass called it the ophicleide from two greek words meaning serpent and keyskeyed serpentalthough it was more like a keyed bass bugle the wooden serpent has gone out of use in military bands within recollection the ophicleide from orchestras only recently it has been superseded by the development of the valved tubas the euphonium and bombardon the basses of the important family of saxhorns now completely cover the ground of bass wind instrument music the keyed bugle invented by joseph halliday bandmaster of the cavan militia in 1810 may be regarded as the prototype of all these instruments excepting that the keys have been entirely replaced by the valve system an almost contemporary invention by stlzel and blumel in prussia in 1815 the valve instruments began to prevail as early as 1850 the sound tube of all bugles saxhorns and tubas is conical with a much wider curve than the horn the quality of tone produced is a general kind of tone not possessing the individuality of any of the older instruments all these valve instruments may be comprehended under the french name of saxhorn there is a division between them of the higher instruments or bugles which do not sound the fundamental note and of the lower or tubas which sound it readily properly military band instruments the second or bass division has been taken over to the orchestra and wagner has made great use of it in his great scores the soprano cornets bugles or flugelhorns and saxhorns are in e flat the corresponding alto instruments in b flat which is also the pitch of the ordinary cornet the tenor baryton and bass instruments follow in similar relation the bass horns are as i have said called tubas and that with four valves the euphonium the bombardon or e flat tuba has much richer lower notes for military purposes this and the contrabassthe heliconare circular finally the contrabass tubas in b flat and in c for wagner have immense depth and potentiality of tone all these instruments are capable of pianissimo there are many varieties now of these brass instruments nearer particulars of which may be found in gevaert and other eminent musicians works on instrumentation one fact i will not pass by which is that from the use of brass instruments which rise in pitch so rapidly under increase of temperature as mr blaikley has shown almost to the coefficient of the sharpening under heat in organ pipes has come about that rise in pitch which from 1816 to 1846until repressed by the authority of the late sir michael costa and more recently by the action of the royal military college at kneller hallis an extraordinary feature in musical history all previous variations in pitchand they have comprised as much as a fourth in the extremeshaving been due either to transposition owing to the requirements of the human voice or to national or provincial measurements the manufacture of brass instruments is a distinct craft although some of the processes are similar to those used by silversmiths coppersmiths and braziers i have only time to add a few words about the percussion instruments which the military band permits to connect with the wind drums are with the exception of kettle drums indeterminate instruments hardly in themselves to be regarded as musical and yet important factors of musical and especially rhythmic effect the kettle drum is a caldron usually of brass or copper covered with a vellum head bound at the edge round an iron ring which fits the circle formed by the upper part of the metal body screws working on this ring tune the vellum head or vibrating membrane as we may call it by tightening or slackening it so as to obtain any note of the scale within its compass the tonic and dominant are generally required but other notes are in some compositions used even octaves have been employed the use beethoven made of kettle drums may be regarded among the particular manifestations of his genius two kettle drums may be considered among the regular constituents of the orchestra but this number has been extended in one remarkable instance that of berlioz in his requiem to eight pairs according to mr victor de pontigny whose article i am much indebted to in sir george groves dictionary upon the drum the relative diameters theoretically for a pair of kettle drums are in the proportion of 30 to 26 bass and tenor practically the diameter of the drums at the french opera is 29 and 25 inches and of the crystal palace band 28 and 24 inches in cavalry regiments the drums are slung so as to hang on each side of the drummers horses neck the best drum sticks are of whalebone each terminating in a small wooden button covered with sponge for the bass drum and side drum i must be content to refer to mr victor de pontignys article and also for the tambourine but the provencal tambourines i have met with have long narrow sound bodies and are strung with a few very coarse strings which the player sounds with a hammer this instrument is the rhythmic bass and support to the simple galoubet a cylindrical pipe with two holes in front and one behind sounded by the same performer the english pipe and tabor is a similar combination also with one player of such a pipe and a small drumhead tambourine lastly to conclude percussion instruments cymbals are round metal plates consisting of an alloy of copper and tinsay 80 parts to 20with sunk hollow centers from which the greek name they are not exactly clashed together to elicit their sound but rubbed across each other in a sliding fashion like the triangle a steel rod bent into the form indicated by the name but open at one corner so as to make it an elastic rod free at both ends the object is to add to the orchestral matter luminous crashes as it were and dazzling points of light when extreme brilliancy is required in conclusion i must be allowed to express my obligations to dr wh stone and mr victor mahillon to mr ebenezer prout mr richard shepherd rockstro mr lavoix fils and dr h riemann whose writings concerning wind instruments have materially helped me to messrs boosey co and to messrs rudall carte co for the loan of the instruments used in the illustrations and also to mr dj blaikley and mr henry carte for valuable personal aid on the present occasion their kindness in reading through my manuscriptmr blaikley throughoutand in offering friendly and generous criticisms also their presence and assistance by trial of the various

contrabass tuba and b flat contrabass double slide trombone how gas cylinders are made the supply of compressed gas in metal cylinders has now assumed the proportions of an important industry more especially since it was found possible by the brin process to obtain oxygen direct from the atmosphere the industry is not exactly a new one for carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide the latter for the use of dentists have been supplied in a compressed state for many years now with the creation of the modern amateur photographer who can make lantern slides and the more general adoption of the optical lantern for the purposes of demonstration and amusement there has arisen a demand for the limelight such as was never experienced before and as the limelight is dependent upon the two gases hydrogen and oxygen for its support these gases are now supplied in large quantities commercially at first the gas cylinders were made of wrought iron they were cumbrous and heavy and the pressure of the inclosed gas was so low that a receptacle to hold only ten feet was a most unwieldy concern but times have changed and a cylinder of about the same size but half the weight is now made to hold four times the quantity of gas at the enormous initial pressure of 1800 pounds on every square inch this means the pressure which an ordinary locomotive boiler has to withstand multiplied by twelve the change is due to improved methods of manufacture and to the employment of mild steel of special quality in lieu of the wrought iron previously employed the cylinders are now made without joint or seam and the process of manufacture is most interesting a short time ago we had an opportunity of watching the various necessary operations involved in making these cylinders at the birmingham works of messrs taunton delamard co by whose courtesy we were enabled to make notes of the process illustration fig 1 illustration fig 2 beginning with the raw material we were shown a disk of metal like that shown in fig 1 and measuring thirty inches in diameter and threequarters of an inch in thickness from such a blank a cylinder destined to hold 100 feet of compressed gas can be constructed and the first operation is to heat the blank in a furnace and afterward to stamp it into the cuplike form shown in fig 2 to all intents and purposes this represents the end of a finished cylinder but it is far too bulky to form the end of one of the size indicated indeed it in reality contains enough metal to make the entire vessel by a series of operations it is now heated and drawn out longer and longer while its thickness diminishes and its diameter grows less these operations are carried out by means of a number of hydraulic rams which regularly decrease in size fig 3 roughly represents one of these rams with the plunger ready to descend and force its way into the partially formed red hot gas cylinder c and further into the well w the plunger may be compared to a finger and the cylinder to a glove while the well may represent a hole into which both are thrust in order to reduce the thickness of the glove with huge tongs the cylinder fresh from the furnace is placed in position but just before the plunger presses into the red hot cup one of the workmen empties into the latter a little water so as to partially cool the bottom and prevent its being thrust out by the powerful plunger oil is also used plentifully so that as the plunger works slowly down the red hot mass it is surrounded by smoky flames it presently forces the cylinder into the well and when the end of the stroke is reached a stop piece is inserted through an opening in the upper part of the well so as to arrest the edge of the cylinder while the reverse action of drawing out the plunger is proceeded with directly the finger is drawn out of the glovein other words immediately the plunger is raised out of the cylinderthe latter drops down below with a heavy thud still in a red hot condition illustration fig 3 this operation of hot drawing is repeated again and again in rams of diminishing size until the cylinder assumes the diameter and length required this hot drawing leaves the surface of the metal marked with longitudinal lines not unlike the glacier scratches on a rock albeit they are straighter and more regular but the next operation not only obliterates these markings and gives the metal a smooth surface like that of polished silver but it also confers upon the material a homogeneity which it did not before possess and without which it would never bear the pressure which it is destined to withstand when finished this operation consists in a final application of the hydraulic ram while the metal remains perfectly cold instead of red hot as in the previous cases as the result of these various hydraulic operations we have a perfectly formed cylinder closed at one end and we now follow it into another department of the works when its open end is once more brought in a furnace to a red heat the object of this is to make the metal soft while the shoulder and neck of the vessel are formed to accomplish this the heated open end of the cylinder is laid horizontally upon a kind of semicircular cradle and is held there by tongs handled by two men another workman places over the open end a die of the form shown in fig 4 and while the cylinder is slowly turned round in its cradle two sledge hammers are brought down with frequent blows upon the die closing in the end of the cylinder but leaving a central hole as shown in fig 5 further operations reduce the opening still more until it is closed altogether and a projection is formed as shown at fig 6 this projection is now bored through and the cylinder is ready for testing illustration fig 4 illustration fig 5 illustration fig 6 the cylinder is submitted to a water test the liquid being forced in until the gauge shows a pressure of two tons to the square inch cylinders have been known to give way under this ordeal but without any dangerous consequences the metal simply rips up making a report at the moment of fracture as loud as a gun the wonderful strength of the metal employed may be gauged by the circumstance that the walls of the cylinder designed to hold 100 feet of gas are only fivesixteenths of an inch in thickness during the manufacture of the cylinder as we have already indicated much oil is used and so far as steel can be saturated with that fluidin the popular sensethe metal is in that state it is essential that this oil should be completely got rid of and this is carefully done before the cylinder is charged with gas previous to such charging the vessel has to be fitted with its valve of these valves there are three kinds known respectively as the brin the birmingham and the manchester each has its admirers but we cannot here discuss their individual merits the charging of the cylinder is brought about by a powerful pump having three cylinders so arranged that the compressed contents of the first cylinder are still further compressed in the second and still more highly in the third the filling of a 100 ft cylinder occupies about half an hourphotographic news

appeared comparatively late in the group of domestic animals in searching the monuments of the ancients which have furnished the foundation for our present culture that is of the littoral inhabitants of the mediterranean and of the people of mesopotamia we find in egypt the first traces of the horse but even here it appears late on the monuments of the first ruling patricians of human origin2 especially during the period of memphis ix dynasty then under the rules of thebes xixvi dynasty there is no trace of the horse footnote 2 until the time menes with whom historical times begin ruled in egypt among visionary heroes or mythological gods it is first in the transition period from the late rule of thebes xviixx dynasty to the socalled period of sut xxixxx dynasty that there appears in the wall pictures of the pharaohs tombs representations of the horse the oldest now known picture of the horse is found on the walls of the tombs of seti i 14581507 bc under whose reign the israelite wandered from egypt the horses of the mortuary pictures are very well drawn and have an unmistakable oriental type there has therefore undoubtedly existed in egypt high culture for over 4000 years without representation of the horse which was the next animal domesticated after the cat from this time on we find the horse frequently represented both by the vainglorious despots of mesopotamia and on the socalled etruscan vases which appeared after the influence of greek art when on almost every urn horses in lively action and in various forms of bodily development almost always of an oriental type are to be recognized but neither here nor in homer nor in the many later representations of the horse on the roman triumphal arches etc are to be found horses whose hoofs have any trace of

mithridates the great at times and specially at the siege of cyzicus were delayed in order to let the hoofs of the horses grow on the contrary it seems strange that of the huns alone whose horsemen swept over whole continents from the asiatic highlands like a thunderstorm such trouble had not become known either through the numerous authors of the eastern and western roman empire or from gallia horseshoeing very likely was invented by different nations at about the same period during the migration of the nations and the various kinds of new inventions were brought together in germany only after each had acquired a national stamp according to climate and usefulness in this way come from the south the thin platelike horseshoes with staved rim covering the whole hoof from the mongolian tribes of middle asia the stolleneisen calk shoe while to our northern ancestors and indeed the normans must be ascribed with great probability the invention of the griffeneisen gripe shoe especially for the protection of the toes all varieties of the horseshoe of southern europe are easily distinguished from the roman socalled kureisen cure shoe of which several have been unearthed at various excavations and are preserved at the romogermanic museum in mentz mainz germany the shoes figs 1 and 2 each represent thin iron plates covering the whole hoof which in some cases have an opening in the middle of several centimeters in diameter illustration fig 1 these plates apparently set forth to suit oriental and occidental body conformation are either directly provided with loops or have around the outer margin a brim several centimeters high in which rings are fastened through the loops or rings small ropes were drawn and in this way the shoe was fastened to the crown of the hoof and to the pastern sufficient securing of the toe was wanting in all these shoes and on account of this the movement of the animal with the same must have been very clumsy and we can see from this that the ropes must have made the crown of the hoof and pastern sore in a short time one of these shoes3 evidently was the object of improvement to prevent the animal from slipping as well as from friction and we therefore find on it three iron cubes 1 centimeters high which were fastened corresponding to our toes and calks of today and offer a very early ready proof from our climatic and mountainous conditions which later occur principally in southern germany that this style of horseshoeing was not caused by error but by a well founded local and national interest or want footnote 3 not illustrated illustration fig 2 aside from the socalled kureisen cure shoe for diseased hoofs we find very little from the romans on horseshoeing or hoof protection and therefore we must observe special precautions with all their literature on the subject it is because of this that i excuse prof sittls communication in the preface of winckelmanns geschichte der kunst in alterthum history of ancient art which contains a notice that fabretti in some raised work in plazzo matti of a representation of a hunt by the emperor gallienus bartoli admirand ant tab 24 showed that at that time horseshoes fastened by nails the same as today were used fabretti de column traj c 7 pag 225 conf montlanc antiq explic t 4 pag 79 this statement proves itself erroneous because he was not aware that the foot of the horse was repaired by an inexperienced sculptor how then did out of this roman cure shoe develop the horseshoeing of southern europe it was to be expected with the roman horseshoe that the mode of fastening became unsatisfactory and necessitated a remedy or change an attempt of this kind has been preserved in the socalled asiatischen koppeneisensole asiatic capironsole fig 3 which the hon mr lydtin at karlsruhe had made according to a model of the circassian horse tribe shaloks and also according to the reverse of lycian coins called triguetra illustration fig 3 this horseshoe plate likely originating in the twelfth century covers the whole surface of the sole like the roman shoes with the exception of the wall region which contains a rim 1 centimeter high and above this rises at one side toward the heel three beaklike projections about 4 centimeters high and 1 centimeter wide at the base being pointed above and turned down which were fastened in the wall of the hoof in the form of a hook this mode of fastening evidently was also insufficient and so the fastening of the shoe by nails was adopted these iron plates used for shoes were too thin to allow nails with sunken heads to be used so only nails with blades and cubical shaped heads were applicable these nail heads 6 to 8 in number which left the toe and the back part of the heel free served at the same time to secure the horse from slipping which the smooth plates covering the whole hoof surface without doubt facilitated illustration fig 4 shoes of this kind after the old roman style with a very strong rim bent upward likely proved very comfortable for the purpose of protection in the sierras of the pyrenean peninsula where they seem to have been in use for a long time for in the twelfth century we find in spain the whole form of the roman shoe only fastened by nails figs 4 and 5 at first the shoe seems to have been cut off at the heel end but as apparently after being on for some time bruises were noticed the shoe was made longer at the heel and this part was turned up so as to prevent them from becoming loose too soon as both the spanish horseshoes of this period show and the acquisition was even later transferred to england fig 7 illustration fig 5 the shoe containing a groove fig 6 which we shall see later made its appearance in germany in the fifteenth century from this time according to our present knowledge ceases the period of the roman horseshoe its influence however lasted a great deal longer and has even remained until our present day illustration fig 6 its successor became partly the araboturkomanic and partly the southwest european horseshoe for the descendants of the numidian light cavalry the roman and old spanish horseshoe was evidently too heavy for their sandy roadless deserts so they made it thinner and omitted the bentup rim because it prevented the quick movement of the horse for the protection of the nail heads the outer margin of the shoe was staved so as to form a small rim on the outer surface of the shoe thus preventing the nail heads from being worn and the shoe lost too soon illustration fig 7 illustration fig 8 illustration fig 9 a horseshoe of that kind is shown by fig 8 which was used in north africa in the twelfth century and became the model for all forms of horseshoes of the mahometan tribes even now quite similar shoes fig 9 are made south and east from the caspian sea at the amudarja in samarkand etc which were probably introduced under tamerlane the conqueror of nearly the whole of asia minor in the fourteenth century the socalled sarmatische sarmatian horseshoe figs 10 and 11 of south russia shows in its form at the same time traces of the last named shoe however greatly influenced by the mongolian shoe the goldenen horde which at the turn of the sixteenth to the seventeenth century played havoc at the volga and the aral the unusual width of the toe and especially the lightness of the iron reminds us of the turkomanic horseshoe whereas on the contrary the large beanshaped holes as well as the calks were furnished through mongolian influence illustration fig 10 the sarmatian tribes were principally horsemen and it is not surprising therefore that the coat of arms of the former kingdom of poland in the second and third quadrate shows a silver rider in armor on a silver running horse shod with golden shoes and that at present about 1000 families in 25 lineages of the polish counts jastrzembiec bolesezy the socalled polnische hufeisen adel polish horseshoe nobility at the same time also carried the horseshoe on their coats of arms the silver horseshoe in a blue field appears here as a symbol of the herbestpfardes autumnal horse to which after the christianization of poland was added the golden cross the noblemen participating in the murder of the holy stanislaus in 1084 had to carry the horseshoe reversed on their escutcheon illustration fig 11 from the african and turkomanic horseshoe through the turning up of the toes and heels originated later the turkish grecian and montenegrin horseshoe of the present as shown by fig 12 illustration fig 12 by the moorish invasion in spain the spanishgothic horseshoeing was also modified through which the shoe became smooth staved at the margin very broad in the toe and turned up at toe and heel and at a later period the old open spanish national horseshoe fig 13 was developed as we thus see we can in no way deny the arabianturkish origin of this shoe illustration fig 13 as france had received her whole culture from the south and as the crusades especially brought the roman nation in close contact with them for centuries so it cannot appear strange that the old french horseshoe a form of which has been preserved by bourgelat and is represented by fig 14 still remained in the smooth turned up in front and behind like the shoe of the southern climates with asiatic traces which hold on the ground the same as all southern shoeing by the nail heads illustration fig 14 the transit of the german empire in order to keep up the historical course once more brings us back to the middle of the fifth century at this time attila the godegisel gods scourge left his wooden capitol in the lowlands near the river theis to go to the roman empire and to the german and gallican provinces there to spread indescribable misery to the horrors of judgment day the following is a prayer in those days of horror kleiner huf kleines ross krummer sabel spitz geschoss blitzesschnell und sattlefest schrim uns herr von hunnenpest we are at present reminded of those times of fright when during the clearing and tilling of the soil a small roughly made horseshoe is found in southern germany about as far as the water boundary of the thuringian forest and occasionally on but principally around augsburg and in france as far as the loire these shoes covering the margin or wall of the foot show slight traces of having been beveled on the lower surface and contain two bent calks very superficially placed occasionally they are sharpened and turned in two directions the characteristic wide beanshaped nail holes are conical on the inside and are frequently placed so near the outer margin of the shoe that from the pressure the hoofs were likely to split open the nail heads were shaped like a sleigh runner and almost entirely sunk into the shoe it evidently was not bent up at the toe like the old form of these kinds of shoes these shoes according to our conception of today were so carelessly finished that in the scientific circles of historical researches they were until very recently looked upon as saddle mountings or something similar and not as horseshoes this shoe was for some time while it was plentifully found in france regarded as of celtic make but this is certainly not the case as it is of hunish and hungarian nationalitat nationality an exactly scientific proof it is true according to our present knowledge cannot be furnished however it will stand well enough until the error is proved this peculiar kind of horseshoe has been found in south germany and northeast france as far as the region of orleans where as it has been proved the huns appeared this therefore speaks for their descendants 1st the far extended and yet sharply limited places of finding the shoe 2d the small size corresponds to the historically proved smallness of the hunish horse 3d the hasty and careless make which does not indicate that it was made by settled workmen 4th the horseshoe fig 15 bespeaks the hunish workmanship of the present chinese shoe which in making of the nail holes shows today related touches of the productions of the mongolian ancestors illustration fig 15 aside from the peculiar shaped nail holes the characteristic of the hunish shoe consists in the changes of the calks for summer and winter shoeing as well as in the sinking of the nail heads the huns therefore aside from the indistinctly marked attempts of the romans in this direction which are the only ones known to me must be regarded as the inventors not only of the calks but partly next to the normans also of the sharpened winter shoeing and of the not unimportant invention of sinking the nail heads observed in fig 15 the hunish shoeing was therefore an important invention for the germans after centuries later wherever horseshoeing was practiced it was done solely according to hunish methods whereby the shoe was very possibly made heavier was more carefully finished and in course of time showed an attempt to bend the toe fig 16a illustration fig 16 illustration fig 16a in the bomberg dom we find an equestrian statue not unknown in the history of art which was formerly held to be that of emperor conrad iii at present however the opinion prevails generally that it represents stephen i den heiligen stephen i the saint stephen i the first king of hungary formerly was a heathen and was named najk he reigned from 997 to 1038 his important events were the many victorious wars led against rebellious chieftains of his country and he was canonized in 1087 his equestrian monument in bomberg dom was in consequence hardly made before the year 1087 notwithstanding that the huns had been defeated 500 years before on the plains of catalania the horse of the above mentioned monument carries as i have convinced myself personally hunish horseshoes modified however by bladeshaped calks just then coming into use this is proof that at least in hungary the hunish method of shoeing was preserved an extraordinary long time by this it has not become improbable that at least the many shoes of this kind which were found on the lechfield come not directly from the huns but from their successors the hungarians whose invasions took place in the first half of the tenth century about the same time of the hungarian invasions the normans began to disturb the southwestern part of europe with their viking expeditions their sea kings seem to have been equestrians at very early times and to have had their horses shod although perhaps only in winter at least the excavation of the viking ship in 1881 disclosed the remains of a horse which was shod the shoeing consisted only of a toe protectionbrodder bruder brotherprovided with a small sharp calk and fastened by two nails when later in the year 1130 the norwegian king sigard yorsalafar during his journey to jerusalem entered constantinople his horse is said to have carried only the small toeprotecting shoes the art of horseshoeing immediately after the migration of the nations came near our improvement of the same today especially near the reputed discoveries met with which consist simply of iron protection for the margin of the hoof fastened by nails the heads were sunk into the shoe so as to increase its firmness special consideration was given to local and climatic conditions through the introduction of toes and heels the mechanism of the hoof also found remarkable consideration inasmuch as they apparently avoided driving nails too close to the heel end of the shoe notwithstanding this early improvement in the art of horseshoeing the huns as stated before took a prominent part it appears to have taken a long time after the migration of the nations for shoeing to become general as is shown by various descriptions of tournaments pictures of horses etc illustration fig 18 we will mention in the first place the percival des wolfram von eschenbach as well as christ von troies where there is a great deal said about horses horse grooms and tournaments but nowhere in those works is any mention made of horseshoeing likewise is found the horse on the coat of arms of wolfram von eschenbach in the manessi collection in paris which was begun in switzerland in the fourteenth century but although we find this horse most beautifully finished it was not shod illustration fig 19 during the time of the crusades 10961291 however there appeared suddenly in germany a platelike horseshoe of southern character figs 18 and 19 which was occasionally bent upward at the heel end and was very heavy the toe was very broad sometimes and was also bent upward in this form we have seen the shoes of the balkan and pyrean peninsula the shoe was remarkably narrow at the heel and was supplied with calks which accounts for the highness of the back part of the shoe frequently we find one calk set diagonally but the other drawn out wedge shaped and sharp so that there existed a great similarity between this iron shank and that used by count einsiedel for winter shoeing sometimes both shanks were sharpened in this way or were provided with bladeshaped calks well set forward the form of nail holes used was very characteristic of that of the huns but they were decidedly smaller and square as were seen in the african shoe of the twelfth century the nail heads were slightly sunk which was according to southern customs that this shoe really belongs to the period of the crusades is proved by the numerous horse pictures which have been preserved from that time of which we will mention the manuscript of heinrich von veldecka eneidt4 in the year 1180 which belongs to the most valuable parts of german history of art footnote 4 wanderungen des aeneas travels of aeneas this south european hunish horseshoe had remained the standard form during the middle ages and until the thirty years war at least in south germany the shoe was continually improved and reached its highest point of perfection about the time of the bauernkrieg revolution of the peasants at a time when under the leadership of the renaissance the whole art of mechanics and especially that of blacksmithing had taken an extraordinarily great stride figs 20 and 21 illustration fig 20 illustration fig 21 the shoe figs 22 and 23 is found in franconia in all places where in the sixteenth century battles had been fought with the rebellious peasants we may therefore be justified in fixing its origin mainly from that period for which also speaks its high perfection of form we find here still the bentup heel and toe the latter broad and thin of the south european form the staved rim of the spanish arabic turkomanic shoe is observed to be undergoing a change to that of a groove the broad surface of the shoe evidently led to the beveling of the same so as to lessen sole pressure the size of the nail holes remains still like that of the huns but the unsunk southern nail heads yet serve to improve the hold on the ground the calks were next placed forward perhaps from an uncultivated sense of beauty or from the high bending up of the hind part of the shoe which would necessitate a high and heavy unsightly calk from this time on horseshoeing in south germany fell back very quickly and loses all scientific holds of support after the thirty years war in the mean time toe protection in the form of a calk had spread from the colder north over southern germany whereas this north german invention did not find favor in england in consequence of her mild oceanic climate illustration fig 22 also the calks in england as well as in the southern countries on the same ground therefore with good reason could at no time be adopted this did however not interfere with the use of the calk in the colder south germany where after a use of nearly 1500 years it has maintained its local and climatic adaptation notwithstanding the occasional aping by foreigners it has remained victorious in its original form and has been chosen in many countries the historical development of the horseshoe in general from about the time of emperor maximilian until the seven years war furnishes a true picture of the confused condition of things at that period of time which to make intelligible would require a separate and complete treatise interesting as it is to the scientist to follow up this development and mode of present german horseshoeing which aside from the national toe and calk is the english form and has become influential and with full right for a periodical of this kind further more comprehensive statement would under all circumstances take up too much room therefore i must drop the pen although reluctantly illustration fig 23 sheet glass from molten metal the present practice in making metal sheets is to cast ingots or slabs and then reduce these by repeated rollings and reheating attempts have been previously made to produce sheets directly from molten metal by pouring the metal 1 between two revolving rollers or 2 between a revolving wheel and the surface of an inclosing fixed semicircular segment by these means none but very thin plates could be satisfactorily produced in this invention by cm pielsticker london the machinery consists of a large receiving roller of 5 ft diameter more or less and of a length equal to that of the plate to be produced with this are combined small forming rollers arranged in succession part way round the periphery of the large roller and revolving at the same rate as the large roller the rollers can be cooled by a current of water circulating through them the molten metal flows on to the surface of the large roller and is prevented from escaping sideways by flanges with which the large roller is provided these flanges embrace the small rollers and are of a depth greater than that of the thickest plate which it is proposed to roll the distance between the large roller and the small rollers can be adjusted according to the desired thickness of the plate when dealing with metals of high melting point such as steel the first small roller is made of refractory material and is heated from inside by the flame of a blow pipe the rollers are coated with plumbago or other material to prevent adhesion to the molten metal in the case of metals of high melting point the machine is fed direct from a furnace divided into two compartments by a wall or bridge in which is a stopper which can be operated so as to regulate the flow of metal when applied to forming sheets of glass the rollers should be warmed by a blow pipe flame as above described and the sheet of glass stretched and annealed as it leaves the last roller weldless steel chains at the royal naval exhibition london messrs william reid co are exhibiting their weldless steel chains which we now illustrate of the many advantages claimed for steel chains it may be prominently noted that a very important saving of weight is effected on account of their possessing such a high breaking strain compared with the ordinary welded iron chains to illustrate this it may be stated that a given length of the weldless steel chain is 35 to 40 per cent less in weight than an equivalent length of iron chain will stand the same breaking strain as the latter and indeed where steel of special quality is used in making the weldless chains this difference can be increased as much as 70 to 80 per cent whereas superior iron chains break at a strain at 17 tons per square inch these weldless steel chains will stand a strain of 28 to 30 tons with 20 to 26 per cent elongation illustration figures 1 through 9 1a 1b and 3a manufacture of weldless chains again there is greater security in their use from the fact that there are no welds and they give warning of the limit of strain to which they can bear being approached by elongation which can be carried to a considerable extent before the chain breaks moreover over in chains made by this process the links are all exactly alike though the life of a weldless steel chain is said to be twice that of an ordinary one the price per length is little more than that of best iron chains they are made in lengths of from 40 to 50 feet being compressed from a solid rolled steel bar the section of which is shaped like a fourpointed star in the first place holes are pierced at intervals down the length of the bar thus determining the length of the several links then the bar is notched between the holes so as to give the external form of the links the next step is flattening out which presses the links into shape on their inner side but leaves the openings still closed by a plate of metal they are then stamped out so as to round them up and the metal inside them is punched out and the edges cleaned or trimmed off the links are now parted from one another and stamped again to insure equal thickness in all parts of the chain the only processes now to be gone through are dressing and finishing according to the die used the shape of the links can be varied to suit any required pattern the lengths of chain thus made are joined by spiral rings made of soft steel the convolutions being afterward hammered together till they become solid a ring of this description inch diameter underwent a strain of 46200 lb that is 23 tons to the square inch its elongation being 21 per cent these chains have passed satisfactorily the tests of the bureau veritas and both that association and lloyds have accepted their use on the same conditions and under the same tests as ordinary chains so much for the general idea of punching steel chains we will now describe a recent invention by which superior steel chains are produced the author of which is mr hippolyte rongier of birmingham eng he says my invention has for its object the manufacture of weldless stayed chains whereof each link together with its cross strut or stay is made of one piece of metal without any weld or joint and the invention consists in producing a chain of stayed links from a bar of cruciform section by the consecutive series of punching twisting and stamping operations hereinafter described the punching operations being entirely performed on the metal when in the cold state figs 1 to 10 show the progressive stages in the manufacture of the chain and the remaining figures show the series of tools that are employed the general method of operation of making stayed chains according to my invention is so far similar to the methods heretofore proposed for making unstayed chains from the bar of cruciform section that the links are formed alternately out of the one and the other pair of diametrically opposite webs of the rod the links when severed and completed being already enchained together at the time of their formation the successive operations differ however in many important practical respects from those heretofore proposed as will appear from the following detailed description of the successive steps in the process illustrated by figs 1 to 10 i will distinguish the one pair of diametrically opposite webs of the bar and the notches and mortises punched therein and the links formed therefrom from the other pair by an index figure 1 affixed to the reference letters appertaining thereto a a are one pair of diametrically opposite webs and a a the other pair of webs of the bar illustration figures 2ab 6a 4ab 7 ab and 10 ab manufacture of weldless chains the first operation illustrated in fig 1 is to punch out of the edge of one of the webs a a series of shallow notches b at equal intervals apart corresponding to the pitch of the links to be formed out of that pair of webs and situated where the spaces will ultimately be formed between the ends of that series of links the notches are made with beveled ends and are no deeper than is absolutely necessary for the purpose of a guide stop in the subsequent operations as hereinafter described so as to avoid as far as possible weakening the bar transversely this operation is repeated upon one of the pairs of webs a but whereas in the first operation of notching the web the pitch of the notches is determined by the feed mechanism in this second operation of notching the notches b cut in the web a serve as guides to influence and compensate for any inaccuracy of the feed mechanism so that the second set of notches b shall be intermediate of and rigorously equidistant from the first set of notches b this compensation is effected by the notches b fitting on to a beveled stop on the bed of the punching tool by which the notches b are cut the beveled ends of the notches b causing the bar under the pressure of the punch to adjust itself in the longitudinal direction if necessary sufficiently to rectify any inaccuracy of feed these notches b b similarly serve as guides to insure uniformity of spacing in the subsequent operations of punching out the links the second operation illustrated in fig 2 is to punch out of the pair of opposite webs a a pairs of oblong mortisestwo pairs c c and one pair d d these three pairs of mortises which might be punched at separate operations but are preferably punched at one stroke of the press are situated as close as possible up to the faces of the other pairs of webs a a the pairs of mortises c c being so spaced as to correspond in position to the eyes of the links to be formed to which they correspond approximately in form while the pair d correspond in position to the notches b and therefore to the intervals by which the links formed out of the same pair of webs a a will be separated when completed this operation is continued along the whole length of the pair of webs a it will be observed that a considerable thickness of metal is left at a between the notches b and the mortises d this is of primary importance and is one of the essential features of my method of manufacture inasmuch as by first punching out the mortises d the subsequent removal of the metal from between the outer ends of the links is greatly facilitated while by leaving the solid metal a the transverse strength of the webs a a is not materially diminished so that when the operation of punching the mortises c and d in the other pair of webs a is performed the bar will not be bent and crippled as would inevitably be the case were the whole of the metal opposite the notches b which is ultimately to be removed to be punched out at so early a stage of the manufacture the operation of punching the pairs of mortises c and d having been repeated along the other pair of webs a it will be observed that like the notches b the mortises c d in the one pair of webs alternate with those c d in the other pair of webs the third operation illustrated in fig 3 is to elongate the mortises c d and bring the mortises c c more nearly to the final form this is performed by punches similar to but larger in the direction of the length of the rod than those used in the second operation the third operation which is repeated upon both pairs of webs a a a a may be considered as a second stage of the second operation it being preferable to punch out the mortises in two stages in order to remove sufficient metal without unduly straining the bar the fourth operation illustrated in fig 4 consists in roughly shaping the ends of the links externally by punching out the portions a of the webs a between the links lying in the same plane or formed out of the same pair of webs this operation is repeated on the other pair of webs a up to this point a continuous core of metal has been left at the intersection of the two pairs of webs the fifth operation illustrated in fig 5 consists in punching out the portions e of the core at each side of the cross stay of the link so as to separate the cross stay from the outer ends of the adjacent links this operation is performed by removing a portion only of the metal of the core which intervenes between the cross stay and the outer ends of the adjacent links enchained with the link under operationthat is to say portions e of the core are temporarily left attached to the outer ends of the links in order to avoid crippling or bending the bar which might occur were the whole of this metal which is ultimately to be removed to be punched out at once these portions e being supported by the bed die in the operation of punching out the spaces e as hereinafter described this operation having been repeated upon both pairs of webs it will be observed that the rodlike form of the chain is now only maintained by the portion of the core at the points f where the inner side of the eye or bow of one link is united with that of the next one the severing of these intervening portions of the core and the breaking up of the rod into the constituent links of the chain constitute the sixth operation the sixth operation illustrated in fig 6 is performed by torsion and for this purpose one end of the rod is held fixed while the other is twisted once or twice in opposite directions until by fatigue of the metal at the points f the whole of the links are severed almost at the same instant and a chain of roughly formed stayed links is produced the seventh operation illustrated in fig 7 is to remove the superfluous projecting pieces of metal both from the inside and outside of the ends of the links for this purpose the two ends of each link are operated on at the same time by two pairs of punches corresponding to the outline of the ends of the link the eighth operation illustrated in fig 8 is to bring the ends of the links to their finished rounded form this is performed by stamping both ends of each link at the same time between pairs of shaping dies or swages the ninth operation illustrated in fig 9 is to bring the middle portion of each linkthat is to say the side members and the cross stayto the finished rounded form which is also performed by means of a pair of dies or swages the tenth and last operation illustrated in fig 10 is to contract the link slightly in the lateral direction in order to correct any imperfections at the sides left by the two previous operations and bring the link to a more perfect and stronger form as shown this operation has the important result of strengthening the link considerably by contracting or rendering more pointed the arched form of the bow or end of the link and also by thickening the metal at that part where the wear is greatest this thickening of the metal at the ends of the link occurring in the direction of the line of strain as indicated by x in fig 10 and being brought about by the compression or upsetting of the metal at the end of the link it may be preferable to perform this operation immediately after the seventh operation and i reserve the right to do so in the case of large cables only the metal is preferably heated for the eighth ninth and tenth operations i will now refer to the figures which illustrate the series of tools whereby the above mentioned operations are performed fig 1a shows a plan the punch being in section and fig 1b an elevation of the bed die of the tool by which the notches b of the first operation are performed the feed mechanism is not shown but might be of any ordinary intermittent kind g is a groove in the bed in which lies the lower vertical web of the rod of cruciform section the two horizontal webs lying upon the bed with the edge of the web to be notched lying just over the die in which works the punch b of which b is the cutting edge the punch is operated in the usual way its lower end which does not rise out of the die acting as a guide b is the beveled stop in the groove g which by fitting in the notches b or b corrects inaccuracies of the feed fig 2a is a sectional plan and fig 2b an elevation of the tool by which the second operation is performed the same tool being also used for performing the third operation illustrated in fig 3a h h are a pair of beddies having a space h between them to receive the lower web of the bar and having notches c c and d d in their inner ends forming counterparts of the punches by which the pairs of mortises c d fig 2 are punched in the pair of webs lying upon the beddies h these beddies are fitted to slide a little in opposite directions upon a suitable bed plate and are caused by the inclined cams i on the guides i of the press head which pass through corresponding apertures in the beddies h to approach each other at the moment the punches come down on the work so as to grip the lower web of the rod and support the pair of webs being operated on close up to the sides of the lower web lying in the space h while when the punches rise the beddies move apart so that the web is quite free in said space h and the rod may be easily fed forward for a fresh stroke of the press b is the beveled stop in the space k as in the tool first described the beddies h have a second set of notches c d at their outer ends similar to but longer than those c d so that by reversing the beddies they will form counterparts for a second set of punches corresponding thereto for performing the third operationie enlarging the mortises c d as represented in figs 3 and 3a or instead of adapting the dies h to perform the two operations separate tools may be used for the second and third operations fig 4a is an elevation and fig 4b a sectional plan of the tool for performing the fourth operationnamely removing the portion a figs 3 3a 4a and 4b this is done by a pair of punches a corresponding in shape to the ends of the link in the rough and to the aperture shown in the beddie k fig 4b which has a groove k to admit the lower web of and to guide the rod the beveled stop b used in operating on the pair of webs a corresponds to the notches b but in operating on the webs a the stop must be replaced by one corresponding to the aperture left by the removal of the portion a fig 5a is an elevation fig 5b a plan and fig 5c a longitudinal vertical section of the tool for performing the fifth operation the work being shown in section in the latter figure it consists of a beddie l with groove m to receive the lower web but terminating at a distance from the die apertures so as to leave supports n for the parts e of the rod to resist the downward pressure of the punches e which remove the portions e from each side of the cross stay as shown in figs 5b and 5c the correct position of the work in regard to the punches is insured by these supporting parts n which terminate the grooves m fig 6a is an elevation

of this so that both ends of the link to be trimmed may be operated on together the tool for performing the eighth operation consists of a pair of swages the bottom one only being shown in fig 8a the swages correspond to the intended rounded sectional form of the ends of the link which is placed in position between the swages in a similar manner to that described for fig 7b so that both ends are rounded or finished off at once fig 9a is a plan of the bottom swage of the tool for performing the ninth operation the upper swage corresponding thereto at least in so far as the middle part of the link to be operated on is concerned the tool for performing the tenth operation is represented in elevation and plan in figs 10a and 10b it consists of a pair of beddies r fitted to slide together and operated by the cams s on the guide rods s the operation being similar to that of the tool shown in figs 2a and 2b except that there are no punches and that the link which lies in the cavity of the dies is merely compressed in the lateral direction by the inward motion of the beddies my invention further comprises a modification of the above described process which has for its object to enable the weldless stayed links to be made as short and particularly as narrow as may be necessary in order to adapt the chain to run over the sheaves of pulley blocks and to suit other purposes for which shortlink welded chain has heretofore only been available illustration figures 5ac 8a 9a 1012 manufacture of weldless chains in the manufacture of chains by the aforesaid process of punching there is a practical minimum limit for the dimensions of the punches which cannot be reduced without compromising their efficiency and consequently the width and therefore the length of the link must necessarily bear a certain proportion to the thickness of the web of metal out of which it is formed since the breadth of the link depends on the length of the cross stay which is determined by the breadth of the mortises forming the eyes of the link the present modification enables these dimensions to be reduced without reducing the dimensions and consequently the efficiency of the punches which form the eyes of the link the modification applies to what i have designated the fifth operation of the above described process and it consists in punching out the middle of the cross stay so as to leave only two short stumps jutting inward from the side members of the link this operation serving to interrupt the continuity of the core which was the object of the fifth operation for this purpose i substitute for the pair of punches illustrated in figs 5a and 5c a single punch which removes that part of the core of the cruciform bar which is situated at the middle of the strut this tool is represented in fig 11 and the effect of its operation is shown in fig 12 the subsequent operations herein designated the sixth seventh eighth and ninth operations are performed as hereinbefore described but the tenth operation has the effect of closing together the two stumps g g until they abut together at the middle of the link and together constitute a cross strut or stay which prevents any further lateral collapse of the link in the operation of closing up the gap between the stumps g g the link is brought to the narrow form shown in fig 12 the eyes of the links being only just wide enough to receive the end of the adjacent link enchained therewith without gripping it this operation is performed by a tool similar to that shown in figs 10a and 10b above referred to an english

history of the aerial postal service and of the carrier pigeons of the siege of paris has been thoroughly written and is so well known that it is useless to recapitulate it in this place it will suffice to say that sixtyfour balloons crossed the prussian lines during the war of 18701871 carrying with them 360 pigeons 302 of which were afterward sent back to paris during a terrible winter without previous training and from localities often situated at a distance of over 120 miles despite the shooting at them by the enemy 98 returned to their cotes 75 of them carrying microscopic dispatches they thus introduced into the capital 150000 official dispatches and a million private ones reduced by photomicrographic processes the whole printed in ordinary characters would have formed a library of 500 volumes one of these carriers which reached paris on the 21st of january 1871 a few days previous to the armistice carried alone nearly 40000 dispatches the pigeon that brought the news of the victory of coulmiers started from la loupe at ten oclock in the morning on the tenth of november and reached paris a few minutes before noon the account of the villejuif affair was brought from paris to tourcoing nord by a white pigeon belonging to mr descampes this pigeon is now preserved in a stuffed state in the museum of the city the carrier pigeon service was not prolonged beyond the 1st of february and our winged brothers of arms were sold at a low price at auction by the government which once more showed itself ungrateful to its servants as soon as it no longer had need of their services after the commune mr la perre de roo submitted to the president of the republic a project for the organization of military dove cotes for connecting the french strongholds with each other mr thiers treated the project as chimerical so the execution of it was delayed up to the time at which we saw it applied in foreign countries in 1877 the government accepted a gift of 420 pigeons from mr de roo and had the administration of post offices construct in the garden of acclimatization a model pigeon house which was finished in 1878 and was capable of accommodating 200 pairs at present the majority of our fortresses contain dove cotes which are perfectly organized and under the direction of the engineer corps of the army the map in fig 1 gives the approximate system such as it results from documents consulted in foreign military reviews according to lieutenant grigot an officer of the belgian army who has written a very good book entitled science colombophile a rational organization of the french system requires a central station at paris and three secondary centers at langres lyons and tours the latter being established in view of a new invasion as the distance of paris from the frontier of the north is but 143 miles at the most the city would have no need of any intermediate station in order to communicate with the various places of the said frontier langres would serve as a relay between paris and the frontier of the northeast for the places of the southeast it would require at least two relays lyons and langres or dijon illustration fig 1theoretic map of the french system of military dove cotes as paris has ten directions to serve it should therefore possess ten different dove cotes of 720 birds each and this would give a total of 7200 pigeons according to the same principle langres which has five directions to provide for should have 3600 pigeons continuing this calculation we find that it would require 25000 pigeons for the dove cotes as a whole appropriated to the frontiers of the north northeast east and southeast without taking into account our frontiers of the ocean and the pyrenees illustration fig 2basket for carrying pigeons a law of the 3d of july 1877 supplemented by a decree of the 15th of november organized the application of carrier pigeons in france one of the last enumerations shows that there exist in paris 11000 pigeons 5000 of which are trained and in the suburbs 7000 of which 3000 are trained at roubaix a city of 100000 inhabitants there are 15000 pigeons watrelos a small neighboring city of 10000 inhabitants has no less than 3000 carrier pigeons belonging to three societies the oldest of which that of saintesprit was founded in 1869 in entire france there are about 100000 trained pigeons and fortyseven departments having pigeonfancying societies germanyafter the war of 1870 prussia which had observed the services rendered by pigeons during the siege of paris was the first power to organize military dove cotes in the autumn of 1871 the minister of war commissioned mr leutzen a very competent amateur of cologne to study the most favorable processes for the recruitment rearing and training of carrier pigeons as well as for the organization of a system of stations upon the western frontier in 1872 mr bismarck having received a number of magnificent belgian pigeons as a present a rearing station was established at the zoological garden of berlin under the direction of dr bodinas in 1874 military dove cotes were installed at cologne metz strassburg and berlin since that time there have been organized or at least projected about fifteen new stations upon the frontier of france upon the maritime coasts of the north or upon the russian frontier berlin remains the principal rearing station with two pigeon houses of 500 pigeons each but it is at cologne that is centralized the general administration of military dove cotes under mr leutzens direction the other stations are directly dependent upon the commandant of the place under the control of the inspector of military telegraphy the wilhelmshaven dove cote by way of exception depends upon the admiralty in each dove cote there is a subofficer of the engineer corps and an experienced civil pigeon fancier on a monthly salary of ninety marks assisted by two orderlies in time of war this personnel has to be doubled and commanded by an officer the amount appropriated to the military dove cotes which in 1875 was about 13000 francs rose in 1888 to more than 60000 francs as a rule each dove cote should be provided with 1000 pigeons but this number does not appear to have been yet reached except at thorn metz and strassburg germany has not confined herself to the organization of military dove cotes but like other nations has endeavored to aid and direct pigeon fancying so as to be able when necessary to find ready prepared resources in the civil dove cotes the generals make it their duty to be present as far as possible at the races of private societies and the emperor awards gold medals for flights of more than 120 miles on the 13th of january 1881 nineteen of these societies at the head of which must be placed the columbia of cologne combined into a federation at the end of the year the association already included sixtysix societies on the 1st of december 1888 it included seventyeight with 52240 carrier pigeons ready for mobilization the first two articles of the statutes of the federation are as follows i the object of the federation is to unite in one organization all societies of pigeon fanciers in order to improve the service of carrier pigeons which in case of war the country must put to profit ii the federation therefore proposes a to aid the activity of pigeonfancying societies and to direct the voyages of the societies according to a determined plan b to form itinerent societies and on this occasion to organize expositions and auction sales of pigeons c to maintain relations with the prussian minister of war d to obtain diminutions and favors for transportation e to make efforts for the extermination of vultures f to obtain a legal protection for pigeons and g to publish a special periodical for the instruction of fanciers italythe first military dove cote in italy was installed in 1876 at ancona by the twelfth regiment of artillery in 1879 a second station was established at bologna at present there are in the kingdom besides the central post at rome some fifteen dove cotes the principal ones of which are established at naples gaeta alexandria bologna ancona and placenza there are at least two on the french frontier at fenestrella and exilles and two others in sardinia at cagliari and maddalena the complete system includes twentythree moreover there are two in operation at massoua and assab the cost of each cote amounts to about 1000 francs the pigeons are registered and taken care of by a pigeon breeder a

service of this vessel named the tynwald we give a profile and an engraving of stern showing the method of supporting the brackets for propeller shafting illustration twin screwsrear view the tynwald is 265 feet long 34 feet 6 inches beam and 14 feet 6 inches depth moulded the gross tonnage being 946 tons the desire of the owners to put the vessel alternately on two distinct services required special arrangement of the saloons running between liverpool and the island there was no necessity for sleeping accommodation as the passage is made in about three hours and the ship had to be suited to carry immense crowds but as the owners wished on special occasions to run the vessel from glasgow to manxland it was necessary to so arrange the saloons as to admit of sleeping accommodation being provided on these occasions on the liverpool run the vessel will carry from 800 to 900 passengers a spacious promenade is an indispensable desideratum and the upper or shelter deck has been made flush from stem to stern the only obstructions in addition to the engine and boiler casings and the deck and cargo working machinery being a small deck house aft with special state rooms ticket and post offices and the companion way to the saloons below on the main deck forward is a sheltered promenade for second class passengers while on the lower deck below are dining saloons the sofas of which may be improvised for sleeping accommodation at the extreme after end of the main deck is the first class saloon with the ladies room forward on the starboard side and there being no alley way forward the ladies lavatories are provided on the starboard side of the engine casing on the port side are the gentlemens lavatories and smoking saloon and bar the dining saloon is aft on the lower deck with ladies room forward in the two saloons and ladies rooms sofa berths can be arranged to accommodate 252 passengers the crew and petty officers are accommodated in the forward part of the ship as the profile shows the vessel is divided by transverse bulkheads into seven watertight compartments and there are double bottoms she has six large boats and several rafts illustration the liverpool and isle of man twin screw steamer tynwald the twin screws are revolved by separate triple expansion engines steam being supplied by two doubleended boilers each boiler is placed fore and aft and each has a separate uptake and funnel there are three stokeholds and to ventilate them and supply sufficient air for the furnaces there is in each a 6 foot fan driven by an independent engine running at 250 revolutions these have been supplied by messrs wh allen co london the boilers are of steel and adapted for a working pressure of 160 lb to the square inch they are 16 feet in diameter and 18 feet long and there are eight furnaces in each boiler sixteen in all the diameter of each furnace being 3 feet 4 inches the cylinders of the main engines are 22 in 36 in and 57 in in diameter respectively with a piston stroke of 3 ft the highpressure cylinders are each fitted with a piston valve and the intermediate and lowpressure cylinders with doubleported slide valves all of which are worked by the usual double eccentric and link motion valve gear by which the cutoff can be varied as required all the shafting is forged of siemensmartin mild steel of the best quality each of the three separate cranks being built up the condensers are placed at the outsides of the engine room and the air feed and bilge pumps are between the engines and the condensers and worked by levers from the lowpressure engine crosshead there are two centrifugal pumps each worked by a separate engine for circulating water through the condenser and these are so arranged that they can be connected to the bilges in the event of an accident to the ship in the engine room there is fitted an auxiliary feed donkey of the duplex type and made by the fairfield company this pump has all the usual connections so that it can be used for feeding the boilers from the hot well for filling the fresh water tanks for pumping from the bilges or from the sea as a fire engine the engines are arranged in the ship with the starting platform between them and the handles for working the throttle valves starting valves reversing gear browns combined steam and hydraulic and drain cocks are brought together at one end of the platform so that the engineer in charge can readily control both engines the two sets of engines are bound together by two beams bolted to the framing of each engine this feature was introduced into the design for steadiness the method of supporting the propeller shaft brackets is interesting and we reproduce a photograph that indicates the arrangement adopted instead of the a frame forming part of the same forging as the stern frame the fairfield company have built up the supporting arms of steel plates riveted together as is clearly shown there is an advantage in cost and with less risk in undiscovered flaws in material an interesting change has been made in the steam pipes cases of copper steam pipes bursting when subjected to high pressure have not been infrequent and mr a laing the engineering director on the fairfield board with characteristic desire to advance engineering practice has been devoting much attention to this question lately he has made very exhaustive tests with lap welded iron steam pipes of all diameters but principally of 10 in diameter and 38 in thickness of material made by messrs a j stuart clydesdale limited and the results have been such as to induce him to introduce these into vessels recently built by the company it may be stated that the pipes only burst at a hydraulic pressure of 3000 lb to the square inches the tynwald was tried on the clyde about a month ago and on two runs on the mile the one with and the other against the tide the mean speed was 1938 knotsthe maximum was 19 knotsand the indicated horse power developed was 5200 the steam pressure being 160 lb and the vacuum 28 lb since that time the vessel has made several runs from liverpool and from glasgow to the isle of man and has maintained a steady seagoing speed of between 18 and 19 knotsengineering the treatment of refractory ores mr jas j shedlock with the assistance of mr t denny of australia has constructed on behalf of the metallurgical syndicate of 105 gresham house london an apparatus on a commercial scale which it is said effects at the smallest expense and with the best economical results the entire separation of metals from their ores in treating ores by this process the stone is crushed in the usual way either by rolls or stamps the crushed ore being conveyed into an apparatus where each atom is subjected to the action of gases under pressure whereby the whole of the sulphur and other materials which render the ore refractory are separated the ore is then conveyed into a vessel containing an absorbing fluid metal so constructed that every particle of the ore is brought into contact with the metal for the production of reducing gases steam and air are passed through highly heated materials having an affinity for oxygen and the gases so produced are utilized for raising the ore to a high temperature by this means the sulphur and other metalloids and base metals are volatilized and eliminated and the gold in the ore is then in such a condition as to alloy itself or become amalgamated with the fluid metal with which it is brought into close contact the tailings passing off worthless are conveyed to the dump the apparatus in the background is that in which the steam is generated and which in combination with the due proportion of atmospheric air is first superheated in passing through the hearth or bed on which the fire is supported the superheated steam and air under pressure are then forced through the fire which is automatically maintained at a considerable depth by which means the products of combustion are mainly hydrogen and carbonic oxide these gases are then conveyed by means of the main and branch pipes to the cylindrical apparatus in the foreground into which the ore to be acted upon is driven under pressure by means of the gases which being ignited raise the ore to a high temperature the ore is maintained in a state of violent agitation each particle being kept separate from its fellows is consequently very rapidly acted upon by the gases the ore freed from its refractory constituents is then fed into a vessel containing the fluid metal in which each particle of ore is separated from the others and being acted upon by the fluid metal is absorbed into it the tailings or refuse passing off freed from any gold which may have been in the ore illustration apparatus for the treatment of refractory ores quantities of refractory ores treated by this process are said to have demonstrated that the whole of the gold in the ore is extracted the successful outcome of these trials is stated to have resulted in the anglofrench exploration co acquiring the right to work the process on the various gold fields of south africa it is anticipated that the process will thus be immediately brought to a test by means of apparatus erected on the gold fields under circumstances and conditions of absolute practical work as is well known goldbearing ores in south africa which are below the water line are by reason of the presence of sulphur extremely difficult to deal with and are consequently of small commercial value the gold in these ores it is maintained will by the new process be extracted and saved and make all the difference between successful and unsuccessful mining in that country it will have been seen that the peculiar and essential features of the invention consist in subjecting every particle of the ore under treatment to the process in all its stages instead of in bulk thereby insuring that no portion shall escape being acted upon by the gases and the absorbing metal this is done automatically and in a very rapid manner it is stated that this method of treatment is applicable to all ores the most refractory being readily reducible by its means the advantages claimed for this process are simplicity of the apparatus it being practically automatic that every particle of the ore is separately acted upon in a rapid and efficient manner that the apparatus is adaptable to existing milling plants and that there is an absence of elaborate and expensive plant and of the refinements of electrical or chemical science these advantages imply that the work can be done so economically as to commend the new process to the favorable consideration of all who are interested in mines or mining propertyiron refining silver bullion a number of years ago the author devised a method for refining silver bullion by sulphuric acid in which iron was substituted for copper as precipitant of silver the principal feature being the separation of pure crystals of silver sulphate a full description of this process may be found in percys metallurgy silver and gold page 479 the process has been extensively worked in san francisco and in germany in refining bullion to the amount of more than a hundred million dollars worth of silver its more general application has been hampered however by the circumstance that the patent had been secured by one firm which limited itself to its utilization in its california works the patent having expired the author lately introduced a modification of the process by which the apparatus and manipulations are greatly cheapened and simplified in the following account is given a short description of the process in its present shape preparing the silver sulphatethe bullion containing essentially silver copper and gold is dissolved by boiling with sulphuric acid in cast iron pots the difference between the new process and the usual practice consists in the use of a much larger quantity of acid thus in refining ordinary silver dore four parts of acid are used to one part of bullion of this acid one part is chemically and mechanically consumed in the dissolving process and the remaining three parts are fully recovered and at once ready for reutilization as will be described hereafter in the usual processunderstanding thereby here and in the following the process practiced at the united states mints for instancetwo parts of acid are employed for one of bullion all of this is lost partly through the dissolving and partly in being afterward mixed with water previous to the precipitation of the silver by copper economy in acid being therefore imperative the silver solution finally becomes much concentrated and it requires high heat and careful management to finish the solution of the bullion bars containing more than about 10 per cent of copper cannot be dissolved at all owing to the separation of copper sulphate insoluble in the small amount of free acid finally remaining the advantage gained by dissolving bullion with abundance of free acid in the improved process is so evident that it merely requires to be pointed out for bullion containing 20 per cent of copper the author employs six parts of acid to one of bullion for baser metal still more acid and so on never losing more than the stochiometrical percentage of acid and recovering the remainder in this description he however confines himself to the treatment of ordinary silver ore with less than 10 per cent of copper in the diagram a a represent two refining pots 4 ft in diameter and 3 ft in depth each capable of dissolving at one operation as much as 400 pounds of bullion the acid is stored in the cast iron reservoir b which is placed on a level sufficiently high to charge into a by gravitation and is composed of fresh concentrated acid mixed with the somewhat dilute acid regained from a previous operation after the bullion is fully dissolved all the acid still available is run from b into a a the temperature and strength are thereby reduced the fuming ceases any still undissolved copper sulphate dissolves and the gold settles in assuming that the settling of the gold takes place in a itself the author follows the practice of the united states mints in private refineries where refining is carried on continuously the settling may take place in an intermediate vessel and a a be at once recharged owing to the large amount of free acid present the temperature must fall considerably before the separation of silver sulphate commences and sufficient time may be allowed for settling if the intermediate vessel be judiciously arranged illustration separating the silver sulphatethe clarified solution is siphoned off the gold from a a into c which is an open cast iron pan say 8 ft by 4 ft and 1 ft deep it is supported by means of a flange in another larger pannot shown in the diagraminto which water may be admitted for cooling steam is blown into the acid solution still very hot as soon as c is filled the steam is introduced about 1 in below the surface of the liquid blowing perpendicularly downward from a nozzle made of lead pipe through an aperture 18 in in diameter under these circumstances the absorption of the steam is nearly perfect and takes place without any splashing the temperature rises with the increasing dilution and may be regulated by the less experienced by manipulating the cooling tank an actual boiling is not desired because it protracts unnecessarily the operation by the less perfect condensation of the steam no separation of silver sulphate occurs during this operation and consequently there is no clotting of the steam nozzle the large amount of free acid combined with the increase of temperature compensating for the diminution of the solubility of the sulphate by the dilution the most important point in this procedure is to know when to stop the admission of steam to determine this the operator takes a drop or two of the solution upon a cold iron plate by means of a glass rod and observes whether after cooling the sample congeals partly or wholly into a white mass of silver bisulphate or whether the silver separates as a monosulphate in detached yellow crystals leaving a mother liquor behind as soon as the latter point has been reached steam is shut off and the solution is allowed to crystallize cold water being admitted into the outer pan the operator may now be certain that the liquid will no longer congeal into a soft mass of silver bisulphate which on contact with water will disintegrate into powder obstinately retaining a large amount of free acid but the silver will separate as a monosulphate in hard and large yellow crystals retaining no acid and preserving their physical characteristics when thrown into water after cooling to say 80 f the silver sulphate will have coated the pan c about 1 in thick there will also be found a deposit of copper sulphate when the mother acid after having been used over and over again has been sufficiently saturated therewith lead sulphate separates in a cloud which however will hardly settle at this stage the whole operation just described which constitutes the most essential feature of the authors improvement upon his old process described in dr percys work is a short one as the acid requires by no means great dilution the steam has merely to furnish enough water to dilute the free acid present to say 62 b areometrical determination is of course not possible on account of the dissolved sulphates reducing the silver sulphate to fine silverthe mother acid is pumped from c to the reservoir b for this purpose an iron pipe connecting the top of b with a recess in the bottom of c the tank b is cast as a closed vessel with a manhole in the top which is ordinarily kept closed by an iron plate resting on a rubber packing the air is exhausted from b by a steam injector and the acid rises from c and enters b without coming in contact with any valves the volume of fresh commercial acid necessary for another dissolving operation say 800 pounds more or less for refining 800 pounds of bullion in a a is lifted from some other receptacle into b in the same manner the mixture of the two acids in b now represents the volume of acid to be employed for dissolving and settling the next charge of 800 pounds of bullion in a a in this reservoir b the cloud of lead sulphate mentioned above finds an opportunity for settling the crystals of silver sulphate are detached from c by an iron shovel and thrown into d d is a lead lined tank about 4 ft by 4 ft and 3 ft deep it is divided into two compartments by means of a horizontal perforated false bottom made of wood from the lower compartment a lead pipe discharges into the lead lined reservoir e warm distilled water is allowed to percolate the crystals until the usual ammonia test indicates that the copper sulphate has been sufficiently dissolved then the outflow is closed sheets of iron are thrown on and into the crystals the apparatus is filled with hot distilled water and steam is moderately admitted into the lower compartment ferrous sulphate is formed and in connection with the iron rapidly reduces the silver sulphate to the metallic state the reduced silver retaining the heavy compact character of the crystals when the reaction is completed as indicated by the chlorine test the liquid is discharged into e the iron sheets are removed and the silver is sweetened either in the same vessel d or in a special filtering vessel which rests on wheels and may be run directly to the hydraulic press the vat e is the great reservoir where all liquids holding silver sulphate in solution are collected for instance that from sweetening the gold and from washing the tools sheets of iron here precipitate all silver and copper and the resulting solution of ferrous sulphate is with the usual precautions discharged into the sewer occasionally when copper and silver have accumulated in e in sufficient amount the mass is thrown into d silver sulphate crystals are added and sheet copper is thrown in instead of sheet iron there results a hot neutral concentrated solution of copper sulphate which may be run at once into a crystallizing vat for the separation of commercial crystals of copper sulphate it will be readily understood of course that if there should be any advantage in manufacturing that commercial article besides the amount prepared as described which represents merely the copper contained in the bullion copper sheets may be regularly employed for reducing the silver sulphate in d the author trusts that the practical refiner will recognize that the manufacture of commercial copper sulphate is thus effected in a more rational and economical manner than by the present method of evaporating from 25 b to 35 b and of saturating by oxidized copper generally in a very incomplete manner the large amount of free acid left from the refining by the usual process however the sale of copper sulphate is but rarely so profitable that a refinery should not gladly dispense with that troublesome and bulky manufacture especially the government establishments which besides waste much valuable space with the crystallizing vats the great saving in sulphuric acid amounting to about 50 per cent of the present consumption has already been pointed out another advantage the author merely mentions namely the easier condensation of the sulphurous fumes in refineries situated in cities because the larger amount of acid available for dissolving greatly facilitates working and makes the usual frequent admission of air into the refining pot for the purpose of stirring and testing unnecessary the more air is excluded from the refining fumes the easier they can be condensed work may be carried on continuously the vessels c and d being empty by the time a new solution is finished in a a thus the plant shown in the diagram covering 26 ft by 16 ft allows the refining of 40000 ounces of fine silver in 24 hours that is four charges in a a of 800 pounds eachf gutzkow eng and mining j a case of drowning with resuscitation by fa burrall md new york as is usual at this season casualties from drowning are of frequent occurrence no class of emergencies is of a more startling character and i think that a history of the case which i now present offers some peculiar features and will not be without interest to physicians the accident which forms the subject of this paper occurred august 29 1890 at south harpswell casco bay me where i was passing my vacation at about 930 am m b an american aged eighteen the son of a fisherman a young man of steady habits and a good constitution with excellent muscular development and who had never before required the aid of a physician was seen by the residents of the village to fall forward from a skiff into the water and go down with uplifted hands i could not learn that he rose at all after the first submersion two men were standing near a bluff which overlooked the bay and after an instants delay in deciding that an accident had occurred they ran over an uneven and undulating pasture for a distance of two hundred and fifty paces to the shore one of them after a quick decision not to swim out to where the young man had fallen in and dive for him removed trousers and boots and waded out five yards to a boat which he drew into the shore and entered with his companion taking him to a yacht which lay two hundred and forty yards from the shore in the padlocked cabin of which was a boat hook the padlock was unfastened the boat hook taken and they proceeded by the boat directly to where the young man lay he was seen through the clear water lying at a depth of nine feet at the bottom of the bay on his back with upturned face and arms extended from the sides of the body he was quickly seized by the boat hook drawn head upward to the surface and with the inferior portion of the body hanging over the stern of the boat and the superior supported in the arms of his rescuer was rowed rapidly to the shore where he was rolled a few times and then placed prone upon a tub for further rolling i was told that much water came from his mouth meantime i had been sent for to where i was sitting one hundred and fiftyone yards from the scene and i arrived to find him apparently lifeless on the tub and to be addressed with the remark well doctor i suppose we are doing all that can be done i have given these details as from a study of them i was aided in deciding the time of submersion as well as the intervals which transpired before the intelligent use of remedies it is also remarkable that notwithstanding all which has been written about ready remedies for drowning no one present knew anything about them although living in a seafaring community i immediately directed that the patient should at once be placed upon the ground which was sloping and arranged his rubber boots under the back of the head and nape of the neck so that the head should be slightly elevated and the neck extended while the head was turned somewhat upon the side that fluids might drain from the mouth the day was clear and moderately warm respiration had ceased but no time was lost in commencing artificial respiration the patient had on a shirt and pantaloons which were immediately unbuttoned and made loose and placing myself at his head i used the silvester method because i was more accustomed to it than any other it seems to me more easy of application than any other and i have often found it of service in the asphyxia of the newly born the patients surface was cold there was extensive cyanosis and his expression was so changed that he was not recognized by his fellow townsmen but supposed to be a stranger the eyelids were closed the pupils contracted and the inferior maxilla firmly set against the superior one of the men who had brought him ashore had endeavored to find the hearts impulse by placing his hand upon the chest but was unable to detect any motion i continued the artificial respiration from 945 until 10 when i directed one of his rescuers to make pressure upon the ribs as i brought the arms down upon the chest this assistance made expiration more complete when nature resumed the respiratory act i am unable to say but the artificial breathing was continued in all its details for threequarters of an hour and then expiration was aided by pressure on the chest for half an hour longer friction upward was also applied to the lower extremities and the surface became warm about half an hour after the beginning of treatment about twenty minutes after ten two hypodermic syringefuls of brandy were administered but i did not repeat this since i think alcohol is likely to increase rather than diminish asphyxia if given in any considerable quantity a thermometer with the mercury shaken down below the scale at this time did not rise at 118 the pulse was 82 respiration 27 temperature 97 after a natural respiration had commenced the wet clothing was removed and the patient was placed in blankets ammonia was occasionally applied to the nostrils since although respiration had returned there was no sign of consciousness the natural respiration was at first attended by the expulsion of frothy fluid from the lips which gradually diminished and auscultation revealed the presence of a few pulmonary rales which also passed away there were efforts at vomiting and pallor succeeded cyanosis there were also clonic contractions of the flexors of the forearm the pupils dilated slightly at about one hour after beginning treatment unconsciousness was still profound and loud shouting into the ear elicited no response mustard sinapisms were applied to the prcordium and the faradic current to the spine coffee was also administered by a ready method which as a systematic procedure was i believe novel when i introduced it to the profession in the medical record in 1876 i take the liberty of referring to this since i think it is now sometimes overlooked it was described as follows a simple examination which any one can make of his own buccal cavity will show that posterior to the last molar teeth when the jaws are closed is an opening bounded by the molars the body of the superior and the ramus of the inferior maxilla if on either side the cheek is held well out from the jaw a pocket or gutter is formed into which fluids may be poured and they will pass into the mouth through the opening behind the molars as well as through the interstices between the teeth when in the mouth they tend to create a disposition to swallow and by this method a considerable quantity of liquid may be administered after i had worked with the patient in the open air for four and threequarter hours he was carried to a cottage near by and placed still unconscious in bed there had been an alvine evacuation during the time in which he lay in the blankets consciousness began to return in the early part of the following morning and with its advent it was discovered that the memory of everything which had occurred from half an hour previous to the accident up to the return of consciousness had been completely obliterated with this exception the convalescence was steady and uncomplicated and of about a weeks duration from a letter which i recently received from my patient i learned that the lapse of memory still remains my experience with this case has taught me that unless the data have been taken very accurately we cannot depend upon any statements as to the time of submersion in cases of drowning my first supposition was that my patient had been from thirteen to fifteen minutes under water but a careful investigation reduced the supposed time by onehalf this makes the time of submersion about six minutes and that which elapsed before the intelligent use of remedies about three minutes longer for a long time the opinion of sir benjamin brodie concerning the presence of water in the lungs of the drowned was accepted who says that the admission of water into the lungs is prevented by a spasm of the muscles of the glottis cannot however be doubted since we are unable to account for it in any other manner later experiments made by a committee of the royal medicochirurgical society of london demonstrated on the contrary that in drowned animals not only were all the air passages choked with frothy fluid more or less bloody but that both lungs were highly gorged with blood so that they were heavy dark colored and pitted on pressure and on being cut exuded an abundance of bloodtinged fluid with many air bubbles in it dr rl bowles1 also holds that the lungs of the drowned contain water and supports his views by a list of cases in his words these examples show very conclusively that in cases of drowning in man water does exist in the lungs that the water only very gradually and after a long time is effectually expelled and that it is absolutely impossible that any relief should be afforded in that way by the silvester method dr bowles believes that the method of dr marshall hall is superior to any other in this class of cases he thinks that on account of the immediate adoption and continued use of the pronolateral position this method is more to be trusted than any other for keeping the pharynx clear of obstruction it also empties the stomach and gradually clears the lungs of the watery and frothy fluids and will surely and gently introduce sufficient air at each inspiration to take the place of the fluid which has been expelled in the light of even my limited experience i cannot but feel that dr bowles opinion concerning the silvester method would admit of some modification this is often the case with very positive statements concerning medical matters in my own case the silvester method answered well but i was much impressed with dr bowles claims for the marshall hall method and should bear them in mind were i called upon to attend another case of drowning footnote 1 resuscitation of the apparently drowned by rl bowles md frcp medicochirurgical transactions vol lxxii 1889 i think it must be admitted that pulling the tongue forward as a means of opening the glottis which has become a standard treatment in asphyxia is unscientific and not warranted by the results of experiments made to determine its value2 footnote 2 dragging on the tongues tip would not affect its base or the epiglottis sufficiently to make it a praiseworthy procedure medicochirurgical transactions vol lxxii see also medical record april 4 1891 pulling out the tongue is a mistake since irritation of nerves of deglutition stops the diaphragmmedical times and gazetteer dr bowles also believes that the safety of the patient is most perfectly secured by keeping him on one side during the whole treatment one lung being thus kept quite free with the account of my case i have brought forward such views of other writers as it seemed to me would be of practical service and throw light on a subject which is of great importance since the yearly record of mortality from drowning is by no means inconsiderable i think however that a knowledge of what ought to be done in cases of drowning should be much more generally diffused than is the case at present it should be one of the items of school instruction since no one can tell when such knowledge may be of immense importance in saving life and the time lost in securing medical aid would involve a fatal result it is also very desirable that all doubt should be removed by the decision of competent medical authorities as to which ready method or methods are the best since there are several in the field with this should be decided what is the best means for securing patency of the air passages and in short a very careful revision of the treatment now recommended for drowning in order that there may be no doubt as to the course which should be adopted in such a serious emergencymedical record the story of the universe1 footnote 1 presidential address before the british association cardiff 1891 by dr william huggins the opening meeting of the british association was held in park hall cardiff august 18 where a large and brilliant audience assembled including in his richly trimmed official robes the marquis of bute who this year holds office as mayor of cardiff at the commencement of the proceedings sir frederick abel took the chair but this was only pro forma and in order that he might after a few complimentary sentences resign it to the presidentelect professor huggins the eminent astronomer who at once amid applause assumed the presidency and proceeded to deliver the opening address dr huggins said that the very remarkable discoveries in our knowledge of the heavens which had taken place during the past thirty yearsa period of amazing and everincreasing activity in all branches of sciencehad not passed unnoticed in the addresses of successive presidents still it seemed to him fitting that he should speak of those newer methods of astronomical research which had led to those discoveries and which had become possible by the introduction into the observatory since 1860 of the spectroscope and the modern photographic plate spectroscopic astronomy had become a distinct and acknowledged branch of the science possessing a large literature of its own and observatories specially devoted to it the more recent discovery of the gelatine dry plate had given a further great impetus to this modern side of astronomy and had opened a pathway into the unknown of which even an enthusiast thirty years ago would scarcely have dared to dream herschels theory it was now some thirty years since the spectroscope gave us for the first time certain knowledge of the nature of the heavenly bodies and revealed the fundamental fact that terrestrial matter is not peculiar to the solar system but is common to all the stars which are visible to us professor rowland had since shown us that if the whole earth were heated to the temperature of the sun its spectrum would resemble very closely the solar spectrum in the nebul the elder herschel saw portions of the fiery mist or shining fluid out of which the heavens and the earth had been slowly fashioned for a time this view of the nebul gave place to that which regarded them as external galaxiescosmical sand heaps too remote to be resolved into separate stars though indeed in 1858 mr herbert spencer showed that the observations of nebul up to that time were really in favor of an evolutional progress in 1864 he the speaker brought the spectroscope to bear upon them the bright lines which flashed upon the eye showed the source of the light to be glowing gas and so restored these bodies to what is probably their true place as an early stage of sidereal life at that early time our knowledge of stellar spectra was small for this reason partly and probably also under the undue influence of theological opinions then widely prevalent he unwisely wrote in his original paper in 1864 that in these objects we no longer have to do with a special modification of our own type of sun but find ourselves in presence of objects possessing a distinct and peculiar plan of structure two years later however in a lecture before this association he took a truer position our views of the universe he said are undergoing important changes let us wait for more facts with minds unfettered by any dogmatic theory and therefore free to receive the teaching whatever it may be of new observations the nebular hypothesis let them turn aside for a moment from the nebul in the sky to the conclusions to which philosophers had been irresistibly led by a consideration of the features of the solar system we had before us in the sun and planets obviously not a haphazard aggregation of bodies but a system resting upon a multitude of relations pointing to a common physical cause from these considerations kant and laplace formulated the nebular hypothesis resting it on gravitation alone for at that time the science of the conservation of energy was practically unknown these philosophers showed how on the supposition that the space now occupied by the solar system was once filled by a vaporous mass the formation of the sun and planets could be reasonably accounted for by a totally different method of reasoning modern science traced the solar system backward step by step to a similar state of things at the beginning according to helmholtz the suns heat was maintained by the contraction of his mass at the rate of about 220 feet a year whether at the present time the sun was getting hotter or colder we did not certainly know we could reason back to the time when the sun was sufficiently expanded to fill the whole space occupied by the solar system and was reduced to a great glowing nebula though mans life the life of the race perhaps was too short to give us direct evidence of any distinct stages of so august a process still the probability was great that the nebular hypothesis especially in the more precise form given to it by roche did represent broadly notwithstanding some difficulties the succession of events through which the sun and planets had passed illustration dr william huggins dcl lld president of the british association dr huggins is one of the most eminent astronomers of the present day and his spectroscopic researches on the celestial bodies have had the most important results he is a dcl of oxford lld of cambridge and phd of leyden dr huggins was born in 1824 and educated at the city of london school he continued his studies giving much of his time to experiments in natural philosophy and physical science in 1855 dr huggins erected a private observatory at his residence on tulse hill where he has carried out valuable prismatic researches with the spectroscopedaily graphic other speculations the nebular hypothesis of laplace required a rotating mass of fluid which at successive epochs became unstable from excess of motion and left behind rings or more probably perhaps lumps of matter from the equatorial regions to some thinkers was suggested a different view of things according to which it was not necessary to suppose that one part of the system gravitationally supported another the whole might consist of a congeries of discrete bodies even if these bodies were the ultimate molecules of matter the planets might have been formed by the gradual accretion of such discrete bodies on the view that the material of the condensing solar system consisted of separate particles or masses we had no longer the fluid pressure which was an essential part of laplaces theory faye in his theory of evolution from meteorites had to throw over his fundamental idea of the nebular hypothesis and formulated instead a different succession of events of which the outer planets were formed last a theory which had difficulties of its own professor george darwin had recently shown from an investigation of the mechanical conditions of a swarm of meteorites that on certain assumptions a meteoric swarm might behave as a coarse gas and in this way bring back the fluid pressure exercised by one part of the system on the other which was required by laplaces theory one chief assumption consisted in supposing that such inelastic bodies as meteoric stones might attain the effective elasticity of a high order which was necessary to the theory through the sudden volatilization of a part of their mass at an encounter by which what was virtually a violent explosive was introduced between the two colliding stones professor darwin was careful to point out that it must necessarily be obscure as to how a small mass of solid matter could take up a very large amount of energy in a small fraction of a second helmholtzs discovery the old view of the original matter of the nebul that it consisted of a fiery mist a tumultuous cloud instinct with fire and niter fell at once with the rise of the science of thermodynamics in 1854 helmholtz showed that the supposition of an original fiery condition of the nebulous stuff was unnecessary since in the mutual gravitation of widely separated matter we had a store of potential energy sufficient to generate the high temperature of the sun and stars we could scarcely go wrong in attributing the light of the nebul to the conversion of the gravitational energy of shrinkage into molecular motion the inquisitiveness of the human mind did not allow us to remain content with the interpretation of the present state of the cosmical masses but suggested the question what seest thou else in the dark backward and abysm of time what was the original state of things how had it come about that by the side of ageing worlds we had nebul in a relatively younger stage had any of them received their birth from dark suns which had collided into new life and so belonged to a second or later generation of the heavenly bodies looking backward during the short historic period there was no record of such an event still it would seem to be only through the collision of dark suns of which the number must be increasing that a temporary rejuvenescence of the heavens was possible and by such ebbings and flowings of stellar life that the inevitable end to which evolution in its apparently uncompensated progress was carrying us could even for a little be delayed we could not refuse to admit as possible such an origin for nebul in considering however the formation of the existing nebul we must bear in mind that in the part of the heavens within our ken the stars still in the early and middle stages of evolution exceeded greatly in number those which appeared to be in an advanced condition of condensation indeed we found some stars which might be regarded as not far advanced beyond the nebular condition it might be that the cosmical bodies which were still nebulous owed their later development to some conditions of the part of space where they occurred such as conceivably a greater original homogeneity in consequence of which condensation began less early in other parts of space condensation might have been still further delayed or even have not yet begun if light matter were suggested by the spectrum of these nebul it might be asked further as a pure speculation whether in them we were witnessing possibly a later condensation of the light matter which had been left behind at least in a relatively greater proportion after the first growth of worlds into which the heavier matter condensed though not without some entanglement of the lighter substances the wide extent and great diffuseness of this brightline nebulosity over a large part of the constellation of orion might be regarded perhaps as pointing in this direction the diffuse nebulous matter streaming round the pleiades might possibly be another instance though the character of its spectrum had not yet been ascertained the motions of the stars besides its more direct use in the chemical analysis of the heavenly bodies the spectroscope had given to us a great and unexpected power of advance along the lines of the older astronomy in the future a higher value might indeed be placed upon this indirect use of the spectroscope than upon its chemical revelations by no direct astronomical methods could motions of approach or of recession of the stars be even detected much less could they be measured a body coming directly toward us or going directly from us appeared to stand still in the case of the stars we could receive no assistance from change of size or of brightness the stars showed no true disks in our instruments and the nearest of them was so far off that if it were approaching us at the rate of a hundred miles in a second of time a whole century of such rapid approach would not do more than increase its brightness by the onefortieth part still it was formerly only too clear that so long as we were unable to ascertain directly those components of the stars motions which lay in the line of sight the speed and direction of the solar motion in space and many of the great problems of the constitution of the heavens must have remained more or less imperfectly known now the spectroscope had placed in our hands this power which though so essential had previously appeared almost in the nature of things to lie forever beyond our grasp it enabled us to measure directly and under favorable circumstances to within a mile per second or even less the speed of approach or of recession of a heavenly body this method of observation had the great advantage for the astronomer of being independent of the distance of the moving body and was therefore as applicable and as certain in the case of a body on the extreme confines of the visible universe so long as it was bright enough as in the case of a neighboring planet algol and spica by observations with the potsdam spectograph professor vogel found that the bright star of algol pulsated backward and forward in the visual direction in a period corresponding to the known variation of its light the explanation which had been suggested for the stars variability that it was partially eclipsed at regular intervals of 688 hours by a dark companion large enough to cut off nearly fivesixths of its light was therefore the true one the dark companion no longer able to hide itself by its obscureness was brought out into the light of direct observation by means of its gravitational effects seventeen hours before minimum algol was receding at the rate of about 24 miles a second while seventeen hours after minimum it was found to be approaching with a speed of about 28 miles from these data together with those of the variation of its light vogel found on the assumption that both stars have the same density that the companion nearly as large as the sun but with about onefourth his mass revolved with a velocity of about fiftyfive miles a second the bright star of about twice the size and mass moved about the common center of gravity with the speed of about 26 miles a second the system of the two stars which were about 3 millions of miles apart considered as a whole was approaching us with a velocity of 24 miles a second the great difference in luminosity of the two stars not less than fifty times suggested rather that they were in different stages of condensation and dissimilar in density it was obvious that if the orbit of a star with an obscure companion was inclined to the line of sight the companion would pass above or below the bright star and produce no variation of its light such systems might be numerous in the heavens in vogels photographs spica which was not variable by a small shifting of its lines revealed a backward and forward periodical pulsation due to orbital motion as the pair whirled round their common center of gravity the bright star was sometimes advancing at others receding they revolved in about four days each star moving with a velocity of about 56 miles a second in an orbit probably nearly circular and possessed a combined mass of rather more than two and onehalf times that of the sun taking the most probable value for the stars parallax the greatest angular separation of the stars would be far too small to be detected with the most powerful telescopes the value of photography referring to the new and great power which modern photography had put into the hands of the astronomer the president said that the modern silver bromide gelatine plate except for its grained texture met his needs at all points it possessed extreme sensitiveness it was always ready for use it could be placed in any position it could be exposed for hours lastly it did not need immediate development and for this reason could be exposed again to the same object on succeeding nights so as to make up by several installments as the weather might permit the total time of exposure which was deemed necessary without the assistance of photography however greatly the resources of genius might overcome the optical and mechanical difficulties of constructing large telescopes the astronomer would have to depend in the last resource upon his eye now we could not by the force of continued looking bring into view an object too feebly luminous to be seen at the first and keenest moment of vision but the feeblest light which fell upon the plate was not lost but taken in and stored up continuously each hour the plate gathered up 3600 times the light energy which it received during the first second it was by this power of accumulation that the photographic plate might be said to increase almost without limit though not in separating power the optical means at the disposal of the astronomer for the discovery or the observation of faint objects two examples two principal directions might be pointed out in which photography was of great service to the astronomer it enabled him within the comparatively short time of a single exposure to secure permanently with great exactness the relative positions of hundreds or even of thousands of stars or the minute features of nebul or other objects or the phenomena of a passing eclipse a task which by means of the eye and hand could only be accomplished if done at all after a very great expenditure of time and labor photography put it in the power of the astronomer to accomplish in the short span of his own life and so enter into their fruition great works which otherwise must have been passed on by him as a heritage of labor to succeeding generations the second great service which photography rendered was not simply an aid to the powers the astronomer already possessed on the contrary the plate by recording light waves which were both too small and too large to excite vision in the eye brought him into a new region of knowledge such as the infrared and the ultraviolet parts of the spectrum which must have remained forever unknown but for artificial help a photographic chart the present year would be memorable in astronomical history for the practical beginning of the photographic chart and catalogue of the heavens which took their origin in an international conference which met in paris in 1887 the decisions of the conference in their final form provided for the construction of a great chart with exposures corresponding to forty minutes exposure at paris which it was expected would reach down to stars of about the fourteenth magnitude as each plate was to be limited to four square degrees and as each star to avoid possible errors was to appear on two plates over 22000 photographs would be required a second set of plates for a catalogue was to be taken with a shorter exposure which would give stars to the eleventh magnitude only the plans were to be pushed on as actively a possible though as far as might be practicable plates for the chart were to be taken concurrently photographing the plates for the catalogue was but the first step in this work and only supplied the data for the elaborate measurements which would have to be made which were however less laborious than would be required for a similar catalogue without the aid of photography a delicate operation the determination of the distances of the fixed stars from the small apparent shift of their positions when viewed from widely separated positions of the earth in its orbit was one of the most refined operations of the observatory the great precision with which this minute angular quantity a fraction of a second only had to be measured was so delicate an operation with the ordinary micrometer though indeed it was with this instrument that the classical observations of sir robert ball were made that a special instrument in which the measures were made by moving the two halves of a divided object glass known as a heliometer had been pressed into this service and quite recently in the skillful hands of dr gill and dr elkin had largely increased our knowledge in this direction it was obvious that photography might be here of great service if we could rely upon measurements of photographs of the same stars taken at suitable intervals of time professor pritchard to whom was due the honor of having opened this new path aided by his assistants had proved by elaborate investigations that measures for parallax might be safely made upon photographic plates with of course the advantages of leisure and repetition and he had already by this method determined the parallax for twentyone stars with an accuracy not inferior to that of values previously obtained by purely astronomical methods photographic revelations the remarkable successes of astronomical photography which depended upon the plates power of accumulation of a very feeble light acting continuously through an exposure of several hours were worthy to be regarded as a new revelation the first chapter opened when in 1880 dr henry draper obtained a picture of the nebula of orion but a more important advance was made in 1883 when dr common by his photographs brought to our knowledge details and extensions of this nebula hitherto unknown a further disclosure took place in 1885 when the brothers henry showed for the first time in great detail the spiral nebulosity issuing from the bright star maia of the pleiades and shortly afterward nebulous streams about the other stars of this group in 1886 mr roberts by means of a photograph to which three hours exposure had been given showed the whole background of this group to be nebulous in the following year mr roberts more than doubled for us the great extension of the nebular region which surrounds the trapezium in the constellation of orion by his photographs of the great nebula in andromeda he had shown the true significance of the dark canals which had been seen by the eye they were in reality spaces between successive rings of bright matter which appeared nearly straight owing to the inclination in which they lay relatively to us these bright rings surrounded an undefined central luminous mass recent photographs by mr russell showed that the great rift in the milky way in argus which to the eye was void of stars was in reality uniformly covered with them the story of the heavens the heavens were richly but very irregularly inwrought with stars the brighter stars clustered into well known groups upon a background formed of an enlacement of streams and convoluted windings and intertwined spirals of fainter stars which became richer and more intricate in the irregularly rifted zone of the milky way we who formed part of the emblazonry could only see the design distorted and confused here crowded there scattered at another place superposed the groupings due to our position were mixed up with those which were real could we suppose that each luminous point had no relation to the others near it than the accidental neighborship of grains of sand upon the shore or of particles of the windblown dust of the desert surely every star from sirius and vega down to each grain of the light dust of the milky way had its present place in the heavenly pattern from the slow evolving of its past we saw a system of systems for the broad features of clusters and streams and spiral windings marking the general design were reproduced in every part the whole was in motion each point shifting its position by miles every second though from the august magnitude of their distances from us and from each other it was only by the accumulated movements of years or of generations that some small changes of relative position revealed themselves the work of the future the deciphering of this wonderfully intricate constitution of the heavens would be undoubtedly one of the chief astronomical works of the coming century the primary task of the suns motion in space together with the motions of the brighter stars had been already put well within our reach by the spectroscopic method of the measurement of star motions in the line of sight astronomy the oldest of the sciences had more than renewed her youth at no time in the past had she been so bright with unbounded aspirations and hopes never were her temples so numerous nor the crowd of her votaries so great the british astronomical association formed within the year numbered already about 600 members happy was the lot of those who were still on the eastern side of lifes meridian already alas the original founders of the newer methods were falling outkirchhoff angstrom darrest secchi draper becquerel but their places were more than filled the pace of the race was gaining but the goal was not and never would be in sight since the time of newton our knowledge of the phenomena of nature had wonderfully increased but man asked perhaps more earnestly now than in his days what was the ultimate reality behind the reality of the perceptions were they only the pebbles of the beach with which we had been playing did not the ocean of ultimate reality and truth lie beyond climatic changes in the southern hemisphere by cam taber having had occasion to cruise a considerable time over the southern ocean i have had my attention directed to its prevailing winds and currents and the way in which they affect its temperature and also to the iceworn appearance of its isolated lands it is now generally conceded that the lands situated in the high latitudes of the southern hemisphere have in the remote past been covered with ice sheets similar to the lands which lie within the antarctic circle the shores of southern chile from latitude 40 to cape horn show convincing evidence of having been overrun by heavy glaciers which scoured out the numerous deep channels that separate the patagonian coast from its islands the falkland islands and south georgia abound with deep friths new zealand and kerguelen land also exhibit the same evidence of having been iceladen regions and it is said that the southern lands of africa and australia show that ice accumulated at one time to a considerable extent on their shores at this date we find the southern ice sheets mostly confined to regions within the antarctic circle still the lands of chile south georgia and new zealand possess glaciers reaching the low lands which are probably growing in bulk for it appears that the antarctic cold is slowly on the increase and the reasons for its increase are the same as the causes which brought about the frigid period which overran with ice all lands situated in the high southern latitudes why there should be a slow increase of cold on this portion of the globe is because of the independent circulation of the waters of the southern ocean the strong westerly winds of the southern latitudes are constantly blowing the surface waters of the sea from west to east around the globe this causes an effectual barrier which the warm tropical currents cannot penetrate to any great extent for instance the tropical waters of the high ocean levels which lie abreast brazil in the atlantic and the east coast of africa in the indian ocean are not attracted far into the southern sea because the surface waters of the latter sea are blown by the westerly winds from west to east around the globe consequently the tropical waters moving southward are turned away by the prevailing winds and currents from entering the southern ocean thus the ice is accumulating on its lands and the temperature of its waters slowly falling through their contact with the increasing ice and such conditions will continue until the lands of the high southern latitudes are again covered with glaciers and a southern ice period perfected but while this gathering of ice is being brought about the antarctic continent now nearly covered with an ice sheet will through the extension of glaciers out into its shallow waters cover a larger area than now for where the waters are shoal the growing glaciers resting on a firm bottom will advance into the sea and this advancement will continue wherever the shallow waters extend especially will this be the case where the snowfall is great under such conditions it appears that the only extensive body of shallow water extending from the iceclad southern continent is the shoal channel which separates the south shetlands from cape horn which is a region of great snowfall therefore should the antarctic ice gain sufficient thickness to rest on the bottom of this shallow sea it would move into the cape horn channel and eventually close it the ice growth would not be entirely from the southern continent but also from lands in the region of cape horn thus the antarctic continent and south america would be connected by an isthmus of ice and consequently the independent circulation of the southern ocean arrested hence it will be seen that the westerly winds instead of blowing the surface waters of the southern ocean constantly around the globe as they are known to do today would instead blow the surface waters away from the easterly side of the iceformed isthmus which would cause a low sea level along its atlantic side and this low sea level would attract the tropical waters from their high level against brazil well into the southern seas and so wash the antarctic continent to the eastward of the south shetlands the tropical waters thus attracted southward would be cooler than the tropical waters of today owing to the great extension of cold in the southern latitudes still they would begin the slow process of raising the temperature of the southern ocean and would in time melt the ice in all southern lands not only the brazil currents would penetrate the southern seas as we have shown but also the waters from the high level of the tropical indian ocean which now pass down the mozambique channel would reach a much higher latitude than now the icemade isthmus uniting south america to the antarctic continent would on account of its location be the last body of ice to melt from the southern hemisphere it being situated to windward of the tropical currents and also in a region where the fall of snow is great yet it would eventually melt away and the independent circulation of the southern ocean again be established but it would require a long time for ice sheets to again form on southern lands because of the lack of icebergs to cool the southern waters still their temperature would gradually lower with the exclusion of the tropical waters and consequently ice would slowly gather on the antarctic lands the above theory thus briefly presented to account for the climatic changes of the high southern latitudes is in full accord with the simple workings of nature as carried on today and it is probable that the formation of continents and oceans as well as the earths motions in its path around the sun have met with little change since the cold era iced the lands of the high latitudes at an early age previous to the appearance of frigid periods the ocean waters of the high latitudes probably did not possess an independent circulation sufficient to lower the temperature so that glaciers could form this may have been owing to the shallow sea bottom south of cape horn having been above the surface of the water the channel having since been formed by a comparatively small change in the oceans level for while considering this subject it is well to keep in mind that whenever the western continent extended to the antarctic circle it prevented the independent circulation of the southern ocean waters consequently during such times ice periods could not have occurred in the southern hemisphere it will be noticed that according to the views given above the several theories which have been published to account for great climatic changes neglect to set forth the only efficacious methods through which nature works for conveying and withdrawing tropical heat sufficient to cause temperate and frigid periods in the high latitudes while lack of space forbids an explanation of the causes which would perfect an ice period in the northern hemisphere i will say that it could be mainly brought about through the independent circulation of the arctic waters which now largely prevent the tropical waters of the north atlantic from entering the arctic seas thus causing the accumulation of ice sheets on greenland but before a northern ice period can be perfected it seems that it will need to cooperate with a cold period in the southern hemisphere and in order to have the ice of a northern frigid period melt away it would require the assistance of a mild climate in the high southern latitudesscience ammonia in the majority of refrigerating and ice machines ammonia gas is the substance used for producing the refrigeration although there are other

uninflammable ammonia although composed of more than threefourths its weight of hydrogen is not inflammable in air on account of its combination with the nitrogen this combination it will be understood is not a simple mixture but the two gases are chemically combined forming a new substance which has characteristics and properties entirely different from either of the gases entering into its composition when taken alone or when simply mixed together without chemical combustion ammonia cannot be produced by the direct combination of these elements but it has been found that it is sometimes made or produced in a very extraordinary manner which goes to show that there is yet considerable to be learned in regard to the chemistry of ammonia animal or vegetable substances when putrefying or suffering destructive distillation almost invariably give rise to an abundant production of this substance the common method for the manufacture of ammonia is to produce it from the salt known as salammoniac salammoniac as a crystal is obtained in various ways principally from the ammoniacal liquor of gas works also from the condensed products of the distillation of bones and other animal refuse in the preparation of animal charcoal and which is of a highly alkaline nature this liquid is then treated with a slight excess of muriatic acid to neutralize the free alkali and at the same time the carbonates and sulphides are decomposed with the evolution of carbonic acid and sulphureted hydrogen all animal matter the meat bones etc contain considerable carbon while the nitrogen from which the ammonia is produced forms a smaller portion of the substance the object is then to get rid of the carbon and sulphur leaving the nitrogen to combine through chemical affinity with a portion of the hydrogen of the water the oxygen which is set free going to form the carbonic acid by combining with the carbon the liquor after being neutralized is evaporated to dryness leaving a crystallized salt containing a portion of tarry matter the salt is then purified by sublimation that is it is heated in a closed iron vessel until it is transformed into a gas which separates and leaves in a carbonized state all foreign substance after this gas is cooled it condenses and again forms crystals which are in a much purer condition if necessary to further purify it it is again sublimed the iron vessels in which the sublimation takes place are lined with clay and covered with lead the clay lining and lead covering are necessary for if the gas evolved during the process of sublimation came in contact with the iron surface the gas would be contaminated and the iron corroded sublimed salammoniac has a fibrous texture and is tough and difficult to powder it has a sharp salty taste and is soluble in two and a half parts of cold and in a much smaller quantity of hot water during the process of sublimation the ammonia is not decomposed but there are several ways in which the gas may be decomposed and a certain portion of it is decomposed in the ordinary use of it in refrigerating machines if electric sparks are passed through the gas it suffers decomposition the nitrogen and hydrogen then being in the condition of a simple mixture when decomposed in this manner the volume of the gas is doubled and the proportion is found to be three measures of hydrogen to one of nitrogen while the weight of the two constituents is in the proportion of three parts hydrogen to fourteen of nitrogen the ammonia gas may also be decomposed by passing through a red hot tube and the presence of heated iron causes a slight degree of decomposition this salammoniac is powdered and mixed with moist slaked lime and then gently heated in a flask when a large quantity of gaseous ammonia is disengaged the gas must be collected over mercury or by displacement the gas thus produced has a strong pungent odor as can easily be determined by any one working around the ammonia ice or refrigerating machines for as our friend otto luhr says it is the worst stuff i ever smelled in my life the gas is highly alkaline and combines readily with acids completely neutralizing them and the aqua ammonia is one of the best substances to put on a place burned by sulphuric acid as has been learned by those working with that substance for although aqua ammonia of full strength is highly corrosive and of itself will blister the flesh yet when used to neutralize the effect of a burn from sulphuric acid its great affinity for the acid prevents it from injuring the skin under such conditions the distilled gas such as has just been described is the anhydrous ammonia used in the compressor system of refrigeration while it is the aqua ammonia that is used in the absorption system of refrigeration aqua ammonia or liquor ammonia is formed by dissolving the ammonia gas in water one volume of water will dissolve seven hundred times its bulk of this gas and is then known as aqua ammonia in contradistinction to anhydrous ammonia the latter designating term meaning without water while the term aqua is the latin word for water anhydrous ammonia the gas may be reduced to the liquid form at ordinary temperatures when submitted to a pressure of about 95 pounds during the process of liquefaction the ammonia gives up a large amount of heat which if absorbed or radiated while the ammonia is in the liquid condition the gas when allowed to expand will absorb from its surroundings an amount of heat equal to that radiated producing a very great lowering of temperature it is this principle that is utilized in refrigeration and ice making in the absorption system where aqua ammonia is used the liquor is contained in a retort to which heat is applied by means of a steam coil and a great part of the gas which was held in solution by the water is expelled and carries with it a small amount of water or vapor this passes into a separator in the top of a condenser from which the water returns again to the retort the ammonia gas under considerable pressure passing into the coolers these are large receptacles in which the gas is permitted to expand by such expansion heat is absorbed and the temperature of the surroundings is lowered from the coolers the gas returns to the absorber from which it is pumped in liquid form into the retort to be again heated the gas expelled and the process repeated as the gas passes through the different processes being heated under pressure cooled expanded again more or less decomposition takes place presumably from a combination of a small portion of the nitrogen with vegetable animal or mineral matter that finds its way into the system such decomposition with the loss of nitrogen leaves a small portion of free hydrogen which is the gas that can be drawn from the top of the absorber ignited and burned the presence of hydrogen gas in the absorber is not necessarily detrimental to the effectiveness of the system but as hydrogen does not possess the qualities of absorbing heat in the same way and to the same extent as ammonia the presence of hydrogen makes the operation of the apparatus somewhat less efficientstationary engineer the refrigerating apparatus illustrated and described in the scientific american supplement of june 25 no 812 is substantially that patented by messrs erny subers hoos of

widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machinereadable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment many small donations 1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the irs the foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the united states compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements we do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance to send donations or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit wwwgutenbergorgdonate while we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate international donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the united states us laws alone swamp our small staff please check the project gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks online payments and credit card donations to donate please visit wwwgutenbergorgdonate section 5 general information about project gutenberg electronic works professor michael s hart was the originator of the project gutenberg concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone for forty years he produced and distributed project gutenberg ebooks with only a loose network of volunteer support project gutenberg ebooks are often created from several printed editions all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the us unless a copyright notice is included thus we do not necessarily keep ebooks in compliance with any particular paper edition most people start at our website which has the main pg search facility wwwgutenbergorg this website includes information about project gutenberg including how to make donations to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation how to help produce our new ebooks and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new ebooks
