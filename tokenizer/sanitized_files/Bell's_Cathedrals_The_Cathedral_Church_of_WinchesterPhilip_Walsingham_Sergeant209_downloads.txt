winchester cathedral from northwest end of close sb bolas co photo illustration with fifty illustrations london george bell sons 1899 first published jan 1898 second edition revised 1899 w h white and co limited riverside press edinburgh general preface this series of monographs has been planned to supply visitors to the great english cathedrals with accurate and well illustrated guidebooks at a popular price the aim of each writer has been to produce a work compiled with sufficient knowledge and scholarship to be of value to the student of archology and history and yet not too technical in language for the use of an ordinary visitor or tourist to specify all the authorities which have been made use of in each case would be difficult and tedious in this place but amongst the general sources of information which have been almost invariably found useful are1 the great county histories the value of which especially in questions of genealogy and local records is generally recognised 2 the numerous papers by experts which appear from time to time in the transactions of the antiquarian and archological societies 3 the important documents made accessible in the series issued by the master of the rolls 4 the wellknown works of britton and willis on the english cathedrals and 5 the very excellent series of handbooks to the cathedrals originated by the late mr john murray to which the reader may in most cases be referred for fuller detail especially in reference to the histories of the respective sees gleeson white ef strange editors of the series preface to first edition it would be useless to attempt to record all the sources of information to which it has been necessary to have recourse in preparing this short account of winchester cathedral and its history but i should like to acknowledge the main portion of the debt the proceedings of the archological institute of great britain in 1845 must of course take the first place for to williss paper every one must go who wishes to know the cathedral well brittons cathedrals browne williss survey of the cathedrals and woodwards history of hampshire with the more recent diocesan history of winchester by canon benham and the winchester cathedral records of various dates have been of great service an article in the builder of october 1 1892 and one on st cross in architecture for november 1896 must also be mentioned above all i am glad to be able to express my gratitude to one of the editors of this series mr gleeson white without whose assistance this account would never have been commenced the

our cathedral cities royal winchester has a secular history of the greatest importance which not only is almost inextricably interwoven with the ecclesiastical annals down to a comparatively recent date but should at times occupy the foremost position in the records of the place to attempt however to trace the story of the city as well as that of the cathedral would be to recapitulate the most important facts of the history of england during those centuries when winchester was its capital town its civic importance indeed was not dependent upon the cathedral alone for before the introduction of christianity into the island winchester was undoubtedly the principal place in the south of england the roman occupation though it seems a mere incident in its record lasted over three centuries about as long as from the reign of henry viii to that of queen victoria richard warner 1795 sums up the various names of winchester when he speaks of the metropolis of the british belg called by ptolemy and antoninus venta belgarum by the welch or modern britons caer gwent and by the old saxons wintancester by the latin writers wintonia collections for the history of hampshire even therefore when we read the account of the legendary king of the britons lucius founding a great church at winchester in ad 164 we do not touch the source of its fame nor have we discovered the record of the first building devoted to religious worship on the site of the present cathedral how far certain references to early pagan temples may be trusted does not here concern us but at christchurch priory some thirtyfive miles to the southwest in the same diocese bones supposed to be those of sacrificial birds have been exhumed on the site of its church there was however a relapse into paganism after the first dedication of the christian building so that there can be no certainty about the date of such discoveries on the authority of vigilantius de basilica petri ie at wynton or winchester quoted by rudborne in anglia sacra john of exeter and other writers we have it that a great church was rebuilt from its foundations at caergwent by lucius after his conversion in ad 164 and that he erected also smaller buildings with an oratory refectory and dormitory for the temporary abode of the monks until the monastery itself should be completed quotations from another lost author moracius provide us with the dimensions of this edifice the length being variously given as 209 and 200 passus the breadth as 80 and 130 while the tower was 92 passus in height this church it was said was dedicated to s saviour in november 169 and endowed with property formerly held by the pagan priests the site of the monastery to the east of the church was 100 passus in length toward the old temple of concord and 40 in breadth to the new temple of apollo the north position was 160 in length and 98 in breadth to the west of the church it was 90 in length and 100 in breadth to the south 405 in length and 580 in breadth willis from whom the above dimensions are quoted does not attempt to reconcile the figures except in so far as he suggests pedes for passus substituting one foot for five during the persecution of the christians by diocletian in ad 266 the buildings were destroyed and the new church dedicated to s amphibalus who was said to be one of the martyrs in that persecution was not so large as its predecessor in writers of the period we find occasional references to the vetus coenobium or old monastery at winchester the new building was not destined to remain long undisturbed in the service for which it was intended for when cerdic king of the west saxons was crowned at winchester and the pagans once more gained the ascendancy the monks were slaughtered and the church devoted to other rites remained a temple of dagon from 516 to 635 in the latter year s birinus in pursuance of his mission from honorius to scatter the seeds of the holy faith in those farthest inland territories of the english which no teacher had yet visited converted king cynegils to christianity this king intended to erect a great new church and with that end in view destroyed the desecrated building and granted the law for seven miles round to the monks whom he destined to take possession of the new building he died however within six years of his conversion and was buried before the altar of the partlyerected church his son cenwalh therefore completed the building which s birinus dedicated to christ in honour of the holy and indivisible trinity birinus was followed by aegelberht afterwards bishop of paris who resigned in 662 wina who died as bishop of london ejected in 666 and eleutherius who died in 676 so far the see was not at winchester but was temporarily placed at dorchester in oxfordshire under hedda the fourth successor of s birinus the seat was at last moved to winchester in accordance with the intention of the royal founder and at the same time the body of the saint which had hitherto rested at dorchester was removed to the cathedral city king cenwalh himself also on his death was buried in the building which he had completed practically nothing is known of the actual saxon building and the very legends are scanty we learn that the city was ravaged by the danes two years after the death of s swithun but the cathedral itself appears fortunately to have escaped damage the bishopric of athelwold commencing with his consecration by dunstan on november 29 ad 963 has more importance in the history of the cathedral than that of his immediate predecessors he was chosen by king edgar to undertake the work of a new monastery in which the king took such pleasure that he is said to have measured the foundations himself this work carried out at winchester by athelwold is described at great length in a latin poem by wolstan no doubt the florid eulogy of the poem is open to grave suspicion where it concerns the details of the building but even when we make full allowance for poetic exaggeration the church appears certainly to have been a large and important one the poem in its first form is reproduced in mabillons version of wolstans life of s athelwold but in its entirety it consists of an epistle of over 300 lines to bishop elphege athelwolds successor some passages deserve quotation he built says wolstan all these dwelling places with strong walls he covered them with roofs and clothed them with beauty he repaired the courts of the old temple with lofty walls and new roofs and strengthened it at the north and south sides with solid aisles and various arches he added also many chapels with sacred altars which distract attention from the threshold of the church so that the stranger walking in the courts is at a loss where to turn seeing on all sides doors open to him without a certain path he stands with wondering eyes until some experienced guide conducts him to the portals of the farthest vestibule here marvelling he crosses himself and knows not how to quit so dazzling is the construction and so brilliant the variety of the fabric that sustains this ancient church which that devout father himself strengthened roofed endowed and dedicated later wolstan speaks of athelwolds addition of secret crypts of such organs that the like were never seen of a sparkling tower reflecting from heaven the suns first rays with at its top a rod with golden balls and a mighty golden cock which as it turns boldly sets its face to every wind that blows more might be quoted but it is sufficient here to refer those interested in the matter either to the chronicle itself or to willis in the proceedings of the architectural institute for 1845 though wolstan thus describes athelwolds undertaking at great length it does not appear that the bishop actually did more than commence the restoration of the original buildings for his successor is exhorted in the letter to carry out athelwolds design the chronicler rudborne makes mention only of the dedication of a minster in honour of the apostles peter and paul in the presence of king aethelred archbishop dunstan and eight other bishops on october 20 980 ad john of exeter ascribes to athelwold the entire rebuilding of the cathedral but the winchester annalist does not mention athelwolds great works from athelwolds death to the succession of walkelin the history of the cathedral is little more than a record of its bishops but with walkelin we reach a very important epoch in its existence in 1079 the winchester annals relate this bishop began to rebuild the cathedral from its very foundations as was commonly done by the norman ecclesiastics of the time according to this account it was in 1086 that the king granted walkelin for the completion of his new building as much wood from the forest of hempage three miles distant from the city on the alresford road as he could cut in four days and nights walkelin collected all the men he could and within the given time removed the whole forest the king passing its site cried am i bewitched or have i taken leave of my senses but the bishop when he heard of his anger pleaded to be allowed to resign the see if he might but keep the chaplaincy and the kings favour at this william relented saying i was as much too liberal in my grant as you were too greedy in availing yourself of it willis in 1093 the new church was formally consecrated and on april 8 in the presence of almost all the bishops and abbots of england the monks came with the highest exultation and glory from the old minster to the new one on the feast of s swithun they went in procession from the new minster to the old one and brought thence s swithuns shrine and placed it with honour in the new buildings and on the following day bishop walkelins men first began to pull down the old minster and before the end of the year they demolished the whole of it with the exception of one apse and the high altar when the old high altar was pulled down we are told the relics of many saints were found the cathedral as walkelin designed it was for the most part so strong that its core and much of its actual work remains to this day but the central tower lacked the stability of the rest for on october 7 1107 during the vacancy which occurred after walkelins death it fell the monkish chroniclers attributed the fall to the fact that william rufus who all his life had been profane and sensual and had expired without the christian viaticum rudborne was interred beneath it in 1100 william of malmesbury however with a degree of incredulity rare in his days says it may have been that it would have fallen in any case through imperfect construction he describes the burial thusa few countrymen conveyed the body placed on a cart to the cathedral of winchester the blood dripping from it all the way here it was committed to the ground within the tower attended by many of the nobility but lamented by few the next year the tower fell though i forbear to mention the different opinions on this subject lest i should seem to assent too readily to unsupported trifles after walkelins death the history of the building is lost sight of for some time owing to the continual disturbances which all england was undergoing with de lucys accession however in 1189 considerable additions were made to the cathedral in the form of the early english retrochoir of which the details are given later in this volume de lucys work it has been pointed out was carried out in such a way as to leave the norman building undisturbed as long as it was practicable to do so the circular apse being left in situ until the new external walls had been erected while the presbytery itself was not touched until the decorated period set in de lucy would doubtless have made further alterations but for his death in 1204 as it was two years before that event he instituted a confraternity to carry on his work for the space of five years and to this body is due some of the work which is attributed loosely to him it was during de lucys tenure of winchester that richard was recrowned by the archbishop of canterbury after his return from captivity he passed the night before at s swithuns priory and was brought thence in the morning to the cathedral clothed in his royal robes with the crown upon his head holding in his right hand a royal sceptre which terminated in a cross and in his left hand a golden wand with a figure of a dove at the top of it being conducted on the right hand by his chancellor the bishop of ely and on the left by the bishop of london roger de hoveden the bishop of winchester himself does not seem to have been present probably on account of a dispute with the king another period of disturbance follows the comparatively quiet rule of bishop de lucy and it is not until we reach 1346 that we come to a fresh outburst of architectural zeal on the part of the incumbents of winchester but edingdon and still more his successor wykeham left very lasting monuments of their occupancy at winchester it must not be forgotten that while to wykeham is due the credit of most of the actual transformation of the building edingdon must have first conceived however vaguely the design edingdons attachment to winchester is well illustrated by his quaint reason for refusing the offer of canterbury if canterbury is the higher rack winchester is the better manger he is indeed charged with having left a considerable debt on the building since his successor seems to have recovered a large sum from his executors who had also to compensate wykeham for large numbers of cattle which had disappeared from the various farms of the bishopric yet it appears from edingdons own will that he began rebuilding the nave and left money for the continuation of the work wykeham as we shall see had already a reputation for architectural skill when first introduced to edward iii and this reputation stood him in good stead in the matter of preferment when he was elected to winchester he found the bishops palaces of farnham wolvesey waltham and southwark in a very dilapidated condition and he set these in order before he turned his attention to anything else new college oxford and winchester college practically occupied him up to 1393 whilst his work in the cathedral was really the last great undertaking of his life inasmuch as it was not finished at the time of his death the actual method of wykehams transformation of the interior is described more fully elsewhere and we will not therefore do more than quote a few words from willis on the work done the old norman cathedral was cast nearly throughout its length and breadth into a new form the double tier of arches in its peristyle was turned into one by the removal of the lower arch and clothed with caen casings in the perpendicular style the old wooden ceilings were replaced with stone vaultings enriched with elegant carvings and cognizances scarcely less than a total rebuilding is involved in this hazardous and expensive operation carried on during ten years with a systematic order worthy of remark and imitation judging from the provision of his will of the expenditure for the last year and a half the cost of this great work to the bishop in present money cannot be estimated at less than 200000 wykehams successor beaufort was far less a bishop of winchester than an english statesman his contributions to the architecture of his see are very small he did indeed so add to the hospital of st cross as to make it almost a new foundation but in the cathedral he only left one monument though this milner styles the most elegant and finished chantry in the kingdom lying on the south side of the retrochoir waynflete who followed him left another fine chantry in a corresponding position to the north under bishops peter courtenay and thomas langton the latter of whom has his chapel at the east end next the lady chapel considerable additions were made to the architecture of the cathedral though most of the credit is due to the priors hunton and silkstede who seem to have been chiefly responsible for the new work this included a prolongation of de lucys lady chapel carried out in all probability between the years 1470 and 1524 and the erection of the present side aisles of the presbytery in place of the original norman aisles in the latter year 1524 the side screens of the presbytery were added by bishop fox whose motto can be read on them the work of fox whose chapel is behind the reredos to the south began in 1510 and was carried out under early renaissance influence he found the choir and presbytery converted to a great extent to the decorated style though the norman aisles remained he completed the transformation adding the abovementioned screens together with a wooden vaulting he would probably have also replaced with his own work de lucys additions at the east end and the norman transepts had he but had the time this however he did not live long enough to do for he died in 1528 roughly speaking his work lies between the transepts and the early english east end the reformation period did not benefit much to the architectural features of winchester cathedral while it most certainly did them harm the bones of s swithun says woodward were doubtless lost at the reformation when his costly shrine was taken from the feretory where it stood so long and destroyed the period was now at hand when many seem to have considered it a religious duty to destroy monuments or at least deface them and winchester though it suffered less than many churches by no means escaped damage under stephen gardiner however no great evil befell the building gardiners own chantry behind the reredos commemorates his connection with the cathedral and distinctly illustrates the inferior taste of his day when compared with the earlier tombs about him though it might easily have been far worse the puritans maltreated it on other grounds than those of taste it is to be feared it was during bishop gardiners tenure of the see that philip of spain and mary were married at winchester contemporary records by a spaniard in philips suite and by an english observer of the same date recently revealed to us by mr martin as hume set forth the story of the marriage most vividly the king arrived from southampton in a storm of rain and donned a black velvet surcoat covered with gold bugles and a suit of white velvet trimmed in the same way and thus he entered passing the usual redclothed kneeling aldermen with gold keys on cushions and then to the grand cathedral which impressed the spaniards with wonder and above all to find that mass was as solemnly sung there as at toledo a little crowd of mitred bishops stood at the great west door crosses raised and censers swinging and in solemn procession to the high altar under a velvet canopy they led the man whom they looked upon as gods chosen instrument to permanently restore their faith in england two days after the wedding took place great attention is paid to the clothes by both english and spanish narrators and the ceremony and dresses were very magnificent the queens ladies looked more like celestial angels than mortal creatures the queen we are told blazed with jewels to such an extent that the eye was blinded as it looked upon her her dress was of black velvet flashing with gems and a splendid mantle of cloth of gold fell from her shoulders but through the mass that followed the marriage service she never took her eyes off the crucifix upon which they were devoutly fixed the marriage took place in the july of 1554 and the chair used by queen mary is now standing in bishop langtons chapel illustration old view of the cathedral looking southwards some stormy years at the end of gardiners interrupted episcopacy and during the rule of his immediate successors did not much affect winchester externally but under robert horne the whole diocese suffered terribly through the puritanical views of its bishop the norman chapterhouse was pulled down part of the lead on the cathedral roof was stripped off and stained glass architectural decorations etc throughout the neighbourhood were ruthlessly destroyed however after a short period of comparative peace far worse had yet to come under james i and during the early part of the reign of charles i little happened to the building beyond the institution of curles passage through the buttress at the southern end of the cathedral with its quaint inscription on the western wall the great rebellion as was only to be expected brought winchester into the utmost peril the important situation of the town in the south of england caused it to become the centre of much hard fighting sir william waller whom winchester has no cause to remember with affection came very near to destroying the interior of the cathedral entirely his troops marched right up the nave in full war equipment some even being mounted tombs were defaced relics scattered statues mutilated stained glass smashed and the more portable objects carried out into the streets it is difficult to estimate with any exactitude what was the whole extent of the damage done but we have sufficient testimony in the broken figures empty niches etc to see that it was great one highly creditable incident in the midst of the general disgrace has been recordednamely the preservation from insult of wykehams chantry this was the work of a colonel fiennes who had been educated at wykehams college at winchester the protests of the inhabitants seem to have finally induced waller to call off his fanatical troops from their work of destruction and violation what might have happened to the cathedral had this not been done it is quite impossible to imagine of the brass torn from the violated monuments in 1644 might have been built a house as strong as the brazen towers of old romances ryvess mercurius rusticus quoted by milner here the architectural history of winchester cathedral practically ends we find tombs and memorial brasses of all dates but until the modern restorations nothing of importance affected the actual appearance of the church among the few examples of jacobean work to be seen within the nave pulpit can hardly be classed since it was brought from new college chapel at oxford as late as 1884 the two statues of james i and charles i by the west door are the work of hubert le sueur who came to england in 1628 the urns which were supposed in the last century to decorate the reredos have long ago been removed as has also the gilt jacobean canopy which formerly disfigured the centre of this screen but benjamin wests raising of lazarus still remains above the altar this centurys work in the cathedral is not very formidable in its extent all of it is mentioned elsewhere in this book and it is sufficient here to say that the erection of sir g scotts choirscreen and the restoration of the reredos are the most noticeable modern features though the latter was carried out on the old lines as nearly as was thought advisable sir g scotts additions to winchester have by no means given universal satisfaction severe language having been applied to them by more than one expert the most recent alterations have consisted chiefly of a very necessary though costly strengthening of the nave roof this work is of course invisible from the ground level but can be reached from the stair in the south transept a repair of the organ has also been provided for and new glass has been inserted in the large south window of the lady chapel in memory of bishop thorold illustration monument to bishop ethelmar from carters ancient architecture of england chapter ii the cathedral building and close before any detailed consideration of the architecture of the cathedral it is well to be clear as to the various dates of the chief parts but it must here be remembered that practically in every instance the now existing portions replaced still earlier structures on the same site mention has been made already of the changes from the original building to the one commenced in the eleventh century in 1079 bishop walkelin laid the foundations of a great norman church of which the transepts the outer face of the south nave wall the core of the nave itself the crypts and a portion of the base of the west front are still existing walkelins work was completed in fourteen years just before the end of 1093 the tower fell in 1107 but was rebuilt soon afterwards in the form which we now see it bishop de lucys work which came next in date 11891204 includes the chapel of the guardian angels flanking the lady chapel at the northeast end of the cathedral and the corresponding chapel on the southeast which afterwards became the chantry of bishop langton the piers of the presbytery probably date from about 1320 the west front was rebuilt in edingdons time 13451366 and a small part of the reconstruction of the nave the first two bays of the north aisle and a bay of the south are generally attributed to him the great remodelling of the nave the outer walls of the presbytery and the continuation of the lady chapel range in date of completion from the end of the fourteenth to the sixteenth century so much however of each period has been altered and often modified almost beyond recognition by later additions that it is impossible to make more than a rough guess at the age of the various portions the work of wykeham and his successors is so important that it must be left until we reach it in its proper place the ground covered by the actual building is one and a half acres in extent the close is fine and extensive and is surrounded by a high and stout wall which marks the limits of the old benedictine monastery the houses within the close are of widely different dates from the early english period to recent years they comprise the official residences of the dean and the canons together with some private houses the changes made from time to time in the distribution of the ground have involved the disappearance of the old priory buildings and it is not possible to trace with certainty their original form the laying out of the close has concealed the ground plan of the cloisters which once adjoined the cathedral what is now called by the name is the passage between the south transept and the former chapterhouse which was pulled down in 1570 by the destructive bishop horne in order it is said that the lead in the roof might be sold five extremely fine early norman arches which were once part of the chapterhouse still remain and may be seen in a line with the end of the slype beyond the south transept some traces of small arches on what is now the extreme outer wall of the transept mark where arcading once ran along the inner wall of the chapterhouse no vestige of the roof remains the slype is a passage which was cut through the southern buttress by bishop curle to put a stop to the constant use of the nave and south aisle as a thoroughfare by the townspeople the anagrams on the walls commemorate the purpose of the passage the first on the western arch reading ill prec ac ator h ambula vi and that over the eastern arch acr s ill ch s a it a oro1 erv s ist f in

aspect revealed to the eye illustration southern side of cathedral from deanery garden sb bolas co photo the exteriorit would be difficult to deny that the exterior of winchester cathedral is disappointing and few are likely to echo the opinion of an overzealous admirer of the building who said that the longer one looks at it the more one feels the low central tower to be the only kind that would suit the huge proportions of the building on the contrary it may be said that it is impossible to look at winchester without a feeling of regret that the superb mass of the great fabric the largest medival church in england since the destruction of old s pauls is not crowned by a loftier central tower there is a legend to the effect that there were seven towers in the original designthe central one two at the west end and one at each angle of the transepts and this seems to be supported by the solid character of some of the piers in the transepts yet despite the rather ungraceful outline of the whole building when its mere size is realised it gradually asserts its importance and incontrovertibly proves its right to be considered one of the very finest structures in england it will not be out of place to quote a short criticism which sums up the external qualities of the cathedral in a concise waywith the exception of portions of the late work in the presbytery the exterior of winchester is severe in treatment and plain wallspace plays an important part in the design plain parapets and simply treated pinnacles characterise the work of the nave the norman transepts are externally but little altered except by the insertion of decorated windows to give more light to the altars in their eastern aisles and de lucys work eastwards is compared with some work of its date simple in the extreme rather more elaboration was bestowed on the design of the new eastern bay of the lady chapel by prior silkstede and bishop courtenay but taken as a whole winchester has one of the simplest exteriors for its size and importance in the country winchester cathedral in the builder for october 1892 the groundplan of winchester cathedral is in the form of a plain latin cross hardly broken in its outline save by the perpendicular prolongation of the lady chapel at the east end but simple as is the plan the great length of the church to use the words of fergusson is pleasingly broken by the bold projection of its transepts which here extend as usual in england three bays beyond the aisles their section being the same width as that of the nave the width of the nave with the aisles is 88 feet while the transepts measure from east to west 81 feet the total length has already been given as 556 and the width from north to south across the transepts is 230 feet the altitude of the walls is 75 feet which is a foot less than at peterborough though three more than at ely the west front the work of bishop edingdon has been roughly handled by its critics though britton calls it a fine specimen of perpendicular architecture the original norman work demolished by edingdon was as excavations have proved forty feet in advance of the present faade to judge by accounts of the destroyed portions the west front in its earlier state must have been far more imposing than it is at present for not only is it now commonplace in mass but even the detail has no particular charm to atone for the change the whole of this work appears so thoroughly perpendicular in character that it has been questioned whether at such an early date as that to which it is assigned the style can have been so far developed woodward indeed though attributing to edingdon the walls and the principal part of the west end declares the tracery the fronts of the porches and much of the panelling to be later but a comparison of winchester with another church undoubtedly built by this bishop at his native town of edingdon in wiltshire supports the tradition which credits him with its erection besides this evidence we have additional proof in the fact that he left by his will certain property to be devoted to the completion of the nave late though his work may appear at first sight yet when it is closely examined and compared with wykehams work the difference is very apparent illustration the west front winchester cathedral sb bolas co photo the whole western faade with its three bays is wanting in greatness and its effect may be said to be that of a large parish church rather than a cathedral not only do we miss the western towers which are so often the most striking feature of an english west front but the screen which masks the lower storey lacks the richness which distinguishes a somewhat similar feature at exeter the curiously poor appearance notwithstanding its huge size of the great west window is perhaps chiefly responsible for the want of dignity in the whole nor is there to redeem this any delicate fancy in the tracery the merest stone grating willis terms the window and though from so warm a panegyrist of the church this seems a severe criticism no one can traverse his opinion by way of further proof that the west front was edingdons work willis points out that while in wykehams panels the masonry itself is carefully finished and the same stones used for the ground of the panel and its mouldings in edingdons work the monials and tracery alone exhibit good masonry the panels being filled with rough ashlar by other tests too technical to quote here the same critic makes it clear that the west front with two compartments of the nave on the north and one to the south must be attributed to edingdon though he probably did not finish the gable and turrets which seem to be the work of wykeham the present state shows a gable rising in the centre flanked by octagonal pinnacle turrets on the apex of this gable is a canopied finial containing a niche wherein now stands a figure of william of wykeham the original statue which was supposed to represent s swithun having been removed to the feretory when the west front was restored in 1860 at a cost of 3000 the triangle of the gable is filled with tracery the lower part of the central panels in which serve as a smaller squareheaded sixlight window above the parapet which crosses at the head of the great ninelight window buttresses assist in supporting the two towers and lesser ones project to hide the sides of the porch which pierced by three doorways and crowned by a parapet extends along the whole lower storey across the nave and both aisles above the screen the pitched roofs of aisles may be seen the bays containing the side windows of four lights each accord in style with the large central one having also wall tracery in panels over the comparatively small surface of unpierced wall the screen itself has three deeplyrecessed portals with pointed arches and a large canopied empty niche on each side of the main entrance the central doorway is divided by a clustered shaft where from spring two cinquefoil arches the recessed portal has a groined roof with an arcade of cusped arches on the main west wall broken by the doorways which give admission to the nave a pierced balcony of simple design crowns the whole of the screen and forms a gallery which is said to have been used for bestowing episcopal benedictions to the people outside the cathedral on festival days the excavations which brought to light the old foundations of the original west front showed a wall of 128 feet from north to south and 12 feet thick with returns at each end of the same thickness 60 feet in length at their eastern ends the walls again turn in at right angles and meet the present side aisles at 17 feet from each corner within the parallelogram thus partially traced two other walls run from east to west at a distance of 36 feet from each other in a garden adjoining the west end of the cathedral at the time when these observations were made part of the southwest angle of the walls still remained indications of the western towers were apparent and willis suggests that they were probably either unfinished or in a threatening condition so that edingdon demolished them even as at gloucester the western towers of the cathedral were removed and the faade was replaced by a perpendicular west front at the beginning of the fifteenth century illustration edingdons windows in northwest bays north west bay winchester cathedral hp clifford from a drawing by hp clifford the original west front may very probably have been similar to that of lincoln cathedral unornamental says a writer in architecture save for some interlacing arches and dwarf blind arcades and with no windows to reflect the setting sun or to light the cavernous interior the two westernmost bays of the north side are due to edingdon and we get here well contrasted the work of edingdon and of wykeham in williss plan the difference can be clearly seen the two windows to the right are heavier lower and broader and display much deeper exterior mouldings with a most cavernous and gloomy appearance while the window on the left hand is much narrower and lighter the lefthand buttress is like the others on the north side of the church whereas the other three are different from it and from one another that on the extreme right together with its pinnacle being apparently just as edingdon left it the pinnacles and upper setoff of the two centre buttresses in the figure were added by wykeham to edingdons underwork the mouldings of wykehams windows are more elaborate than those of edingdons where the tracery is similar to that of the west window of the bays on the north side the nine next to edingdons two together with the three beyond the northern transept are wykehams work as are the three bays beyond the transept on the southern side and the extension of the lady chapel edingdon claims beside what has been already mentioned one bay on the south next the west front de lucys work consists of the three easterly bays on either side and part of the lady chapel exterior the rest of the bays are norman and the prevailing note is simplicity not to say rudeness the south side of the nave is almost devoid of decoration the bays being merely divided by flat buttresses which do not reach below the bottoms of the aisle windows the eleven windows in the clerestory above are all alike divided only by flat buttresses aisle and clerestory both show a plain parapet and corbels the bold buttresses on the north side with their panelled and crocketted pinnacles save it from the monotony of the south side which however was once greatly concealed by cloisters and convent buildings and is even now far more enclosed than the northern side the low central tower the coping of which is only 35 feet above the ridge of the transept roof is norman though as explained before of later date than the transepts it is of a simple square form 150 feet high by 50 wide and is divided by a string course into two storeys the lower of which is plain with small roundheaded windows the larger upper storey has on each side three narrow roundheaded windows which form a kind of arcade round the upper part of the tower surmounted by a zigzag string course at the angles are engaged shafts the massive manner in which the tower was rebuilt in the eleventh century can be better appreciated from within when we come to the piers which support it the building has been said to prove that the normans of the period were still bad masons and imperfectly acquainted with the principles of construction the masses of masonry employed showing an enormous waste of both labour and materials but the architects at any rate gained their end since the tower has stood to the present day the strength of the original norman work indeed is so great that for all the 250 feet of nave no flyingbuttresses were required to support the later vaulting the gables of the transepts are not so high as those of the nave but the clerestory parapets are on the same level the side aisles are much lower than those in the nave or the presbytery the parapets are plain over a series of small arches supported by corbels except that in the eastern aisle of the south transept the parapet rests on plain corbels and above the western clerestory of the other transept is a cornice with perpendicular bosses in this clerestory again the buttresses are perpendicular whereas otherwise throughout the transepts they are flat norman over the eastern aisle of the north there is no cornice or corbel the parapet says woodward with no more than a watertable under it is carried across the gable of the north transept so as to form an alura above the buttress in front of the circular window there the perpendicular rosewindow in the northern gable cannot now be seen from the interior being hidden by the transept ceiling but in the illustration from britton on page 59 it is visible the corresponding gable on the south shows panelling with interlacing norman arches but there are only two narrow lights many symptoms show that square towers were to have been erected flanking the transept gables there is an unfinished turret at the northeast corner of the north transept while the springing of an arcade and the generally incomplete appearance prove that a side tower was intended the other three extreme angles of the transepts also bear out this view the width from east to west of the transepts is enormous as compared with the height of the central tower above it rather looks from the presence barely perceptible from outside of the westernmost windows of the presbytery aisles as if those who carried on wykehams work had meant to reduce this great width and give more importance to the presbytery and retrochoir externally it is certain at any rate that the norman transepts narrowly escaped a complete transformation that on the north side of the cathedral shows very considerable alterations in the majority of its windows from the old norman pattern a builtup doorway may be noticed under the first window from the west of this transept the exterior of the presbytery has only three compartments on each side but in each there are four lights in aisle and clerestory alike the windows are of the wykeham pattern though probably a little later in date than his work the buttresses which rise above the aisle roof culminate in square panelled pinnacles surmounted by crocketted ogee canopies from these buttresses spring graceful flyingbuttresses with pierced spandrels running to the clerestory walls on the northern side the plain parapet has over it a pierced battlement the east end as it now stands is some 110 feet beyond the original norman termination and presents a square face projecting with a flat parapet beyond the high gable over the actual east window the norman apse was demolished about 1320 in all probability and the present polygonal end substituted for it it seems that originally the aisles of the norman presbytery continued round this apse which was flanked by two small towers the eastern chapel may have been dedicated to the holy trinity as at canterbury and probably extended as far as the western arch of the present lady chapel the central gable of the old termination rather acute in form is richly decorated with panels and crocketting and is crowned by a tabernacle wherein bishop fox is represented leaning on the pelican three of the panels in the centre are pierced and glazed forming a small squareheaded window and under it is a door opening upon an alura behind a crenelated panelled and pierced parapet over a cornice with bosses at the base of the gable and just above the east window woodward the perpendicular east window has seven lights and resembles in the form of its head wykehams windows a portrait bust of fox has been discovered on the north corbel of the hoodmould of this window and the flyingbuttresses which as willis pointed out the jointing of the masonry proves to be later insertions into the clerestory walls have the pelican carved on them the whole gable is flanked by richly canopied octagonal turrets on which the flyingbuttresses abut the lower part of the east window cannot be seen from below being lost behind the roof of the chantry aisles illustration the east endexterior sb bolas co photo the whole of the eastern arm of the cathedral is curiously mixed in style furnishing examples of early english decorated and perpendicular architecture beyond the main east gable just described projects a low early english structure of three nearly equally high aisles of which the central or lady chapel has received a further perpendicular addition there has been apparently a slight subsidence of the early english walls which has caused the irregular look of the arches in the interior of the southern retrochoir aisle see page 69 above the plain stringcourse of the retrochoir there is in each compartment under a level parapet an arcade of narrow pointed arches four in number the central couple of each set being pierced and glazed so as to form pairs of lancet windows the langton and guardian angels chapels which project not quite half as far as the lady chapel from the old eastern limit of the church show a triple series of arcades diminishing in size as they mount the central arcade is much cut into on the eastern face by the large threelight windows of the lateral chapels there is no parapet above the arcades at the angles between these chapels and the retrochoir aisles are staircases enclosed in small octagonal turrets rising slightly above the adjoining parts with merely a plain parapet at the top the lady chapel has at the end and at each side a fine sevenlight perpendicular window the heads of the lights below the transom being cinquefoiled while above each window is a cornice supported by small arches resting on corbels over all is a pierced battlement which is also crenelated at the actual east end below the east window of the lady chapel between the two great buttresses with mutilated canopies on the two lower of their three divisions there is some blank panelling consisting of four shallowarched recesses with a pilaster down the centre each arch uniting two minor ones with cinquefoil cusps at the head and crowned by a quatrefoil with a rosette in the middle there were originally four heads at the ends of the corbels under these quatrefoils but the southernmost is broken away a similar arcade runs along the southern wall of the lady chapel but there is none on the north side the two main corbeltables at the east end show the arms of england and france and the bishops device of three torteaux under these at a short distance from the ground are two smaller windows which give light to the lady chapel crypt the panelling dates from about 1490 and is due to bishop peter courtenay illustration nave showing the screen before restoration a pumphrey photo chapter iii the interior the very first glimpse of the nave as one enters by the west door reveals the superb proportions of the interior in spite of all statistics of its size the outward appearance of the building hardly impresses the spectator with the fact that winchester is the largest cathedral in northern europe and it is not until one is within the walls that the great length of the cathedral begins to become real and its majesty is properly appreciated the total span from end to end of 556 feet compared with the 537 feet of ely the 525 of york the 524 of lincoln and the 516 of canterbury would not alone produce the effect of almost infinite vastness and is certainly not realised either in a distant prospect from the hills or in a nearer view from the cathedral precincts but when once the nave is entered owing partly to the open and comparatively low choirscreen the magnificent vault of nearly 400 feet may easily be understood to have few rivals in the world certainly neither of the two buildings in england which are practically equal in size to winchester cathedral give the peculiarly overwhelming sense of length produced here the old epithet of royal may be said to apply as fitly to the cathedral as to the town and it certainly is a worthy shelter for the bones of halfforgotten dynasties and as fine a monument of an earlier england as westminster is of later periods in the development of the country of course as in all english cathedrals a lack of colour and a sense of coldness and emptiness modifies any unqualified admiration which one might at first feel but winchester could well afford to admit far more than the most captious critic could utter against it and yet claim to be the most stately nave that england can show despite the late recasting the proportions are norman and the very core of the pillars is still the original norman stonework notwithstanding the changes wrought by edingdon and wykeham all the more petty detail of the decorated period is lavished on a colossal structure planned with the simple magnificence of those that builded better than they knew perhaps it is not quite fair to the later architects to attribute all the excellence of the work to the earlier builders for the graceful columns of the naves eleven bays which rise unbroken to where the roofgroining springs from their capitals are made by wykeham to fulfil a new duty which entirely alters their whole aspect the general effect has been said to be as if a norman architect had expressed himself in the more refined idiom of the early fifteenth century yet the work of edingdon and wykeham was ruthless in its way the original norman nave of walkelin consisted of the normal three storeys of equal height in this casethe main arches triforium and clerestory at the present day the main arches are fully half as high again as they were in the norman cathedral while the base of the clerestory has been brought down to meet them so that the triforium appears to have vanished or rather to exist merely as a balcony over each arch as a matter of fact however it was the old clerestory which was entirely removed and replaced by the present upper storey on p 35 we see on the one hand typical norman work of the character still existing at romsey abbey and christchurch prioryto mention only the two large churches nearest to winchester during the conversion of the nave the bases and capitals of the grouped shafts of the main arches were removed together with all the masonry above them this is not mere conjecture for the norman shafts and capitals which still remain on the north side of the nave in the second bay from the crossing where they were covered by the ancient roodscreen show that the pierarches of the nave sprang from the same height as those of the transepts the norman main arch of the triforium still exists in every compartment over the vault of the side aisles to prove that the triforium of the nave was practically on the same level as that of the transepts and the tops of the norman shafts yet remaining above the navevaulting are additional evidence that the nave was to all intents and purposes uniform with the transepts in its general arrangement in the south aisle moreover there is to be seen the lower extremity of a norman shaft once covered by some votive altar or shrine which was removed during the destructive period of the reformation it may be readily noted says the writer of a recent article on winchester cathedral how the new ashlar was brought down to the level of this vanished altar and how wykehams vaultingshaft has been made to end in foliation where it once rose in receipt of prayers and waxcandles vowed in return for mercies vouchsafed in the seven westerly piers of the south aisle the norman stonework has merely received new mouldings while flat norman buttresses can be seen outside between the clerestory windows also on the south side illustration elevation of two bays of the nave showing its transformation from williss architectural history of winchester cathedral 1846 on the division into two in place of the usual three storeys it may perhaps be of interest to quote some remarks of willis in the proceedings of the archological institute the compartment of wykehams nave he says is divided into two parts vertically instead of three for although it has a triforium gallery yet this is so completely subordinated to the clerestory window that it cannot be held as a separate division of the composition as in the norman work where the triforium compartment is of all importance and similar in decoration to the other two although not exactly like them in wykehams work on the contrary we find above the lofty pierarch what at first sight appears to be a clerestory window divided at midheight by a transom and recessed under a deeplypointed archway but it is above the transom only that the real window is formed by glazing the spaces between the monials below the transom these spaces are filled with panels and two narrow openings cut through the latter give access from the roof to a kind of balcony which projects over the pierarches in each compartment this balcony exists but there is no free passage from one to the other this mode of uniting the triforium and clerestory by the employment of a transom dividing the stone panels of the former from the glazed lights of the latter is common enough at the period of wykehams work and before it but the balcony is unusual it is needless to add any further explanation since the diagram fully explains both the present state of the nave and the manner in which the transformation from the original norman design was brought about but it may be worth while to quote an architects verdict on the general effect of wykehams work in the nave if we cannot admire all the details says this writer we can but bear tribute to the conception of the whole its lofty arcades give no space for triforium and the proportion between the clerestory and the arcade is somewhat unsatisfactory if we except the vaulted roof and the chantry of the great wykeham himself and his predecessor edingdon this portion of the church may with reason be considered simple in its character and bears distinct evidence of having been grafted on earlier work the norman columns still remain in one or two places towards the east end of the nave arcade but with the exception of these and of the norman masonry existing in the piers on the south and perhaps portions of the aisle walls all is transformed to perpendicular detail the builder october 1892 illustration the nave looking east sb bolas co photo altogether there are between the western doors and the piers supporting the tower twelve arches on each side one of each series being included in the choir hooks and brackets may be seen in the face of the piers at about threequarters of their height these were formerly used for the suspension of arras on occasions of great festivity it has been practically established that the sculpture at least of the nave and its vault was not finished for nearly halfacentury after wykehams death we find cardinal beauforts arms and bust and his device a white hart chained as well as waynfletes lily intermingled with the arms and bust of wykeham under the triforium gallery is a cornice in each compartment of which are to be found seven large sculptured bosses representing a cardinals hat a lily roses etc of the compartments of the clerestory in the nave we have said that they have the appearance of a very fine perpendicular window all however except the upper part of the centre of these seeming windows is really panelwork the old norman main arch of the triforium may be seen behind this panelling under the present clerestory windows until recently the mass above pressed very heavily on the navevaulting but during the last and preceding years 18967 the strain has been relieved by the insertion of new supplementary timbers above the original hempage forest beams which can still be seen by those who wish the cost of this work of repairing the roof and vault has been about 9000 and so far has not at all exceeded the original estimate in august 1897 a large amount still remained to be subscribed as seen from below each division of the vault is bounded by two vaultingshafts which rise to the level of the clerestory windowsill and send out from above the capital nine diverging ribs to the ridgerib by which the whole vault is divided into a series of bisected and interlacing lozenges as the basis for all the groining woodward illustration west window from nave photochrom co ltd photo the general effect of the nave can be gathered from the illustrations which bring out well the appearance of height which is bound to impress the spectator standing near the central western door in the nave aisles also a fine view may be obtained the comparative narrowness counteracting the lessened height as one looks down the church towards the west it will be noticed that the western interior wall is practically entirely filled by the great window for not only does this stretch across the whole width but the mullions also are carried right down to the floorlevel a double series of panels occupying the space below the sill of the window the glass in the window proper is for the most part very old and as is pointed out elsewhere see p 94 is arranged in patterns after the fashion of a kaleidoscope this arises from the fact that the fragments of which it is composed are entirely disjointed and probably incapable of being pieced together the monuments and objects of interest in the nave are numerous but chief perhaps are on the north side the minstrels gallery the old grillwork and the font and on the south side the chantries of bishops wykeham and edingdon but first of all though not on account of preeminent merit should be mentioned the bronze statues of james i and charles i to the north and south of the main west door against the interior wall they were executed by le sueur the artist who executed the fine equestrian figure of charles i at charing cross a note on the sculptors payment for these bronzes may be seen in the record of exchequer from which it appears that he received 340 for the two with a further 40 for carrying and erecting them at winchester in the northwest corner stands the minstrels gallery or tribune the work of edingdon it is supported by two flattened arches springing from the pier shafts and is panelled on its face and spandrels the panelling is decorated with flowered cusps and the central bosses bear the arms of wykeham this gallery appears to have been intended for use on state occasions now however it is merely used as a room in which the episcopal registers may be stored in height it extends halfway up the neighbouring piers illustration iron grillwork from s swithuns shrine from mr starkie gardiners ironwork vol i by permission of the science and art department south kensington near this at the western end of the north aisle is a door made up of four pieces of iron grillwork which originally stood at the top of the steps leading up from the south transepts to the retrochoir the place where it used to be is still pointed out and indeed marks are visible in the piers to which it was secured a paper read to the society of arts by mr j starkie gardiner describes the door as being from its style the oldest piece of grillwork in england the design is composed of sprays formed of two rolls of scrolls welded to a central stem like a muchcurled ostrich feather with lesser scrolls in the interstices and the major scrolls each terminating in an openwork trefoil or quinquefoil the large scrolls are 5 in in diameter and rather stout the grill possessing great resisting powers though it would not be hard to climb there is unfortunately no means of fixing the date since no other grill resembles it but from the position indicated in the cathedral it may well have been made as long ago as the eleventh or twelfth century it was originally intended to keep the miscellaneous crowd of pilgrims to the shrine of s swithun from penetrating farther into the church by way of the south transept they were obliged to enter and depart by the norman doorway in the north transept it will not be necessary to record all the monuments and the brasses which so abundantly cover the walls but those of the greatest interest will be alluded to in the fifth bay of the north aisle are two memorials of very different dates those of the two brothers of avington 1662 and of the novelist jane austen the youngest daughter of the rector of steventon in hampshire her monumental brass is affixed to the wall below the other which records how the two brothers were both of oxford both of the temple both officers to queen elizabeth and our noble king james both justices of the peace both agree in arms the one a knight the other a captain in the next bay opposite the norman font is an inscription relating to mrs montagu the founder of the blue stocking club it is to this effecthere lies the body of elizabeth montagu daughter of matthew robinson esq of west layton in the county of york who possessing the united advantages of beauty wit judgment reputation and riches and employing her talents most uniformly for the benefit of mankind might be justly deemed an ornament to her sex and country she died on the 25th august 1800 aged 81 the norman font which milner called crux antiquariorum is situated on the north side of the nave between the fifth and sixth pillars from the west front it is one of a group of seven found in england of which four are in hampshire at east meon s michaels southampton s mary bourne and winchester two in lincolnshire in the cathedral and at thornton curtis and one at s peters ipswich of four similar fonts on the continent that at zedelghem near bruges is most like the winchester example and also illustrates the same legend the material of which these fonts are made is a bluishblack calcareous marble such as is still worked at tournai in hainault the font before us is a nearly square block of marble supported on a solid central column ornamented with horizontal mouldings with four disengaged pillars of lesser diameter with cable mouldings at each corner the spandrels of the top are decorated with carved symbolic subjects leaves and flowers on two sides and on the other two doves drinking from vases out of which issue crosses typifying baptism it is said it is rather curious that the artist has disregarded the usual symmetry and filled his spaces without reference to the corresponding ones on the north and east faces of the font are three circular medallions with symbolic doves and salamanders on the south and west are scenes from the life of s nicholas of myra as was fully demonstrated by milner the north side showing the saint dowering the three daughters of a poor nobleman while on the west he restores to life a drowned person probably the kings son in one of the stories of his life and rescues from death by the axe three young men who are about to be slain either by the executioner or by a wicked innkeeper for there are two versions some authorities would find four scenes represented on the west side but on what grounds it is difficult to see there only appear to be two figures of the saint and the two scenes are divided by what looks like a short vertical bar indicating a difference of subject see p 117 the cult of s nicholas of myra grew rapidly in the twelfth century being popularised by the crusaders in this century it is known that the carved work at tournai whence it is probable that the black marble came was remarkable for its symbolism the font has been thought to be older on account of its archaic figures but as the dean of winchester pointed out in a paper read before the archological association in 1893 to which we are indebted for much of this account the mitre which s nicholas is represented as wearing was not recognised as part of a bishops official dress until the very end of the eleventh century in fact the particular form of mitre depicted appears to have been late twelfth century the conclusion naturally arrived at is that the font is of belgian origin carved at tournai between 11501200 and its presence at winchester may well be due either to henry of blois or to toclive illustration the norman fontsouth and west sides photochrom co ltd photo on the north side of the steps leading up to the choir is a brass tablet on a pillar recording the merits of the

between the ninth and tenth pillars on this side is the tomb of bishop morley with an epitaph written by himself at eighty years of age by the next pillar is the monument of bishop hoadley with a good medallionportrait of him on it on the south side of the nave we find two remarkable tombs of which the first is the chantry of william of wykeham called by timbs one of the best remaining specimens of a fourteenth century monument it stands where wykeham erected it in that part of the cross formed by the church which corresponds to the saviours pierced side and occupies the space between the piers which enclose the fifth bay from the west end the site is said to have been previously occupied by an altar dedicated to the blessed virgin wykehams patroness he left directions moreover that three monks should celebrate masses thrice daily in his chantry receiving for this one penny a day while the boys who were to sing there nightly were assigned 6s 8d a year needless to say his wishes are not now carried out the stonescreen which surrounds the chantry is of beautiful and elaborate workmanship the effect of which has been compared to lace while above graceful shafts support a canopy of which the pinnacles rise to the level of the triforium gallery at the east end are traces of an altar and credence table and close by is a piscina above are two rows of canopied niches which however they were originally occupied have for long been untenanted until quite recently during the early part of 1897 the pedestals have been filled with ten statue of modern workmanship2 a row of five empty niches runs along the western wall the vault of the chantry is richly groined with lierne work it is tinted a vivid blue on the background and the bosses on the groins are gilt the ironwork in this chantry is also noticeable the tomb within has fortunately suffered but little from time and thanks to the courage of one of the pupils in wykehams foundation at winchester colonel nathaniel fiennes the parliamentarians left both this monument and the college buildings untouched on the tomb itself lies the figure of wykeham with his hands folded across his breast habited in episcopal robes and mitre his crozier on his shoulder three small figures of monks praying kneel at his feet while his head is slightly raised up by supporting angels a little arcade runs all round the tomb with a series of shields in the spaces containing his arms and motto manners makyth man and the arms of the see of winchester his epitaph on a slip of red enamelled brass in a chamfer round the edge of the tomb has

cease not to pray that for such great merits he may enjoy everlasting life 2 one method of commemorating the quincentenary of winchester college 1893 was the insertion of statues into the niches of

scholar of winchester and a warden of new college presenting a scholar of that college the artist worked with a photograph of the present warden before him the pastor bonus with ss james and john ss

church times aug 20 1897 illustration william of wykehams chantry from brittons winchester as one proceeds along the nave toward the east the choir is reached by two flights of four steps each with a landing between over which formerly there extended a roodloft from pillar to pillar bearing on it stigands great cross to the south of these choir steps and adjoining the intermediate landing is the chantry of bishop edingdon the earliest in date of the chapeltombs at winchester the chantry is very plain in comparison with the others in the cathedral and apart from the tomb there is only a slightly raised platform at the east end without an altar a shaft of the large pillars runs down the centre of the east and west interior walls on the tomb lies the figure of the bishop in pontificalibus his stole bearing the symbolic and muchdisputed fylfot cross which has been interpreted as a sign of submission edingdons curious latin epitaph given on page 107 is on a blue enamelled strip of brass on the edge of the tomb close to edingdons chantry is the nave pulpit which is in itself a good piece of jacobean work though not happily situated in the nave of winchester it stood formerly in the chapel at new college oxford and did not appear at winchester until 1884 when it was presented by members of the mayo family if one stands facing east in the aisle to the right of this pulpit one of the most picturesque views in the cathedral lies before one through part of the south transept and up the southern ambulatory of the retrochoir to the bright colours of langtons chapel window at the end it will readily be noticed how out of the perpendicular are the piers of this ambulatory as one approaches the east end of the church this seems to have arisen through a slight subsidence of the ground here the original roodscreen exists no longer and in its place we have but a modern copy by sir gilbert scott of the work in the decorated choir stall canopies this oak choir screen which is all that breaks the view between west porch and reredos has not met with much approval and the pallor of its wood does not contrast agreeably with the rich colour of the old choir stalls this however cannot with justice be made a ground for complaint against the architect who modelled his work as far as possible on the original as one enters the choir which is raised above the level of the nave by the two sets of four steps the stalls abovementioned will be found to reach on either side from the eastern piers of the central tower to the first piers of the nave they are of carved oak and are possibly the best existing examples of their date in england the style is early decorated and willis points out the similarity between their canopies and gables and those of edward crouchbacks chapel in westminster abbey the details are varied and graceful with the design of each pair coupled under a pointed arch with a cinquefoil in its head which is again surmounted by a high crocketted gable the oak has turned a superb hue with age very different from the colour of the modern screen which is banked by the reveals of the old bishops throne the misereres below are much earlier in date than the canopies but do not go quite so far back as those at exeter which may be assigned to about 1230 the desks and stools of the upper tier show the date 1540 and bear also the initials of henry viii bishop gardiner and dean kingsmill the pulpit on the north side of the choir was given by prior silkstede whose name it bears and is also of finely carved work above the choir stalls on the northern side is the organ which was repaired this year illustration the choir looking east hw salmon photo toward the east end of the choir stalls in the centre of the pavement lies the muchdisputed tomb of william rufus it is a plain coped tomb constructed of purbeck marble since it was known that william was buried originally beneath the tower this tomb was assumed to be his and in cromwells time it was violated when as milner relates there was found therein besides the dust some pieces of cloth embroidered with gold a large gold ring and a small silver chalice the very fact of these discoveries however tend to prove that the grave was not that of rufus it is now frequently held that it is that of henry of blois who is known to have been buried with much honour before the high altar rudborne records that he was sepultus in ecclesia sua coram summo altari yet others suppose that he still lies in the space before the altar the ring found in cromwells time set with a sapphire which denotes a bishop may be seen in the cathedral library when the contents of the tomb were last examined on august 27 1868 the remains though much disturbed by the previous violation indicated a man of about 5 feet 8 inches and fragments of red cloth with gold embroidery were to be seen it was also gathered that the body had been wrapped in lead as henry of blois was said to have been the vaulting of the presbytery which is of timber carved to imitate stone is remarkable for its very fine and brilliantly coloured bosses forming a quite unique collection of designs milner mentions as the chief among these the arms and badges of the families of lancaster and tudor the arms of castile of cardinal beaufort and even of the very sees held successively by bishop fox the part of the vaulting from the altar to the east window bears none but pious ornaments the several instruments of the saviours passion including s peters denial and the betrayal in the garden of gethsemane the faces of pilate and his wife of the jewish high priest judas kissing jesus judas moneybag the veronicathis is immediately above the place of the cross on the reredosthe saviours coat with the

this year the choirlantern was visible from below with its striking late norman stonework divided into two tiers it has been proposed to reopen the lantern but this would necessitate the removal of the bells from the tower a matter of considerable expense it would also be a pity to take down the vaulting with its various devices including the arms etc of charles i his queen and the prince of wales a medallion of the two former the scotch and irish arms and those of archbishop laud bishop curie and dean young the central emblem is that of the trinity with a chronogram indicating the year 1634 thussint domus hujus pii reges nutritii reginae nutrices piae the larger letters picked out in red serve as roman figures which added together make up the required number illustration the choir stalls photochrom co ltd photo from the commencement of the choir to the high altar are eleven steps making nineteen in all from the level of the nave this elevation of course much enhances the imposing effect of the altar and reredos as seen from the lower plane it is due to the existence of the norman crypt beneath and can be paralleled both at canterbury and at rochester the raised platform includes the presbytery with its aisles and the retrochoir and extends under the central tower to the second pillar beyond the nave and transepts are thus on a lower level before the altar are rails which date from the reign of charles i while the altar books were presented to the cathedral by charles ii the great reredos which separates the presbytery from the feretory and the eastern end of the church is to judge from its style late fifteenthcentury work it has been attributed to cardinal beaufort and to bishop fox and prior silkstede but no inscription or armorial details can be discovered to confirm either of these suppositions it is similar in character to the altarscreens of christchurch priory hants and s mary overy s saviours southwark but less fortunate than the former it was despoiled of all the statues which once filled its niches while it has not the exquisite grace of detail which marks the choir of angels at southwark the reredos at s albans in the same style though not so large was erected between 1476 and 1484 and as at winchester before 1899 shows a crossshaped space where according to legend a huge silver crucifix was placed now once more as in the sixteenth century there is a figure on the great cross it is curious to note an attempt during the rage for pseudoclassic architecture in the last century to beautify the reredos by placing sham funeral urns in its niches these were fortunately removed in 1820 and in recent years they have been replaced by a series of statues intended to reproduce as far as possible the original effect in the builder for october 10 1892 a large reproduction was given of a very interesting drawing by the late mr jw sedding showing the whole screen completely restored but this scheme was unfortunately not used a large oilpainting the raising of lazarus by benjamin west purchased in 1782 by dean ogle till 1899 hung immediately over the altar before 1818 a huge wooden canopy in jacobean style freely enriched with gold covered all the central portion of the screen this was due to bishop curie the reredos is so large that it occupies the whole of the space between the choir piers and being constructed of a very white stone is the prominent feature of the choir the work is very elaborate the whole screen being arranged in three tiers with canopied niches containing eighteen large statues while smaller figureskings saints angels etcoccupy the splays between the pinnacles are pierced and crocketted and there is a central projecting canopy over the place of the original crucifix on either side of the high altar is a door leading to the feretory at the back of the reredos and these have in their four spandrels interesting groups of fifteenthcentury sculpture representing various scenes in the life of the virgin the annunciation and the visitation of s elizabeth still showing traces of colour the fact that these carvings have escaped destruction just as the lower tier at christchurch escaped is only to be explained on the assumption that they were hidden behind some panelling since removed for of all images which provoked iconoclastic fury those representing the virgin were the most certain to be attacked the whole is crowned by a triple frieze of leaves tudor roses and quatrefoils at a height little short of the corbels which support the arches of the roof illustration the altar and reredos hw salmon photo the eighteen larger statues were and are now since the restoration of the reredos arranged in the following order in the uppermost tier to the left and right of the head of cross were s peter and s paul who were the patron saints of the church two on either side of these were the four latin doctors ss augustine gregory jerome and ambrose below these on the middle tier we had two great local bishops s birinus first occupant of the see standing beside the figure of the virgin and on the other side s swithun the benevolent bishop patronsaint

the figures of ss swithun and birinus stand statues of the virgin and s john while above the arms of the cross are the four archangels uriel gabriel michael and raphael in all there are now fiftysix statues on the screen the smaller figures including famous kings bishops women and a representation of izaak walton 3 the charter of william rufus which gave permission for s giles fair still exists and may be found with a commentary by dean kitchin in the winchester cathedral records the fair was granted for three days august 31 september 1 and 2 on the eastern hill known as s giles hill the object of the fair was evidently says dean kitchin to help the bishop in completing his great norman church parts of the proceeds of the fair were at a later time assigned to hyde abbey to s swithuns priory and to the hospital of s mary magdalen above the altar it is said that there was once a table of images of silver and gilt garnished with stones these images are conjectured to have represented christ and his disciples possibly at the last supper but no traces remain of them from 1782 till 1899 wests picture the raising of lazarus now in the south transept hung here the place is now more happily occupied by a representation of the incarnation illustration the north transept from brittons winchester the most recent feature of the screen is the great central figure of christ crucified the gift of canon valpy and the work of messrs farmer and brindley the final restoration of the screen by the filling of the space left vacant for three centuries was commemorated by a solemn dedication service held at the cathedral on march 24 1899 on the reredos as a whole one authority has said that no description could do justice to the beauty and effect of the whole work but another has declared that a huge screen of this uncompromising squareness of outline is a flagrantly artless device which in previous periods to the latter half of the fifteenth century would have been impossible milner again describes its exquisite workmanship as being as magnificent as this or any other nation can exhibit doctors most certainly differ here it will perhaps be most convenient to deal at this point with the transepts of which the western walls are almost level with the choirscreen having been but little injured by the fall of the tower in 1107 they still remain to a great extent what they were when originally built by walkelin we therefore get the massive and rugged early norman walls still divided into the three nearly equal storeys which in the nave have given place to two where the fall of the central tower necessitated a partial rebuilding the difference between the early and the late masonry is very evident that of the transepts generally is coarse and very thick as is the case with all early norman stonework the new masonry on the other hand recalls what william of malmesbury says of the later norman masonry at salisbury when he speaks of the courses of stone so correctly laid that the joint deceives the eye and leads it to imagine that the whole wall is composed of a single block the juncture of the two works at winchester can be easily traced of the general style of the transepts willis says the architecture is of the plainest description the compartment of the triforium is very nearly of the same height as that of the pierarches and the clerestory is also nearly the same height each pierarch is formed of two orders or courses of voussoirs the edges of which are left square wholly undecorated by mouldings this is the case with the pierarches of ely transept but in the arches of the triforium at ely and in every other norman part of that cathedral the edges of the voussoirs are richly moulded in winchester transept on the contrary the arches of the triforium and clerestory are squareedged like those of the pier below and hence arises the peculiarly simple and massive effect of this part of the church between the towerpiers and the terminal walls of each transept there are three piers making four compartments the farther two of which from the nave and choir open into the terminal aisles the arches were all originally plain semicircular and squareedged and are supported by shafts with the cushioned capitals so characteristic of the ruder norman style and the bases are simple with a chamfer and quarterround very different from the ornamental late norman bases such as may be seen at s cross winchester for example where the later norman work has taken the place of the original we find stronger piers the vault above is groined but there are no ribs nothing however can now be seen of the vaulting above the level of the sidewalls since a flat wooden ceiling painted in early tudor style was put up in 1818 by which among other things the rosewindow in the gable of the north transept was hidden though in brittons view which we give on page 59 we have the transept previous to the timbering each transept has an eastern and a western aisle while at the extreme ends there are aisles rising to pierarch level consisting of two arches which a triple bearingshaft supports in the centre a kind of gallery is formed at the terminations of the north and south transepts over and beyond which may be seen the triforium and clerestory windows this can best be appreciated by a reference to the illustration plate xv possibly this platform or gallery was not originally so bare as it appears at the present day but there is no doubt that it was built in order that processions might pass round on the triforium level it has been mentioned that when the tower was rebuilt the columns nearest it in the transepts were strengthened they now indeed present a singularly massive outline to the eye and contrast strongly even with the remaining norman pillars in the transepts the arches also are changed all were once semicircular but the rebuilding necessitated a change of the first and second from the actual towerpier into the stilted or horseshoe form they are doubly recessed except those supporting the end platform which have but one soffit and present quite plain and unadorned square edges illustration view in north transept photochrom co ltd photo in each transept there is at the eastern angle a spiral staircase leading up to the roof if we take first the north transept there will be found at the southern end against the side wall of the choir and between the two great towerpiers the chapel of the holy sepulchre a small compartment which contains some interesting and still distinct mural paintings on the roof and walls representing scenes of the passion etc the most striking is a large head and bust of christ on the easternmost division of the vaulting one hand holds the gospels with the inscription salus populi ego sum on the wall beneath are the descent from the cross and the entombment the nativity and annunciation also appear on the roof while on the walls are the entry into jerusalem the raising of lazarus the descent into hell and the appearance to mary magdalene in the garden two of the norman piers on the eastern side of this transept have received very elaborate canopies of the decorated period under which it is probable that there were at one time altars some early english work may be seen in the heads carved on some of the larger shafts and the caps of the subsidiary pillars a noticeable figure being a monk crouched in a caryatidal attitude and holding a chessboard the modern entry to the crypts is in the southeast interior wall of this transept the old means of entrance through the holy hole having been blocked up the large tomb in the north transept is that of prebendary iremonger on the western wall at the end of the transept are very faint traces of mural paintings representing s christopher carrying christ etc and it is probable the transepts were once thus decorated throughout the south transept has received far more additions to its interior decorations than has the north in the back of the choirwall is recessed sir isaac townsends memorial not a very noteworthy object just under it there now stands the old oak settle which was once used by the norman monks in the central space of the transept itself is a large monument to bishop wilberforce showing beneath a canopy a lifesized figure with mitre cope and staff on a slab borne by six kneeling angels a latin inscription records his birth on 1st september 1805 and his death on 19th july 1873 the monument is the work of sir gilbert scott and has met with some severe attacks it certainly is out of place in its norman surroundings the aisles of the south transept are divided up into six chambers of which the larger of the two westernmost is used as a chapterroom and does not betray its age by its present appearance the one next the body of the church milners ancient sacristy but now known as henry of blois treasury serves as a boys vestry the norman work over the door must not be overlooked the chamber to the extreme south is the entrance lobby to the south door which leads into the slype or passage running between the church and the old chapterhouse leading out of it is the ancient calefactory where the fire for the censers and thuribles was preserved panelled oak screens enclose this room on both sides next it comes silkstedes chapel the central of the three easterly divisions of the transept aisles the priors rebus in the form of a skein of silk is evident among the carvings and his christian name thomas may be seen on the cornice with the ma the monogram of the virgin standing out distinctly the screen in this chapel is worthy of remark and is divided into four compartments the upper part of each being openwork and arched with pierced quatrefoils in the spandrels in this chapel traces of painting were discovered in 1848 beneath the whitewash on the eastern wall the subject apparently being christ upon the water calling to him s peter who in an attitude of hesitation holds the prow of the boat fine canopywork surmounts the whole originally there were eight canopies enclosing figures but little except the canopies remain the distemperpainting having almost vanished on the floor of the chapel may be found a black marble slab the tomb of isaak walton with bishop kens oftenquoted inscription which however it is perhaps pardonable to quote again alas hees gone before gone to returne noe more our panting hearts aspire after their aged sire whose wellspent life did last full ninety years and past but now

bishop wilberforces tomb in south transept photochrom co ltd photo illustration south aisle from transept sb bolas co photo next to prior silkstedes chapel comes the venerable chapel which serves as a vestry for the minor canons of the cathedral the screen of this fills the whole archway the six canopies extending beyond the sweep of the arch down each side are untenanted niches and the openings of the tracery show some beautiful and elaborate ironwork dating from the renaissance a similar screen though without canopies divides the venerable chapel from silkstedes the library is approached from an old wooden staircase in the south aisle of this transept it is a long low room with oaken presses curiously carved and ornamented with gilded knobs after the fashion of the latter half of the seventeenth century it contains three or four thousand books most of which are the gift of bishop morley and there are many fine mss but its chief treasure is a vulgate of the twelfth century in three folio volumes on vellum the gorgeously illuminated manuscript is the best work extant of the winchester school and the fact that it was never finished renders it only the more interesting since thereby the whole process from the first outline to the final touch of colour is evident a legend concerning hugh of avalon afterwards bishop of lincoln associated with this book is worthy of mention henry ii who founded the carthusian monastery of witham in somerset had appointed hugh prior in 1175 or 1176 and finding that his monks needed mss to copy and in particular a complete copy of the bible promised to give them one to avoid expense he borrowed this superb vulgate from winchester and sent it to witham a chance visit long afterwards of a winchester monk revealed what had happened and on the matter becoming known to hugh he returned the volume without the kings knowledge4 among other important mss in the library are an eleventh century copy of bedes ecclesiastical history a twelfth century life of edward the confessor by s aelred cistercian abbot of rivaulx about 1160 containing a portrait of the king within one of its initial letters a copy of the promptorium parvulorum a charter of thelwulf king of wessex dated 854 and bearing the signatures of the king his young son alfred and s swithun there are also the chapterbooks for 15531600 the cathedral statutes with the signatures of charles i and bishop laud the original charter of henry viii to the cathedral on the dissolution of the priory and many interesting documents and printed books some with the original chains which were fastened to their covers here also are kept the great seal of henry v the pastoral staff from bishop foxs tomb his ring those of bishops gardiner and woodlock and the one set with a sapphire which comes from the tomb of william rufusprobably as we have said belonging to henry of blois the library was built in 1668 ad 4 it is now however on record that the book was bequeathed by bishop nicholas of ely in 1282 we may now return to the body of the cathedral and pass to the surroundings of the choir the feretory where the feretra or shrines of the saints were placed lies behind the high altar and reredos and the two doors in the latter give access to it at one time before the erection of the reredos the feretory must have been visible from the choir behind the doors is a raised platform seven feet in breadth extending right across the upper surface of this is now only three feet above the ground level but originally it must have been far higher four steps give access to it before it is a hollow space with stumps of piers demonstrating the ancient presence of an arcade in front of the platform the feretory is without internal decoration but the exterior of the east wall is adorned with nine rich decorated tabernacles with the yet legible names of saints and king who once occupied the eighteen pedestals within them this inscription is to be found here corpora sanctorum sunt hic in pace sepulta ex meritis quorum fulgent miracula multa the floor beneath the platform is supported by a small vault the entrance to which to quote willis is by a low arch in the eastern face of the wall under the range of tabernacles this vault is that which was designated as the sanctum sanctorum or holy hole the feretory is used as a receptacle for the carved work found at various dates about the cathedral including portions of statuary once belonging to the great screen here lies a really marvellous lid of a reliquary chest presented in 1309 by sir william de lilburn with events in the life of our lord and various saints vividly portrayed in colours and decorated with the donors armorial bearings the holy hole has been used as a receptacle for fragments of various kinds since the end of the fifteenth century before which it was visible from the choir for no reredos intercepted the view milner states that in 1789 the whole passage and vault was so choked with rubbish that the attempt to enter it had to be abandoned a more recent observer records that there appears to be no space for a crypt or receptacle for relics within the holy hole the chest of bones etc being placed on the platform over the arcade the fragments now in the feretory are often very fine but are most of them sadly mutilated illustration back of feretory with bishop gardiners chantry sb bolas co photo the north and south sides of the feretory are flanked by the chantries of bishops gardiner and fox into which it opens gardiners chantry in the renaissance style was much damaged by the reformers the head being knocked off the figure lying in a long niche on the outside of the chantry and other indignities committed of the tomb nothing now remains but there is an altar with figures at the back after italian models representing according to one tradition justice and mercy while others say the law and the gospel at the east end is a small vestry used as a repository for fragments the details and the mouldings of gardiners chantry are of the renaissance style and britton has described the chapel as bad italian and bad english this is true of the eastern end of the compartment but there are redeeming features amid the curious mixture of styles below the floorlevel of this chantry may be seen the base of one of the norman apse piers the sole remaining feature of the norman east end except the crypt bishop foxs chantry is a far finer piece of work and is certainly the most elaborate chantry in the cathedral it displays no fewer than fiftyfive richlygroined niches all different in pattern only two of them are tenanted and these by very recent figures on either side of the door there is a great amount of wonderful undercutting to be seen in the spandrels to the arches and the upper part of the erection shows open tracery with niches and canopies under a cornice of running foliage and tudor flowers surmounted by panelled pinnacles foxs pelican in her piety alternates on the pinnacles with small octagonal turrets at one time moreover all the arches etc contained stained glass but this has now vanished within there is no tomb but as in gardiners chantry there is in an arched recess at the side the ghastly carved figure of a corpse so frequently introduced in monuments of the period the altar is surmounted by a small reredos in a sunk panel now unoccupied crowned by a band of angels bearing emblems of the passion over the altar is this inscription in latin o sacrum convivium in quo christus sumitur there is here as was the case with gardiners chantry a small room at the eastern end in this are chests in which relics were kept illustration bishop foxs chantry the interior part of the choir aisles have received wykeham windows four on each side though from the exterior only three can be seen the westernmost on the north side has two lights partly looking into the open while two are unglazed and the top of one looks into the northern transept on the south side all are glazed but only three get any light from outside these can be seen from the close at the junction of transept and retrochoir all these windows have blank panelling or arcading below it looks as if wykeham or his successors meant to reduce the width of the norman transepts so as to bring them into better proportion with the eastern arm of the church illustration door of foxs chantry between the presbytery and the side aisles extending from pier to pier are screens of pierced stonework erected by bishop fox whose motto frequently occurs on them together with his initials and cardinal beauforts on the top of the screens are six painted chests see p 95 in which are collected the bones of saints and kings of the saxon period the original collection being made by henry of blois these mortuary chests were desecrated by the cromwellian ruffians when they broke into the cathedral and the bones were hurled through the stained glass of the west and other windows afterwards they were collected once more and replaced in the chests where they now lie among the relics are the bones of edred edmund canute william rufus emma bishops wina alwyn egbert cenwulf or kenulf cynegils and ethelwulf and there are the old inscriptions to indicate whose remains were originally enclosed within the boxes though there is now no warrant that the bones within correspond at all to the names without illustration detail of pulpit among those who have been buried in the presbytery aisles is bishop de pontissara of whom rudborne says that he was buried ex aquilonari plaga majoris altaris accordingly we find his monument on the north side close by him and still nearer the altar was laid hardicanute the last danish king who was brought hither

elys heart illustration south aisle of retrochoir with beauforts and foxs chantries sb bolas co photo eastward of the feretory the building is known by the name of the retrochoir and presents a very old and pure example of early english work from the hands of bishop de lucy the aisles are said to have been used as a model in the building of salisbury cathedral similar processional aisles may be seen also at hereford on a minor scale this part of the cathedral is lower and consequently appears broader than the more westerly portion there is a considerable amount of wallspace only interrupted by the numerous imposing chantries erected on the floor the lower part of the walls is remarkable for some fine though simple blank arcading dating also from de lucys time while light is given by pairs of lancet windows the rear arches being borne on groups of detached shafts many of the original chased tiles of the pavement remain to this day and in fact there has been little interference with de lucys work unfortunately however as has been remarked much of it has settled considerably throwing the southeastern angle altogether out of the perpendicular one vaultingshaft having in this manner been bent back and cracked in half the effects of the subsidence can easily be seen in the photograph of the south aisle of the retrochoir looking toward the east as one passes beyond the feretory through the retrochoir the chantry of william waynflete stands to the north of the central alley the canopy is very elaborate and beautiful and plentiful traces of the original colour still can be seen especially on the groining on each side are three flatheaded arches those at the east end being closed while on each side of the piers adjoining the west end there are narrow open arches corniced and battlemented screens fill these arches to midheight the figure on the tomb is a modern restoration very elaborately clad in full pontificals while the hands are clasped about a heart representing the sursum corda or lifting up of the heart the chantry is kept in repair by magdalen college oxford which waynflete founded its situation like that of the companion tomb of cardinal beaufort makes it very impressive there is no altar now at the east end is a blank wall surmounted by three empty canopied niches while at the other are two open gratings in the corresponding position to the south is the chantry of cardinal beaufort now kept in repair by the dukes of beaufort in brittons time as he tells us there had fallen a horseload of the pinnacles in the canopy of cardinal beauforts chantry owing however to the extreme elaboration the effect is hardly impaired by this loss the plan of the tomb is two groups of four clustered piers at each end supporting a mass of canopies niches and pinnacles which bewilder the sight and senses by their number and complexity as britton quaintly says the screen at the west end is closed that at the east end open the vault displays some elaborate fantracery the body of the cardinal is presented in his scarlet official robes and the tasselled and corded hat and the serenity of his face suggests very little the traditional portrait of him as represented for example in shakespeares henry v his deathbed moments it is well known have been much misrepresented the inscription originally on his tomb has been destroyed but godwin quotes one sentence of it thustribularer si nescirem misericordias tuas against the north wall not far from waynfletes chantry is an unknown tomb with part of an effigy to the east of which is the grave of one william symonds gentleman of winchester twice maior and alderman as his epitaph of 1616 relates the last four lines of the inscription run as follows his merrit doth enherit life and fame for whilst this city stands symonds his name in alle mens harts shall never be forgotten for poores prayers rise when flesh lyes rotten between the same chantry and the wall lies the tomb of bishop de rupibus while in the space between the chantries of beaufort and waynflete lies the only ancient military effigy in the cathedral a genuine relic of the fourteenth century it is commonly known as william de foix and represents in a slightly mutilated form a knight in surcoat and complete ringed armour of the thirteenth century his legs are crossed5 and the feet rest on a crouching lion while the head is supported on two cushions which were formerly held up by angels the right hand grasps the sword hilt and the pointed shield one of the earliest examples of a quartered shield bears quarterly in the first and fourth the arms of bearn two cows passant gorged with collars and bells in the second and third three garbs over all a cross on the front edge of the slab mr fj baigent discovered the name petrus gavston or gauston twice encised but to this scribbling mr weston s walford who has a note on this tomb in the fifteenth volume of the archeological journal does not attach much importance for it may merely record the engravers conjecture as to the person here buried the body of edward iis favourite piers was moved from oxford to kings langley in hertfordshire two years after his execution and buried there on january 2 1314 in the presence of the king it is not known to have been moved since it seems probable that the effigy here is that of the father of the piers known to us a sir arnold de gavaston a record of whose interment at winchester in may 1302 we possess with the additional fact that edward i sent money and two pieces of cloth of gold to the funeral such respect would naturally be paid to the father of edward iis fosterbrother mr walford suggests that the garbs on the shield are a canting allusion to the name gabaston or gavaston for the spelling varies very muchgaveston gaverston and gaberston being also found the date of the tomb mr walford places between the death of arnold in 1302 and the murder of his son in 1312 the tomb itself

the entrance to the chapel of the guardian angels is a fine monument somewhat mutilated to ethelmar or aymer de valence halfbrother of henry iii who was so unpopular a bishop at winchester only his heart is in the cathedral having been conveyed hither from paris where his body was buried the facts are commemorated by the following inscription on the presbytery wall corpus ethelmari cuius cor nunc tenet istud saxum parisiis morte datur tumulo obiit ad 1261 when winchester was attacked by the socalled religious zeal of the puritans ethelmars heart was disturbed as is recorded by a writer of the period who says that when the steps of the altar were levelling with the rest of the ground one of the workmen accidentally struck his mattock on this stone and broke it underneath which was an urn wherein the heart of this ethelmar was being enclosed in a golden cup which thing being conveyed to the ears of the committeemen they took the cup for their own use and ordered him to bury the heart in the north isle which he accordingly did the heart he goes on to say was so entire and uncorrupt that it was as fresh as if it had just been taken from the body and issued forth fresh drops of blood upon his hand this i had from the mouth of the workman himself whom i believe the slab which once covered the heart shows within the symbolic vesica in a trefoil canopy the halflength figure of

seats desks and screen are also of fine workmanship where the walls are not hidden by woodwork are the very faint remains of some curious old mural paintings of the miracles of the virgin executed under the direction of prior silkstede in 1489 these frescoes are decidedly archaic but they are extremely interesting starting from the south side the nineteen pictures represent 1 miracle of an

the southern window of the lady chapel has recently been filled with a memorial window to the late bishop thorold whose tomb lies in the cathedral precincts just below the new window in prereformation

dedication ceremony took place on august 7 1897 two years after the burial of bishop thorold at winchester of the two chapels which flank the lady chapel that to the north is the chapel of the guardian angels once the chantry of bishop adam de orlton of whom no memorial here exists though he is buried in the chapel this compartment is sometimes called the portland chapel owing to the fact that it contains on the south side the tomb of richard weston earl of portland who was treasurer to charles i a recumbent bronze statue by le sueur adorns the tomb while in the wall above are four tabernacles three of which contain mutilated busts probably representing members of his family a mural monument of bishop peter mews who is also interred here is marked by a crozier and mitre on the

henry vii at westminster on the groining at the junction of the ribs is carved bishop langtons rebus consisting of the musical sign for a long upon a tun while his motto laus tibi christe also occurs it is supposed that the magnificent carved vine on the upper part of the oakpanelling which runs round the chapel originally formed the rebus of langtons see the tun from which it sprang being now lost the woodwork which is certainly one of the most striking things in the cathedral is unfortunately mutilated as is also part of the heraldic work on the entrance door at the east end of the chapel above the former altar there is a row of seven tabernacles under which is a cornice which was originally gilt and painted the statues which once occupied the tabernacles are no longer extant the central tomb here is that of bishop langton himself queen marys chair now stands in this chapel it is in a wonderful state of preservation for its age and the woodwork is still sound the entrance to the crypts is in the north transept as was noted above they are three in number the main division stretching from the eastern towerpiers to the first piers of the retrochoir it consists of a central room divided by a row of five columns in the middle with an apsidal eastern termination and is flanked by two aisles with square eastern ends the well here is said to be considerably older than the building above it from this opens out a narrower crypt which also has five columns down the centre while its apse reaches to the eastern end of the retrochoir these crypts cannot as some have supposed and the tradition still survives form part of the old saxon church since it has been fairly established that the site of this was not that of the present building the plan of the chambers is in perfect accord as willis says with that of norman churches in general the main crypt shows by its circular apse what was the form of the east end in the old norman church the actual work is strikingly like that of the transepts the peculiar thin square abacus combined with a round capital being a noteworthy point in both these portions of the building the third crypt which is narrow like the second is rectangular in shape and its vaulting rests on columns it is early english in architecture and is contemporary with de lucys work in the upper part of the church in 1886 the crypts were to a great extent cleared out to their original level a vast quantity of rubbish being removed many fragments of early work still remain though in too mutilated a form to indicate where they originally stood the stained glass at winchester can perhaps best be treated separately from the windows which it occupies most of the information may be found summed up in a paper addressed to the archological association in september 1845 by mr c winston two circles of early decorated glass are to be seen in the west window but they are merely composed of coloured pieces arranged in geometrical patterns the general arrangement of the great window is as has been already said kaleidoscopic the fragments which compose it being too scattered to admit of being put together again in their original form the effect however is striking particularly at some distance from the west end there are remains of the original glass in the west windows of the aisles and in the first window from the west in the south aisle but the edingdon windows in the north aisle have lost their glass the glass in the above windows consists of the heads of canopies though in the west window some of the original figures are still to be seen this is the earliest perpendicular glass in the cathedral and may date from edingdons time next in date is the glass in the other windows of the nave aisles and clerestory windows a little later than that in the west window and of the same character as that at new college oxford in the north south and west windows of this glass apparently four figures and part of their canopies have been removed to the first window from the east in the choir clerestory the heads of the three westerly windows to the north of the choir clerestory showing canopywork and cherubim come next in date with eight canopied figures in the upper tier of the two easterly windows on the south of this clerestory the latter seem to have come originally from some other window being too short for their present situation their date may be about the end of the reign of henry vi the east window of the choir may be a little earlier than 1525 and has introduced in it bishop foxs arms and motto est deo gracia this window has been much disturbed the top central light being filled with glass of wykehams period while little of foxs glass seems to be in its original position to fox also may be attributed part of the aisle windows north and south of the choir and some canopies in the side windows of the choir clerestory some late glass much mutilated may be seen in the east window of the lady chapel warner says of the two large windows that the great east window is remarkable for the beauty of its painted glass which contains the portraits of saints and of some bishops of this see it is whole and entire the west window is magnificent but much inferior to this illustration one of the mortuary chests in the choir screen see mortuary chests in chapter iii from a drawing by reginald blomfield in his history of renaissance architecture in england bell 1897 chapter iv history of the see the west saxon kingdom of which s birinus became the first bishop included the counties of surrey berkshire sussex hampshire dorset devon and somerset when birinus was consecrated by the bishop of milan he was not assigned any exact territorial jurisdiction as was only natural seeing that he was a missionary to a littleknown land he met however with a rapid success and in 635 performed the baptism of cynegils king of the west saxons on the day of his marriage to the daughter of the northumbrian king the town of dorchester on the borders of mercia was immediately assigned to birinus as a bishops seat but when aegelberht had succeeded him the next king cenwalh made a division of the kingdom into two distinct dioceses of dorchester and winchester the new creation being assigned in 661 to wina who however succeeded to the whole of the original diocese as aegelberht appears to have left england in disgust eleutherius winas successor continued to hold the still united offices at dorchester and it was not until hedda became bishop about 679 ad that winchester was really made the seat of a diocese even hedda continued to rule all from winchester and not before his death was a permanent division of sees carried out winchester retained surrey sussex and the southampton district while the other counties were assigned to sherbornedorchester which belonged more properly to mercia having been taken away as there was no longer the same need of an inland centre to the see with four bishops now in mercia sussex was also taken from the winchester diocese during the episcopacy of daniel heddas successor and by way of compensation he was only able to add the isle of wight hitherto unattached to any see when the west saxon kingdom became in the ninth century practically the kingdom of england winchester of course assumed a very important position s swithun who was chosen as bishop in 852 had great influence with king ethelwulf and his cathedral correspondingly became an object of veneration the see suffered however from the danish raids which occurred during the next two reigns but with bishop athelwold its prestige was quite restored to him is due the establishment of a benedictine monastery at winchester the previous convent having been one of secular and noncelibate canons with the supremacy of the danes we find cnut both elected king and subsequently buried at winchester edward the confessor moreover was crowned in the cathedral on easter day 1043 so that winchester maintained its position well up to this date further invasions of the northmen then very much wasted the south coast and gradually winchester began to yield its pride of place to westminster however the town remained a place of considerable importance for as mr h hall says in his antiquities of the exchequer although westminster possessed an irresistible attraction to a pious sovereign through the vicinity of a favoured church norman kings engrossed in the pleasure of the chase and constantly embroiled in continental wars found the ancient capital of winchester better adapted for the pursuit of sport as well as for the maintenance of their foreign communications through the proximity of the great medival seaport southampton this traffic between london and the two hampshire towns passed through southwark which always had a close connection with winchester remaining even to this day in a modified degree the norman bishops if they found winchester no longer the chief town of england certainly added to the glory of the church by the erection and beautifying of a new cathedral immediately after the death of walkelin the first bishop of the conquering race there was a vacancy in the see which lasted for nine years owing to the vexed question of investiture when giffard was finally installed he displayed considerable activity among his other works he built the town residence of the bishops of winchester at southwark bishops waltham remained the principal residence until its destruction by waller in 1644 after which farnham castle took its place rumour says that there was a suggestion made of raising the see of winchester to the rank of an archbishopric during its tenure by that foremost of fighting churchmen henry de blois who certainly desired the elevation at any rate fuller says of henry that he outshined theobald archbishop of canterbury the popes consent however was not secured henry paid considerable attention to the temporal affairs of his see rebuilding the castles at farnham and wolvesey and founding the hospital of st cross he translated also the bodies of the old kings and bishops from the site of the saxon crypt the remains without inscriptions being placed in leaden sarcophagi mixed in hopeless confusion after henrys death there occurred another vacancy in the see ended at last by the admittance of toclive in 1174 ad with de lucys accession in 1189 we reach another epoch of building activity for not only was this bishop busy himself but also under his guidance there was instituted in 1202 as the winchester annalist records a confraternity to last for five years for repairing the cathedral de lucys work at the eastern end of the building is described elsewhere we should not omit to notice when considering the position of winchester that richard on his return from captivity in 1194 was recrowned here on the octave of easter day bishop de rupibus de lucys successor introduced preaching friars into england and set up at winchester in 1225 a dominican establishment while a few years later the franciscans were also established here both institutions have since vanished the middle of the thirteenth century was marked at winchester by continual struggles between king monks and pope as to the right of electing the bishop of winchester some record of these struggles will be found in the list of bishops of the see the contest about the election of de raleigh lasted five years and the king only finally accepted the monks choice after the pope and the king of france had also lent their influence on his behalf in 12647 the town rose up against the prior and convent burning and murdering under pretext of assisting the king the bishop being a partisan of de montfort after the battle of evesham the cathedral was laid under an interdict by the papal legate ottoboni and this was not removed until august 1267 with wykehams importance in the story of winchester we have dealt elsewhere his successor beaufort greatly enlarged the foundation of st cross adding to it his almshouse of noble poverty it is a remarkable fact that these two bishops and waynflete the founder of magdalen college oxford between them occupied the see for no less than 120 years the history of this period as far as the cathedral is concerned is mainly architectural and therefore uneventful in comparison with that of the earlier times the intervals whose history is less stirring however fortunately leave far better marks on the actual buildings than do the more eventful epochs and the fact that cardinal wolsey once was bishop of winchester could not be gathered from the cathedral itself indeed he never visited the town at all during the course of his episcopatea circumstance which is perhaps hardly to be regretted in 1500 pope alexander issued a bull separating the channel islands from their former see of coutances which was now no longer english territory and attaching them to the see of salisbury this was afterwards altered to winchester says canon benham but from some cause which does not appear the transfer was never made until 1568 after the reformed liturgy has been established in the islands the cathedral itself received architectural additions during this period from bishops courtenay and langton their priors and bishop fox when in henry viiis reign the former town of southwark had either been conveyed to the city or had become the kings property the latter being such parts as had previously been the holding of canterbury the clink or the bishop of winchesters liberty was not interfered with the result of this was that the clink became the home of the early playhousesthe globe hope rose and swansince within the city bounds actors were not allowed to carry on their profession in mr t fairman ordishs early london theatres the extent to which the first theatres flourished in the winchester liberty may be clearly seen the early reformation period at winchester led to a great impoverishment of the see so much so that the second william of wickham 15945 ventured in a sermon preached before the queen to say that should the see continue to suffer such rapine as it had already undergone in her reign there would soon be no means to keep the roof on the cathedral building we do not know that this remonstrance produced much effect for the cathedral and its revenues underwent many losses after this the ravages of the parliamentarians however which were the most serious have been alluded to elsewhere it appears from the old valor printed 1685 which was quoted by browne willis in his survey of the cathedrals of 1742 that some dioceses about calais used once to belong to winchester we learn also from browne willis that in his time the see of winchester contained the whole county of southampton with the isle of wight and one parish in wiltshire viz wiltesbury it has also all surrey except 11 churches in croyden deanry which are peculiars of the see of canterbury here are two archdeacons viz 1 winchester valued at 61l 15s 2d for firstfruits which has all the deanries in the county of southampton and the isle of wight 2 surrey which has all the deanries in the county of surrey the corps of which is the rectory of farnham and it is rated for firstfruits at 91l 3s 6d the subsequent history of the see is mainly bound up with political and theological questions which need not be touched on here it may however be mentioned that the ecclesiastical commission of 18367 readjusted the boundaries of the diocese while in 1846 there were transferred to london the following districtsbattersea bermondsey camberwell clapham graveney lambeth merton rotherhithe southwark streatham tooting and wandsworth this rearrangement still left winchester the largest rural diocese in england chapter v the bishops of winchester winchester boasts a very long list of bishops as compared with many of our english cathedrals but the details about a great number of them are most scanty the exact year from which the history of the diocese should be dated is not certain but it is to be placed somewhere during the reign of ine over the west saxons under bishop eleutherius to whom hedda succeeded the kingdom of wessex was still but a single diocese the removal of the see from dorchester to winchester was rendered necessary by the extension of the mercian rule which made the former town unsuitable for a west saxon see the date of the change simultaneous with the moving of the bones of s birinus is fixed by rudborne at 683 but according to recent authorities it would appear to be earlier hedda 679705 was at any rate the first bishop of winchester properly speaking though he was the fourth successor to s birinus as his most recent biographer says hedda was a man of much personal holiness and was zealous in the discharge of his episcopal duties he is reckoned a saint his day being 30 july many miracles were worked at his tomb he figures on the reredos as restored in accordance with the original design daniel 705744 had the misfortune to see his diocese considerably docked in order to form the see of sherbourne he resigned by reason of loss of eyesight in 744 according to some accounts ethelwulf afterwards king of wessex and father of alfred succeeded him but this story certainly lacks proof though ethelwulf seems to have been educated at winchester hunferth or humfredus 744754 like most of the immediately succeeding bishops has his place of interment at winchester recorded by john of exeter cyneheard became bishop of winchester in 754 his successors during the next century were aethelheard ecbald circ 790 dudda 793 cyneberht circ 799 almund or ealhmund circ 803 wigthegen circ 824 hereferth 829833 edmund 833 and helmstan of none of these do we know much and their dates cannot be assigned with any certainty with s swithun 852862 who was first prior and afterwards bishop we come upon one of the names especially connected with the history of the church it is however to be feared that it is not so much because of his fame in churchbuilding and his acts of humanity that he will be remembered as for the popular superstition which asserts that the weather for forty days after his feastday on july 15 is dry or rainy according to its state on that day the legend is said to be based on the fact that the removal of his body from a vile and unworthy place where his grave might be trampled upon by every passenger and received the droppings from the eaves to the golden shrine in the cathedral was delayed by a long continuance of wet weather similar legends to explain a wet summer are found elsewhere in europe the saint was translated says rudborne in the 110th year of his rest and for his glory so great was the concourse of people and so numerous and frequent the miracles that the like was never witnessed in england a figure representing s swithun seems once to have stood in a niche at the apex of the gable of the west front he was succeeded by alhferth or ealhfrith 863871 translated to canterbury tunbriht or dunbert whose name was latinised as tunbertus 871879 denewulf 879909 whom a singularly incredible legend asserts to have been the swineherd in whose cottage alfred allowed his hostesss cakes to burn frithstan 909931 byrnstan 931934 aelfheah or elphege 934951 aelfsige 951958 who was nominated to canterbury but died in the snow while crossing the alps on his way to rome for his pallthe only fact which is really known about him and brithelm 958963 next came the holy athelwold a great builder of churches and of various other works both when he was abbot and after when he became bishop of winchester wolstan he seems to have moved the bodies of swithun and other saints to a more suitable restingplace than they had hitherto enjoyed of athelwolds building operations at winchester wolstans account is quoted on page 6 he held the see of winchester for twentyone years 963984 and he was by birth a native of the town it was said of him that he was terrible as a lion to the rebellious but gentler than a dove to the meek elphege or aelfheah 9841005 his successor to whom wolstans account of athelwold is addressed was martyred in 1012 by the danes while archbishop of canterbury where his tomb subsequently received great honours aelfheahs great work was spent in the conversion of the northmen or danish invaders of england cenwulf or kenulf 10051006 is allowed three years by rudborne but apparently wrongly another athelwold or ethelwold 10061015 and aelfsige 10151032 are not of great importance aelfwine or alwyn 10321037 called by anglosaxon chroniclers the kings priest seems to have been a monk of s swithuns monastery and also chaplain to cnut before he was elevated to winchester the legend which makes him the lover of emma widow of aethelred and cnut and mother of edward the confessor has been declared unhistorical but at any rate the story of her ordeal when she walked blindfold and barefoot over nine redhot ploughshares was once celebrated it is a curious coincidence that the bones of queen and bishop were deposited by bishop fox in the same chest aelfwines remains being exhumed from his grave to the south of the high altar to be placed in a leaden sarcophagus above the cryptdoor stigand 10471069 was chiefly remarkable it appears for his avarice especially shown in his retention of winchester after his election to canterbury he received the pall in 1058 from the antipope benedict x so that he was never regarded as the rightful possessor of the dignities he enjoyed the normans refusing to recognise him except as bishop of winchester his wealth attracted the attention of william the conqueror and by a council held at winchester after easter 1070 stigand was deposed some reports state that he was cast into prison where he died of voluntary starvation and that on his body was found a key of a casket containing the clue to great hidden treasures which the king appropriated giving from them says rudborne a great silver cross with two images but the cross is generally called stigands he was buried in a leaden sarcophagus to the south of the high altar walkelin 10701098 was related by blood to the conqueror and was brother of simeon prior of winchester and afterwards abbot of ely he was the first of the norman bishops and signalised his incumbency by rebuilding the cathedral from its very foundations as the norman ecclesiastics frequently did he figures more largely in the architectural history of the cathedral than in its historical records and his work has been described elsewhere walkelin was buried in the nave before the roodloft where stood the great silver cross william giffard 11001129 succeeded after an interregnum such as occurred in many sees during the reign of william rufus he founded s mary overy now s saviours southwark as well as the bishops residence in the same district before his death he became a monk henry de blois 11291171 was grandson of the conqueror and younger brother of stephen afterwards king of england although an ecclesiastic from his youth he was by no means a man of peace or a mere scholar and theologian vir animosus et audax says giraldus during his prelacy he influenced greatly the secular history of his time in the quarrel between matilda and stephen henry at first recognised matilda but subsequently as the foremost power in the church and a strong partisan of his brother he lent his weight against the empress and with the aid of roger of salisbury and other bishops gained the crown for stephen on whitsunday 1162 henry de blois consecrated thomas becket as archbishop and it is said that when king henry visited him just before his death he was reproved by the bishop for his murder of becket henry de blois was certainly a militant churchman but in an age not conspicuous for such virtues we are told his private life was pure and he laboured steadfastly for the good of his diocese the winchester annalist says of him never was man more chaste and prudent more compassionate or more earnest in transacting ecclesiastical matters or in beautifying churches his great foundation was the still existing hospital of st cross richard toclive 11741188 was elected by the monks after the see had been vacant three years he was strongly against becket having even been excommunicated by him yet after the archbishop was murdered and canonised he dedicated to him several new churches at portsmouth newport and elsewhere he founded a small hospital at winchester dedicated to s mary magdalene which by the time of charles ii had become a ruin and was pulled down in 1788 its norman doorway may be seen in the roman catholic chapel in s peters street godfrey de lucy 11891204 was son of richard de lucy grand justiciary of england and a great benefactor to the priory of lesnes in kent founded by his father de lucys work at winchester is a fine specimen of early english architecture and consists of what is known as the retrochoir where he was buried in accordance with the practice of interring a founder amid his work the large slab of grey marble without inscription which marks his grave was willis tells us by a slight confusion of tradition pointed out by former vergers as the tomb of king lucius peter de la roche or de rupibus 12041238 sprang from a knightly family in poitou and was consecrated bishop of winton at rome in 1205 he was a hot and unscrupulous partisan of king john in spite of the latters scornful treatment of the church and in 1214 when john had submitted to innocent iii peter was made grand justiciary of england much against the wish of the english nobles he became guardian of the young henry iii coming often into conflict with henry de burgh peter was in many ways a type of the norman ecclesiastic so hated by the people but according to matthew paris he fought bravely in the holy land whither he led a body of crusaders in 1226 he founded the domus dei at portsmouth some portions of which still exist in the garrison chapel and also the monastery at selborne described by gilbert white he died at farnham castle in june 1238 william de raleigh 12441249 came from the see of norwich to that of winchester he was elected by the monks in 1238 but as explained elsewhere it was six years before he gained possession though confirmed in his office by the pope he retired to france then under the rule of louis ix until henry at length gave way raleigh however did not live to enjoy his honours long dying during a stay at tours in 1249 ethelmar or aymer de valence 12501261 who succeeded him was halfbrother of henry iii being son of the count of la marche who married johns widow as a native of poitou his appointment was as unpopular as that of de roches and moreover he is said to have been only an acolyte when henry forced the monks to accept him as their bishop at first he was only styled bishopelect of winchester and he was not consecrated until ascension day 1260 even before his appointment we are told that his revenues exceeded those of the archbishop of canterbury and he was permitted to retain them his tyranny and greed provoked the oxford parliament in 1258 to expel him from the kingdom and he fled to france dying three years later in paris while on his return from rome to england for he had induced the pope to espouse his cause and consecrate him john of exeter or john gervase 12651268 was appointed by the pope on the death of aymer in preference to two rivals whose election was disputed he is accused of having purchased his elevation he assisted the barons in the civil war and after simon de montforts failure was suspended and cited to appear at rome where he

translated hither from worcester by the pope against the kings wishes he has the most unenviable notoriety of having been the bishop of hereford who instigated the brutal murder of edward ii on september 21 1327 he had been accused of high treason and deprived of hereford but was restored thereto by the barons edward iii apparently at length received him into favour but orleton went blind some years before his death he is buried in the chapel of the guardian angels william edingdon 13461366 though chiefly notable for his architectural work at winchester was treasurer of england in 1350 and chancellor seven years later he might had he wished it have become archbishop of canterbury but preferred winchester he began the great remodelling of the nave and dying before much of the work was done left certain property as appears from his will for carrying on the work though it is also said that a claim was made against his executors with regard to the dilapidations of the see his general reputation was as a biographer says that he loved the kings advantage more than that of the community he founded a convent of bonhommes at his native village of edingdon in wiltshire where the church building or rather rebuilding is due chiefly to him he was buried in his own chantry in the cathedral his monkish epitaph as warner calls it runs thus edyndon natus wilhelmus hic est tumulatus

eorum mc tribus junctum post lxv sit i punctum octava sanctum notat hunc octobris inunctum william of wykeham 13671404 whose name has become so identified with winchester cathedral and college was probably a native of the village of wykeham near litchfield born in 1324 after education at winchester and oxford he was in 1346 presented to the king edward iii at the age of twentythree with no other advantages than his skill in architecture and the courtly attribute of a courtly person in the course of the next twentyone years he rose rapidly filling various offices until he became bishop of winchester and lord high chancellor of england his first recorded appointment is to the clerkship of all the kings works near windsor and in the same year he was surveyor of the new buildings there including the round tower and the eastern ward of the castle and a college to the west for the order of the garter occupying the site of the ancient domus regis close to the present s georges chapel on one of the towers the inscription this made wykeham may or may not be meant to convey a double meaning but it is certainly true that his architectural successes furthered his fortunes in 1357 he received the tonsure and in 1360 was made dean of s martins le grand archdeacon of lincoln northampton and buckingham and provost of wells in 1361 he commenced queenborough castle on the island of sheppey this important edifice covering over three acres of ground was demolished about 1650 the castles of winchester porchester wolvesey ledes and dover with many others are believed to have been either entirely rebuilt or at least enlarged by him he was only ordained priest five years before his elevation to winchester in 1394 he undertook the great reformation of the cathedral which is dealt with in another part of this book new college sainte mary of wynchestre oxford opened by wykeham on april 14 1386 effected almost as great a revolution in university education as his famous college at winchester did for the training of boys as dr ingram has pointed out the very title of new college which has clung to it shows how completely a new collegiate system was established by its foundation which served as a model for future endowments his wellknown mottochosen when his growing dignity made it necessary for him to possess armorial bearingsmanners makyth man has generally been taken to mean that virtue alone is true nobility lord campbell however would have us rather interpret manners as the studied etiquette of courts and the polished courtesy which lord chesterfield held so important a factor in success willis styles it a somewhat radical sentiment at the time in his own day the secular arts wykeham practised did not meet with universal approval for wiclif alludes to him when he observes they wullen not present a clerk able of gods word and holy ensample but a kitchen clerk or a penny clerk or one wise in building castles and other worldly doings but despite this objection the whole of wykehams biographers contemporary or posthumous agree in praising him as highly as fuller who says that his benefaction to learning is not to be paralleled by any english subject in all particulars and his great innovation whereby elementary education was taken from the hands of the monks and as in his own college established upon an entirely different plan would alone stamp him as one whose foresight was far beyond his own times he influenced the nation in a way not easy to overestimate inasmuch as he originated or at least carried into execution the idea of the great public school as englishmen understand it and by the building of winchester college founded the institution he had long meditated in a way worthy of his design previously to the actual construction of the college he had maintained in temporary shelters numbers of poor students on the death of the black prince whose fortunes he had vigorously espoused and the assumption of power by john of gaunt wykeham was impeached on the charge of embezzling the royal revenues accepting bribes and the like and the king laid hands on the temporalities of his see but almost the last act of edward iii was to restore what he had seized to the bishop under certain conditions which show the great wealth of the latter milman in his latin christianity does full justice to the splendid munificent prelate blameless in character who devoted his vast riches to the promotion of learning and says that though his endeavour to maintain the hierarchical power over humanity was bitterly opposed by wiclif the religious of england may well be proud of both wykeham was eighty years of age when he died and his body lies in the chantry erected by his orders on the south side of the nave henry of beaufort 14051447 who followed wykeham in the bishopric was the second son of john of gaunt by catharine swynford and uncle of henry v in 1398 at the early age of twentyone he was made bishop of lincoln and in 1404 was translated to winchester during the reign of henry v he thrice filled the office of chancellor in 1417 when ostensibly on pilgrimage to the holy land he was present at the council of constance which was then considering the affairs of the church at this time he was offered the cardinals hat by martin v and appointed papal legate but the bestowal of this dignity on him was resented by the english monarch who commanded him to surrender his office at winchester which he declared was forfeited by his becoming a cardinal the dispute however was arranged and the haughty cardinal more like a soldier than a man of the church formally received his hat at calais in 1426 in the following year he led a crusade against the followers of huss in bohemia where during the retreat of the great army from mies he alone at the head of a band of english crusaders endeavoured but in vain to arrest the utter rout the death of henry v brought about a fierce rivalry between the two great uncles humphrey duke of gloucester and the cardinal bishop of winchester lasting until the death of the former which only occurred six weeks before that of beaufort himself during the halfcentury of his rule at winchester he rebuilt st cross and founded the almshouse of noble poverty shakespeare has made beaufort a prominent figure in parts i and ii of henry vi but for dramatic reasons perhaps he is painted very much blacker than he deserved that he was a militant ecclesiastic scheming and unscrupulous is no doubt true but he was a statesman and possessed firmness of purpose fertility of resource and confidence in those whom he selected to carry out his designs his wealth was very great for he was able to lend his nephew the king 20000 besides spending an enormous amount in charities including 400000 devoted to the inmates of london prisons william of waynfleete 14471486 a student in wykehams colleges at winchester and oxford was first master of winchester college then made provost of eton in 1443 and in 1447 succeeded beaufort in the bishopric of winchester from 1449 to 1459 like his predecessor he held the chancellors seal and during the wars of the roses was a firm adherent of henry vi his death took place in 1486 he founded magdalen college oxford and possibly influenced henry in his endowment of kings college cambridge and eton waynfleete appears to have been a man of great piety and learning and as milman observes his actions in advancing nonmonastic institutions reveal a sagacious foreknowledge of the coming changes in the temporal power of the church and were planned to maintain its supremacy in ways better adapted to the new spirit which soon after his death caused the downfall of the religious houses the effigy of this bishop in his chantry in the retrochoir has been restored peter courtenay 14861492 was translated from exeter to winchester but at neither see has he left any mark on the history the architectural work of his period being due chiefly to his priors thomas langton 14931500 translated hither from salisbury where he was active against the adherents of wiclif was chosen in 1500 to occupy the see of canterbury but he died of the plague before his translation and was buried in his chantry to the south of the lady chapel he seems to have been enthusiastic in the cause of education since he is said to have himself superintended the teaching of boys in his town richard fox 15001528 was bishop successively of exeter bath and wells and durham before he was appointed to winchester great confidence was reposed in him by henry vii who chose him as godfather of the future henry viii to fox is attributed the introduction of wolsey to the king yet this appears to have failed to win him the cardinals gratitude for according to fuller all thought bishop fox to die too soon only one excepted who conceived him to live too long thomas wolsey who gaped for his bishopric with hugh oldham bishop of exeter fox was jointfounder of corpus christi college oxford the pelican in her piety which appears on the college arms being borne by the bishop his fine chantry and the reconstruction of the choir aisles bear witness to his interest in the fabric of his cathedral and he is otherwise noted for the assistance he gave to various foundations illustration carving on choir stall in lady chapelbishop foxs work from a drawing by hp clifford thomas wolsey 15291530 at length gained the coveted see which he held in commendam with the archbishopric of york but only for one year stephen gardiner 15311555 another of the more famous prelates who have held this see is said to have been the illegitimate son of bishop lionel woodville of salisbury brotherinlaw of edward iv fuller in one of his favourite conceits says that gardiner retained in his wit and quick apprehension the sharpness of the air at his birthplace of bury st edmunds in 1529 he became archdeacon of norwich and owing to his services to cardinal wolsey and henry viii was appointed to winchester on the whole he managed to keep on good terms with the king but his famous six articles in support of the real presence sent so many to the stake that the title of the bloody statute has clung to them during the reign of edward vi he was kept prisoner in the tower and in 1550 was deprived of his bishopric which was restored to him on the accession of mary whom he crowned at westminster he performed also the marriage service of mary and philip of spain mentioned on page 13 his malice says fuller was like what is commonly said of white powder which surely discharged the bullet yet made no report being secret in all his acts of cruelty this made him often chide bonner calling him ass though not so much for killing poor people as for not doing it more cunningly cruel and vengeful as he was it is yet possible that he has been rather unjustly accused of personal delight in his victims sufferings but while the persecutions under mary continue to be the worst chapter of english church history the hammer of heretics as he was called will always continue to be execrated on his deathbed at westminster in 1555 he is reported to have said i have sinned with peter but i have not wept with him it has indeed been held that in his latter days he was half a protestant at heart though this is difficult to establish there is preserved a rather amusing appeal of gardiner to the privy council dating from 1547 he had intended to hold in southwark a solemn dirge and mass in memory of henry viii and writes to complain that the players who flourished in the neighbourhood say that they will also have a solemne playe to trye who shal have most resorte they in game or i in earnest during gardiners imprisonment by edward vi john poynet once cranmers chaplain held his see as the author of on politique power 1558 where he pleads that it is lawful to kill a tyrant and uses some very immoderate language poynet may be remembered but as an ecclesiastic he has left only a discreditable record in his short term of office he died in 1556 in germany whither he had retired on the roman catholic revival john white 15561559 who succeeded gardiner was deposed by queen elizabeth he was born at farnham and educated at winchester though personally he appears to have been pious during his tenure of the see four burnings of religious opponents took place in the diocese richard horne 15601580 was a very vigorous supporter of the reformed religion and suffered consequently under mary he appears to have been very fanatical against the use of vestments pictures and ornaments of all kinds he may have pulled down the monastic buildings at winchester less from a mistaken zeal than from motives of economy but his reputation in this respect is very bad john watson 15801583 formerly a doctor of medicine only held the see for three years thomas cooper 15831594 was ordained on the accession of elizabeth his protestancy hindering him from taking holy orders under mary his preaching abilities rapidly secured his promotion to the see of lincoln in 1570 and winchester thirteen years later he was buried in the choir but his monument has disappeared he engaged in controversies both with the recusants and with the puritans william wickham 15941595 who also came from lincoln to winchester only held the see for ten weeks william day 15951596 brotherinlaw of the preceding was provost of eton for no less than thirtyfour years but he died eight months after his elevation to winchester thomas bilson 15971616 though called by anthony wood as reverend and learned a prelate as england ever afforded and the author of several theological works has left little behind him at winchester james montagu 16161618 may also be briefly dismissed bilsons on the perpetual government of christs church and montagus latin translation of the writings of james i can hardly be said to have made them famous montagus tomb is in bath abbey lancelot andrewes 16191626 is the most celebrated of the postreformation bishops who have held the see he was made bishop of chichester in 1605 bishop of ely in 1609 and moved to winchester nine years later as a pious and austere man a powerful preacher an angel in the pulpit he was called a scholar versed in patristic literature and a polemical writer he is well known miltons elegy suffices to prove the great respect and admiration which he inspired in his contemporaries and he held a considerable influence over james i but his manual of devotion is the only volume of all his writings that can fairly be said to have become a classic in any sense of the word andrewes died at winchester house southwark on september 11 1626 and his tomb is at s saviours southwark in the lady chapel whither it was moved on the destruction of the chapel to the east of the building where it was originally placed richard neile 16271631 son of a tallowchandler though of good descent became bishop of rochester 1608 lichfield and coventry 1610 durham 1617 winchester 1627 and archbishop of york 1631 he was censured by the house of commons together with archbishop laud as inclined to arminianism and favouring popish doctrines and ceremonies walter curle 16321650 who came next was deprived of his see during the civil war like neile he was a follower of laud he is best remembered in the winchester of today for his cutting of the passage known as the slype brian duppa 16601662 chaplain to charles i and tutor to his sons was appointed to chichester in 1638 having previously been dean at oxford in 1641 he was translated to salisbury but during the commonwealth he retired to richmond where he lived in solitude until the restoration when he obtained the see of winchester an allusion to him during his first year here may be found in pepys who in his diary for october 4 1660 says i and lieut lambert to westminster where we saw dr frewen translated to the archbishoprick of york here i saw the bishops of winchester bangor rochester bath and wells and salisbury all in their habits in king henry viis chapel but lord at their going out how people did most of them look upon them as strange creatures and few with any kind of love or respect duppa was however we are informed a man of such exemplary piety lively conversation and excess of good nature that when charles i was in prison at carisbrooke castle he thought himself happy in the company of so good a man he died in 1662 at richmond where an almshouse founded by him bears over its gate the inscription i will pay my vow which i made to god in my trouble and was buried at westminster abbey in abbot islips chapel where a tablet records his adherence to his two kings george morley 16621684 a constant supporter of charles i was much favoured by him until his death on the scaffold from this point he lived in exile until the restoration when he was created bishop of worcester in 1660 and was chosen to be one of the revisers of the liturgy in 1662 he succeeded duppa at winchester he restored farnham castle the palace of the bishops at a cost of 8000 obtained winchester house chelsea for the see and founded the college for widows of the clergy near the close at winchester he died at farnham castle in 1684 bishop morley was an acquaintance of isaak walton the angler whose guest he was after parliament had expelled him from his see the cathedral library owes its being to a bequest from morley to the dean and chapter and their successors peter mews 16841706 bishop of bath and wells in 1672 took part personally in the civil war attaining the rank of captain and followed charles ii to flanders in 1648 even long after his ordination he retained his martial spirit for as bishop of winchester he personally took part in the battle of sedgmoor against the followers of monmouth and received a wound he died in 1706 and was buried in the cathedral jonathan trelawney baronet 17071721 was one of the famous seven bishops who underwent trial in the reign of james ii he was before his occupancy of the see of winchester bishop of bristol and of exeter during his episcopacy the cathedral received some questionable adornments including the grecian urns in the niches of the reredos now fortunately removed charles trimnell 17211723 was a very energetic whig and a strong opponent of the once famous sacheverell he only spent two years at winchester his term being cut short by death richard willis 17231734 was bishop successively of gloucester salisbury and winchester but he has left little by which he may be remembered benjamin hoadley 17341761 was a zealous partisan of religious liberty and a strenuous low churchman he occupied in turn the bishoprics of bangor hereford salisbury and winchester during his tenure of the firstnamed see he started the famous bangorian controversy by the publication of a tract and a sermon in which he denied the existence of a visible church of christ in which any one more than another has authority either to make new laws for christs subjects or to impose a sense upon the old ones or to judge censure or punish the servants of another master in matters relating purely to conscience or salvation as a result of the heated discussion of the matter in convocation that body was virtually suspended for a century and a half pope ridicules hoadley for his verbose eloquence speaking of hoadley with his periods of a mile he was however a great favourite of george i whose private chaplain he became on that kings accession and it was under royal protection that he published the works which gave rise to the great controversy john thomas 17611781 was tutor to george iii he was called by his successor a man of most amiable character and a polite scholar and it is difficult to say much more about him hon brownlow north 17811826 was halfbrother of lord north to whom he owed a rapid preferment in 1771 when he was thirty years of age he was made bishop of coventry and lichfield in 1774 bishop of worcester at winchester he spent over 6000 on farnham castle and during his time 40000 was devoted to the restoration of the cathedral but the result cannot be commended george pretyman tomline baronet 18201827 had a distinguished university career and was the author of several theological works charles sumner 18271869 came to winchester after a year at llandaff he was a vigorous supporter of the evangelical party during his term of office the boundaries of his see were readjusted and contracted samuel wilberforce 18691873 third son of the celebrated abolitionist william wilberforce was translated to winchester from oxford where for twentyfive years he was bishop his record at winchester is neither so long nor so important as at oxford where he successfully passed through the troubles of the tractarian movement his death was occasioned by a fall when he was out riding with lord granville since the death of bishop wilberforce the see has been occupied by three bishops whose names alone need be given here for their records will be fresh in the memories of all edward harold brown 18731890 who came from ely to winchester antony wilson thorold 18901895 whose tomb lies outside the cathedral close to the new memorial south window of the lady chapel randall thomas davidson 1895 the present occupant of the see illustration details of the font also see the norman font in chapter iii chapter vi other institutions connected with the cathedral it is hardly possible to conclude an account of winchester cathedral without briefly alluding to several places in the immediate neighbourhood which are more or less intimately connected with the church and its benefactors only four buildings however call for any detailed descriptionwolvesey castle the college hyde abbey and st cross wolvesey which is said to mean wolfs island is quite close to the east end of the cathedral it contained at one time a regular residence of the bishops of winchester the greater part of which was erected by henry de blois the remains of this castle are very ruinous though the outer walls and the exterior of the keep are in good condition still woodward pointed out traces of a refectory with a norman arch and window the building more than once underwent attacks the earliest being during the struggle between stephen and matilda in which henry de blois took a vigorous part finally in 1646 cromwell practically destroyed it after it had held out against him in the royalist cause it served as the residence of many wellknown characters in history and among its bishops cardinal beaufort died there mary slept at wolvesey castle in 1554 before her marriage at winchester bishop morley commenced building a modern house close by the old site and subsequent bishops completed it only the middle portion of this with the tudor chapel now remains the southern end having been pulled down by bishop brownlow north the ruins of the castle can be seen from the top of the cathedral tower on wykehams charter for the incorporation of his new foundation seinte marie college of wynchestre is the date october 20 1382 but it seems that long before this date and up to the actual completion of the college buildings the bishop superintended the education of the boys for whom his institution was founded housing them in temporary structures in the meantimepossibly in s johns parish on s giles hill it has been suggested before wykehams time and indeed before the conquest it appears that the monks of s swithuns institution had a school at winchester at which no less celebrated a pupil than alfred the great was brought up we have already touched on the subject of wykehams ideas on education and the change which he brought about by his colleges at winchester and oxford and it is not necessary to go into the subject again the college buildings lie beyond the southern limits of the cathedral close on the south side of the narrow college street being entered by a gateway with an ancient statue of the virgin in the niche over it this door leads into the quadrangle about which are ranged various parts of the college a further arch under the tower in this court leads to a larger quadrangle in which are the chapel and the refectory or hall a room 63 feet by 30 with a groined oak roof and a dais at one end for the warden and fellows while at the other is the audit room which has some fifteenthcentury tapestry and an ironbound chest once belonging to william of wykeham beneath the hall is seventh chamber an early schoolroom beyond are cloisters and more buildings and then the meadows which run down to the itchen the niches over the second gateway contain figures of the virgin the angel gabriel and william of wykeham while the room below them is known as the election chamber where the annual election of scholars took place in the inner quadrangle the carvings over the windows should be noticed over the hall and kitchen entrance are the psaltery and bagpipe over kitchen window excess a head vomiting opposite a bursar as frugality with his ironbound moneychest over the masters windows are the pedagogue the listless scholar etc in the chapel which is 93 feet long by 30 wide and 57 high the perpendicular windows should be noticed and in particular the large east window the glass is declared by mr winston to be with the exception of a few pieces modern dating from 1824 while the jesse window is a very good copy of the old design in the vault wykehams wooden fantracery remains but there has been much change in the fittings of the chapel the old screen has gone and the reredos is a restoration the original stalls were removed as early as 1681 the tower had to be rebuilt in 1863 though the old stonework of 1470 was used where possible at the northeast end are the sacristy and muniment room in which the college charters etc are kept among the mss etc kept here are certain anglosaxon documents and charters of privileges from richard ii to charles ii a table of wykehams domestic expenses a thirteenth century vulgate in manuscript a briefe description of the newe founde lande of virginia by sir walter raleigh and a pedigree of henry vi tracing his descent from adam the chief relic of wykeham is a gold ring

burial of the fellows among the names cut in the walls may be seen the name of thos ken 1646 in the square formed by the cloisters is the chantry chapel built in 1420 converted into the library after edward vi had forbidden its use as a chapel and now used once more as a chapel for the junior scholars a portrait of wykeham the oldest on record is shown in the east window the glass of which dates

the upper part except an arched gateway with hoodmouldings and two royal corbelheads this gateway is in some walls that apparently were once part of the outbuildings of the abbey the body of alfred the great was brought hither in 1110 and must still be here though all traces of the tomb have now vanished utterly the institution which was a very wealthy one was not always on good terms with the cathedral authorities of whom it was of course independent a record is kept of a dispute between cardinal beaufort and the abbot of hyde in the dissolution of the monasteries under henry viii it was impossible that the riches of hyde abbey could escape and in 1538 pillage and violation overtook it the royal commissioners wrote that they intended to sweep away all the rotten bones that be called relices which we may not omit lest it should be thought that we came more for the treasure than for avoiding the abominations of idolatry probably thomas cromwell to whom they wrote understood how far the two motives influenced them and the king the monastic buildings did not altogether disappear until close on the end of last century when the materials were devoted to other purposes illustration st cross from the quadrangle photochrom co ltd photo the hospital of st cross the oldest almshouse in england lies one mile to the south of the town on the southampton road and may be reached from winchester across the fields for part of the way situated in the hamlet of sparkford it was founded originally by bishop henry de blois in 1136 on the site of a small monastery destroyed by the danes the founders wish was to give refuge to thirteen poor men feeble and so reduced in strength that they can hardly or with difficulty support themselves with anothers aid while a meal was daily to be provided for another hundred poor men the knights hospitallers in the person of their master raymund were in 1151 ad put in charge of the foundation they agreed so ill however with the bishops of the neighbouring cathedral that about 1200 the pope appointed a commission which transferred to the bishops the right of choosing the master the new arrangement did not work well for a little more than a century and a half afterwards the master was found to be robbing his charge to such an extent that the scandal was intolerable william of wykeham turning his attention to the matter a papal bull was procured ordering the use of the revenues for the benefit of the poor the next bishop cardinal beaufort added to the buildings by the foundation of the almshouse of noble poverty for the maintenance of two priests thirtyfive brethren and three sisters the master of the hospital was to be at its head otherwise the institutions were to be distinct but by the middle of the sixteenth century the hospital had practically absorbed the almshouse at the end of the next century in 1696 the master and brethren of the hospital made a public repudiation of their duties and commenced either to destroy the buildings or to convert them to other than their original uses and shortly after the southern side of beauforts quadrangle was pulled down the abuses were rectified in the middle of the present century and now a body of trustees under the control of the charity commissioners has the management of the two institutions all the endowments of the hospital are still intact illustration church of

is the refectory and beyond that the masters house the refectory has three twolight perpendicular windows a highpitched wooden roof and a minstrels gallery at the west end it is now only used as a dininghall on great occasions the masters house is thought to be the old hundred mennes hall but is now furnished with modern windows the cloister on the east side is of sixteenthcentury work paved with large red tiles the roof is redtiled says a recent observer the long blank wall faced with roughcast of a warm yellowish tinge and supported on a range of broad and low timber arcading which is in its turn supported by a dwarf wall some three feet in height the main feature of the cloister is a redbrick oriel window reared upon two brick arches supported midway by an octangular pillar of the same material and flanked by splayed buttresses with stone quoins the windowopening occupies a comparatively small space and is filled with stone mullions and tracery of a tudor character the whole design proclaimed by a stone tablet let into the brickwork to be the work of bishop compton above the cloister is the infirmary which opens into the church so as to allow the sick to hear the service the church though considered by many the finest existing example of late and transitional norman also exhibits architecture of all periods down to late decorated commenced by bishop de blois in 1171 it was not completed until the end of the thirteenth century from east to west it measures 125 feet its ordinary breadth is 54 feet while at the transepts it is 115 woodward thinks from the appearance of the exterior that the body of the church was widened at some period after its first erection the windows are various in style in the nave they are transition norman and early english and in the clerestory decorated in the choir aisles late norman the western doorway is early english with dogtooth ornament while the large window above with its geometrical tracery is fully developed decorated the most striking feature of the exterior however is at the southeast exterior angle of the south transept a fine triple arch with chevron and billet moulding which was probably once a doorway into a cloister no longer existing within the threebay nave one is in the midst of early english and transition norman work the bases and caps of the norman pillars are very rich and as has been pointed out furnish a great contrast to such norman work as is seen on the transept pillars at winchester itself the south walls are very plain and were probably connected with de blois buildings originally in the choir above the pierarches is a triforium of intersecting arches to which milner attributed the origin of the pointed style and there is a second passage beneath the clerestory windows the floorbrass of john de camden 1382 lies in the choir when the church was restored by butterfield the choir was painted in imitation of the old colouring it cannot be said that the effect is at all pleasing the new floor tiles bear the letters zo to commemorate the anonymous donor of the money for this restoration the old encaustic tiles bear the motto have mynde in the chancel the renaissance carving dates from about henry vii while the henry viii stalls have been removed to the morning chapel in the south aisle the transepts are a good example of the transition to early english style in the northern arm can be seen the window opening out of the infirmary already mentioned above illustration the city cross winchester from an old print illustration tombstone in the churchyard a pumphrey photo of other points of interest in or near winchester it would be out of place to speak here at any length but among the various objects that are worth seeing in the town itself mention may be made of the city cross erected by the fraternity of the holy cross during the reign of henry vi the chief figures represent william of wykeham florence de anne mayor of winchester alfred the great and s laurence the latter being the only old figure britton in 1807 said the present building is called the butter cross because the retail dealers in that article usually assemble round it he complained of the injury done to it by boys and childish men s laurence was the only figure in his day and it was then generally said to be an effigy of s john the evangelist in the county hall which includes the remains of the ancient castle of william the conquerors days is king arthurs round table this is mentioned as being here by the chronicler john harding 13781465 so that its antiquity is undoubted its present painted design however can not be earlier than the beginning of the sixteenth century but since henry viiis time the same design has been adhered to the illustration which appears here comes from an old print of the county hall milner in his history and survey of winchester in the last century remarked that the round table was evidently an eating table for the knights who used to meet here to perform feats of chivalry which kind of meetings from this circumstance was anciently called the round table these however were not so much as known in england until the reign of king stephen 600 years after the reign of arthur there is great reason to believe that the said stephen was the real author of the present table the figures and characters now painted on it were certainly first executed in the reign of henry viii illustration the west gate winchester photochrom co ltd photo the last illustration represents the oldest of the city gates at winchester parts of
