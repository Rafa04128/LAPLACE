of the tough epidermis of the sugarcane from the internal spongy pith which is to be pressed its function consists in isolating and separating the cells from their cortex and in putting them in direct contact with the rollers or cylinders of the mill after their passage into the apparatus which is naturally placed in a line with the endless chain that carries them to the mill the canes arrive in less compact layers pass through much narrower spaces and finally undergo a more efficient pressure which is shown by an abundant flow of juice the first trials of the machine were made in 1879 at the pointe simon works at martinique with the small type that was shown at the paris exhibition of 1878 these experiments which were applied to a work of 3000 kilos of cane per hour gave entire satisfaction and decided the owners of three of the colonial works pointe simon larcinty and marin to adopt it for the season of 1880 the apparatus is shown in longitudinal section in fig 1 and in plan in fig 2 fig 3 gives a transverse section passing through the line 34 and fig 4 an external view on the side whence the decorticated canes make their exit from the apparatus illustration faures machine for decorticating sugar cane the other figures relate to details that will be referred to further along the decorticating cylinderthe principal part of the apparatus is a hollow drum a of cast iron 430 mm in internal diameter by 141 m in length which is keyed at its two extremities to the shaft a externally this drum which is represented apart in transverse section in fig 5 has the form of an octagonal prism with well dressed projections between which are fixed the eight plates c that constitute the decorticating cylinder these plates which are of tempered cast iron and one of which is shown in transverse section in fig 7 when once in place form a cylindrical surface provided with 48 helicoidal dentate channels the length of these plates is 470 mm there are three of them in the direction of the generatrices of the cylinder and this makes a total of 24 all are strengthened by ribs as shown in fig 8 and each is fixed by 4 bolts c 20mm in diameter the pitch of the helices of each tooth is very elongated and reaches about 752 m the depth of the toothing is 18 mm frame and endless chainthe cylinder thus constructed rotates with a velocity of 50 revolutions per minute over a cylindrical vessel b cast in a piece with the frame b this vessel is lined with two series of tempered cast iron plates d and d called exit and entrance plates which rest thereon through the intermedium of well dressed pedicels and which are held in place by six 20millimeter bolts their length is 708 mm the entrance plates d are provided with 6 spiral channels whose pitch is equal to that of the channels of the decorticating cylinder c and in the same direction the depth of the toothing is 10 mm the exit plates d are provided with 7 spiral channels of the same pitch and direction as those of the preceding but the depth of which increases from 2 to 10 mm the axis of the decorticating cylinder does not coincide with that of the vessel b so that the free interval for the passage of the cane continues to diminish from the entrance to the exit the passage of the cane to the decorticator gives rise to a small quantity of juice which flows through two orifices b into a sort of cast iron trough g suspended beneath the vessel the cane which is brought to the apparatus by an endless belt empties in a conduit formed of an inclined bottom e of plate iron and two cast iron sides provided with ribs these sides rest upon the two ends of the vessel b and are crossbraced by two flat bars e to which is bolted the bottom e this conduit is prolonged beyond the decorticating cylinder by an inclined chute f the bottom of which is made of plate iron 7 mm thick and the sides of the same material 9 mm thick the hollow frame b whose general form is like that of a saddle carries the bearings b in which revolves the shaft a one of these bearings is represented in detail in figs 9 and 10 it will be seen that the cap is held by bolts with sunken heads and that the bearing on the bushes is through horizontal surfaces only in a piece with this frame are cast two similar brackets b which support the axle h of the endless chain to this axle whose diameter is 100 mm are keyed toward the extremities the pinions h to which correspond the endless pitch chains i these latter are formed as may be seen in figs 11 and 12 of two series of links the shorter of these latter are only 100 mm in length while the longer are 210 mm and are hollowed out so as to receive the butts of the boards i the chain thus formed passes over two pitch pinions j like the pinions h that are mounted at the extremities of an axle j that revolves in bearings i whose position with regard to the apparatus is capable of being varied so as to slacken or tauten the chain i this arrangement is shown in elevation in fig 13 transmissionthe driving shaft k revolves in a pillow block k cast in a piece with the frame b it is usually actuated by a special motor and carries a flywheel not shown in the figure for want of space it receives in addition a cogwheel l which transmits its motion to the decorticating cylinder through the intermedium of a large woodentoothed gear wheel l the shaft a whose diameter is 228 mm actuates in its turn through the pinions m and m the pitch pinion n upon whose prolonged hub is keyed the pinion m this latter is mounted loosely upon the intermediate axle m motion is transmitted to the driving shaft h of the endless chain i by an ordinary pitch chain through a gearing which is shown in fig 12 the pitch pinion n is cast in a piece with a hollow friction cone n which is mounted loosely upon the shaft h and to which corresponds a second friction cone o this latter is connected by a key to a socket o upon which it slides and which is itself keyed to the shaft h the hub of the cone o is connected by a ring with a bronze nut p mounted at the threaded end of the shaft h and carrying a handwheel p it is only necessary to turn this latter in one direction or the other in order to throw the two cones into or out of gear if we allow that the motor has a velocity of 70 revolutions per minute the decorticating cylinder will run at the rate of 50 and the sugarcane will move forward at the rate of 12 meters per minute this new machine is a very simple and powerful one the decortication is effected with wonderful rapidity and the canes opened throughout their entire length and at all points of their circumference leave the apparatus in a state that allows of no doubt as to what the result of the pressure will be that they have to undergo there is no tearing no trituration no loss of juice but merely a simple preparation for a rational pressure effected under most favorable conditions the apparatus which is made in several sizes has already received numerous applications in martinique trinidad cuba antigua st domingo peru australia the mauritius islands and brazilpublication industrielle moving a bridge an interesting piece of engineering work has recently been accomplished at bristol england which consisted in the moving of a footbridge 134 feet in length bodily down the river a considerable distance the pontoons by means of which the bridge was floated to its new position consisted of four 80ton barges braced together so as to form one solid structure 64 feet in width and were placed in position soon after the tide commenced to rise at six oclock am the top of the stages which was 24 feet above the water touched the under part of the bridge and in a quarter of an hour later both ends rose from their foundations when the tide had risen 4 ft the stage and bridge were floated to the new position when at 830 the girders dropped on to their beds the generation of steam and the thermodynamic problems involved1 footnote 1 lecture delivered at the institution of civil engineers session 188384 for the illustrations we are indebted to the courtesy of mr j forrest the secretary by mr william anderson mice it will not be necessary to commence this lecture by explaining the origin of fuel it will be sufficient if i remind you that it is to the action of the complex rays of the sun upon the foliage of plants that we mainly owe our supply of combustibles the tree trunks and branches of our forests as well as the subterranean deposits of coal and naphtha at one time formed portions of the atmosphere in the form of carbonic acid gas that gas was decomposed by the energy of the solar rays the carbon and the oxygen were placed in positions of advantage with respect to each otherendowed with potential energy and it is my duty this evening to show how we can best make use of these relations and by once more combining the constituents of fuel with the oxygen of the air reverse the action which caused the growth of the plants that is to say by destroying the plant reproduce the heat and light which fostered it the energy which can be set free by this process cannot be greater than that derived originally from the sun and which acting through the frail mechanism of green leaves tore asunder the strong bonds of chemical affinity wherein the carbon and oxygen were hound converting the former into the ligneous portions of the plants and setting the latter free for other uses the power thus silently exerted is enormous for every ton of carbon separated in twelve hours necessitates an expenditure of energy represented by at least 1058 horse power but the action is spread over an enormous area of leaf surface rendered necessary by the small proportion of carbonic acid contained in the air by measure only 12000 part and hence the action is silent and imperceptible it is now conceded on all hands that what is termed heat is the energy of molecular motion and that this motion is convertible into various kinds and obeys the general laws relating to motion two substances brought within the range of chemical affinity unite with more or less violence the motion of transition of the particles is transformed wholly or in part into a vibratory or rotary motion either of the particles themselves or the interatomic ether and according to the quality of the motions we are as a rule besides other effects made conscious of heat or light or of both when these emanations come to be examined they are found to be complex in the extreme intimately bound up together and yet capable of being separated and analyzed as soon as the law of definite chemical combination was firmly established the circumstance that changes of temperature accompanied most chemical combinations was noticed and chemists were not long in suspecting that the amount of heat developed or absorbed by chemical reaction should be as much a property of the substances entering into combination as their atomic weights solid ground for this expectation lies in the dynamic theory of heat a body of water at a given height is competent by its fall to produce a definite and invariable quantity of heat or work and in the same way two substances falling together in chemical union acquire a definite amount of kinetic energy which if not expended in the work of molecular changes may also by suitable arrangements be made to manifest a definite and invariable quantity of heat at the end of last century lavoisier and laplace and after them down to our own time dulong desprez favre and silbermann andrews berthelot thomson and others devoted much time and labor to the experimental determination of the heat of combustion and the laws which governed its development messrs favre and silbermann in particular between the years 1845 and 1852 carried out a splendid series of experiments by means of the apparatus partly represented in fig 1 opposite which is a drawing onethird the natural size of the calorimeter employed it consisted essentially of a combustion chamber formed of thin copper gilt internally the upper part of the chamber was fitted with a cover through which the combustible could be introduced with a pipe for a gas jet with a peep hole closed by adiathermanous but transparent substances alum and glass and with a branch leading to a thin copper coil surrounding the lower part of the chamber and descending below it the whole of this portion of the apparatus was plunged into a thin copper vessel silvered internally and filled with water which was kept thoroughly mixed by means of agitators this second vessel stood inside a third one the sides and bottom of which were covered with the skins of swans with the down on and the whole was immersed in a fourth vessel tilled with water kept at the average temperature of the laboratory suitable thermometers of great delicacy were provided and all manner of precautions were taken to prevent loss of heat illustration the generation of steam fig 1 it is impossible not to admire the ingenuity and skill exhibited in the details of the apparatus in the various accessories for generating and storing the gases used and for absorbing and weighing the products of combustion but it is a matter of regret that the experiments should have been carried out on so small a scale for example the little cage which held the solid fuel tested was only 58 inch diameter by barely 2 inches high and held only 38 grains of charcoal the combustion occupying about sixteen minutes favre and silbermann adopted the plan of ascertaining the weight of the substances consumed by calculation from the weight of the products of combustion carbonic acid was absorbed by caustic potash as also was carbonic oxide after having been oxidized to carbonic acid by heated oxide of copper and the vapor of water was absorbed by concentrated sulphuric acid the adoption of this system showed that it was in any case necessary to analyze the products of combustion in order to detect imperfect action thus in the case of substances containing carbon carbonic oxide was always present to a variable extent with the carbonic acid and corrections were necessary in order to determine the total heat due to the complete combination of the substance with oxygen another advantage gained was that the absorption of the products of combustion prevents any sensible alteration in the volumes during the process so that corrections for the heat absorbed in the work of displacing the atmosphere were not required the experiments on various substances were repeated many times the mean results for those in which we are immediately interested are given in table i next column comparison with later determinations have established their substantial accuracy the general conclusion arrived at is thus stated as a rule there is an equality between the heat disengaged or absorbed in the acts respectively of chemical combination or decomposition of the same elements so that the heat evolved during the combination of two simple or compound substances is equal to the heat absorbed at the time of their chemical segregation table

gas n2o produces about 38 per cent more heat than the same substance burned in pure oxygen notwithstanding that the work of decomposing the protoxide of nitrogen has to be performed in marsh gas or methane ch4 again the energy of combustion is considerably less than that due to the burning of its carbon and hydrogen separately these exceptions probably arise from the circumstance that the energy of chemical action is absorbed to a greater or less degree in effecting molecular changes as for example the combustion of 1 pound of nitrogen to form protoxide of nitrogen results in the absorption of 1157 units of heat berthelot states as one of the fundamental principles of thermochemistry that the quantity of heat evolved is the measure of the sum of the chemical and physical work accomplished in the reaction and such a law will no doubt account for the phenomena above noted the equivalent heat of combustion of the compounds we have practically to deal with has been experimentally determined and therefore constitutes a secure basis on which to establish calculations of the caloric value of fuel and in doing so with respect to substances composed of carbon hydrogen and oxygen it is convenient to reduce the hydrogen to its heatproducing equivalent of carbon the heat of combustion of hydrogen being 62032 units that of carbon 14544 units it follows that 4265 times the weight of hydrogen will represent an equivalent amount of carbon with respect to the oxygen it is found that it exists in combination with the hydrogen in the form of water and being combined already abstracts its combining equivalent of hydrogen from the efficient ingredients of the fuel and hence hydrogen to the extent of 18 of the weight of the oxygen must be deducted the general formula then becomes heat of combustion 14544 c 4265 ho8 and water evaporated from and at 212 taking 966 units as the heat necessary to evaporate 1 pound of water lb evaporated 1506 c 4265 ho8 carbon hydrogen and oxygen being taken at their weight per cent in the fuel strictly speaking marsh gas should be separately determined it often happens that available energy is not in a form in which it can be applied directly to our needs the water flowing down from the mountains in the neighborhood of the alpine tunnels was competent to provide the power necessary for boring through them but it was not in a form in which it could be directly applied the kinetic energy of the water had first to be changed into the potential energy of air under pressure then in that form by suitable mechanism it was used with signal success to disintegrate and excavate the hard rock of the tunnels the energy resulting from combustion is also incapable of being directly transformed into useful motive power it must first be converted into potential force of steam or air at high temperature and pressure and then applied by means of suitable heat engines to produce the motions we require it is probably to this circumstance that we must attribute the slowness of the human race to take advantage of the energy of combustion the history of the steam engine hardly dates back 200 years a very small fraction of the centuries during which man has existed even since historic times the apparatus by means of which the potential energy of fuel with respect to oxygen is converted into the potential energy of steam we call a steam boiler and although it has neither cylinder nor piston crank nor fly wheel i claim for it that it is a veritable heat engine because it transmits the undulations and vibrations caused by the energy of chemical combination in the fuel to the water in the boiler these motions expend themselves in overcoming the liquid cohesion of the water and imparting to its molecules that vigor of motion which converts them into the molecules of a gas which impinging on the surfaces which confine it and form the steam space declare their presence and energy in the shape of pressure and temperature a steam pumping engine which furnishes water under high pressure to raise loads by means of hydraulic cranes is not more truly a heat engine than a simple boiler for the latter converts the latent energy of fuel into the latent energy of steam just as the pumping engine converts the latent energy of steam into the latent energy of the pumpedup accumulator or the hoisted weight if i am justified in taking this view then i am justified in applying to my heat engine the general principles laid down in 1824 by sadi carnot namely that the proportion of work which can be obtained out of any substance working between two temperatures depends entirely and solely upon the difference between the temperatures at the beginning and end of the operation that is to say if t be the higher temperature at the beginning and t the lower temperature at the end of the action then the maximum possible work to be got out of the substance will be a function of tt the greatest range of temperature possible or conceivable is from the absolute temperature of the substance at the commencement of the operation down to absolute zero of temperature and the fraction of this which can be utilized is the ratio which the range of temperature through which the substance is working bears to the absolute temperature at the commencement of the action if w the greatest amount of effect to be expected t and t the absolute temperatures and h the total quantity of heat expressed in foot pounds or in water evaporated as the case may be potential in the substance at the higher temperature t at the beginning of the operation then carnots law is expressed by the equation t t w h t i will illustrate this important doctrine in the manner which carnot himself suggested illustration the generation of steam fig 2 fig 2 represents a hillside rising from the sea some distance up there is a lake l fed by streams coming down from a still higher level lower down on the slope is a millpond p the tail race from which falls into the sea at the millpond is established a factory the turbine driving which is supplied with water by a pipe descending from the lake l datum is the mean sea level the level of the lake is t and of the millpond t q is the weight of water falling through the turbine per minute the mean sea level is the lowest level to which the water can possibly fall hence its greatest potential energy that of its position in the lake qt h the water is working between the absolute levels t and t hence according to carnot the maximum effect w to be expected is t t w h t t t but h qt therefore w q t t w q t t that is to say the greatest amount of work which can be expected is found by multiplying the weight of water into the clear fall which is of course selfevident now how can the quantity of work to be got out of a given weight of water be increased without in any way improving the efficiency of the turbine in two ways 1 by collecting the water higher up the mountain and by that means increasing t 2 by placing the turbine lower down nearer the sea and by that means reducing t now the sea level corresponds to the absolute zero of temperature and the heights t and t to the maximum and minimum temperatures between which the substance is working therefore similarly the way to increase the efficiency of a heat engine such as a boiler is to raise the temperature of the furnace to the utmost and reduce the heat of the smoke to the lowest possible point it should be noted in addition that it is immaterial what liquid there may be in the lake whether water oil mercury or what not the law will equally apply and so in a heat engine the nature of the working substance provided that it does not change its physical state during a cycle does not affect the question of efficiency with which the heat being expended is so utilized to make this matter clearer and give it a practical bearing i will give the symbols a numerical value and for this purpose i will for the sake of simplicity suppose that the fuel used is pure carbon such as coke or charcoal the heat of combustion of which is 14544 units that the specific heat of air and of the products of combustion at constant pressure is 0238 that only sufficient air is passed through the fire to supply the quantity of oxygen theoretically required for the combustion of the carbon and that the temperature of the air is at 60 fahrenheit 520 absolute the symbol t represents the absolute temperature of the furnace a value which is easily calculated in the following manner 1 lb of carbon requires 223 lb of oxygen to convert it into carbonic acid and this quantity is furnished by 122 lb of air the result being 132 lb of gases heated by 14544 units of heat due to the energy of combustion therefore 14544 units t 520 5150 absolute 132 lb x 0238 the lower temperature t we may take as that of the feed water say at 100 or 560 absolute for by means of artificial draught and sufficiently extending the heating surface the temperature of the smoke may be reduced to very nearly that of the feed water under such circumstances the proportion of heat which can be realized is 5150 560 0891 5150 that is to say under the extremely favorable if not impracticable conditions assumed there must be a loss of 11 per cent next to give a numerical value to the potential energy h to be derived from a pound of carbon calculating from absolute zero the specific heat of carbon being 025 and absolute temperature of air 520 units 1 lb of carbon x 025 x 520 130 122 of air x 0238 x 520

take a definite case and compare the potential energy of a certain kind of fuel with the results actually obtained for this purpose the boiler of the eighthorse portable engine which gained the first prize at the cardiff show of the royal agricultural society in 1872 will serve very well because the trials all the details of which are set forth very fully in vol ix of the journal of the society were carried out with great care and skill by sir frederick bramwell and the late mr menelaus indeed the only fact left undetermined was the temperature of the furnace an omission due to the want of a trustworthy pyrometer a want which has not been satisfied to this day2 footnote 2 in the fiftysecond volume of the proceedings 188778 page 154 will be found a remarkable experiment on the evaporative power of a vertical boiler with internal circulating pipes the experiment was conducted by sir frederick bramwell and dr russell and is remarkable in this respect that the quantity of air admitted to

for a boiler that it is a veritable heat engine and i have ventured to construct an indicator diagram to illustrate its working the rate of transfer of heat from the furnace to the water in the boiler at any given point is some way proportional to the difference of temperature and the quantity of heat in the gases is proportional to their temperatures draw a base line representing 460 fahr the absolute zero of temperature at one end erect an ordinate upon which set off t 3777 the temperature of the furnace at 849 t on the scale of temperature draw a line parallel to the base and mark on it a length proportional to the heating surface of the boiler join t by a diagonal with the extremity of this line and drop a perpendicular on to the zero line the temperature of the water in the boiler being uniform the ordinates bounded by the sloping line and by the line t will at any point be approximately proportional to the rate of transmission of heat and the shaded area above t will be proportional to the quantity of heat imparted to the water join t by another diagonal with extremity of the heating surface on the zero line then the larger triangle standing on the zero line will represent the whole of the heat of combustion and the ratio of the two triangles will be as the lengths of their respective bases that is as t t t which is the expression we have already used the heating surface was 220 square feet and it was competent to transmit the energy developed by 41 lb of coal consumed per hour 12819 u 41 u 525572 units equal to an average of 2389 units per square foot per hour this value will correspond to the mean pressure in an ordinary diagram for it is a measure of the energy with which molecular motion is transferred from the heated gases to the boilerplate and so to the water the mean rate of transmission multiplied by the area of heating surface gives the area of the shaded portion of the figure which is the total work which should have been done that is to say the work of evaporating 544 lb of water per hour the actual work done however was only 485 lb to give the speculations we have indulged in a practical turn it will be necessary to examine in detail the terms of carnots formula carnot labored under great disadvantages he adhered to the emission theory of heat he was unacquainted with its dynamic equivalent he did not know the reason of the difference between the specific heat of air at constant pressure and at constant volume the idea of an absolute zero of temperature had not been broached but the genius of the man while it made him lament the want of knowledge which he felt must be attainable also enabled him to penetrate the gloom by which he was surrounded and enunciate propositions respecting the theory of heat engines which the knowledge we now possess enables us to admit as true his propositions are 1 the motive power of heat is independent of the agents employed to develop it and its quantity is determined solely by the temperature of the bodies between which the final transfer of caloric takes place 2 the temperature of the agent must in the first instance be raised to the highest degree possible in order to obtain a great fall of caloric and as a consequence a large production of motive power 3 for the same reason the cooling of the agent must be carried to as low a degree as possible 4 matters must be so arranged that the passage of the elastic agent from the higher to the lower temperature must be due to an increase of volume that is to say the cooling of the agent must be caused by its rarefaction this last proposition indicates the defective information which carnot possessed he knew that expansion of the elastic agent was accompanied by a fall of temperature but he did not know that that fall was due to the conversion of heat into work we should state this clause more correctly by saying that the cooling of the agent must be caused by the external work it performs in accordance with these propositions it is immaterial what the heated gases or vapors in the furnace of a boiler may be provided that they cool by doing external work and in passing over the boiler surfaces impart their heat energy to the water the temperature of the furnace it follows must be kept as high as possible the process of combustion is usually complex first in the case of coal close to the firebars complete combustion of the red hot carbon takes place and the heat so developed distills the volatile hydrocarbons and moisture in the upper layers of the fuel the inflammable gases ignite on or near the surface of the fuel if there be a sufficient supply of air and burn with a bright flame for a considerable distance around the boiler if the layer of fuel be thin the carbonic acid formed in the first instance passes through the fuel and mixes with the other gases if however the layer of fuel be thick and the supply of air through the bars insufficient the carbonic acid is decomposed by the red hot coke and twice the volume of carbonic oxide is produced and this making its way through the fuel burns with a pale blue flame on the surface the result as far as evolution of heat is concerned being the same as if the intermediate decomposition of carbonic acid had not taken place this property of coal has been taken advantage of by the late sir w siemens in his gas producer where the supply of air is purposely limited in order that neither the hydrocarbons separated by distillation nor the carbonic oxide formed in the thick layer of fuel may be consumed in the producer but remain in the form of crude gas to be utilized in his regenerative furnaces illustration the generation of steam fig 3 illustration the generation of steam fig 4 illustration the

cw maccord scd ii illustration planetary wheel trains fig 14 it has already been shown that the rotations of all the wheels of a planetary train relatively to the trainarm are the same when the arm is in motion as they would be if it were fixed now in fig 14 let a be the first and f the last wheel of an incomplete train that is one having but one sunwheel as before let these be so connected by intermediate gearing that when t is stationary a rotation of a through m degrees shall drive f through n degrees and also as before let t in the same time move through a degrees then if m represent the total motion of a we have again m m a or m m a this is clearly the motion of a relatively to the fixed frame of the machine and is measured from a fixed vertical line through the center of a now if we wish to express the total motion of f relatively to the same fixed frame we must measure it from a vertical line through the center of f wherever that maybe which gives in this case n n a or n n a but with respect to the trainarm when at rest we have ang vel a n whence again ang vel f m n a n m a m this is the manner in which the equation is deduced by prof willis who expressly states that it applies whether the last wheel f is or is not concentric with the first wheel a and also that the train may be composed of any combinations which transmit rotation with both a constant velocity ratio and a constant directional relation he designates the quantities m n absolute revolutions as distinguished from the relative revolutions that is revolutions relatively to the trainarm indicated by the quantities m n adding hence it appears that the absolute revolutions of the wheels of epicyclic trains are equal to the sum of their relative revolutions to the arm and of the arm itself when they take place in the same direction and equal to the difference of these revolutions when in the opposite direction in this deduction of the formula as in that of prof rankine all the motions are supposed to have the same direction corresponding to that of the hands of the clock and in its application to any given train the signs of the terms must be changed in case of any contrary motion as explained in the preceding article and both the deduction and the application in reference to these incomplete trains in which the last wheel is carried by the trainarm clearly involve and depend upon the resolving of a motion of revolution into the components of a circular translation and a rotation in the manner previously discussed illustration planetary wheel trains fig 15 to illustrate take the simple case of two equal wheels fig 15 of which the central one a is fixed supposing first a for the moment released and the arm to be fixed we see that the two wheels will turn in opposite directions with equal velocities which gives nm 1 but when a is fixed and t revolves we have m 0 whence in the general formula n a 1 or n 2 a a which means being interpreted that f makes two rotations about its axis during one revolution of t and in the same direction again let a and f be equal in the 3wheel train fig 16 the former being fixed as before in this case we have n 1 m 0 which gives m n a 1 therefore n 0 a that is to say the wheel f which now evidently has a motion of circular translation does not rotate at all about its axis during the revolution of the trainarm illustration planetary wheel trains fig 16 all this is perfectly consistent clearly with the hypothesis that the motion of circular translation is a simple one and the motion of revolution about a fixed axis is a compound one whether the hypothesis was made to substantiate the formula or the formula constructed to suit the hypothesis is not a matter of consequence in either case no difficulty will arise so long as the equation is applied only to cases in which as in those here mentioned that motion of revolution can be resolved into those components when the definition of an epicyclic train is restricted as it is by prof rankine the consideration of the hypothesis in question is entirely eliminated and whether it be accepted or rejected the whole matter is reduced to merely adding the motion of the trainarm to the rotation of each sunwheel but in attempting to apply this formula in analyzing the action of an incomplete train we are required to add this motion of the trainarm not only to that of a sunwheel but to that of a planetwheel this is evidently possible in the examples shown in figs 15 and 16 because the motions to be added are in all respects similar the trains are composed of spurwheels and the motions whether of revolution translation or rotation take place in parallel planes perpendicular to parallel axes this condition which we have emphasized be it observed must hold true with regard to the motions of the first and last wheels and the trainarm in order to make this addition possible it is not essential that spurwheels should be used exclusively or even at all for instance in fig 16 a and f may be made bevel or screwwheels without affecting the action or the analysis but the trainarm in all cases revolves around the central axis of the system that is about the axis of a and to this the axis of f must be parallel in order to render the deduction of the formula as made by prof willis and also by prof goodeve correct or even possible illustration planetary wheel trains fig 17 this will be seen by an examination of fig 17 in which a and b are two equal spurwheels e and f two equal bevel wheels b and e being secured to the same shaft and a being fixed to the frame h as the arm t goes round b will also turn in its bearings in the same direction let this direction be that of the clock when the apparatus is viewed from above then the motion of f will also have the same direction when viewed from the central vertical axis as shown at f and let these directions be considered as positive it is perfectly clear that f will turn in its bearings in the direction indicated at a rate precisely equal to that of the trainarm let p be a pointer carried by f and r a dial fixed to t and let the pointer be vertical when oo is the plane containing the axes of a b and e then when f has gone through any angle a measured from oo the pointer will have turned from its original vertical position through an equal angle as shown also at f now there is no conceivable sense in which the motion of t can be said to be added to the rotation of f about its axis and the expression absolute revolution as applied to the motion of the last wheel in this train is absolutely meaningless nevertheless prof goodeve states elements of mechanism p 165 that we may of course apply the general formula in the case of bevel wheels just as in that of spur wheels let us try the experiment when the trainarm is stationary and a released and turned to the right f turns to the left at the same rate whence n 1 also m 0 when a is fixed m and the equation becomes n a 1 therefore n 2a a or in other words f turns twice on its axis during one revolution of t a result too palpably absurd to require any comment we have seen that this identical result was obtained in the case of fig 15 and it would of course be the same were the formula applied to figs 5 and 6 whereas it has never so far as we are aware been pretended that a miter or a bevel wheel will make more than one rotation about its axis in rolling once around an equal fixed one again if the formula be general it should apply equally well to a train of screw wheels let us take for example the single pair shown in fig 8 of which when t is fixed the velocity ratio is unity the directional relation however depends upon the direction in which the wheels are twisted so that in applying the formula we shall have nm 1 if the helices of both wheels are right handed and nm 1 if they are both left handed thus the formula leads to the surprising conclusion that when a is fixed and t revolves the planetwheel b will revolve about its axis twice as fast as t moves in one case while in the other it will not revolve at all illustration planetary wheel trains fig 18 a favorite illustration of the peculiarities of epicyclic mechanism introduced both by prof willis and prof goodeve is found in the contrivance known as fergusons mechanical paradox shown in fig 18 this consists of a fixed sunwheel a engaging with a planetwheel b of the same diameter upon the shaft of b are secured the three thin wheels e g i each having 20 teeth and in gear with the three others f h k which turn freely upon a stud fixed in the trainarm and have respectively 19 20 and 21 teeth in applying the general formula we have the following results n 20 n a 1 for the wheel f therefore n a m 19 a 19 n n a h 1 therefore n 0 m a n 20 n a 1 k therefore n a m 21 a 21 the paradoxical appearance then consists in this that although the drivers of the three last wheels each have the same number of teeth yet the central one h having a motion of circular translation remains always parallel to itself and relatively to it the upper one seems to turn in the same direction as the trainarm and the lower in the contrary direction and the appearance is accepted too as a reality being explained agreeably to the analysis just given by saying that h has no absolute rotation about its axis while the other wheels have that of f being positive and that of k negative illustration planetary wheel trains fig 18 the mechanical paradox it is clear may be regarded as composed of three separate trains each of which is precisely like that of fig 16 and that again differs from the one of fig 15 only in the addition of a third wheel now we submit that the train shown in fig 17 is mechanically equivalent to that of fig 15 the velocity ratio and the directional relation being the same in both and if in fig 17 we remove the index p and fix upon its shaft three wheels like e g and i of fig 18 we shall have a combination mechanically equivalent to fergusons paradox the three last wheels rotating in vertical planes about horizontal axes the relative motions of those three wheels will be the same obviously as in fig 18 and according to the formula their absolute motions are the same and we are invited to perceive that the central one does not rotate at all about its axis but it does rotate nevertheless and this unquestioned fact is of itself enough to show that there is something wrong with the formula as applied to trains like those in question what that something is we think has been made clear by what precedes since it is impossible in any sense to add together motions which are unlike it will be seen that in order to obtain an intelligible result in cases like these the equation must be of the form nm a nm we shall then have n 20 n 20 for the wheel f therefore n a m 19 a 19 n n for the wheel h 1 therefore n a m a n 20 n 20 for the wheel k therefore n a m 21 a 21 which corresponds with the actual state of things all three wheels rotate in the same direction the central one at the same rate as the train arm one a little more rapidly and the third a little more slowly it is then absolutely necessary to make this modification in the general formula in order to apply it in determining the rotations of any wheel of an epicyclic train whose axis is not parallel to that of the sunwheels and in this modified form it applies equally well to the original arrangement of fergusons paradox if we abandon the artificial distinction between absolute and relative rotations of the planetwheels and regard a spurwheel like any other as rotating on its axis when it turns in its bearings the action of the device shown in fig 18 being thus explained by saying that the wheel h turns once backward during each forward revolution of the trainarm while f turns a little more and k a little less than once in the same direction in this way the classification and analysis of these combinations are made more simple and consistent and the incongruities above pointed out are avoided since without regard to the kind of gearing employed or the relative positions of the axes we have the two equations n a n i for all complete trains m a m n n ii for all incomplete trains m a m illustration planetary wheel trains fig 19 as another example of the difference in the application of these formul let us take watts sun and planet wheels fig 19 this device as is well known was employed by the illustrious inventor as a substitute for the crank which some one had succeeded in patenting it consists merely of two wheels a and f connected by the link t a being keyed on the shaft of the engine and f being rigidly secured to the connectingrod suppose the rod to be of infinite length so as to remain always parallel to itself and the two wheels to be of equal size then according to prof willis analysis we shall have n a n s 1 n 0 therefore 1 whence m a m m a a a m or m 2a the other view of the question is that f turns once backward in its bearings during each forward revolution of t whence in eq 2 we have n n 1 n a m a m a therefore 1 which gives a a m or m 2a m a as before it is next to be remarked that the errors which arise from applying eq i to incomplete trains may in some cases counterbalance and neutralize each other so that the final result is correct illustration planetary wheel trains fig 20 for example take the combination shown in fig 20 this consists of a trainarm t revolving about the vertical axis oo of the fixed wheel a which is equal in diameter to f which receives its motion by the intervention of one idle wheel carried by a stud s fixed in the arm the second trainarm t is fixed to the shaft of f and turns with it a is secured to the arm t and f is actuated by a also through a single idler carried by t we have here a compound train consisting of two simple planetary trains af and af and its action is to be determined by considering them separately first suppose t to be removed and find the motion of f next suppose f to be removed and t fixed and find the rotation of f and finally combine these results noting that the motion of t is the same as that of f and the motion of a the same as that of t then according to the analysis of prof willis we shall have substituting the symbol t for a in the equation of the second train in order to avoid confusion n n a 1 train af 1 m 0 m m a n a whence 1 n 0 rot of f a n n t 2 train af 1 m 0 m m t n t whence again 1 t 0 rot of f t of these results the first is explicable as being the absolute rotation of f but the second is not and it will be readily seen that the former would have been equally absurd had the axis ll been inclined instead of vertical but in either case we should find the errors neutralized upon combining the two for according to the theory now under consideration the wheel a being fixed to t turns once upon its axis each time that train arm revolves and in the same direction and the revolutions of t equal the rotations of f whence finally in train af we have n n t 3 1 in which t 0 m a m m t n 0 which gives 1 or n a a 0 this is unquestionably correct and indeed it is quite obvious that the effect upon f is the same whether we say that during a revolution of t the wheel a turns once forward and t not at all or adopt the other view and assert that t turns once backward and a not at all but the latter view has the advantage of giving concordant results when the trains are considered separately and that without regard to the relative positions of the axes or the kind of gearing employed analyzing the action upon this hypothesis we have in train af n n n 1 m 0 therefore 1 or n a m m a a in train af n n n 1 m 0 therefore 1 or n t m m t t in combining we have in the latter train m 0 t a whence n n n 1 gives 1 or n a as before m m t a now it happens that the only examples given by prof willis of incomplete trains in which the axis of a planetwheel whose motion is to be determined is not parallel to the central axis of the system are similar to the one just discussed the wheel in question being carried by a secondary trainarm which derives its motion from a wheel of the primary train the application of his general equation in these cases gives results which agree with observed facts and it would seem that this circumstance in connection doubtless with the complexity of these compound trains led him to the too hasty conclusion that the formula would hold true in all cases although we are still left to wonder at his overlooking the fact that in these very cases the absolute and the relative rotations of the last wheel are identical illustration planetary wheel trains fig 21 in fig 21 is shown a combination consisting also of two distinct trains in which however there is but one trainarm t turning freely upon the horizontal shaft oo to which shaft the wheels a f are secured the trainarm has two studs upon which turn the idlers b b and also carries the bearings of the last wheel f the first wheel a is annular and fixed to the frame of the machine let it be required to determine the results of one revolution of the crank h the numbers of teeth being assigned as follows a 60 f 30 a 60 f 10 we shall then have for the train abf eq i n 60 n a 2 in which n 1 m 0 m 30 m a 1 a 1 whence 2 2a 1 a 3a 1 a a 3 and for the train abf eq ii n 60 n 1 6 in which a m 1 m 10 m a 3 n whence 6 or n 4 1 13 that is the last wheel f turns four times about the axis ll during one revolution of the crank h but according to profs willis and goodeve we should have for the second train n 60 n a 1 6 in which a m 1 m 10 m a 3 n 13 which gives 6 n 13 4 n 413 1 13 or four and onethird revolutions of f for one of h this result no doubt might be near enough to the truth to serve all practical purposes in the application of this mechanism to its original object which was that of paring apples impaled upon the fork k but it can hardly be regarded as entirely satisfactory in a general way nor can the analysis which renders such a result possible the pantanemone the need of irrigating prairies inundating vines drying marshes and accumulating electricity cheaply has for some time past led to a search for some means of utilizing the forces of nature better than has ever hitherto been done wind which figures in the first rank as a force has thus far with all the mills known to us rendered services that are much inferior to those that we have a right to expect from it with improved apparatus for the work produced whatever the velocity of the wind has never been greater than that that could be effected by wind of seven meters per second but thanks to the experiments of recent years we are now obtaining an effective performance double that which we did with apparatus on the old system desirous of making known the efforts that have been made in this direction we lately described mr dumonts atmospheric turbine in speaking of this apparatus we stated that aerial motors generally stop or are destroyed in high winds recently mr sanderson has communicated to us the result of some experiments that he has been making for years back by means of an apparatus which he styles a pantanemone the engraving that we give of this machine shows merely a cabinet model of it and it goes without saying that it is simply designed to exhibit the principle upon which its construction is based illustration the pantanemone two plane surfaces in the form of semicircles are mounted at right angles to each other upon a horizontal shaft and at an angle of 45 with respect to the latter it results from this that the apparatus will operate even without being set whatever be the direction of the wind except when it blows perpendicularly upon the axle thus permitting owing to the impossibility of reducing the surfaces of threescore days more work per year being obtained than can be with other mills three distinct apparatus have been successively constructed the first of these has been running for nine years in the vicinity of poissy where it lifts about 40000 liters of water to a height of 20 meters every 24 hours in a wind of a velocity of from 7 to 8 meters per second the second raises about 150000 liters of water to the villejuif reservoir at a height of 10 meters every 24 hours in a wind of from 5 to 6 meters the third supplies the laboratory of the montsouris observatory the first is not directible the second may be directed by hand and the third is directed automatically these three machines defied the hurricane of the 26th of last januaryla nature relvass new lifeboat the spanish and portuguese papers have recently made known some interesting experiments that have been made by mr carlos relvas with a new lifeboat which parts the waves with great facility and exhibits remarkable stability this boat which is shown in front view in one of the corners of our engraving is tshaped and consists of a very thin keel connected with the sidetimbers by iron rods cushions of cork and canvas are adapted to the upper part and when the boat is on the sea it has the appearance of an ordinary canoe although as may be seen it differs essentially therefrom in the submerged part when the sea is heavy says mr relvas and the high waves are tumbling over each other they pass over my boat and are powerless to capsize it my boat clears waves that others are obliged to recoil before it has the advantage of being able to move forward whatever be the fury of the sea and is capable besides of approaching rocks without any danger of its being broken illustration relvass new life boat a committee was appointed by the portuguese government to examine this new lifeboat and comparative experiments were made with it and an ordinary lifeboat at porto on a very rough sea mr relvass boat was manned by eight rowers all provided with cork girdles while the government lifeboat was manned by twelve rowers and a pilot all likewise wearing cork girdles the chief of the maritime department an engineer of the portuguese navy and a portuguese deputy were present at the trial in a pilot boat the three boats proceeded to the entrance of the bar where the sea was roughest and numerous spectators collected upon the shore and wharfs followed their evolutions from afar the experiments began at half past three oclock in the afternoon the two lifeboats shot forward to seek the most furious waves and were seen from afar to surmount the billows and then suddenly disappear it was a spectacle as moving as it was curious it was observed that mr relvass boat cleft the waves while the other floated upon their surface like a nutshell after an hours navigation the two boats returned to their starting point the official committee that presided over these experiments has again found in this new boat decided advantages and has pointed out to its inventor a few slight modifications that will render it still more efficientla nature experiments with doublebarreled guns and rifles the series of experiments we are about to describe has recently been made by mr horatio phillips a practical gun maker of london the results will no doubt prove of interest to those concerned in the use or manufacture of firearms the reason that the two barrels of a shot gun or rifle will if put together parallel throw their charges in diverging lines has never yet been satisfactorily accounted for although many plausible and ingenious theories have been advanced for the purpose the natural supposition would be that this divergence resulted from the axes of the barrels not being in the same vertical plane as the center line of the stock that this is not the true explanation of the fact the following experiment would tend to prove illustration experiments with doublebarrelled guns fig 1 represents a single barrel fitted with sights and firmly attached to a heavy block of beech this was placed on an ordinary rifle rest being fastened thereto by a pin at the corner a the block and barrel being free to revolve upon the pin as a center several shots were fired both with the pin in position and with it removed the barrel being carefully pointed at the target each time no practical difference in the accuracy of fire was discernible under either condition when the pin was holding the corner of the block the recoil caused the barrel to move from right to left in a circular path but when the pin was removed so that the block was not attached to the rest in any way the recoil took place in a line with the axis of the bore it will be observed that the conditions which are present when a double barreled gun is fired in the ordinary way from the shoulder were in some respects much exaggerated in the apparatus for the pin was a distance of 3 in laterally from the axis of the barrel whereas the center of resistance of the stock of a gun against the shoulder would ordinarily be about onesixth of this distance from the axis of the barrel this experiment would apparently tend to prove that the recoil does not appreciably affect the path of the projectile as it would seem that the latter must clear the muzzle before any considerable movement of the barrel takes place with a view to obtain a further confirmation of the result of this experiment it was repeated in a different form by a number of shots being fired from a crosseyed rifle1 in which the sights were fixed in the center of the rib very accurate shooting was obtained with this arm footnote 1 a crosseyed rifle is one made with a crooked stock for the purpose of shooting from the right shoulder aim being taken with the left eye a second theory often broached in order to account for the divergence of the charge is that the barrel which is not being fired by its vis inertia in some way causes the shot to diverge in order to test this mr phillips took a single rifle and secured it near the muzzle to a heavy block of metal when the accuracy of the shooting was in no way impaired so far the experiments were of a negative character and the next step was made with a view to discover the actual cause of the divergence referred to a single barrel was now taken to which a template was fitted in order to record its exact length the barrel was then subjected to a heavy internal hydrostatic pressure under this treatment it expanded circumferentially and at the same time was reduced in length this it was considered gave a clew to the solution of the problem a pair of barrels was now taken and a template fitted accurately to the side of the righthand one as the template fitted the barrel when the latter was not subject to internal pressure upon such pressure being applied any alterations that might ensue in the length or contour of the barrel could be duly noted the righthand barrel was then subjected to internal hydrostatic pressure the result is shown in an exaggerated form in fig 2 it will be seen that both barrels are bent into an arched form this would be caused by the barrel under pressure becoming extended circumferentially and thereby reduced in length because the metal that is required to supply the increased circumference is taken to some extent from the length although the substance of metal in the walls of the barrel by its expansion contributes also to the increased diameter a simple illustration of this effect is supplied by subjecting an indiarubber tube to internal pressure supposing the material to be sufficiently elastic and the pressure strong enough the tube would ultimately assume a spherical form it is a well known fact that heavy barrels with light charges give less divergence than light barrels with heavy charges after the above experiments it was hoped that if a pair of barrels were put together parallel and soldered only for a space of 3 in at the breech end and were then coupled by two encircling rings joined together as in fig 4 the lefthand ring only being soldered to the barrel very accurate shooting would be obtained for it was argued that by these means the barrel under fire would be able to contract without affecting or being affected by the other barrel that on the righthand it will be seen by the illustration was the one to slide in its ring a pair of able 0500 bore express rifle barrels were accordingly fitted in this way fig 3 shows the arrangement with the rings in position upon firing these barrels with ordinary express charges it was found that the lines of fire from each barrel respectively crossed each other the bullet from the righthand barrel striking the target 10 in to the left of the bulls eye while the left barrel placed its projectile a similar distance in the opposite direction or as would be technically said the barrels crossed 20 in at 100 yards the latter distance being the range at which the experiment was made these last results have been accounted for in the following manner the two barrels were rigidly joined for a space of 3 in and for that distance they would behave in a manner similar to that illustrated in fig 2 and were they not coupled at the muzzles by the connecting rings they would shoot very wide the charges taking diverging courses when the connecting rings are fitted on the barrel not being fired will remain practically straight and as it is coupled to the barrel being fired by the rings the muzzle of the latter will be restrained from pointing outward the result will be as shown in an exaggerated manner by the dotted lines on the right barrel in fig 3 it would appear from these experiments that when very accurate shooting is required at long ranges with doublebarreled rifles they should be mounted in a manner similar to that adopted in the manufacture of the nordenfelt machine gun in which weapon the barrels are fitted into a plate at the extreme breech end the muzzles projecting through holes bored to receive them in a metal plate no unequal expansion would then take place and the barrels would be free to become shorter independently of each other we give the above experiments on the authority of their author who we believe has taken great pains to render them as exhaustive as possible so far as they goengineering ball turning machine the distinguishing feature in the ball turning machine shown opposite is that the tool is stationary while the work revolves in two directions simultaneously in the case of an ordinary spherical object such as brass clack ball the casting is made from a perfect pattern having two small caps or shanks in which the centers are also marked to avoid centering by hand it is fixed in the machine between two centers carried on a face plate or chuck with which they revolve one of these centers when the machine is in motion receives a continuous rotary motion about its axis from a wormwheel d this is driven by a worm c carried on a shaft at the back of the chuck and driven itself by a wormwheel b which gears with a screw which rides loosely upon the mandrel and is kept from rotating by a finger on the headstock this center in its rotation carries with it the ball which is thus slowly moved round an axis parallel to the face plate at the same time that it revolves about the axis of the mandrel the result being that the tool cuts upon the ball a scroll of which each convolution is approximately a circle and lies in a plane parallel to the line of centers when the chuck is set for one size of ball which may be done in a few minutes any quantity of that diameter

everything is arranged in the most handy way for rapid working and six brass balls of 2 in in diameter can be turned and finished in an hour the machine is specially adapted for turning ball valves for pumps pulsometers and the like and in the larger sizes for turning governor balls and spherical nuts for armor plates and is manufactured by messrs wilkinson and lister of bradford road iron works keighleyengineering cooling apparatus for injection water it often happens in towns and where manufactories are crowded together that the supply of water for condensing purposes is very small and consequently that it attains an inconveniently high temperature under unfavorable conditions of weather resulting in the deterioration of the vacuum and a consequent increase in the consumption of fuel to remedy or to diminish this difficulty messrs boase and miller of london have brought out the water cooler illustrated above this consists says engineering of a revolving basket of wire gauze surrounding an inner stationary vessel pierced with numerous small holes through which the heated water discharged by the air pump finds its way into the basket to be thrown out in the form of fine spray to a distance of 20 ft at each side the drops are received in the tank or pond and in their rapid passage through the air are sufficiently cooled to be again injected into the condenser the illustration shows a cooler having a basket three feet in diameter revolving at 300 revolutions per minute and discharging into a tank 40 ft square it requires 3 to 4 indicated horsepower to drive it and will cool 300 gallons per minute the following decrease of temperature has been observed in actual practice water entering at 95 deg fell 20 deg in temperature water entering at 100 deg to 110 deg fell 25 deg and water entering at 110 deg to 120 deg fell 30 deg the machine with which these trials were made was so placed that the top of the basket was four ft from the surface of the water in the pond with a greater elevation as shown in the engraving better results can be obtained illustration improved water cooling apparatus the advantages claimed for the cooler are that by its means the temperature of the injection water can be reduced the cost and size of cooling ponds can be diminished and condensing engines can be employed where hitherto they have not been possible the apparatus has been for two years in operation at several large factories and there is every reason to believe that its use will extend as it supplies a real want in a very simple and ingenious manner messrs duncan brothers of dundee and 32 queen victoria street ec are the manufacturers corrugated disk pulleys this is a pulley recently introduced by messrs j and e hall of dartford eng with the exception of the boss which is cast it is composed entirely of steel or sheet iron in place of the usual arms a continuous web of corrugated sheet metal connects the boss to the rim this web is attached to the boss by means of spences metal inside the rim which is flanged inward a double hoop iron ring is fixed for strengthening purposes the advantageous disposition of metal obtained by means of the corrugated web enables the pulley to be made of a given strength with less weight of material and from this cause and also on account of being accurately balanced these pulleys are well adapted for high speeds illustration kansas city review early history of the telegraph although the electric telegraph is comparatively speaking a recent invention yet methods of communication at a distance by means of signals have probably existed in all ages and in all nations there is reason to believe that among the greeks a system of telegraphy was in use as the burning of troy was certainly known in greece very soon after it happened and before any person had returned from troy polybius names the different instruments used by the ancients for communicating informationpyrsia because the signals were always made by means of fire lights at first they communicated information of events in an imperfect manner but a new method was invented by cleoxenus which was much improved by polybius as he himself informs us and which may be described as follows take the letters of the alphabet and arrange them on a board in five columns each column containing five letters then the man who signals would hold up with his left hand a number of torches which would represent the number of the column from which the letter is to be taken and with his right hand a number of torches that will represent the particular letter in that column that is to be taken it is thus easy to understand how the letters of a short sentence are communicated from station to station as far as required this is the pyrsia or telegraph of polybius it seems that the romans had a method of telegraphing in their walled cities either by a hollow formed in the masonry or by a tube fixed thereto so as to confine the sound in order to convey information to any part they liked this method of communicating is in the present age frequently employed in the well known speaking tubes it does not appear that the moderns had thought of such a thing as a telegraph until 1661 when the marquis of worcester in his century of inventions affirmed that he had discovered a method by which a man could hold discourse with his correspondent as far as they could reach by night as well as by day he did not however describe this invention dr hooke delivered a discourse before the royal society in 1684 showing how to communicate at great distances in this discourse he asserts the possibility of conveying intelligence from one place to another at a distance of 120 miles as rapidly as a man can write what he would have sent he takes to his aid the then recent invention of the telescope and explains how characters exposed at one station on the top of one hill may be made visible to the next station on the top of the next hill he invented twentyfour simple characters each formed of a combination of three deal boards each character representing a letter by the use of cords these characters were pushed from behind a screen and exposed and then withdrawn behind the screen again it was not however until the french revolution that the telegraph was applied to practical purposes but about the end of 1703 telegraphic communication was established between paris and the frontiers and shortly afterward telegraphs were introduced into england the history of the invention and introduction of the electric telegraph by prof morse is one of inexhaustible interest and every incident relating to it is worthy of preservation the incidents described below will be found of special interest the article is from the pen of the late judge neilson poe and was the last paper written by him he prepared it during his recent illness the letter embodied in it from mr latrobe being of course obtained at the time of its date it is as follows on the 5th of april 1843 when the monthly meeting of the directors of the baltimore ohio railroad company was about to adjourn the president the hon louis mclane rose with a paper in his hand which he said he had almost overlooked and which the secretary would read it proved to be an application from prof morse for the privilege of laying the wires of his electric telegraph along the line of the railroad between baltimore and washington and was accompanied by a communication from bh latrobe esq chief engineer recommending the project as worthy of encouragement on motion of john spear nicholas seconded by the hon john p kennedy the following resolution was then considered resolved that the president be authorized to afford mr morse such facilities as may be requisite to give his invention a proper trial upon the washington road provided in his opinion and in that of the engineer it can be done without injury to the road and without embarrassment to the operations of the company and provided mr morse will concede to the company the use of the telegraph upon the road without expense and reserving to the company the right of discontinuing the use if upon experiment it should prove in any manner injurious whatever said mr mclane may be our individual opinions as to the feasibility of mr morses invention it seems to me that it is our duty to concede to him the privilege he asks and to lend him all the aid in our power especially as the resolution carefully protects the company against all present or future injury to its works and secures us the right of requiring its removal at any time in view of the fact that no railroad can now be run safely without the aid of the telegraph the cautious care with which the right to remove it if it should become a nuisance was reserved strikes one at this day as nearly ludicrous a short pause ensued and the assent of the company was about to be assumed when one of the older directors famed for the vigilance with which he watched even the most trivial measure begged to be heard he admitted that the rights and interests of the work were all carefully guarded by the terms of the resolution and that the company was not called upon to lay out any of its means for the promotion of the scheme but notwithstanding all this he did not feel as a conscientious man that he could without further examination give his vote for the resolution he knew that this idea of mr morse however plausible it might appear to theorists and dreamers and socalled men of science was regarded by all practical people as destined like many other similar projects to certain failure and must consequently result in loss and possibly ruin to mr morse for one he felt conscientiously scrupulous in giving a vote which would aid or tempt a visionary enthusiast to ruin himself fortunately the views of this cautious practical man did not prevail a few words from the mover of the resolution mr nicholas who still lives to behold the wonders he helped to create and from mr kennedy without whose aid the appropriation would not have passed the house of representatives relieved the other directors from all fear of contributing to mr morses ruin and the resolution was adopted of the president and thirty directors who took part in this transaction only three samuel w smith john spear nicholas and the writer survive under it morse at once entered upon that test of his invention whose fruits are now enjoyed by the people of all the continents it was not however until the spring of 1844 that he had his line and its appointments in such a condition as to allow the transmission of messages between the two cities and it was in may of that year that the incident occurred which has chiefly led to the writing of this paper mr latrobes recollections my dear mr poe agreeably to my promise this morning i put on paper my recollection of the introduction of the magnetic telegraph between baltimore and washington i was counsel of the baltimore ohio railroad co at the time and calling on mr louis mclane the president on some professional matter was asked in the course of conversation whether i knew anything about an electric telegraph which the inventor who had obtained an appropriation from congress wanted to lay down on the washington branch of the road he said he expected mr morse the inventor to call on him when he would introduce me to him and would be glad if i took an opportunity to go over the subject with him and afterward let him mr mclane know what i thought about it while we were yet speaking mr morse made his appearance and when mr mclane introduced me he referred to the fact that as i had been educated at west point i might the more readily understand the scientific bearings of mr morses invention the presidents office being no place for prolonged conversation it was agreed that mr morse should take tea at my dwelling when we would go over the whole subject we met accordingly and it was late in the night before we parted mr morse went over the history of his invention from the beginning with an interest and enthusiasm that had survived the wearying toil of an application to congress and with the aid of diagrams drawn on the instant made me master of the matter and wrote for me the telegraphic alphabet which is still in use over the world not a small part of what mr morse said on this occasion had reference to the future of his invention its influence upon communities and individuals and i remember regarding as the wild speculations of an active imagination what he prophesied in this connection and which i have lived to see even more than realized nor was his conversation confined to his invention a distinguished artist an educated gentleman an observant traveler it was delightful to hear him talk and at this late day i recall few more pleasant evenings than the only one i passed in his company of course my first visit the next morning was to mr mclane to make my report by this time i had become almost as enthusiastic as mr morse himself and repeated what had passed between us i soon saw that mr mclane was becoming as eager for the construction of the line to washington as mr morse could desire he entered warmly into the spirit of the thing and laughed heartily if not incredulously when i told him that although he had been minister to england secretary of state and secretary of the treasury his name would be forgotten while that of morse would never cease to be remembered with gratitude and praise we then considered the question as to the right of the company to permit the line to be laid in the bed of the roadthe plan of construction at that time being to bury in a trench some eight or ten inches deep a half inch leaden tube containing the wrapped wire that was to form the electric circuit about this there was in my opinion no doubt and it was not long after that the work of construction commenced i met mr morse from time to time while he lived and often recurred to the evenings discussion at my house in baltimore the above is the substance of what i have more than once related to other persons i hope you will persist in your design of putting on paper your own very interesting recollections in this connection and if what i have contributed of mine is of service to you i shall be much pleased most truly yours john hb latrobe march 3 1881 the kravogl electric motor at the origin of every science of whatever nature it may be there is always a fruitless period of greater or less length characterized by the warfare of a few superior minds against general apathy the finest discoveries pass unperceived so to speak since they cannot cross the limits of a narrow circle and it often happens that they fall into oblivion before they have been seriously judged meanwhile a slow progress is imperceptibly made and in measure as theoretical principles more clearly disengage themselves a few industrial applications spring up and have the effect of awakening curiosity an impulse is thus given and from this moment a movement in advance goes on increasing at a headlong pace from day to day with electricity this period has been of comparatively short duration since scarcely a century and a half separate us from the first experiments made in this line of research now that it has truly taken its place in a rank with the other sciences we like to go back to the hesitations of the first hour and trace step by step the history of the progress made so as to assign to each one that portion of the merit that belongs to him in the common work when we thus cast a retrospective glance we find ourselves in the presence of one strange fact and that is the simultaneousness of discoveries that an absolutely original idea fertile in practical consequences should rise at a given moment in a fine brain is well we admire the discovery and in spite of us a little surprise mingles with our admiration but is it not a truly curious thing that several individuals should have had at nearly the same time that idea that was so astonishing in one this however is a fact that the history of electrical inventions offers more than one example of no one ignores the fact that the invention of the telephone gave rise to a notorious lawsuit two inventors having had this ingenious apparatus patented on the same day and at nearly the same hour this is one example among a thousand in the history of dynamoelectric machines it is an equally delicate matter to fix upon the one to whom belongs the honor of having first clearly conceived the possibility of engendering continuous currents we do not wish to take up this debate nor to go over the history of the question again every one knows that the first continuous current electric generator whose form was practical is due to zenobius gramme and dates back to july 1871 an epoch at which appeared a memoir entitled note upon a magnetoelectric machine that produces continuous currents that was read to the academy of sciences by mr jamin ten years previous pacinotti had had a glimpse of the phenomenon and of its practical realization but was unfortunately unable to appreciate the importance of his discovery and the benefit that might be reaped from it it is of slight consequence whether gramme knew of this experiment or not for the glory that attaches to his name could not be diminished for all that but an interesting fact that we propose to dwell upon now has recently been brought to light in an electrical review published at vienna1 it results from documents whose authenticity cannot be doubted that as far back as 1867 mr l pfaundler a professor at innsbruck very clearly announced the reversibility of a magnetoelectric motor constructed by kravogl a mechanician of the same place and that he succeeded some time before gramme in obtaining continuous currents footnote 1 zeitschrift des electrotechnischen vereines in wien july 1883 the kravogl motor that figured at the universal exhibition of 1867 is but little known and it is now very difficult to obtain drawings of it what is certain is that this motor is an application of the properties of the solenoid and from this standpoint resembles the bessolo motor that was patented in 1855 we may figure the apparatus to our mind very well if we suppose that in the gramme ring a half and almost twothirds of the core are removed and the spirals are movable around the said core if a current be sent into a portion of the spirals only and in such a way that only half of the core be exposed the latter will move with respect to the bobbin or the bobbin with respect to the core according as we suppose the solenoid or the bobbin fixed in the first case we have a bessolo motor and in the second a kravogl one in order to obtain a continuous motion it is only necessary to allow the current to circulate successively in the different portions of the solenoid it is difficult to keep the core in place since it is unreachable being placed in the interior of the bobbin kravogl solved this difficulty by constructing a hollow core into which he poured melted lead this heavy piece mounted upon rollers assumed a position of equilibrium that resulted from its weight from friction and from magnetic attraction but for a current of given intensity this position once reached did not vary and so necessitated a simple adjustment of the rubbers under such circumstances with a somewhat large number of sections the polarity of the core was nearly constant the spirals as a whole were attached to a soft iron armature that had the effect of closing up the lines of forces and forming a shell so to speak like bessolo kravogl never thought of making anything but a motor and did not perceive that his machine was reversible it results from some correspondence between dr a von waltenhofen and mr l pfaundler at this epoch that the latter clearly saw the possibility of utilizing this motor as a current generator under date of november 9 1867 he wrote in speaking of the kravogl motor which had just been taken to innsbruck in order to send it to paris i regret that i shall not be able to see it any more for i should have liked to try to make it act in an opposite direction that is to say to produce a current or an electric light by means of mechanical work a little more than two years later these experiments were carried out on a larger motor constructed by kravogl in 1869 and mr pfaundler was enabled to write as follows upon running the machine by hand we obtain a current whose energy is that of one bunsen element this letter is dated february 11 1870 that is to say it is a year anterior to the note of gramme illustration fig 1 in the presence of the historic interest that attaches to the question we do not think it will be out of place to reproduce here the considerations that guided prof pfaundler in the researches that led him to convert the kravogl motor into a dynamoelectric machine let us consider two magnetized bars db and bd placed end to end and surrounded by a cylindrical armature forming a shell this armature being likewise supposed to be a permanent magnet and to present poles of contrary direction opposite the poles of the bars for the sake of greater simplicity this shell is represented by a part only in the figure s n n s if into a magnetic field thus formed we pass a spiral from left to right the spiral will be traversed by a current whose direction will change according to the way in which the moving is done it is only necessary to apply lenzs law to see that a reversal of the currents will occur at the points a and c the direction of the current being represented by arrows in the figure if we suppose a continual displacement of the spirals from left to right we shall collect a continuous current by placing two rubbers at a and c either the core or the shell may be replaced by a piece of soft iron in such a case this piece will move with the spiral and keep its poles that are developed by induction fixed in space from this in order to reach a dynamoelectric machine it is necessary to try to develop the energy of the magnetic field by the action of the current itself if we suppose the core to be of soft iron and make a closer study of the action of the current as regards the polarity that occurs under the influence of the poles s n s we shall see that from d to a and from b to c the current is contrary while that from a to b and from c to d it is favorable to the development of such polarity in short with a spiral moving from d to d the resulting effect is nil a fact moreover that is selfevident under such circumstances if we suppose the shell as well as the core to be of soft iron we shall obtain a feeble current due to the presence of remanent magnetism but this magnetism will not be able to continue increasing under the influence of the current to solve this difficulty two means present themselves 1 to cause a favorable magnetic current and act upon the armature and 2 to suppress such portions of the current in the spirals as are injurious in effect the first solution was thought of by gramme in 1871 and is represented diagramatically in fig 2 the second is due to prof pfaundler and dates back to 1870 the core is cut through the center fig 3 and the portion to the right is suppressed the current is interrupted between da and cd and is closed only between a and c v fig 1 it results from this arrangement that under the action of the current the polarity due to remanent magnetism does nothing but increase it suffices then for but little remanent magnetism to prime the machine the polarity of the shell continues to increase and the energy of the magnetic field and consequently of the current has for a limit only the saturation of the soft iron if now we curve the core the spirals and the armature into a circle we have a gramme or a pfaundler machine according as we consider fig 2 or fig 3 illustration fig 2 illustration fig 3 this latter apparatus has in this case the form shown in fig 4 illustration fig 4 the spiral s m b is movable and the core n o s is kept in a position of equilibrium by virtue of its weight and is provided with rollers for the sake of greater clearness the front part of the armature is supposed to be removed the current does not circulate in the spirals to the right of the diameter w o which latter is not absolutely vertical the position of the rubbers and armature is regulated once for all we do not know just what were the means devised by kravogl to suppress the current in the spheres to the right at all events it is probable that the system has grown old since gramme invented his collector in the application of the kravogl motor to the generation of continuous currents professor pfaundler now proposes to ingeniously utilize the gramme collector in such a case the arrangement shown in fig 5 would be adopted let us suppose an ordinary collector having as many plates as there are sections in the ring these plates being connected as usual with the entrance and exit wires of the sections the diametrically opposite touches that are in the line w o are divided and one of the halves is connected at the entrance c a fig 4 with the corresponding section while the other communicates with the exit c a of the neighboring section each of these halves is prolonged by a piece of metal bent into the form of an arc of a circle and embracing a little less than a semicircumference between these prolongations there is an insulating part in the rotary motion of the spiral at least one of the touches is always outside of the arc comprised between the brushes r in order to secure a continuity of the circuit in the effective arc w s o it is only necessary to arrange a rubber m in such a way as to establish a communication between the two parts of the divided touch as soon as this latter enters the arc under consideration in order to produce a current in the direction of the arrows shown in fig 4 the spiral and axle must revolve from right to left in this case the rubber m occupies the position shown in the same figure the brushes embracing an arc of a little less than 180 as soon as the lower touch comes in contact with the brush r when the revolution is being effected from left to right the rubber m establishes a communication between the two halves that have until now been isolated and the current is no longer interrupted the second touch during this time is at any point whatever of the arc w n o and the spirals corresponding to the latter arc outside of the circuit in short thanks to the rubber m we have an ordinary gramme collector in that portion of the circuit comprised between the brushes and a collector with a breakage of the circuit in the portion to the right illustration fig 5 this type of machine is entirely theoretical in the apparatus used for prof pfaundlers experiments in 1870 the armature revolved with the solenoid the core and armature were of soft iron and the core was arranged in a manner analogous to the preceding and remained in place under the action of its weight and the shell forming a complete circle revolved with poles fixed in space practically the machine that we have just described would prove inconvenient to realize and would present serious inconveniences in the first place it seems to us quite difficult to transmit the motion of the solenoid to the axle supposing the former to revolve within the armature in the second place considerable friction would surely occur between the spirals and core and the axle being submitted to a lateral stress would be placed in a poor condition for work it is even allowable to doubt whether such a type could be practically got up at all events no trial has as yet been made of it compared with the gramme machine from an absolutely theoretical point of view the pfaundler apparatus presents undoubted advantages a theoretically perfect dynamo electric machine would be one in which there was a complete reciprocity between the magnetizing action of the current and the inductive action of the magnetic field now such is not the case in the gramme machine in this apparatus the soft iron core is at the same time a magnet through favorable induction and a disadvantageous electromagnet this double polarization is only remedied to a certain extent by the adjustment of the brushes in the pfaundler machine on the contrary the electromagnetism and magnetism through induction act in the same direction and concur in effecting a polarization that favors the production of the current looked at it in this light the latter machine more nearly approaches the type of perfection than does that of gramme but we must not forget that such qualities are purely theoretical in practice the best machine is that in which the copper is best utilized that is to say that which with a given weight of this metal furnishes the most work now this is certainly not the case in the pfaundler machine for here half or more than half of the ring is inerta defect which is apparent at first sight it results from this that as soon as we propose to obtain an electromotive force however slight it be we must get it with machines of large dimensions now it is permissible to believe that under such circumstances taking into consideration the complication of mechanical means that the construction of such apparatus necessitates and the great friction that occurs it would be impossible to obtain practical rotary velocities comparing his machine with grammes prof pfaundler expresses the idea that between them there is the same analogy as there is between a constant pressure and an expansion engine with cylinders of equal diameters the work performed by the former of these is greater than that done by the second but in the latter the expansive force of the steam is better utilized this comparison seems to us to be more ingenious than exact would it not be coming nearer to the truth if we were to suppose a case of a hydraulic motor whose performance continued diminishing with the height of the fall and would it not be advantageous under such circumstances to utilize only a portion of the fall for the purpose of increasing the motors performance this machine however as before stated has never as yet been constructed so that experimental data relative to its mode of working are wanting it is especially interesting as regards its origin which dates back to an epoch at which researches on the dynamo electric machine were at their heat it is in its historical aspect that it is proper to regard it and it is from such a point of view that we have deemed it well to say a few words about it in this placela lumiere electrique bornhardts electric machine for blasting in mines we shall not attempt to pass in review the several apparatus that have hitherto been devised for igniting blasts in mining operations but shall simply describe in this place a machine recently invented for this purpose by mr

rubbers b that are formed of skin and are held against the disks by small springs r motion is communicated to the axle a by means of a pair of gearings a and b and a crank f illustration bornhardts

discharging the condensers there is employed a manipulator formed of a rod mm which can be acted upon from the exterior by means of a button k upon bringing the ball m of the rod in contact with the ball p of the condenser the lever which then takes the position shown by the dotted line continues to remain in connection with a small ring q through a special spring another ring t is connected in the same way with the external armature of the condenser upon connecting the rings p and t by a wire to which cartridges are attached any number of the latter may be ignited the parts that we have just enumerated are inclosed in a tin box covered with a wooden casing p between the two there is inserted a sheet of hard rubber in order to prevent a loss of electricity the whole is held in place by strong springs in order to show the normal state of the condenser a scale consisting of 15 metallic buttons to give the dimensions of the sparks is arranged at x this scale is capable of being connected with the rings q and t by means of chains when the spark obtained after 15 or 20 revolutions considerably exceeds the intervals of the scale it is a sure thing that the machine is in a proper state in order to prepare the apparatus for carriage the winch is taken off and placed in the compartment m which is closed by means of a door q figs 5 and 6 show the arrangement of the

alarm the object of this apparatus is to close an electric circuit when the temperature of a room rises above a certain point many devices have been invented for effecting this object each of which have their own advantages or disadvantages the invention of mr pritchett enables the required result to be obtained in a very satisfactory manner the apparatus consists as shown by the figure of a long glass vessel containing air connected to this vessel there is a glass tube filled with mercury the whole is mounted on a metal cradle which turns on pivots according to the position which the glass vessel and its adjuncts occupy in the cradle this position being adjustable by means of a thumbscrew seen at the upper part of the cradle so will the same have a tendency to rock longitudinally over to one side or the other now if we suppose the position to be such that the right hand end of the glass vessel is depressed and the left hand end raised then if the vessel becomes subjected to an elevation of temperature the air inside the same will become expanded and the mercury column in the tube will be driven over to the left and will rise in the turned up end of the tube this will cause the left hand branch of the glass vessel and its attachments to become increased in weight while the right hand branch will become proportionally lighter the consequence of this will be that the vessel and its cradle will cant over and by falling on an electrical contact will close a circuit and sound an alarm it is obvious that the apparatus is equally well adapted for indicating a diminution as well as an increase of temperature for if the electrical contact be placed under the right hand portion of the cradle and the latter be adjusted so that in its normal position its left hand portion is depressed then when the glass vessel becomes cooled the air in it will contract and the mercury will fall in the turnedup portion of the tube before referred to and will rise in the limb connected to the vessel consequently the cradle and glass vessel will cant over in the reverse way to that which it did in the first case owing to the surface which the glass vessel exposes the air inside quickly responds to any external change of temperature consequently the apparatus is very sensitive another important feature is the fact that the cradle and vessel in canting over acquires a certain momentum and thus the contact made becomes very certain illustration pritchetts electric fire alarm mr pritchett proposes that his apparatus shall give external evidence outside the house by ringing a gong and by dropping a semaphore arm released by an electromagnet he also proposes as has often been suggested that a water supply shall be automatically turned onelectrical review a standard thermopile dr g gore frs has invented an improved thermopile for measuring small electromotive forces it consists of about 300 pairs of horizontal slender parallel wires of iron and german silver the former being covered with cotton they are mounted on a wooden frame about 1 in of the opposite ends of the wires are bent downward to a vertical position to enable them to dip into liquids at different temperatures contained in long narrow troughs the liquids being nonconductors such as melted paraffin for the hot junctions and the nonvolatile petroleum known as thin machinery oil the electromotive force obtained varies with the temperature a pile of 295 pairs having a resistance of 956 ohms at 16 deg cent gave with a difference of temperature of 100 deg cent an electromotive force of 07729 volts or with 130 deg cent an electromotive force of 1005 volt each element therefore equaled 00000262 volt for each degree cent difference of temperature on having been verified with a standard voltaic cell the apparatus becomes itself a standard especially for small electromotive forces it is capable of measuring the 134861 part of a volt for higher electromotive forces than a volt several of these piles would have to be connected in series the fractional electromotive force is obtained by means of a sliding contact which cuts out so many pairs as is required telephonic transmission without receivers the annual meeting of the french society of physics the success of which is continually increasing took place this year in the salons of the observatory which were kindly placed at the societys disposal by admiral mouchez there were three consecutive sessions the one of tuesday april 15 being set apart for the members of the association the one of the 16th for the invited guests of admiral mouchez and that of the 17th for the invited guests of the society the salons were partially lighted by the siemens differential arc continuous current lamps and partially by the swan incandescent lamp supplied by a distributing machine that permitted of the lamps being lighted and extinguished at will without changing the normal operation of all the rest many apparatus figured at this exhibition but we shall on the present occasion merely call attention to those that presented a certain character of novelty or of originality among the apparatus that we shall reserve a description of for the present was messrs richard bros registering thermometer designed for the concarneau laboratory an instrument which when sunk at one mile from the coast and to a depth of 40 meters will give a diagram of the temperature of the ocean at that depth and mr hospitaliers continuous electrical indicators designed for making known from a distance such mechanical or physical phenomena as velocities levels temperatures pressures etc among the most important of the apparatus exhibited we must reckon mr cailletets devices for liquefying gases and those of mr mascart for determining the ohm the results obtained by mr mascart which have been submitted to the committee on unities of the congress of electricians now in session at paris are sensibly concordant with those obtained independently in england by lord rayleigh everything leads to the hope then that a rapid and definite solution will be given of this important question of electric unities and that nothing further will prevent the international development of the cgs system mr jules duboscq made a number of very successful projections and we particularly remarked the peculiar experiment made in conjunction with mr parinaud that gave in projection two like spectra produced by the same prism and which through superposition were capable of increasing the intensity of the colors or on the contrary of reconstituting white light among the optical applications we may cite mr leon laurents apparatus for controlling plane parallel perpendicular and oblique surfaces and magic mirrors obtained with an ordinary light mr sp thompsons apparatus for demonstrating the propagation of electromagnetic waves in ether according to maxwells theory as well as some new polarizing prisms and a mode of lighting the microscope presented by mr yvon that was quite analogous to the one employed more than a year ago by dr van heurck director of the botanical garden of anvers acoustics were represented by an electromagnetic brake siren of mr bourbouze konigs apparatus for the synthesis of sounds and mr sp thompsons cymatographa pendulum apparatus for demonstrating the phenomena of beats it was electricity again that occupied the largest space in the programme of the session apparatus for teaching are assuming greater and greater importance every day and the exhibit of mr ducretet included a large number of the most interesting of these the house of breguet exhibited on a reduced scale the magnificent experiments of gaston plante wherein 320 leaden wire secondary elements charged for quantity with 3 daniell elements and afterward coupled for tension served to charge a rheostatic machine formed of 50 condensers coupled for quantity these latter coupled anew for tension furnished upon being discharged a spark due to a difference of potential of about 32000 volts that presented all the characters of the spark produced by induction coils on the machines so improperly called static finally we may cite the apparatus arranged by mr sp thompson for studying the development of currents in magnetoelectric machines the inventor studies the influence of the forms of the inductors and armatures of machines by means of an arrangement that allows him to change the rings or armatures at will and to take out the induced bobbins in order to sound every part of the magnetic field upon giving the armature an angular motion limited by two stops there develops a certain quantity of electricity that may be measured by causing it to traverse an appropriate ballistic galvanometer messrs deprez and darsonvals galvanometer answers very well for this purpose and its aperiodicity which causes it quickly to return to zero as soon as the induced current ceases permits of a large number of readings being taken within a very short space of time measuring apparatus were represented by a new and very elegant arrangement of sir william thomsons reflecting galvanometers due to mr j carpentier the mounting adopted by mr carpentier permits of an easy removal of the bobbins and of an instantaneous substitution therefor the galvanometric part composed of the needles and mirror therefore remains entirely free thus allowing of its being verified and making it convenient to attach the silken fiber mr carpentier has moreover adopted for all the minor apparatus a transparent celluloid scale which simplifies them facilitates observations and renders the use of reflection almost industrial we shall complete our enumeration of the measuring apparatus by citing ducretets nonoscillating galvanometer sir william thomsons amperemeters voltameters ohmmeters and mhosmeters constructed and exhibited by breguet and a new aperiodic galvanoscope of mr maiche mr baudot exhibited the recent improvements that he has made in his multiplex printing telegraph and m boudet of paris showed a new system of telephone transmission by submarine cables illustration fig 1diagram exhibiting the arrangement for telephonic transmissions without a receiver finally we shall conclude our enumeration by referring to the curiosities the house of siemens exhibited a miniature electric railway actuated by a new model of reynier accumulators m maiche operated a system of musical telephonic auditions that differed only in detail from those instituted by mr ader at the exhibition of 1881 and mr hospitalier presented a new form of an experiment devised by mr giltay consisting of a telephonic transmission of sounds without the use of receivers mr giltays experiment is nothing but mr dunands speaking condenser without the condenser a glance at fig 1 will show how things are arranged for the experiment the transmitting system comprises two distinct circuits viz 1 one formed of a pile p of 2 or 3 leclanche elements or of 1 or 2 small sized accumulators an ader microphane transmitter m and the inducting wire of a small induction coil b and 2 the other formed of the induced wire of the coil b of a pile p of 10 or 12 leclanche elements and of a line whose extremities terminate at r in two ordinary electromedical handles with this arrangement the experiment performed is as follows when any one speaks or sings in front of the transmitter t while two persons a and b each having one hand gloved are holding the handles in the ungloved hand it is only necessary for a to place his gloved hand upon bs ear or for the latter to place his hand upon as or for each to place his hand on the others ear simultaneously in order that a or b or a and b simultaneously may hear a voice issuing from the glove under these circumstances mr giltays experiment is explained like dunands speaking condenserthe hand of a and the ear of b here constituting the armature of an elementary condenser in which the glove performs the role of dielectric upon repeating this experiment at the laboratory of the school of physics and industrial chemistry of paris it has been found that the glove maybe replaced by a sheet of plain or paraffined paper in this case when two persons are holding the handles and have their ears applied one against the other if a sheet of paper be interposed airs or words will be heard to proceed therefrom finally it has been found possible to entirely suppress the paper or dielectric and to hear directly by simply interposing the auditor or auditors in the circuit one of the most curious forms of the experiment is the one shown in fig 2 here a third person c hears the hands of a and b speak when a circuit is formed by means of three persons a b and c the two former a and b each holding one of the wires of the circuit and applying his free hand to the ear of c although the experiment is one that requires entire silence and could not on that account be performed at the laboratory a sort of telephonic chain can be formed in which five or six persons may hear at the same time a putting his hand on the ear of b the latter putting his to that of c and so on up to the last person who closes the circuit by grasping one of the handles the other one being held by a illustration experiment on telephonic transmission without receiving apparatus it is difficult in the present state of science to explain very clearly how these telephonic transmissions are effected without a receiver all that we can conclude from it so far is that the ear is an instrument of incomparable delicacy and of exquisite sensitiveness since it perceives vibrations in which the energy developer particularly in the telephonic chain is exceedingly feeble without any desire to seek an application for an experiment that is simply curious we yet believe that there is here a phenomenon of a nature to be studied by physicists discoveries in telephony and microphony have certainly opened up to science as regards both theory and practice new horizons that still promise other surprises for the future but to return to the observatory the success obtained by the exhibition of the french society of physics shows that these reunions respond to a genuine needthat of instructing in and popularizing science while warmly congratulating the organizers of these meetings we may express a wish that the good example set by the society of physics may be followed by other societies we are convinced in advance that an equal success awaits themla nature on the arrangement of ground conductors in telegraphy as well as in the question of lightning rods attention has been but incidentally paid to the improvement of ground conductors and this point has not been the object of that careful study that has been bestowed upon the establishment of aerial lines it is only recently that the interest created by lightning rods has given rise to new forms of conductors differing from those formerly used the publications of the prussian academy of sciences of from 1876 to 1880 contain some information of special importance in regard to this it is stated therein that the effect of ground conductors may be notably increased by the division of the earth plates and the use of metallic rods without necessitating a greater output of material these facts however have not as yet been put to profit in practice for the reason perhaps that the considerations which have remained general have not at once permitted of obtaining forms what could be employed with perfect knowledge of the results this is what led mr ulbricht of dresden to make calculations for a few forms of conductors and to test their approximate values the results of these researches are printed in the elektrotechnischen zeitschrift for 1883 p 18 illustration the equations found show in the first place that there exist three means of obtaining a considerable effect as regards the ground conductor with a slight expenditure of material the cylindrical electrode may be drawn out into the form of a bar or wire the plate may be rendered narrow and elongated in the form of a ribbon and besides the annular plate may be enlarged in lessening the metallic surface finally a short open cylinder with a vertical axis may be formed by curving a narrow plate or ribbon it is not necessary to see the formula to recognize the fact that this cylinder must behave like a ribbon and a flat ring the radius increasing and the surface remaining constant the resistance of the earth here likewise approaches zero as the resistance of the earth is inversely proportional to the diameter of the plates the zero resistance can also be reached by dividing a plate ad infinitum as the parts of the plate may be brought quite close to each other without perceptibly interfering with the action a network has finally been reached by a division carried very far yet limited and by connecting the parts with one another by conducting cylinders if we seek to determine what forms of ground conductors are efficient and economical under given conditions we shall have to begin by informing ourselves as to the choice of material to be used for the electrode and shall then have to ascertain whether putting it in the ground will or will not necessitate much outlay the most suitable material is copper which may be used with advantage in that it lasts pretty well underground and that the facility which it may be worked permits of easily giving it more appropriate forms than those that can be obtained with cast iron which is of itself less costly if the burying in the ground requires little or no labor as when there exist ponds rivers and wells or subterranean strata of water near the surface of the earth elongated forms of conductors will be employed such as the solid or hollow cylinder the wire the ribbon the narrow ring and the network plates approaching a square or circular shape are not advantageous but if the ground has to be dug deeply in order to sink the conductor the form of the electrode must be more condensed and selected in such a way that the necessary action may be obtained with a minimum output of copper and labor for great depths and when the ground will permit of boring an elongated and narrow cylinder will be used such a system however can only be employed when the cylinder is surrounded by spring water since without that an intimate contact with earth that is only moist cannot be obtained with certainty in earth that is only moist and for moderate depths preference may be given to an electrode laid down flat the digging necessary in this case is onerous it is true but it permits of very accurately determining the state of the earth beneath and of obtaining a very perfect adherence of the electrode therewith two forms the annular ribbon or the flat ring and the network present themselves according to calculations as a substitute for copper plates which are so expensive and these forms are satisfactory on condition that the labor of digging be not notably increased these forms should always have a diameter a little greater than that of the plate the flat ring and the network however offer one weak point which they possess in common with the plate and that is their dimensions cannot be easily adapted to the nature of the ground met with without a notable increase in the expense now if the ground should offer a conductivity less than what was anticipated and it were desired to increase the plate say by onethird it would be impossible to do so as a consequence of the closed form one important advantage is realized in this respect by combining the ring and the network in the form of a reticulated ring having a diameter of from 1 to 1 meters on cutting this ring at a given place and according to a certain radius we obtain the reticulated ribbon shown in the accompanying figure the thickness of the wires is 25 mm and their weight is 0475 kilo per meter l l and l are the points at which the conducting cable is soldered a reticulated ribbon of copper can be made in advance of any length whatever and according to local exigencies it may be easily curved and given the form of a flat or cylindrical ring of varying width even though the ribbon has already been cut for a ring of given diameter it may be still further enlarged by drawing it out and leaving a bit of the ring open so as to thus obtain a nearly corresponding diminution in the resistance such a resistance may be still further diminished by rendering the ring higher that is to say by employing an annular cylindrical form after assuring himself by experiments on a small scale that calculation and observation gave concordant results for the flat ring the author made an experiment on a larger scale with the annular network for practical reasons he employed for this purpose a copper wire 25 mm in diameter which may be expected to last as long as one of iron plate 2 mm in thickness calculation showed that in a ribbon 160 mm wide meshes 40 mm in breadth were advantageous and favorable as regards rigidity a reticulated ribbon like this 4 meters in length was made and formed into a flat ring having an external diameter of 142 m and an internal one of 110 m the resistance of this ring was found to be w 03485 1k and that of a plate one meter square w0 0368 1k as the conductivity of the earth is very variable and as we cannot have an absolute guarantee that the ramming will be uniform it seemed proper to make the measurements of the resistance by fixing the plate and the ring in succession to the lower surface of a small raft in such a way that the contact with the water should correspond as well as possible to the suppositions made for the calculation as a second ground conductor a system of water pipes was used and after this a lightning rod conductor etc repeated and varied experiments gave for the calculation of the values of the resistances equations so concordant that the following results may be considered very approximate the square plate had a resistance of 355 siemens units and the reticulated ring one of 325 from the first figure we deduce k 19112 that is to say the specific conductivity of riverwater is 191120000 calculation then gives as the resistance of the earth in siemens units calculated observed square plate 335 335 annular ring 3176 325 these figures prove the accuracy of the calculations that had been made in an approximate way the experiments were performed upon the elba above dresden other experiments still had reference to the influence of immersion in order to diminish polarization only instantaneous currents from the measuring pile were employed it was to be supposed that the current of water through which the bubbles of gas were removed from the electrodes would not have permitted of a notable resistance of polarization later measurements made upon a ribbon buried like the plates in the earth gave likewise most favorable results as a result of these experiments the state railways of saxony have in such cases as were practicable introduced the annular network of copper there are some manufacturers too who seem desirous of adopting this system although it has hardly emerged from the period of experiment the pecuniary advantages that will result from an application of it ought it would seem to dispel a large proportion of the criticisms directed against the erection of lightning rods from the standpoint of expense and contribute to extend an arrangement which may be considered as a very happy one if we compare the square plate with the equivalent annular network constructed as above indicated and which should possess according to the author an external diameter of 126 m and of 345 m we find that the square plate 1 mm thick weighs 89 kilos 2 178 the annular network 164 the cost of reticulated ribbon per meter amounts to about 44 francs supposing it to be arranged as shown in the cut as term of comparison we may admit that the following forms are nearly the equivalent of a horizontal unburied plate one meter square length diameter vertical cylinder buried 140 m 013 m 180 m 006 m vertical bar 260 m 0013 m horizontal bar 520 m 0013 m horizontal flat ring 132 m in external diameter and 108 m internal horizontal network 101 m square and having meshes of the same size as those of the reticulated ribbon horizontal reticulated ribbon 3 m in length and of the structure described horizontal annular ring 126 m in external diameter 094 m internal in conclusion let us meet an objection that might be made to the accuracy of the hypotheses that serve as a base to the preceding calculations in cases where ground plates for lightning rods and not for telegraphs are concerned between the two ground plates of a telegraph line there is generally a distance such that the curves of the current undergo no deviation in the vicinity of one of the electrodes the only part important for integrations through the influence of the other but it might be admitted that such would prove the case with a lightning rod in a storm at the time of the passage of the fluid into the earth the ground plate here is one of the electrodes and the other is replaced by the surface of the earth strongly charged to a great distance under the storm clouds if we suppose what may be admitted in a good lightning rod that there no longer occurs any spark from the point downward the curves of the current in starting perpendicularly from the ground plate would be obliged to leave their rectilinear trajectory and strike the surface of the earth at right angles when the electricity flows through a plane surface into an infinite body it is only when such surface presents a very great development that the respective potentials decrease very slowly in the vicinity of the said surface no notable modification occurs then in the curves of equal potential in the vicinity of the ground plate through the action of this extended charge nor consequently any modification in the curves of the current but the electricity which spreads has but a short distance to travel in order to overcome the most important resistances the calculations of resistances given above have then the same value for discharges of atmospheric electricitybull du musee de lindustrie on electrolysis by h schucht concerning the separations which take place at the positive pole the composition of the peroxides and the manner of their determination relatively little has been done if solutions of the salts of lead thallium silver bismuth nickel and cobalt are decomposed by the current between platinum electrodes metal is deposited at the negative and oxide at the positive electrode manganese is precipitated only as peroxide the formation of peroxide is of course effected by the ozone found in the electrolytic oxygen at the positive pole the oxide existing in solution is brought to a higher degree of oxidation and is separated out its formation may be decreased or entirely prevented by the addition of readily oxidizible bodies such as organic acids lactose glycerine and preferably by an excess of oxalic acid but only until the organic matter is transformed into carbonic acid in this manner classen separates other metals from manganese in order to prevent the saline solutions from being retained by the peroxide with solutions of silver bismuth nickel and cobalt it is often practicable to prevent the separation of oxide by giving the current a greater resistanceincreasing the distance between the electrodes the proportion between the quantities of metal and of peroxide deposited is not constant and even if we disregard the concentration of the solution the strength of the current and secondary influences action of nascent hydrogen is different in acid and in alkaline solutions in acid solutions much peroxide is formed in alkaline liquids little or none the reason of the difference is that ozone is evolved principally in acid solutions but appears in small quantities only in alkaline liquids or under certain circumstances not at all the quantity of peroxide deposited depends also on the temperature of the saline solution at ordinary temperatures the author obtained more peroxidethe solution the time and the strength of current being equalthan from a heated liquid the cause is that ozone is destroyed by heat and converted into ordinary oxygen with the exception of lead and thallium the quantity of metal deposited from an acid solution is always greater than that of the peroxide leadluckow has shown that from acid solutionsno matter what may be the acidlead is deposited at the anode as a mixture of anhydrous and hydrated peroxide of variable composition only very strongly acid solutions let all their lead fall down as peroxide the precipitation is rapid immediately on closing the circuit and complete separation is effected only in presence of at least 10 per cent of free nitric acid as the current becomes stronger with the increase of free acid there is deposited upon the first compact layer a new stratum of loosely adhering peroxide in presence of small quantities of other metals which are thrown down by the current in the metallic state such as copper mercury etc peroxide alone is deposited from a solution of lead containing small quantities only of free nitric acid the lead peroxide deposited is at first light brown or dark red and becomes constantly darker and finally taking a velvetblack as its stratification upon the platinum is unequal it forms beautifully colored rings experiments show that the quantity of peroxide deposited depends on the nature of the solution and the strength of the current in case of very feeble currents and slight acidity its quantity is so small that it does not need to be taken into consideration if the lead solution is very dilute scarcely any current is observed lead solutions per se being very bad conductors of electricity faintly acid concentrated lead solutions give loose peroxide along with much spongy metallic lead free alkali decreases the separation of peroxide feebly alkaline solutions concentrated and dilute yield relatively much peroxide along with metallic lead while strongly alkaline solutions deposit no peroxide dried lead peroxide is so sparingly hygroscopic that it may be weighed as such its weight remains constant upon the balance for a long time in order to apply the peroxide for quantitative determinations a large surface must be exposed to action as positive electrode a platinum capsule is convenient and a platinum disk as negative pole the capsule shape is necessary because the peroxide when deposited in large quantities adheres only partially and falls in part in thin loose scales it is necessary to siphon off the nitric solution since like all peroxides that of lead is not absolutely insoluble in nitric acid the methods of riche and may give results which are always too high since portions of saline solution are retained by the spongy deposit and can be but very imperfectly removed by washing this is especially the case in presence of free alkali the author has proceeded as follows the lead peroxide is dried in the capsule and there is passed over it pure dry gaseous sulphurous acid in a strong current from a rather narrow delivery tube lead sulphate is formed with evolution of heat it is let cool under the exsiccator and weighed as such or he ignites the peroxide along with finely pulverized ammonium sulphite the mass must have a pure white color after the conclusion of the reaction it is ignited for about 20 minutes the results are too high the proportion of actual lead peroxide in the deposit ranges from 94 to 9476 per cent the peroxide precipitated from a nitric solution may under certain circumstances be anhydrous this result is due to the secondary influences at the positive pole where the free acid gradually withdraws water from the peroxide the peroxide thrown down from alkaline solutions retains alkali so obstinately that it cannot be removed by washing the peroxide plays here the part of an acid the lead nitrate mechanically inclosed in the peroxide is resolved by ignition into oxide hyponitric acid and oxygen this small proportion of lead oxide does not exert an important influence on the final result the quantity of matter mechanically inclosed is relatively high as in the precipitation of much lead peroxide there is relatively more saline matter occluded than when a few centigrammes are deposited the peroxide incloses also more foreign matter if it is thrown down upon a small surface than if it is deposited in a thin layer over a broad surface from numerous analyses the author concludes that in presence of much free nitric acid the proportion of water is increased with free alkali the reverse holds good thallium behaves similarly to lead from a nitric acid solution it is thrown down according to the proportion of free acid either as sesquioxide only or in small quantities as silvery metallic leaflets from alkaline solutions it is deposited as sesquioxide and metal the latter of a leadgray color thallium solutions conduct the electric current badly thallium oxide resembles lead peroxide in color at a strong heat it melts becomes darker and is converted into peroxide in which state it can be weighed silverall solutions of silver salts except the nitrate and those containing a very large quantity of free nitric acid or nitrates deposit electrolytically merely metallic silver in the above mentioned exceptional cases there is formed a small quantity of peroxide which adheres to the anode as a blackishgray deposit the greatest quantity of peroxide is obtained on employing a concentrated strongly acid solution of the nitrate and a strong current if the solution is very dilute we obtain no peroxide or mere traces which disappear again toward the end of the process the peroxide is deposited at first in small dark shining octahedral crystals subsequently in an amorphous state at 110 it evolves oxygen suddenly and is converted into metallic silver it dissolves in ammonia with a violent escape of nitrogen in nitric acid it dissolves without decomposition and with a red color the author uses a galvanic current for reducing silver residues consisting of sulphocyanide the salt is mixed with sulphuric acid in a roomy platinum capsule and a fine platinum wire gauze is used as positive electrode bismuththe current resolves bismuth solutions into metal and bismutic acid the latter is deposited at the positive pole and in thin layers appears of a goldenyellow but in thick strata is darker approaching to red its formation is very gradual and in time it disappears again owing to secondary actions of the current on ignition it becomes lemon yellow and transitorily darker even brown and passes into the sexquioxide nickel and cobalton the electrolysis of the ammonical solution the sesquioxide appears at the positive pole its formation is prevented by an excess of ammonia the author never obtains more than 3 per cent of the quantity of the metal the sesquioxides dissolve in ammonia without escape of nitrogen and are usually anhydrous manganesemanganese is the only metal which is precipitated only as peroxide it is deposited at once on closing the circuit and is at first brown then black and shining organic acids ferrous oxide chromic oxide ammonium salts etc prevent the formation of peroxide and the red color produced by permanganic acid in very dilute strongly acid nitric solutions there is formed only permanganic acid which according to riche is plainly visible in solutions containing 11000000 grm manganese on electrolyzing a manganiferous solution of copper nitrate red permanganic acid appeared in a stratum floating above the platinum disk coated with brown peroxide no manganese peroxide was deposited the peroxide adheres firmly to the platinum when the proportion of free acid is small not exceeding 3 per cent and the current is not too strong if the action of the current is prolonged after the peroxide is thrown down it falls off in lamin according to riche in a nitric solution the manganese is deposited as peroxide also at the negative pole this formation is not directly due to the current but is a precipitate occasioned by the production of ammonia by the reduction of nitric acid to determine the manganese in peroxide electrolytically precipitated it is heated to bright redness in the platinum capsule until the weight becomes constant the results are too high selenium and telluriumboth these bodies are readily and completely reduced by the current either in acid or alkaline solutions selenium is thrown down at first of a fine brownish red which gradually becomes darker the deposit of tellurium is of a bluish black color if the current is feeble the deposit of selenium is moderately compact that of tellurium is always loose and it often floats on the liquid a strong current precipitates both as powders the positive pole is coated during electrolysis with a film of a dark color in case of selenium but of a lemon yellow with tellurium as in case of arsenic and antimony the hydrogen evolved at the negative pole combines with the reduced substances forming hydrogen selenide or telluride which remain in part in solution in the liquid the reduced metal separates out at the anode in a friable conditionzeitschrift fur analytische chemie and chemical news the electrochemical equivalent of silver a very careful and important determination of the electrochemical equivalent of silver has been made at the observatory of the physical institute of wrzbourg and the results are that an ampere current flowing for a second or a coulomb of electricity deposits 11183 milligrammes of silver or 03281 milligramme of copper and decomposes 009328 milligramme of water a result agreeing closely with that of lord rayleigh recently communicated to the physical society an ampere therefore deposits 40259 grammes of silver per hour kohlrauschs value is 40824 a value hitherto accepted universally this value is so useful in measuring electric currents with accuracy and free from the disturbances of magnetism etc that it is eminently satisfactory to find the german value agree with that of lord rayleigh which will probably be adopted by english electricians a new standard light herr hefneralteneck has suggested a new standard light for photometric purposes which promises to be very simple and effective in operation the light is produced by an open flame of amylacetate burning from a wick of cotton fiber which fills a tube of german silver 1 in long and 316 mils internal diameter the external diameter being 324 mils the flame is 158 in high from top to bottom and it should be lighted at least ten minutes before using the light for testing a cylindrical glass chimney surrounds it to ward off air currents about 2 per cent of the light is absorbed by the glass the power of the flame is that of a standard english candle and experiments have shown that amyl acetate which besides is not expensive is the best fuel for steadiness and brilliance neither the substitution of commercial amylacetate for pure nor the use of a wick of cotton thread for loose cotton fiber alters the illuminating power but the wick should be trimmed square across the mouth of the tube for if it project and droop the illuminating power is increased nature dr feussners new polarizing prism in a recent number of the zeitschrift fur instrumentenkunde iv 4250 february 1884 dr k feussner of karlsruhe has given a detailed description of a polarizing prism lately devised by him which presents several points of novelty and for which certain advantages are claimed the paper also contains an account although not an exhaustive one of the various polarizing prisms which have from time to time been constructed by means of different combinations of iceland spar the literature of this subject is scattered and somewhat difficult of access and moreover only a small part of it has hitherto been translated into english and it would appear therefore that a brief abstract of the paper may not be without service to those among the readers of nature who may be unacquainted with the original memoirs or who may not have the necessary references at hand following the order adopted by dr feussner the subject may be divided into two parts iolder forms of polarizing prisms in comparing the various forms of polarizing prisms the main points which need attention arethe angular extent of the field of view the direction of the emergent polarized ray whether it is shifted to one side of or remains symmetrical to the long axis of the prism the proportion which the length of the prism bears to its breadth and lastly the position of the terminal faces whether perpendicular or inclined to the long axis these requirements are fulfilled in different degrees by the following methods of construction illustration fig 1 fig 2 and fig 3 1 the nicol prism edin new phil journal 1828 vi 83this fig 1 as is well known is constructed from a rhombohedron of iceland spar the length of which must be fully three times as great as the width the end faces are cut off in such a manner that the angle of 72 which they originally form with the lateral edge of the rhombohedron is reduced to 68 the prism is then cut in two in a plane perpendicular to the new end surfaces the section being carried obliquely from one obtuse corner of the prism to the other in the direction of its length the surfaces of this section after having been carefully polished are cemented together again by means of canada balsam a ray of light on entering the prism is separated by the double refraction of the calcspar into an ordinary and an extraordinary ray the former undergoes total reflection at the layer of balsam at an incidence which allows the extraordinary ray to be transmitted the latter therefore passes through unchanged this principle of obtaining a single polarized ray by means of total reflection of the other is common to all the forms of prism now to be described dr feussner gives a mathematical analysis of the paths taken by the two polarized rays within the nicol prism and finds that the emergent extraordinary ray can include an angular field of 29 but that this extreme value holds good only for rays incident upon that portion of the end surface which is near to the obtuse corner and that from thence it gradually decreases until the field includes an angle of only about half the previous amount he finds moreover that although of course the ray emerges parallel to its direction of incidence yet that the zone of polarized light is shifted to one side of the central line also that the great length of the nicol328 times its breadthis not only an inconvenience but owing to the large pieces of spar thus required for its construction prisms of any but small size become very expensive to this it may be added that there is a considerable loss of light by reflection from the first surface owing to its inclined position in regard to the long axis of the prism illustration fig 4 fig 5 and fig 6 it is with the view of obviating these defects that the modifications represented in figs 2 to 6 have been devised 2 the shortened nicol prismthis arrangement of the nicol prism is constructed by dr steeg and reuter of homburg vdh for the sake of facility of manufacture the end surfaces are cleavage planes and the oblique cut instead of being perpendicular makes with these an angle of about 84 by this alteration the prism becomes shorter and is now only 283 times its breadth but if canada balsam is still used as the cement the field will occupy a very unsymmetrical position in regard to the long axis if balsam of copaiba is made use of the index of refraction of which is 150 a symmetrical field of about 24 will be obtained a prism of this kind has also been designed by prof b hasert of eisenach pogg ann cxiii 189 but its performance appears to be inferior to the above 3 the nicol prism with perpendicular endsthe terminal surfaces in this prism are perpendicular to the long axis and the sectional cut makes with them an angle of about 75 the length of the prism is 375 times its breadth and if the cement has an index of refraction of 1525 the field is symmetrically disposed and includes an angle of 27 prisms of this kind have been manufactured by dr steeg mr cd ahrens and others 4 the foucault prism comptes rendus 1857 xlv 238this construction differs from all those hitherto mentioned in that a film of air is employed between the two cut surfaces as the totally reflecting medium instead of a layer of cement the two halves of the prism are kept in position without touching each other by means of the mounting the length of the prism is in this way much reduced and amounts to only 1528 times its breadth the end surfaces are cleavage planes and the sectional cut makes with them an angle of 59 the field however includes not more than about 8 so that this prism can be used only in the case of nearly parallel rays and in addition to this the pictures which may be seen through it are to some extent veiled and indistinct owing to repeated internal reflection 5 the hartnack prism ann de ch et de physique ser iv vii 181this form of prism was devised in 1866 by mm hartnack and prazmowiski the original memoir is a valuable one a translation of it with some additions has lately been published journ of the r microscopical soc june 1883 428 it is considered by dr feussner to be the most perfect prism capable of being prepared from calcspar the ends of the prism are perpendicular to its length the section carried through it is in a plane perpendicular to the principal axis of the crystal the cementing medium is linseed oil the index of refraction of which is 1485 this form of prism is certainly not so well known in this country as it deserves to be a very excellent one supplied to the present writer by dr steeg is of rectangular form throughout the terminal surfaces are 19 15 mm and the length 41 mm the lateral shifting of the field is scarcely perceptible the prism is perfectly colorless and transparent and its performance is far superior to that of the ordinary nicol the field of view afforded by this construction depends upon the cementing substance used and also upon the inclination of the sectional cut in regard to the end of the prism it may vary from 20 to 41 if the utmost extent of field is not required the prism may be shortened by lessening the angle of the section at the expense however of interfering with the symmetrical disposition of the field 6 the glan prism carls repertorium xvi 570 and xvii 195this is a modification of the foucault and in a similar manner includes a film of air between the sectional surfaces the end surfaces and also the cut carried through the prism are parallel to the principal axis of the calcspar the ends are normal to the length and the field includes about 8 this prism is very short and may indeed be even shorter than it is broad it is subject to the same defect as that mentioned in the case of the foucault although perhaps not quite to the same extent iithe new polarizing prism this prism differs very considerably from the preceding forms and consists of a thin plate of a doubly refracting crystal cemented between two wedgeshaped pieces of glass the terminal faces of which are normal to the length the external form of the prism may thus be similar to the hartnack the calcspar being replaced by glass the indices of refraction of the glass and of the cementing medium should correspond with the greater index of refraction of the crystal and the directions of greatest and least elasticity in the latter must stand in a plane perpendicular to the direction of the section one of the advantages claimed for the new prism is that it dispenses with the large and valuable pieces of spar hitherto found necessary a further advantage being that other crystalline substances may be used in this prism instead of calcspar the latter advantage however occurs only when the difference between the indices of refraction for the ordinary and extraordinary rays in the particular crystal made use of is greater than in calcspar when this is the case the field becomes enlarged and the length of the prism is reduced illustration fig 7 the substance which dr feussner has employed as being most suitable for the separating crystal plate is nitrate of soda natronsalpeter in which the abovementioned values are omega 1587 and eta 1336 it crystallizes in similar form to calcite and in both cases thin plates obtained by cleavage may be used as the cementing substance for the nitrate of soda a mixture of gum dammar with monobromonaphthalene was used which afforded an index of refraction of 158 in the case of thin plates of calcite a solid cementing substance of sufficiently high refractive power was not available and a fluid medium was therefore employed for this purpose the whole prism was inclosed in a short glass tube with airtight ends which was filled with monobromonaphthalene in an experimental prism a mixture of balsam of tolu was made use of giving a cement with an index of refraction of 162 but the low refractive power resulted in a very considerable reduction of the field the extent and disposition of the field may be varied by altering the inclination at which the crystal lamina is inserted fig 7 and thereby reducing the length of the prism as in the case of the hartnack in order to obviate the effects of reflection from the internal side surfaces if the prism the wedgeshaped blocks of glass of which it is built up may be made much broader than would otherwise be necessary the edges of this extra width are cut obliquely and suitably blackened the accompanying diagram fig 8 represents a prism of cylindrical external form constructed in this manner the lower surface being that of the incident light in this the field amounts to 30 and the breadth is about double the length illustration fig 8 dr feussner remarks that a prism similar in some respects to his new arrangement was devised in 1869 by m jamin comptes rendus lxviii 221 who used a thin plate of calcspar inclosed in a cell filled with bisulphide of carbon and also by dr zenker who replaced the liquid in m jamins construction by wedges of flint glass among others the carefully

arrangement is rather better adapted for small prisms than for those of considerable size any means by which a beam of polarized light of large diametersay 3 to 3 inchescould be obtained with all the convenience of a nicol would be a real advance for spar of sufficient size and purity for such a purpose has become so scarce and therefore so valuable that large prisms are difficult to procure at all so far as an analyzer is concerned the experience of the writer of this notice would lead to the opinion that improvements are to be looked for rather in the way of the discovery of an artificial crystal which absorbs one of the polarized rays than by further modifications depending upon total reflection the researches of dr herapath on iodosulphate of quinine phil mag march 1852 161 and november 1853 346 are in this direction but crystals of the socalled herapathite require great manipulative skill for their production if these could be readily obtained of sufficient size they would be invaluable as analyzers this opinion is supported by the existence of an inconvenience which attends every form of analyzing prism it is frequently and especially in projecting apparatus required to be placed at the focus of a system of lenses so that the rays may cross in the interior of the prism this is an unfavorable position for a prismatic analyzer and in the case of a powerful beam of light such as that from the electric arc the crossing of the rays within the prism is not unattended with danger to the cementing substance and to the surfaces in contact with it philip r sleeman zircon by f stolba finely ground zircon is quickly rendered soluble if fused with a mixture of potassium borofluoride and potassium carbonate the author takes two parts of the former to three of the latter and prepares an intimate finely divided mixture which is kept ready for use of this mixture four parts are taken to one of zircon thoroughly mixed and melted in a platinum crucible at a red heat the mass fuses readily froths at first and gives off bubbles of gas and flows then quietly forming a very fluid melt if the zircon is finely ground 15 minutes are sufficient for this operation the loss of weight is 16 per cent and is not notably increased on prolonged fusion it corresponds approximately to the weight of the carbonic anhydride present in the potassium carbonate as pungent vapors are given off during fusion the operation should be conducted under a draught hood the activity of the mixture in attacking zircon appears from the following experiment two zircon crystals each weighing grm were introduced into the melted mixture and subjected to prolonged heat in a short time they decreased perceptibly in size each of them broke up into two fragments and within an hour they were entirely dissolved the melted mass is poured upon a dry metal plate and when congealed is thrown into water it is at once intersected with a number of fissures which facilitate pulverization this process is the more necessary as the unbroken mass is very slowly attacked by water even on prolonged boiling the powder is boiled in a large quantity of water so as to remove everything soluble there is obtained a faintly alkaline solution and a sediment insoluble in water from the filtrate alkalies throw down zirconium hydroxide free from iron the portion insoluble in water is readily dissolved in hydrofluoric acid and is converted into zircon potassium fluoride the chief bulk of the zirconium is found in the aqueous solution in the state of double fluorides the platinum crucible is not in the least attacked during melting on the contrary dirty platinum crucibles may be advantageously cleaned by melting in them a little of the above mentioned mixture if finely divided zircon is boiled for a long time with caustic lye it is perceptibly attacked it is very probable that in this manner zircon might be entirely dissolved under a pressure of 10 atmospheres potassium borofluoride may be readily prepared from cryolite crucibles of nickel seem especially well adapted for the fusion of zircon in caustic alkaliesber boehm gesell wissenschaft chem news a process for making wrought iron direct from the ore1 footnote 1 a paper read at the cincinnati meeting of the american institute of mining engineers by willard p ward am me february 1884 the numerous direct processes which have been patented and brought before the iron masters of the world differ materially from that now introduced by mr wilson after a careful examination of his process i am convinced that mr wilson has succeeded in producing good blooms from iron ore and i think that i am able to point out theoretically the chief reasons of the success of his method without going deeply into the history of the metal i may mention the well known fact that wrought iron was extensively used in almost all quarters of the globe before pig or cast iron was ever produced without entering into the details of the processes by which this wrought iron was made it suffices for my present purpose to say that they were crude wasteful and expensive so that they can be employed today only in a very few localities favored with good and cheap ore fuel and labor the construction of larger furnaces and the employment of higher temperatures led to the production of a highly carbonized fusible metal without any special design on the part of the manufacturers in producing it this pig iron however could be used only for a few purposes for which metallic iron was needed but it was produced cheaply and with little loss of metal and the attempt to decarbonize this product and bring it into a state in which it could be hammered and welded was soon successfully made this process of decarbonization or some modification of it has successfully held the field against all socalled direct processes up to the present time why because the old fashioned bloomeries and catalan forges could produce blooms only at a high cost and because the new processes introduced failed to turn out good blooms those produced were invariably red short that is they contained unreduced oxide of iron which prevented the contact of the metallic particles and rendered the welding together of these particles to form a solid bloom impossible the process of puddling cast iron and transforming it by decarbonization into wrought iron has as everybody knows been in successful practical operation for many years and the direct process referred to so closely resembles this that a short description of the theory of puddling is not out of place here the material operated on in puddling is iron containing from 2 to 4 per cent of carbon during the first stage of the process this iron is melted down to a fluid bath in the bottom of a reverberatory furnace then the oxidation of the carbon contained in the iron commences and at the same time a fluid basic cinder or slag is produced which covers a portion of the surface of the metal bath and prevents too hasty oxidation this slag results from the union of oxides of iron with the sand adhering to the pigs and the silica resulting from the oxidation of the silicon contained in the iron this cinder now plays a very important part in the process it takes up the oxides of iron formed by the contact of the oxidizing flame with the exposed portion of the metal bath and at the same time the carbon of the iron coming in contact with the under surface of the cinder covering where it is protected from oxidizing influences reduces these oxides from the cinder and restores them to the bath in metallic form this alternate oxidation of exposed metal and its reduction by the carbon of the cast iron continues till the carbon is nearly exhausted when the iron assumes a pasty condition or comes to nature as the puddlers call this change the charge is then worked up into balls and removed for treatment in the squeezer and then hammered or rolled in the wilson process the conditions which we have noted in the puddling operation are very closely approximated iron ore reduced to a coarse sand is mixed with the proper proportion of charcoal or coke dust and the mixture fed into upright retorts placed in the chimney of the puddling furnace by exposure for 24 hours to the heat of the waste gases from the furnace in the presence of solid carbon a considerable portion of the oxygen of the ore is removed but little or no metallic iron is formed the ore is then drawn from the deoxidizer into the rear or second hearth of the puddling furnace situated below it where it is exposed for 20 minutes to a much higher temperature than that of the deoxidizer here the presence of the solid carbon mixed with the ore prevents any oxidizing action and the temperature of the mass is raised to a point at which the cinder begins to form then the charge is carried forward by the workmen to the front hearth in which the temperature of a puddling furnace prevails here the cinder melts and at the same time the solid carbon reacts on the oxygen remaining combined with the ore and forms metallic iron but by this time the molten cinder is present to prevent undue oxidation of the metal formed and solid carbon is still present in the mixture to play the same role of reducing protoxide of iron from the cinder as the carbon of the cast iron does in the ordinary puddling process i have said that the cast iron used as the material for puddling contains about 3 per cent of carbon but in this process sufficient carbon is added to effect the reduction of the ore to a metallic state and leave enough in the mass to play the part of the carbon of the cast iron when the metallic stage has been reached it would be interesting to compare the wilson with the numerous other direct processes to which allusion has already been made but there have been so many of them and the data concerning them are so incomplete that this is impossible two processes however the blair and the siemens have attracted sufficient attention and are sufficiently modern to deserve notice in the blair process a metallic iron sponge was made from the ore in a closed retort this sponge cooled down in receptacles from which the air was excluded to the temperature of the atmosphere then charged into a puddling furnace and heated for working in this way and the same plan essentially has been followed by other inventors the metallic iron in the finest possible state of subdivision is subjected to the more or less oxidizing influences of the flame without liquid slag to save it from oxidation and with no carbon present to again reduce the iron oxides from the cinder after it is formed the loss of metal is consequently very large but oxides of iron being left in the metal the blooms are invariably red short in the siemens process pieces of ore of the size of beans or peas mixed with lime or other fluxing material form the charge which is introduced into a rotating furnace and when this charge has become heated to a brightred heat small coal of uniform size is added in sufficient quantity to effect the reduction of the ore the size of the pieces of the material employed prevents the intimate mixture of the particles of iron with the particles of carbon and hence we would on theoretical grounds anticipate just what practice has proved viz that the reduction is incomplete and the resulting metal being charged with oxides is redshort in practice blooms made by this process have been so redshort that they could not be hammered at all it would be impracticable in this process to employ ore and carbon in as fine particles as wilson does as a very large portion of the charge would be carried off by the draught and a sticking of the material to the sides of the rotating furnace could scarcely be avoided i do not imagine that a division of the material into anything like the supposed size of molecules is necessary we know that the graphitic carbon in the pigiron employed in puddling is not so finely divided but it is much smaller particles than bean or pea size and by approximating the size of the graphite particles in pig iron wilson has succeeded in obtaining good results if we examine the utilization of the heat developed by the combustion of a given quantity of coal in this process and compare it with the result of the combustion of an equivalent amount of fuel in a blast furnace we shall soon see the theoretical economy of the process the coal is burned on the grate of the puddlingfurnace to carbonic acid and the flame is more fully utilized than in an ordinary puddlingfurnace for besides the ordinary hearth there is the second or rear hearth where additional heat is taken up and then the products of combustion are further utilized in heating the retorts in which the ore is partly reduced after this the heat is still further utilized by passing it under the boilers for the generation of steam and the heat lost in the gases when they finally escape is very small in a blast furnace the carbon is at first burned only to carbonic oxide and the products of combustion issue mainly in this form from the top of the furnace then a portion of the heat resulting from the subsequent burning of these gases is pretty well utilized in making steam to supply the power required about the works but the rest of the gas can only be utilized for heating the blast and here there is an enormous waste the amount of heat returned to the furnace by the heated blast being very small in proportion to the amount generated by the burning of that portion of carbonic oxide expended in heating it and the gases escape from both the hotblast and the boilers at a high temperature in the direct process under consideration the fuel burned is more completely utilized than in the puddling process to which the cast iron from the blast furnace is subjected to convert it into wrought iron the economy claimed for this process over the blast furnace and puddling practice for the production of wrought iron is that nearly all the fuel used in the puddling operation is saved and that with about the same amount of fuel used in the blast furnace to produce a ton of pig iron a ton of wrought iron blooms can be made i had no opportunity of weighing the charges of ore and coal used but i saw the process in actual operation at rockaway nj the iron produced was hammered up into good solid blooms containing but little cinder the muckbar made from the blooms was fibrous in fracture and showed every appearance of good iron i am informed by the manager of the sanderson brothers steel works at syracuse ny that they purchased blooms made by the wilson process in 18811882 that none of them showed redshortness and that they discontinued their use only on account of the injurious action of the titanium they contained on the melting pots these blooms were made from magnetic sands from the long island and connecticut coasts illustration new process for making wrought iron from the ore the drawing given shows the construction of the furnace employed i quote from the published description the upper part or deoxidizer is supported on a strong mantel plate resting on four cast iron columns the retorts and flues are made entirely of firebrick from special patterns the outside is protected by a wrought iron jacket made of no 14 iron the puddling furnace is of the ordinary construction except in the working bottom which is made longer to accommodate two charges of ore and thus utilize more of the waste heat in reducing the ore to metallic iron the operation of the furnace is as follows the pulverized ore is mixed with 20 per cent of pulverized charcoal or coke and is fed into an elevator which discharges into the hopper on the deoxidizer leading into the retorts marked c these retorts are proportioned so that they will hold ore enough to run the puddling furnace 24 hours the time required for perfect deoxidation after the retorts are filled a fire is started in the furnace and the products of combustion pass up through the main flue or well b where they are deflected by the arch and pass out through suitable openings as indicated by arrows into the downtakes marked e and out through an annular flue where they are passed under a boiler it will be noticed that the ore is exposed to the waste heat on three sides of the retorts and owing to the great surface so exposed the ore is very thoroughly deoxidized and reduced in the retorts before it is introduced into the puddling furnace for final reduction the curved cast iron pipes marked d are provided with slides and are for the purpose of introducing the deoxidized ore into the second bottom of the furnace as before stated the furnace is intended to accommodate two charges of ore and as fast as it is balled up and taken out of the working bottom the charge remaining in the second bottom is worked up in the place occupied by the first charge and a new charge is introduced as fast as the ore is drawn out from the retorts the elevator supplies a new lot so that the retorts are always filled thus making the process continuous the temperature of the charge in the deoxidizer is from 800 to 1000 famer engineer some remarks on the determination of hardness in waters by herbert jackson having had occasion some short time ago to examine a hard water which owed half its hardness to salts of magnesium i noticed that the soap test applied in the usual way gave a result which differed very much from that obtained by the quantitative estimation of calcium and magnesium a perfectly normal lather was obtained when soap had been added in quantities sufficient to neutralize 14 of hardness whereas the water contained salts of calcium and magnesium equivalent on clarks scale to a hardness of 27 although i was aware that similar observations had been made before i thought that it might be useful to determine the conditions under which the soap test could not be depended upon for reliable results i found with waters containing calcium or magnesium alone that whenever salts of either of these metals were in solution in quantities sufficient to give 23 of hardness on clarks scale no dependence could be placed upon the results given by the soap test in the case of waters containing salts of both calcium and magnesium i found that if the salts of the latter metal were in solution in quantities sufficient to give more than 10 of hardness no evidence could be obtained of their presence so long as the salts of calcium in the same water exceeded 6 in such a case a perfect and permanent lather was produced when soap had been added equivalent to 7 of hardness if any water be diluted so as to reduce the proportions of the salts of calcium and magnesium below those stated above perfectly reliable results will of course be obtained instead of dilution i found that heating the water to about 70 c was sufficient to cause a complete reaction between the soap and the salts of calcium and magnesium even if these were present in far larger quantities than any given here the experiments so far had all been made with a solution of castile soap of the strength suggested by mr wanklyn in his book on water analysis my attention was next directed to the use of any one of the compounds of which such a soap is composed i commenced with sodium oleate and found that by employing this substance in a moderately pure condition perfectly reliable results could be obtained in very hard waters without the trouble of either diluting or heating i was unable to try sodium stearate directly because of the slight solubility of this substance in cold water or dilute alcohol but i found that a mixture of sodium oleate and stearate behaved in exactly the same manner as the castile soap i am not prepared at present to state the exact reaction which takes place between salts of calcium and magnesium and a compound soap containing sodium oleate and stearate i publish these results because i have not noticed anywhere the fact that some waters show a greater hardness with soap when their temperatures approach the boiling point than they do at the average temperature of the air it being i believe the ordinary impression that cold water wastes more soap than hot water before a good and useful lather can be obtained whereas with very many waters the case is quite the reverse neither am i aware at present whether it is well known that the use of sodium oleate unmixed with sodium stearate dispenses with the process of dilution even in very hard waterschem news the density and pressure of detonating gas mixtures mm berthelot and vielle have recently been studying the influence of the density of detonating gaseous mixtures upon the pressure developed the measure of pressure developed by the same gaseous system taken under two initial states of different density to which the same quantity of heat is communicated is an important matter in thermodynamics if the pressures vary in the same ratio as the densities we may conclude independently of all special hypotheses on the laws of gases first that the specific heat of the system is independent of its density that is to say of its initial pressure and depends only on the absolute temperature whatever that may mean and secondly that the relative variation of the pressure at constant volume produced by the introduction of a determinate quantity of heat is also independent of the pressure and a function only of the temperature lastly the pressure itself will vary proportionally with the absolute temperature as defined by the theory of a perfect gas and will serve to determine it mm berthelot and vielle operated with a bomb at first kept at ordinary temperatures in the air and afterward heated in an oil bath to 153 deg cent they also employed isomeric mixtures of the gases methylic ether cyanogen hydrogen acetylene and other gases were experimented upon and the general conclusions are as follows 1 the same quantity of heat being furnished to a gaseous system the pressure of the system varies proportionally to the density of the system 2 the specific heat of the gas is sensibly independent of the density as well toward very high temperatures as about deg cent this is all true for densities near to those that the gas possesses cold under normal pressure and which varied in the experiment to double the original value 3 the pressure increases with the quantity of heat furnished to the same system 4 the apparent specific heat increases parallel with this quantity of heat these conclusions are independent of all hypotheses on the nature and laws of gases and were simply drawn from the experiments in question turkish baths for horses the turkish bath has become an established institution in this country men of all classes now use it for sanitary as well as remedial purposes athletes of various descriptions find it invaluable in training and all the distinguished jockeys and light weights keep themselves in condition by its use it was thought probable that what was good for man might also be good for the horse and the fact has been proved messrs pickford the eminent carriers in their hospital for horses at finchley have had a bath in operation over eleven years and find the horses derive great benefit from its use the bath is put in operation three days a week and is administered to over twenty horses in this time the value of the bath having been thus proved it is rather strange that it has not been more generally adopted by the large carrying firms however the great northern railway company at their new hospital for horses at totteridge are erecting a very complete turkish bath

acclimated can if necessary pass to the hottest room or calidarium from 160 to 170 fahr and without any turning round can pass on into the grooming and washing room again this last room is slightly heated from the two other rooms and in each are stocks in which the animal can he fastened if required the heating is done most economically by constantines convoluted stove and thorough ventilation

surgeongeneral us army retired list professor of diseases of the mind and nervous system in the new york postgraduate medical school and hospital in a very interesting account of a journey from the pacific ocean through asia to the united states by lieutenant bh buckingham and ensigns george c foulk and walter mclean2 united states navy i find an affection of the nervous system described which on account of its remarkable characteristics as well as by reason of certain known analogies i think should be brought to the special notice of the medical profession i quote from the work referred to the following account of this disease the party is on the ussuri river not far from its junction with the amur in eastern siberia while we were walking on the bank here we observed our messmate the captain of the general staff of the russian army approach the steward of the boat suddenly and without any apparent reason or remark clap his hands before his face instantly the steward clapped his hands in the same manner put on an angry look and passed on the incident was somewhat curious as it involved a degree of familiarity with the steward hardly to have been expected after this we observed a number of queer performances of the steward and finally comprehended the situation it seemed that he was afflicted with a peculiar mental or nervous disease which forced him to imitate everything suddenly presented to his senses thus when the captain slapped the paddlebox suddenly in the presence of the steward the latter instantly gave it a similar thump or if any noise were made suddenly he seemed compelled against his will to imitate it instantly and with remarkable accuracy to annoy him some of the passengers imitated pigs grunting or called out absurd names others clapped their hands and shouted jumped or threw their hats on the deck suddenly and the poor steward suddenly startled would echo them all precisely and sometimes several consecutively frequently he would expostulate begging people not to startle him and again would grow furiously angry but even in the midst of his passion he would helplessly imitate some ridiculous shout or motion directed at him by his pitiless tormenters frequently he shut himself up in his pantry which was without windows and locked the door but even there he could be heard answering the grunts shouts or pounds on the bulkhead outside he was a man of middle age fair physique rather intelligent in facial expression and without the slightest indication in appearance of his disability as we descended the bank to go on board the steamer some one gave a loud shout and threw his cap on the ground looking about for the steward for the shout was evidently made for his benefit we saw him violently throw his cap with a shout into a chickencoop into which he was about to put the result of his foraging expedition among the houses of the stanitza footnote 2 observations upon the korean coast japanesekorean ports and siberia made during a journey from the asiatic station to the united states through siberia to europe june 3 to september 8 1882 published by the united states navy department washington 1883 pp 51 we afterward witnessed an incident which illustrated the extent of his disability the captain of the steamer running up to him suddenly clapping his hands at the same time accidentally slipped and fell hard on the deck without having been touched by the captain the steward instantly clapped his bands and shouted and then in powerless imitation he too fell as hard and almost precisely in the same manner and position as the captain in speaking of the stewards disorder the captain of the general staff stated that it was not uncommon in siberia that he had seen a number of cases of it and that it was commonest about yakutsk where the winter cold is extreme both sexes were subject to it but men much less than women it was known to russians by the name of miryachit so far as i am awareand i have looked carefully through several books of travel in siberiano account of this curious disease has been hitherto published the description given by the naval officers at once however brings to mind the remarks made by the late dr george m beard before the meeting of the american neurological association in 1880 relative to the jumpers or jumping frenchmen of maine and northern new hampshire3 footnote 3 journal of nervous and mental diseases vol vii 1880 p 487 in june 1880 dr beard visited moosehead lake found the jumpers and experimented with them he ascertained that whatever order was given them was at once obeyed thus one of the jumpers who was sitting in a chair with a knife in his hand was told to throw it and he threw it quickly so that it stuck in a beam opposite at the same time he repeated the order to throw it with a cry of alarm not unlike that of hysteria or epilepsy he also threw away his pipe which he was filling with tobacco when he was slapped upon the shoulder two jumpers standing near each other were told to strike and they struck each other very forcibly one jumper when standing by a window was suddenly commanded by a person on the other side of the window to jump and he jumped up half a foot from the floor repeating the order when the commands are uttered in a quick loud voice the jumper repeats the order when told to strike he strikes when told to throw he throws whatever he may happen to have in his hand dr beard tried this power of repetition with the first part of the first line of virgils neid and the first part of the first line of homers iliad and outoftheway words of the english language with which the jumper could not be familiar and he repeated or echoed the sound of the word as it came to him in a quick sharp voice at the same time he jumped or struck or threw or raised his shoulders or made some other violent muscular motion they could not help repeating the word or sound that came from the person that ordered them any more than they could help striking dropping throwing jumping or starting all of these phenomena were indeed but parts of the general condition known as jumping it was not necessary that the sound should come from a human being any sudden or unexpected noise as the explosion of a gun or pistol the falling of a window or the slamming of a doorprovided it was unexpected and loud enoughwould cause these jumpers to exhibit some one or all of these phenomena one of these jumpers came very near cutting his throat while shaving on hearing a door slam they had been known to strike their fists against a redhot stove to jump into the fire and into water they could not help striking their best friend if near them when ordered the noise of a steam whistle was especially obnoxious to them one of these jumpers when taking some bromide of sodium in a tumbler was told to throw it and he dashed the tumbler upon the floor it was dangerous to startle them in any way when they had an ax or an knife in their hands all of the jumpers agreed that it tired them to be jumped and they dreaded it but they were constantly annoyed by their companions from this description it will at once i think be perceived that there are striking analogies between miryachit and this disorder of the jumping frenchmen of maine indeed it appears to me that if the two affections were carefully studied it would be found that they were identical or that at any rate the phenomena of the one could readily be developed into those of the others it is not stated that the subjects of miryachit do what they are told to do they require an example to reach their brains through the sense of sight or that of hearing whereas the jumpers do not apparently perform an act which is executed before them but they require a command it seems however that a jumper starts whenever any sudden noise reaches his ears in both classes of cases a suggestion of some kind is required and then the act takes place independently of the will there is another analogous condition known by the germans as schlaftrunkenheit and to english and american neurologists as somnolentia or sleepdrunkenness in this state an individual on being suddenly awakened commits some incongruous act of violence ofttimes a murder sometimes this appears to be excited by a dream but in others no such cause could be discovered thus a sentry fell asleep during his watch and being suddenly aroused by the officer in command attacked the latter with his sword and would have killed him but for the interposition of the bystanders the result of the medical examination was that the act was involuntary being the result of a violent confusion of mind consequent upon the sudden awaking from a profound sleep other cases are cited by wharton and stille in their work on medical jurisprudence by hoffbauer and by myself in sleep and its derangements the following cases among others have occurred in my own experience a gentleman was roused one night by his wife who heard the streetdoor bell ring he got up and without paying attention to what she said dragged the sheets off of the bed tore them hurriedly into strips and proceeded to tie the pieces together she finally succeeded in bringing him to himself when he said he had thought the house was on fire and he was providing means for their escape he did not recollect having had any dream of the kind but was under the impression that the idea had occurred to him at the instant of his awaking another was suddenly aroused from a sound sleep by the slamming of a windowshutter by the wind he sprang instantly from his bed and seizing a chair that was near hurled it with all his strength against the window the noise of the breaking of glass fully awakened him he explained that he imagined some one was trying to get into the room and had let his pistol fall on the floor thereby producing the noise which had startled him in another case a man dreamed that he heard a voice telling him to jump out of the window he at once arose threw open the sash and jumped to the ground below fortunately only a distance of about ten feet so that he was not injured beyond receiving a violent shock such a case as this appears to me to be very similar to those described by dr beard in all its essential aspects a few years ago i had a gentleman under my charge who would attempt to execute any order given him while he was asleep by a person whispering into his ear thus if told in this way to shout he shouted as loud as he could if ordered to get up he at once jumped from the bed if directed to repeat certain words he said them and so on i am not able to give any certain explanation of the phenomena of miryachit or of the jumpers or of certain of those cases of sleepdrunkenness which seem to be of like character but they all appear to be due to the fact a motor impulse is excited by perceptions without the necessary concurrence of the volition of the individual to cause the discharge they are therefore analogous to reflex actions and especially to certain epileptic paroxysms due to reflex irritations it would seem as though the nerve cells were very much in the condition of a package of dynamite or nitro glycerin in which a very slight impression is sufficient to effect a discharge of nerve force they differ however from the epileptic paroxysm in the fact that the discharge is consonant with the perceptionwhich is in these cases an irritationand is hence an apparently logical act whereas in epilepsy the discharge is more violent is illogical and does not cease with the cessation of the irritation certainly the whole subject is of sufficient importance to demand the careful study of competent observers the gum disease in trees1 footnote 1 communicated to the medical times by sir james paget an essay by dr beijerinck on the contagion of the gum disease in plants lately published by the royal academy of sciences at amsterdam contains some useful facts the gum disease gummosis gumflux is only too well known to all who grow peaches apricots plums cherries or other stone fruits a similar disease produces gum arabic gum tragacanth and probably many resins and gum resins it shows itself openly in the exudation of thick and sticky or hard and dry lumps of gum which cling on branches of any of these trees where they have been cracked or wounded through the bark dr beijerinck was induced to make experimental inoculations of the gum disease by suspicions that like some others observed in plants it was due to bacteria he ascertained that it is in a high degree contagious and can easily be produced by inserting the gum under the edge of a wound through the bark of any of the trees above named the observation that heated or long boiled pieces of gum lose their contagious property made it most probable that a living organism was concerned in the contagions and he then found that only those pieces of the gum conveyed contagion in which whether with or without bacteria there were spores of a relatively highly organized fungus belonging to the class of ascomycetes and that these spores inserted by themselves under the bark produced the same pathological changes as did the pieces of gum the fungus thus detected was examined by professor oudemans who ascertained it to be a new species of coryneum and has named it coryneum beijerincki the inoculation experiments are best made by means of incisions through the bark of young branches of healthy peach trees or cherry trees and by slightly raising the cut edge of the bark and putting under it little bits of gum from a diseased tree of the same kind in nearly every instance these wounds become the seats of acute gum disease while similar wounds in the same or other branches of the same tree into which no gum is inserted remain healthy unless by chance gum be washed into them during rain the inoculation fails only when the inserted pieces of gum contain no coryneum by similar inoculations similar diseases can be produced in plum almond and apricot trees and with the gum of any one of these trees any other can be infected but of many other substances which beijerinck tried not one produced any similar disease the inoculation with the gum is commonly followed by the death of more or less of the adjacent structures first of the bark then of the wood small branches or leaf stalks thus infected in winter or in many places at the same time may be completely killed but in the more instructive experiments the first symptom of the gum disease is the appearance of a beautiful red color around the wound it comes out in spots like those which often appear spontaneously on the green young branches of peach trees that have the gum disease and in these spots it is usual to find coryneum stromata or mycelium filaments the color is due to the formation of a red pigment in one or more of the layers of the cells of the bark but in its further progress the disease extends beyond the parts at which the coryneum or any structures derived from it can be found and this extension beijerinck believes is due to the production of a fluid of the nature of a ferment produced by the coryneum and penetrating the adjacent structures this acting on the cell walls the starch granules and other constituents of the cells transforms them into gum and even changes into gum the coryneum itself reminding the observer of the selfdigestion of a stomach in the cells of the cambium the same fluid penetrating unites with the protoplasm and so alters it that the cells produced from it form not good normal wood but a morbid parenchymatous structure the cells of this parenchyma well known among the features of gum disease are cubical or polyhedral thin walled and rich in protoplasm this in its turn is transformed into gum such as fills the gum channels and other cavities found in wood and sometimes regarded as gum glands and from this also the new ferment fluid constantly produced and tracking along the tissues of the branches conveys the coryneum infection beyond the places in which its mycelium can be found drinkstone park drinkstone has long been distinguished on account of the successful cultivation of remarkable plants it lies some eight miles southeast from bury st edmunds and is the seat of th powell esq the mansion or hall is a large oldfashioned edifice a large portion of its south front being covered by a magnificent specimen of the magnolia grandiflora not less than 40 feet in height while other portions of its walls are covered with the finest varieties of climbing roses and other suitable plants the surrounding country although somewhat flat is well wooded and the soil is a rich loam upon a substratum of gravel and is consequently admirably suited to the development of the finer kinds of coniferous and other ornamental trees and shrubs so that the park and grounds contain a fine and well selected assortment of such plants illustration the snowflake leucojum vernum at drinkstone park coniferous trees are sometimes considered as out of place in park scenery this however does not hold good at drinkstone where mr powell has been displayed excellent taste in the way of improving the landscape and creating a really charming effect by so skillfully blending the dressed grounds with the rich greensward of the park that it is not easy to tell where the one terminates or the other commences the park which covers some 200 acres including a fine lake over eight acres in extent contains also various large groups or clumps of such species as the sequoia gigantea taxodium sempervirens cedres deodora picea douglasii pinsapo etc interspersed with groups of ornamental deciduous trees producing a warm and very pleasing effect at all seasons of the year among species which are conspicuous in the grounds are fine wellgrown examples of araucaria imbricata some 30 feet high cedrus deodara 60 feet in height abies pinsapo 40 feet and fine specimens of abies grandis a nobilis and a nordmanniana etc together with abies albertiana or mertensiana a fine freegrowing species also libocedrus gigantea thuiopsis borealis thuia lobbii juniperus recurva taxas adpressa fine plants with fine golden yews and equally fine examples of the various kinds of variegated hollies etc illustration odontoglossum rossi major var rubescens at drinkstone park particular attention is here paid to early spring flowers drinkstone is also celebrated as a fruit growing establishment more particularly as regards the grape vine the weight and quality of the crops of grapes which are annually produced here are very remarkablethe gardeners chronicle on the changes which take place in the conversion of hay into ensilage by fredk jas lloyd fcs lecturer on agriculture kings college the recently published number of the royal agricultural societys journal contains some information upon the subject of silage which appears to me of considerable interest to those chemists who are at present investigating the changes which take place in the conversion of grass into silage the data1 are so far as i know unique and though the analytical work is not my own yet it is that of an agricultural chemist mr a smetham of liverpool whose work i know from personal experience to be thoroughly careful and reliable i have therefore no hesitation in basing my remarks upon it footnote 1 royal agricultural societys journal vol xx part i pp 175 and 380 we have here for the first time an accurate account of the quantity of grass put into a silo of the quantity of silage taken out and of the exact composition both of the grass and resulting silage i desire merely to place myself in the position of so to speak a chemical accountant the ensilage has been analyzed at three depths or rather in three layers the first being 1 foot the second 1 ft to 1 ft 6 in and the third 1 ft 6 in to 2 ft from the bottom of the silo by doubling the figures of the bottom layer analysis adding these to the second and third layer analysis and dividing by 4 we obtain a fair representation of the average composition of the silage taken throughout the silo for by so doing we obtain the average of the analyses of each 6inch layer of silage the results of the analyses are as follows calculated on the dry matter the moisture was practically the same being 7048 per cent in the grass and 7297 in the silage composition of grass and silage dried at 100c grass ensilage fat ether extract 280 538 soluble albuminous compounds 306 598 insoluble albuminous compounds 694 377 mucilage sugar and extractives etc 1165 498 digestible fiber 3624 3337 indigestible woody fiber 3233 3179 9302 8527 soluble mineral matters 524 1262 insoluble mineral matters 174 211 10000 10000 the striking difference in the mineral matter of the grass and silage i will merely draw attention to it is not due to the salt added to the silage i may say however that other analysts and i myself have found similar striking differences for instance prof kinch2 found in grass 850 per cent mineral matter in silage 1010 per cent which as be points out is equivalent to a loss of about 18 per cent of combustible constituentsa loss which we have no proof of having taken place in mr smethams sample the loss would have to be 50 per cent which did not occur and in fact is not possible what is the explanation footnote 2 journ chem society march 1884 p 124 i am however considering now the organic constituents calculating the percentages of these in the grass and silage we obtain the following figures percentage composition of organic compounds grass ensilage fat ether extract 301 631 soluble albuminous compounds 829 701 1075 1143 insoluble 746 442 mucilage sugar and extractives 1252 584 digestible fiber 3896 3914 indigestible woody fiber 3476 3728 10000 10000 the difference in the total nitrogen in the grass and silage is equal to 068 per cent of albuminoids practically it is a matter of impossibility that the nitrogen could have increased in the silo and it will be a very safe premise upon which to base any further calculations that the total amount of nitrogen in the silage was identical with that in the grass there may have been a loss but that is not yet proved arguing then upon the first hypothesis it is evident that 100 parts of the organic matters of silage represent more than 100 parts of the organic matter of grass and by the equation we obtain 10751143 100106 approximately if now we calculate the composition of 106 parts organic matter of grass it will represent exactly the organic matter which has gone to form 100 parts of that present in silage the following table gives these results and also the loss or gain in the various constitutents arising from the conversion into silage organic matter in 106 pts in 100 pts loss or grass silage gain fat ether extract 319 631 312 soluble albuminous compounds 349 701 352 insoluble 791 442 349 mucilage 1327 584 743 digestible fiber 4130 3914 216 indigestible woody fiber 3684 3728 044 10600 10000 these calculations show provided my reasoning be correct that the chief changes which take place are in the albuminous compounds which has already been pointed out by professors voelcker kinch and others and in the starch gum mucilage sugar and those numerous bodies termed extractives which was to be expected but they show most conclusively that the decrease in the amount of indigestible fiber and increase in digestible so much spoken of is so far as our present very imperfect methods of analyzing these compounds permit us to judge a myth and i have not yet found any sufficient evidence to support this statement a loss then of 6 parts of organic matter out of every 106 parts put into the silo has in this instance taken place due chiefly to the decomposition of starch sugar and mucilage etc and as the grass contained 70 parts of water when put into the silo the total loss would only be 17 per cent of the total weight this theoretical deduction was found by practical experience correct for mr smith agent to lord egerton upon whose estate this silage was made in his report to mr jenkins says the actual weight out of the silo corresponds exactly with the weight we put into the same in my judgment these figures are of interest to the agricultural chemist for many reasons first they will clear the ground for future workers and eliminate from their researches what would have greatly complicated themchanges in the cellulose bodies secondly they are of interest because our present methods of distinguishing between and estimating digestible and indigestible fiber is most rough and probably inaccurate and may not in the least represent the power of an animalsay a cowto digest these various substances and most of us know that when a new method of analysis becomes a necessity a new method is generally discovered lastly they are of interest to the agriculturist for they point out i believe for the first time the exact amount of loss which grassor at least one samplehas undergone in conversion into silage and also that much of the nitrogenous matter is changed and so far as we know at present lost its nutritive value this however is only comparing silage with grass what is wanted is to compare silage with hayboth made out of the same grass then and then only will it be possible to sum up the relative advantages or disadvantages of the two methods of preserving grass as food for cattlechem news the illuminating power of ethylene dr percy frankland has obtained results which may be thus briefly summarized 1 that pure ethylene when burnt at the rate of 5 cubic feet per hour from a referees argand burner emits a light of 685 standard candles 2 that the illuminating power of equal volumes of mixtures of ethylene with either hydrogen carbonic oxide or marshgas is less than that of pure ethylene 3 that when the proportion of ethylene in such mixtures is above 63 per cent the illuminating power of the mixture is but slightly affected by the nature of the diluent when on the other hand the proportion of ethylene in such mixtures is low the illuminating power of the mixture is considerably the highest when marshgas is the diluent and the lowest when the ethylene is mixed with carbonic oxide 4 that if 5 cubic feet of ethylene be uniformly consumed irrespectively of the composition of the mixture the calculated illuminating power is in every case equal to or actually greater than that of pure ethylene until a certain degree of dilution is attained this intrinsic luminosity of ethylene remains almost constant when the latter is diluted with carbonic oxide until the ethylene forms only 40 per cent of the mixture after which it rapidly diminishes to zero when the ethylene forms only 20 per cent of the mixture when the ethylene is diluted with hydrogen its intrinsic luminosity rises to 81 candles when the ethylene constitutes 30 per cent of the mixture after which it rapidly falls to zero when the ethylene amounts to only 10 per cent in the case of mixtures of ethylene and marshgas the intrinsic luminosity of the former is augmented with increasing rapidity as the proportion of marsh gas rises the intrinsic luminosity of ethylene in a mixture containing 10 per cent of the latter being between 170 and 180 candles diffraction phenomena during total solar eclipses1 footnote 1 a paper read before the american astronomical society may 5 1884 by gd hiscox the reality of the suns corona having been cast in doubt by a leading observer of the last total eclipse who from the erratic display observed in the spectroscope has declared it a subjective phenomenon of diffraction has led me to an examination and inquiry as to the bearing of an obscurely considered and heretofore only casually observed phenomenon seen to take place during total solar eclipses this phenomenon it seems to me ought to account for and will possibly satisfy the spectroscopic conditions observed just before during and after totality which has probably led to the epithet used by some leading observersthe fickle corona the peculiar phenomenon observed in the spectroscope the flickering bands or lines of the solar spectrum flashing upon and across the coronal spectrum has caused no little speculation among observers the diffraction or interference bands projected by the passage of a strong beam of light by a solid body as discovered long since by grimaldi and investigated later by newton fresnel and fraunhofer are explained and illustrated in our text books but the grand display of this phenomenon in a total solar eclipse where the sun is the source of light and the moon the intercepting body has as yet received but little attention from observers and is not mentioned to my knowledge in our text books in the instructions issued from the united states naval observatory and the signal office at washington for the observation of the eclipse of july 29 1878 attention was casually directed to this phenomenon and a few of the observers at pikes peak central city denver and other places have given lucid and interesting descriptions of the flight of the diffraction bands as seen coursing over the face of the earth at the speed of the moons shadow at the apparent enormous velocity of thirtythree miles per minute or fifty times the speed of a fast railway train from a known optical illusion derived from interference or fits of perception as illustrated in quick moving shadows this great speed was not realized to the eye as the observed motion of these shadows was apparently far less rapid than their reality the ultra or diffraction bands outside of the shadow were distinctly seen and described by mr je keeler at central city both before and after totality he estimates the shadow bands at 8 inches wide and 4 feet apart professor es holden also at central city estimated the dark bands as about 3 feet apart and variable from estimates which he obtained from other observers of his party the distances between the bands varied from 6 to l feet but so quickly did they pass that they baffled all attempts to count even the number that passed in one second he observed the time of continuance of their passage from west to east as fortyeight seconds which indicates a width of 33 miles of diffraction bands stretching outward from the edge of the shadow to the number of many thousands mr gw hill at denver a little to the north of the central track of the shadow observed the infra or bands within the shadow alluding to the fact that they must be moving at the same rate as the shadow although their apparent motion was much slower or like the shadows of flying clouds he attributes the discrepancy to optical illusion at virginia city the colors of the ultra bands were observed and estimated at five seconds duration from the edge of the shadow which is equal to about 4 miles in width these are known to be the strongest color bands in the diffraction spectrum which accounts for their being generally observed mr wh bush observing at central city in a communication to prof holden alludes to the brilliancy of the colors of these bands as seen through small clouds floating near the suns place during totality and of the rapid change of their rainbow colors as observed dashing across the clouds with the rapidity of thought all of these bands both ultra and infra as seen in optical experiments are colored in reverse order being from violet to red for each band outward and inward from the edge of the shadow it is very probable that the velocity of the passage of all the bands during a total eclipse very much modifies the distinctness of the colors or possibly obliterates them by optically blending so as to produce the dull white and black bands which occupied so large a portion of this grand panorama the phenomenon of these faint colored bands with the observed light and dark shadows may be attributed to one or all of the following causes 1 a change in the direction of a small portion of the suns light passing by the solid body of the moon it being deflected outward by repulsion or reflection from its surface and other portions being deflected inward after passing the body by mutual repulsion of its own elements toward a light vacuum or space devoid of the element of vibration 2 the colored spectral bands being the direct result of the property of interference or the want of correspondence of the wave lengths due to divergence the same phenomenon being also observed in convergent light this is practically illustrated in the hazy definition of the reduced aperture of telescopes and its peculiarities shown in the spectral rings within and beyond the focus 3 chromatic dispersion by our atmosphere together with selective absorption also by our atmosphere and its vapors have been suggested as causes in this curious and complicated phenomena in none of the reports descriptive of the phenomena of polarization of the corona is there the slightest allusion to the influence that the diffraction bands may possibly have in modifying or producing the various conditions of polarization observed although these observations have been made and commented upon during the past twentyfive years investigations now in progress of the modifying relation of the phenomenon of diffraction in its effect upon not only the physical aspect of the corona but also in some strange spectroscopic anomalies that have been observed near the sun at other times than during a total solar eclipse will it is hoped result in a fuller interpretation of the physical nature of one of the grandest elements of creationlight let there be more of it
