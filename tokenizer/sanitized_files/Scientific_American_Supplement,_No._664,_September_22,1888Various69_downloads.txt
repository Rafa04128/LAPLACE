by all the maritime powers and these picked men proved this at the siege of paris where they made themselves illustrious not only by their courage and their coolness but also by the accuracy of their firing nothing is neglected moreover to keep up the precision of hand and eye that distinguishes them and which has become so much the more necessary in that it is no longer a question of firing a broadside at the enemy and reckoning on one ball being more fortunate than another in damaging the enemys ship at present the most powerful ironclad has four and sometimes six or eight guns of large caliber which are of from 30 to 100 tons every shot represents not only an enormous sum but also a prodigious force expended and so powder must not be used too lavishly since the shot should be in relation with the colossal power that it represents and the shell adopted in the navy is accompanied with so disastrous effects that a single one well directed is capable of reducing the enemys ship to impotence so exercises in firing are becoming more and more frequent and they have a right to be multiplied inasmuch as the present guns are complicated affairs the maneuvering of which requires constant practice our engraving represents one of these exercises performed by the squadron of the north which is of recent organization and which consists of the three ironclads marengo suffren and ocean and three coast guards furieux fulminant and tonnerre each of the ironclads is provided with four 27 cm guns and four 24 cm ones not counting the revolving guns which constitute the small artillery reserved for fighting torpedo boats the furieux has two 34 cm guns and the tonnerre and fulminant each two 37 cm ones an endeavor is made as far as possible to practice firing such as is done in a naval action that is at moving targets to this effect the dispatch boat epervier tows a rectangular float about two meters in length upon which are arranged two canvas balloons kept taut by a wooden framework one of these balloons is white and the other is black each is a meter in diameter and is supported by a rod which is usually a meter in height the vessels of the squadron successively fire their large guns at this target which moves at a definite velocity the shell on dropping into the water raises an immense jet which entirely hides the balloons when the projectile falls in a line with and sufficiently near the target the smoke that envelops the ships the thunder that echoes in the calm of the sea and the jet that rises in the air produce a thrilling effect and give an idea of the power of man carried to the last expressionlillustration modern cavalry on the field of battle1 footnote 1 a lecture lately delivered at the aldershot military societys library by col r s liddell i feel that some apology is due from me for coming down to aldershot and giving my opinions before so many officers whose daily experience renders them much more capable than i am of bringing this subject forward and it was with some hesitation that i yielded to the flattering invitation of the military society of aldershot to read a paper here today on cavalry at the same time if it is thought that anything i can say can increase the success that this society has already met with i can only add that i render my services most willingly it seems to me one of the many advantages that these meetings possess is the bringing together of the different branches of the service and the mutual information they afford of each others arm when we look back only a few years we have much to be thankful for in the disappearance of a vast amount of prejudice that used to exist between the different branches each arm thought that theirs and theirs only was worth studying infantry officers sometimes said as long as their arm was sufficiently numerous and well equipped that with the exception of a few scouts and orderlies cavalry might be dispensed with artillery might think that unless guns were largely used no infantry could ever make an attack at all while cavalry officers who were perhaps the most conservative of all would point to the past and show how every battle that had ever been fought was won by cavalry and ever would be confidence in ones own arm is most desirable and should be fostered if at the same time we can learn how to work with others remembering that while cavalry gives the information to and hides the movements of the army while artillery shakes and disperses the enemys formation and prepares the way for attack it is the infantry alone who can assault and hold the position and it is for their advance and to bring them up to the point that determines the battle in the condition most favorable to insure success that all the efforts of the other two arms must be devoted i have made these preliminary remarks as from my paper being entirely given to the actions of cavalry it might appear that i am claiming more for that arm in the battle field than is reasonable but i wish it clearly understood that whatever i may say is only in an auxiliary sense to the action of infantry and i trust that i shall not be thought underestimating other arms while showing unbounded confidence in my own the necessary rest required by europe after the exhaustion of the wars of napoleon resulted in the long peace which succeeded the campaign of 1815 this and the improvement that took place in fire arms in the next forty years gave room for speculation as to whether cavalry would play as important a part in the future as it had done in the past under marlborough frederick the great napoleon and wellington the crimean war helped to confirm the opinion that the days of cavalry had gone by no account was made of the enormous distance by sea that the cavalry had to be transported the unfavorable nature of the seat of war for that arm the little scope given in a campaign that resolved itself into a siege the smallness of the cavalry force employed and the difficulty in keeping up a fresh supply of horses after this war came the introduction and improvement in the breech loader and with it opinions were strengthened that cavalry duties would be still further limited and its traditions for a time appear to have been lost the awakening from this transient period of theory came from a nation not trained to arms and it is to the american civil war that we owe the revival that took place in the use of the cavalry arm the raids made by the confederates under morgan stuart forrest and by the federals under sheridan drew attention to advanced cavalry work such as scouting reconnaissance outpost and dismounted work as particular examples we may select morgans boldest and greatest raid in 1862 when he passed through kentucky and indiana capturing large stores from the enemy by his rapid and skillful marches the federal officers were completely bewildered he was absent from his army 24 days in which time he traveled 1000 miles capturing 17 towns and destroying all the government supplies and arms in a second raid he forced the federal army to fall back by taking possession of the railway in its rear which brought it supplies in october 1862 stuart made his greatest raid through pennsylvania around the northern army he set out with 1800 cavalry and four pieces of horse artillery and crossed the potomac the telegraph wires were cut in all directions railways obstructed and a large number of horses captured and all the public stores and buildings were destroyed his position at this time was very critical 90 miles from his own army he considered it less dangerous to return by the opposite way to which he came forrest used his cavalry in every possible manner dismounting in the battle field and employing it as infantry in october 1864 during a raid he impeded the navigation of the tennessee river which was filled with federal gunboats choosing a strong position on the bank he masked his guns and awaited the approach of the enemys vessels he captured a gunboat and a transport and manned them with his own men but his naval expedition did not last long pursued by several gunboats he had to run his ships on shore when the troopers gladly mounted their horses again his object was however gainedinspiring alarm throughout the country and occupying a considerable number of the enemy later on the federals copied this system when the raids of sheridan with his 10000 horsemen armed with the magazine rifle and revolver with sword attached to the saddle brought about the final overthrow of the southern army the next campaign that took place was in 1866 known as the seven weeks war when large bodies of cavalry were used by the austrians and prussians this campaign was of such short duration that there was not sufficient time for the experience gained in the use of cavalry to be utilized while the war lasted but when the war was over both sides having bought their experience set out to reorganize their systems and the course pursued by the prussians after this campaign in largely increasing their cavalry was fully justified by the advantages reaped in the war in france in 1870 at the close of the francogerman war the attention of the whole of europe was called to the successful use of german cavalry during the campaign more especially the advanced duties when at times 60 miles in breadth and 50 in advance of the army was covered by the cavalry in england after the termination of this war many german military works of great value were translated and published the battle fields in france were visited and described every movement of both armies strategical and tactical was studied all this tended to draw our attention to the extended use of the cavalry arm in future campaigns and the shortcomings of our own system were carefully scrutinized the movements of our drill book were simplified the careful training of our men in shooting was more fully recognized and the teaching of advanced cavalry duties reconnaissance outpost and dismounted work were gone into most thoroughlyin such a manner that i may confidently appeal to those officers who have the best opportunities of forming an opinion whether our cavalry does not bear comparison now with what is being done in other armies and in these matters is advancing in a satisfactory manner while all this good work has been going on and i would be the last to say one word that might seem to depreciate its value we may perhaps have permitted the action of cavalry on the field of battle to escape from sufficient notice it is for this reason i will ask your permission to bring before you this subject believing that the opinions of all branches of the service being brought to bear upon it considerable advantage maybe obtained it will be my endeavor to show not by my own arguments but by quotations from others that cavalry still has an important part to take on the battle field and far from its duties ending when armies come in contact that it is still reserved to them as has been the case before to decide perhaps by only one charge the issue of a whole campaign prince kraft in his letters on cavalry says the battle of marslatour won by the bold employment of cavalry made possible the blockade of metz and afterward the surrender of the whole of bazaines army so it may be said without exaggeration that the charge of bredows six squadrons on that day was the turning point of the francogerman campaign colonel home in his prcis of modern tactics says the action of cavalry on the actual battle field is by no means a thing of the past the use of cavalry with skill at the right moment and in the right numbers has always been considered one of the most difficult problems in war modern arms have increased this difficulty manifold but to say the day of cavalry on the field of battle is past is merely another way of saying that the knowledge of how it should be used is wanting cavalry is apportioned to an army in two capacities 1 divisional cavalry that is if possible a regiment or as many squadrons as can be spared attached to each infantry division acting under the orders of the general of the division 2 the cavalry division that is a large body of cavalry composed of several brigades an independent body having its own commander on the march the divisional cavalry covers the head and flanks of its own division on the field of battle it will be as near as possible to its division in the most sheltered spot that can be found in the early part of the battle it would be kept as much in reserve as possible cheloned in rear of one flank of its own infantry it would remain there until the artillery and musketry had effected their work and the enemys flanks had become thinned and shaken then when his infantry become tired and exhausted under cover of the smoke the cavalry may be further advanced prince kraft says at sedan the divisional cavalry were employed during the battle charging by single squadrons patrolling and reconnoitering to obtain information of the enemy and the ground every infantry body is accompanied by patrols however small an instance of the too early employment of cavalry in a battle occurred at waterloo when napoleon at the commencement launched his cavalry into the fight the result was that although it far outnumbered the english at first it became so reduced depressed and worn out that it was unable afterward to offer full resistance to the british squadrons who were comparatively fresh wellington on the contrary after his first successes kept his cavalry as much as possible in reserve the field of battle itself shows the proper situation of cavalry but the divisional cavalry on the defensive side must always be at hand to fall upon the flanks of the enemys infantry when in extended order while that of the attacking side must be equally at hand to prevent the flanks of its own infantry being so attacked in discussing the action of divisional cavalry the most advantageous time for its assisting in the combat must be considered at what moment if any can infantry be attacked by cavalry when opposed to a force acting on the defensive divisional cavalry has its operations limited and probably in the earlier part of an engagement confined to watching and if possible guarding the flanks of its own attacking infantry from surprise it is the cavalry on the defenders side that has the greatest opportunities in both cases however a rule must be made not to attack infantry when it has taken up a favorable position or before its ranks have been shaken by artillery or musketry prince kraft in speaking of marslatour says this same day took place a series of cavalry charges of greater or less importance which all showed practically to the cavalry the limits of their effective action against infantry the advancing infantry were brought to a stand infantry who gave way were ridden down but where the cavalry attacked infantry intact the cavalry were unable to prevail the precision of modern fire arms has necessitated great changes in infantry tactics to advance against the murderous fire of the present rifle infantry is compelled to adopt scattered formations in small lines and to move forward with sudden rushes all this lends itself to the attacks of an active cavalry when these infantry attacks take place it may be presumed that they have already been under arms some hours have marched some distance and been exposed to considerable loss from artillery and musketry fire their advance in extended formation will have commenced at about 1000 yards or earlier by this time the squadrons opposing them will have been brought to a more advanced position to the nearest point to their flank where cover is afforded and to carry this out successfully requires skillful handling files must be extended and short rushes made with small bodies say half a troop if over exposed ground into sheltered places it is true that cavalry cannot hide themselves over exposed ground as infantry can but they have one advantage that nothing can deprive them ofrapidity of motion and the distance that would take them say 10 seconds to traverse viz 150 yards would take infantry a minute prince kraft writes no battle field is a tabula rasa for in the most exposed country there are depressions if strong skirmishing lines of infantry can advance directly over a country devoid of cover cavalry can undoubtedly do the like if by making use of the lie of the ground they can gain the enemys flank a skilled cavalry leader will thus undoubtedly find an opportunity to get close to the enemy having arrived at this more advanced position say from 500 to 1000 yards according to the formation of the ground the nearer the better the most favorable moment to assail the flanks of the attacking infantry would probably be immediately before the last belt of the fighting line and before the main body had reenforced them as they are preparing for their last united rush and as their supports are doubling up to join them at this moment the men would be to some extent out of breath their attention would be fixed on the point about to be attacked and their flanks would be neglected cavalry should then descend upon them at the utmost speed that can be extracted from the horses with a good interval from knee to knee if there is only one squadron one troop should take the flank or fighting line while the other throws itself upon the support as the distance to be covered in the open will probably be not more than from 200 to 400 yards they will be exposed to fire supposing none of the ground is undulating for fifteen to thirty seconds when at full speed as they close on the infantry neither the supports nor those in rear of them or their artillery will dare to fire on account of their own men if the infantry run to get into small squares as is most likely the cavalry must endeavor to catch them before they assemble if they get together it may be too late for the cavalry to stop they must then throw themselves upon them and trust to the supporting squadron to complete the attack although it is rare that a battle field is on such ground that there are no undulations to afford shelter for cavalry in an advanced position this may be the case and if so the enemys infantry attack must be allowed to take place but even then by cavalry showing itself on the flanks for a moment infantry would get together and afford a better mark for fire and the progress of the attack would be delayed the very appearance of cavalry frequently frightens infantry into masses if the ground was too much exposed for the charge men might be dismounted with their carbines at a safe distance to assist the infantry if mounted infantry were at hand they would be utilized in the same way and the machine guns of the cavalry would also pour in their volleys if the enemys attack is successful cavalry must then advance on their flanks and take its chance and if necessary sacrifice itself to give its own infantry time to rally if it is unsuccessful the cavalry must be ready to take every favorable opportunity of molesting its broken ranks speaking of marslatour prince kraft says during the battle a german infantry brigade was forced to retire with heavy loss and ran some danger of being annihilated by the pursuing enemy but the first dragoons of the guards threw themselves on the pursuers the enemys infantry massed round the eagles and ceased to press on while the thin ranks of our infantry were able to rally and our guns were saved and brought into position the losses were heavy half a regiment of cavalry 250 horses were sacrificed in order to save the brigade at waterloo a french division of infantry fled before three regiments of dragoons the union brigade the royal dragoons and the inniskillings in first line the scots greys on their left rear the whole under sir william ponsonby acting in support of the highland infantry brigade were awaiting the attack of the whole of the 1st french division under gen alix the three scotch regiments threw into them a concentrated fire and as they were staggered by the shock ponsonby gave the order to advance passing through the highlanders the greys having come up into line the three regiments charged the leading portion of the french column which yielded and those in rear were hurled back the dragoons having the advantage of the descent of the hill appeared to mow down the mass the greys on the left pressed on through the supporting brigade of the french while the royals drove back the right giving no time for fire many threw down their arms while hundreds of prisoners were hurried off to the rear of the line at the same time the inniskillings forced their way through the center when the remainder of the french division broke and fled it may be said that this took place before the introduction of the rifle and is therefore no example but it took place within the range of the weapon then in use and at that distance it was equally effective the celebrated charge of bredows brigade at vieuville marslatour also shows what an energetic attack may do it had become necessary to demand a sacrifice from the cavalry for the good of the army to enable prince frederick charles with only 24000 infantry to hold in check bazaines army of 180000 until his own main body came up bredows cavalry brigade consisted of six squadrons of the 7th cuirassiers and the 16th uhlans they were ordered to make a breach in the front of the 16th french army corps the six squadrons advanced in column the cuirassiers leading when they received the word to change direction to the right then to form line which was done under heavy fire the cuirassiers getting into line first charged at once the 16th following in echelon in a moment the batteries vomiting flames were reached with a loud hurrah and the gunners cut down at their guns when the whole brigade which had now got into one line charged the long lines of infantry in rear who received them with a heavy fire from their chassepots these lines too were broken through and the main object of the charge was attained but carried away by the ardor of the combat they charged and took the mitrailleuses when the french cuirassiers with a dragoon brigade in support come down upon them and compelled them to fall back this they did having to force their way back through the enemys masses of infantry with enormous loss the object however was gained and the attack of the french corps checked and never resumed the cavalry division covers the advance of the whole army and is a day or two in front of it it conceals and guards the army while finding out the movements of the enemy it collects information and is also used with horse artillery on great enterprises on the enemys communications having finished the reconnaissance and covering the army on the day of battle it falls back as the two opposing sides come in contact and awaits further orders on the battle field it should be placed so as to suffer as little loss as possibleas a rule in rear of the flanks how far must depend on the formation of the ground if shelter is to be obtained nearer the front the better if not then some 2000 yards in rear of one flank would seem advisable its duties are to guard the exposed flank or flanks and rear of the army while it watches the cavalry of the enemy if within range of artillery it should be kept on the move from front to rear its strength should not be wasted or frittered away on doubtful enterprises as it maybe required for some decisive blow in pursuit or in covering the retreat prince kraft speaking of the battle of st privat says on the 18th of august the gigantic fight of st privat took place the cavalry divisions were held back in reserve but the divisional cavalry took an active part during the battle a squadron of hussars advanced and sent information of the enemy making a flank movement he also says at sedan the cavalry division was kept in reserve the massing of artillery at the commencement of a battle must expose a long line with some weak spot to attack if protected by cavalry then probably a cavalry combat will ensue prince kraft says the action of the masses of german cavalry at marslatour excited wonder and admiration they surprised the enemys cavalry when in bivouac they met and surrounded the hostile infantry in a threatening manner and thus 8000 cavalry occupied 65000 infantry until the prussian infantry came up the cavalry made no charges which could not have been successful but carried out their task of occupying the enemy almost without loss in the old days these squadrons would have charged and ridden down the infantry the change is the result of the improvement in fire arms during the early stages of a battle advanced parties under officers selected for the purpose must be kept out from the cavalry division to watch the enemys movements and the information they should be able to afford should be invaluable to the generalinchief an engagement with the enemys cavalry should not be sought unless they are much weaker but should the necessity arise the ground should be reconnoitered and every advantage of position taken to insure success the attack being determined on the preparations for it should be carried out rapidly echelon movements have many advantages they favor the formation of oblique lines they also insure in a charge direct to the front the bringing up of squadron after squadron in support the attack of vivians hussar brigade upon the french reserves at waterloo gives a brilliant illustration of this and has been termed by siborne the crisis of waterloo this celebrated charge intended to be in line became virtually a charge in echelon of squadrons in consequence of the rapid pace of the head of the column the movement of cavalry must be rapid and unexpected and bear the character of determined confidence an effort should be made by maneuvering to come suddenly on the enemys flank a gentle declivity for the final charge must be sought the rapid vigorous and determined charge in line on to cavalry riding knee to knee is what is required the charge to be made effectual the horses must be brought up in wind the gallop must not be begun too early when begun it must gradually be increased to a fast gallop the final charge for the last sixty yards made with every horse extended nothing then must be left undone to excite the spirit of enthusiasm even to ferocity then and only then the cheer to be raised at waterloo the charge of the heavy brigade the 1st and 2d life guards and kings dragoon guards with the blues in support is a good example of a successful attack on cavalry the french line of cavalry as it advanced presented an imposing appearance they had ascended the brow of the ridge when a vigorous fire from ross horse artillery was opened on to them in the next moment their trumpets sounded the charge and they rushed to the attack and as cuirassiers approached the british squares the heavy brigade dashed into them the shock was terrific the right of the life guards being thrown forward came first into collision the right of the french was suddenly thrown out by coming unexpectedly on to a hollow way and as they passed it the 2d life guards came full speed upon them the french cuirassiers were driven back and pursued until the english brigade came under infantry fire the charge of the heavy cavalry brigade at balaklava under gen scarlett is another good example when the russian cavalry receiving the british charge at a halt were entirely overthrown one of the greatest difficulties after the charge is to know when and how to stop and it is then that the squadron and troop leaders well in front of their men must use all their efforts to carry out the ends of their commander i think this is the time when a strong whistle carried by the commanding officer and the squadron leaders can be used with good effect being an unusual sound it would attract attention the battle being over some of the most serious duties of cavalry commence if the enemy is victorious the pursuit has immediately to follow history points out the difficulty of carrying this out uncertainty of the victory or how far it can be counted on often delays its commencement battles are often ended by nightfall valuable time is lost and the golden opportunities are past an active cavalry leader will however without further orders at least follow with his advanced parties and not lose touch of the enemy he will soon learn the condition of the enemy act accordingly harass his flanks and rear and play upon him with his artillery an example of another manner in which cavalry may be employed after a victory can be taken from the egyptian campaign of 1882 when after the battle of telelkebir by a rapid advance of the cavalry some fifty miles ahead of the infantry the capital of the country was captured by the english cavalry division if the battle is lost still greater are the responsibilities of the cavalry detached squadrons with scouts must be sent round the flanks to ascertain the strength of the enemy sent in pursuit every available position must be taken up by the horse artillery and every advantage seized for counter attack above all accurate information must be obtained for the generalinchief of the nature of the pursuit in order that he may not harass his main body by falling back further than necessary this subject however is beyond the scope of this lecture and is one of study of past campaigns of the action of cavalry in savage warfare the recent campaigns in africa have given some experience in the presence of an enemy met with in such enormous numbers as in the desert cut off from all help knowing that unless you win you die it seems to be decided that our infantry must adopt the square as the most suitable formation in the zulu war the cavalry at the battle of ulundi was placed inside the square the experience met with there was exceptional and from the swarms of savages surrounding the square in all directions it was considered desirable to keep the 17th lancers in the center of it in order that they should not interfere with the infantry fire and that when the enemy was repulsed they should be launched out upon them and this was done with perfect success it is however contrary to the instincts and traditions of cavalry to be shut up in a square and where practicable i should think cavalry outside a square even at some distance out of the way of the infantry fire acting with horse artillery would very much disturb the attacking bodies of the enemy and perhaps attract away a portion of them and they could be brought up when called upon to do so to carry out the pursuit in the first campaign on the east coast of the soudan on the advance to el teb and afterward to tokar squadrons were sent in front and on the flanks of the square with scouts thrown out to feel the way and obtain information while the main body of the cavalry was echeloned on the rear and flank opposite an angle of the square in the most suitable manner to avoid any interference with its fire during the action it remained in this position until after the first attack on the square when it moved away past the square on the outward flank and acted on the enemys rear and engaged their reserves until the action was over during the desert march in the nile expedition the 19th hussars by its scouting protected the square and gave it timely notice of the approach of the enemy in a country where a great deal of bush abounds the effective charge of cavalry on to groups of savages is very much curtailed the arabs throw themselves on to the ground behind the prickly bushes the ranks are opened out as the horses avoid the thorns and the men get no chance of using their swords but although much execution is not achieved under these circumstances the natives have great fear of cavalry and they are prevented from attacking elsewhere when their attention is thus occupied horse artillery and machine guns might make great havoc among them at the action of tamai where the ground from the rocks and ravines of the neighboring mountains was unsuitable for cavalry charges when one of the infantry squares was broken the cavalry advanced and one squadron of the 10th hussars dismounting helped to create a favorable diversion by pouring fire into the flanks of the attacking arabs my remarks would i think be considered incomplete if i did not touch on the question of cavalry charging squares as this point is always made very prominent in all discussions on the action of cavalry i therefore must not pass it by i will say at once that i think it most undesirable even under favorable circumstances that cavalry should charge a formed square and men armed with the breech loader at best the gain can be but local and partial while the loss to the cavalryan arm so difficult to keep up in numbersmust be disastrous and it seems to me that if cavalry by its appearance can force infantry to form square it has done enough and that the artillery infantry and machine guns should do the rest the necessity might however arise and by looking at the past we see its possibility at langensalza two prussian squares were broken by the hanoverian cavalry and the major part taken prisoners we have only to turn to the recent campaigns in egypt to see the effect of determined rushes of men intending to succeed charging on to squares carefully formed on ground affording shelter with an enormous amount of fire being poured upon them it will be said that these men were fanatics but our cavalry too have been and will be fanatics in a charge and i still think if the necessity recurs that an attack properly conducted on favorable ground one troop charging on the corner of a square followed by another at double distance others in echelon on both flanks immediately following the whole charging with the greatest impetuosity intended to win will break down any square that englishmen are likely to meet with if we look back again on the past we will find many instances of british cavalry not being called upon in vain to make a sacrifice at talavera the 23d light dragoons supported by the 1st hussars of the german legion advanced against the french squares in their impetuous rush they came upon a hollow cleft covered with long grass eight feet deep and eighteen feet broad too late to pull up the foremost rode headlong into it some tumbled in others over it some rode boldly at it and gained the other side still they went on swept past the infantry columns and fell upon a brigade of french chasseurs at balaklava 670 british horsemen were launched against an entire wing of the russian army the brigade at first in two lines the 11th hussars 17th lancers and 13th light dragoons followed by the 4th light dragoons and 8th hussars advanced down a gradual descent of threequarters of a mile the russian guns vomiting shell and shot upon them one battery bearing on their right another on their left and all the intermediate ground covered with riflemen the guns were charged and forced through the forces drawn up in rear were overpowered they then had to turn and retiring up hill ran through the same gauntlet in the sikh war at the battle of ferozeshah the 3d light dragoons charged the enemys entrenchments at a point defended by some of their heaviest batteries when within 250 yards the regiment moved at speed under a destructive fire of grape and musketry and pressing forward at the charge entered the enemys camp and captured the whole of the batteries cavalry attacks have been made with success after dark and the advantage of course is gained of obviating opposing fire prince kraft mentions that after the battle of marslatour the cavalry division reenforced by the divisional cavalry rode forward to complete the advantages gained it was almost night and fault has been found with making the attack in the dark if the ground is well known a night attack may be advisable while criticising it we have to think of the feelings of a halfdefeated army about to bivouac being attacked by unknown forces in the dark in this case at vionville the enemy did not wait for a second but withdrew and abandoned the whole field of battle prince kraft quotes the attack of blcher at grossgorchen and a cavalry attack at loon during the first egyptian campaign the life guards made an attack by moonlight at kassassin i have now i think touched lightly on some important cavalry duties on a campaign in some points perhaps these remarks may appear contradictory how to combine keeping cavalry in reserve for any great action it may be called upon to perform while using it unsparingly to assist on the battle field if the necessity arises it may however be noticed that much as they may be criticised few cavalry commanders have been severely blamed when they have thought it best to take the bolder course to insure to cavalry the power of carrying out its duties successfully in war organization and practice in peace is most essential infantry may suddenly be increased without much deranging its action in the field but cavalry cannot be hurried into an increased augmentation in tactics simplicity in every evolution and rapidity in execution are the most important principles this simplicity of drill i think might be assisted if our squadrons were divided into four divisions zuges or pelotons when squadrons have 48 files in the front rank there might be four of these while weak regiments with 36 files could drill equally as well with three divisions this system introduced by the late gen valentine baker into the english service for a time and now used by all european countries was found to work well i think the whistle could be carried with advantage by all cavalry officers for advanced work attention can be drawn by it without being heard at a distance like a bugle in movements the commanding officers would find it useful to call the attention of leaders to himself especially in extended or chelon formation i have omitted to make much mention of the action of horse artillery combined with cavalry as it seems beyond the limits of this paper but it is one to which the cavalry officers attention requires to be brought most strongly to bear i would also have wished to have made some remarks on the many advantages to be obtained by having mounted infantry attached to cavalry i understand that this force would be under the orders of the cavalry general and if so i think a cavalry division well found in horse artillery with mounted infantry whether conveyed on horses or where the cavalry admitted of it on cars and accompanied by machine guns on wheels could act in such an independent manner as to enable it to penetrate far ahead into an enemys country or threaten his communications and be absent from its main body for many days or weeks as regards the english cavalry i think it may be said without boasting that the material is excellent the men are of the best physique recruited from a good class and plenty of them to be had the noncommissioned officers are intelligent and always ready for instruction the riding compares favorably with cavalry of other nations certainly far better than any i have ever seen abroad either german russian or french and among all foreign countries we have the reputation of being the best horsemen in the world which at all events has a good moral effect our horses are undoubtedly firstrate having more quality and greater speed than foreigners we have in our officers the exact stuff we want their very sports and amusements start them with all the makings of cavalry soldiers but the quickness of eye the selfconfidence and readiness that these sports and games may give require nowadays more than ever something beyond this to produce the trained cavalry leader cavalry is an arm of opportunity and above all others depends greatly on its leaders but with the chances now available of reading in every detail the campaigns of the past if taken advantage of as is now daily becoming more common we should produce in the future the best and most accomplished cavalry officers that this country or any other has ever seen as there appeared to be a unanimity

glasgow exhibition a very numerous and varied show of sailing models first we find the noble fourmasted ships of from 1800 tons to 2200 tons which sail and carry well on their tonnage and which are worked by fewer hands than are required for a ship of the same burden with three masts but squarer yards some owners prefer the latter and so messrs russell show not only such handsome specimens as the fourmasted falls of earn but also the threemasted ardencraig and soudan one of the favorite models of this firm is that of their 1500 ton ship with three masts represented by the cromartyshire of which type they have built a large number of vessels noted alike for their carrying capacity and their excellent sailing qualities the main built for mr james nourse of london is a good specimen of their 1700 ton ship as designed for the special trade of the owner between calcutta demerara and london their 1300 ton bark is represented by the model of the aboukir bay and her sisters of the bay line owned by messrs hatfield cameron co of glasgow while their 1000 ton barks are shown in the model of the banca belonging to messrs p denniston co of the same city these are about the smallest class of sailing ships built during recent years the demands of the shipping trade being such as to make it unprofitable to sail anything smaller than about 1500 tons while the tendency is to exceed 2000 tons in burden and to reach even as high as 3000 tonsthe engineer water blast pump it is well known that the principle which is applied to the construction of vacuum or filter pumps and which aims at the production of rarefied air in a certain inclosed space may also be applied to the production of air pressure a simple apparatus by which this may be accomplished has recently been constructed by a beutell a tall cylindrical flask k see cut is provided with an outlet tube near the bottom and its stopper carries two tubes one m for the entrance of a jet of water and the other l for the exit of the compressed air which may be conducted to a blast lamp or wherever air under pressure may be needed the column of water entering through m causes air to be sucked in through the little hole at c and this air after arriving in the flask is gradually compressed by the continuously entering water in order that the apparatus may work properly it is necessary to construct the tube m in a particular manner and of certain definite proportions fig 3 exhibits its bore and shape in an enlarged view a short distance below the orifice of the tube it is slightly expanded and then gradually contracts to the place b it then again expands to an oblong cavity and contracts again to a neck e which is a trifle wider than that at b and which must be so situated that the column of water passing through b is exactly perpendicular to the center of the aperture at e the tube then expands again to its original diameter and is slightly curved which is done to prevent any of the compressed air in the cylinder k from regurgitating upward illustration fig 1 fig 2 fig 3 beutells water blast pump the outlet tube at a is preferably constructed as shown in fig 2 instead of being made of one piece it is there represented as consisting of two pieces joined together by rubber tubing a sort of check valve g being introduced into the rubber joint by regulating the check valve that is by approaching it more or less to the exit of the tube a the outflow of water may be regulated it is important to adjust this so that the cylindrical flask will always be at least half full and never over threefourths filled while the column of water falls through the aperture at b into the expanded portion of m it aspirates air through the little orifice c communicating with the outer air and this air is carried along with it into the flask where it accumulates until it is under a pressure equal to that of the column of water entering the apparatus when the latter will cease to flow by allowing the air to escape through l more will be successively compressed so that a steady blast may be obtained the proportions between the diameters of the expanded and contracted portions of the glass tube m are important if the bore at b amounts to 25 millimeters that at e should be 3 millimeters under these circumstances and with a pressure of water equal to a column of 617 cubic centimeters the apparatus will furnish 890 liters of air for every 1000 liters of water consumed if the two diameters were b 1 millimeter and e 24 mm one liter of water aspirates 235 liters of air these proportions are no doubt capable of improvementchem zeit and ch centralbl transmission of power between bodies moving at different velocities a few months ago there was exhibited in the societys reading room a working model of an application to railway working of what the inventor calls division of the mass in causing a body moving at a high velocity to communicate motion to another at rest or moving at a lower velocity he splits one of them up into parts all the more numerous and therefore tenuous as the difference in velocity is greater and this is accomplished by causing one of the parts to take the form of a brush composed of metal fibers in applying this principle to the transmission of motion for driving machinery a disk fitted with segmental brushes is slid laterally along the shaft so that the fibers come into contact with radial projections on a second disk and although the contact is made instantaneously the action is exerted gradually owing to the flexibility of the fibers that is to say the full power is communicated without any shock a similar arrangement but with one of the disks fixed serves as a brake for arresting motion and this again without shock but with gradually increasing action where space is very much circumscribed the clutch and the brake may be combined by fitting a disk with brushes on one side and projections on the other so that it may be brought by a lever against a second disk for transmitting motion and against a third fixed for stopping it safety appliances for arresting the descent of mine cages in the event of the rope breaking have hitherto depended upon the entrance of claws into the guides or the clipping of the latter or the wedging of the cage between the guides in this application of the system the guides of the shaft are fitted with corrugated iron plates and the sides of the cage with steel brushes in the normal state of working the brushes are kept clear of the guides but should the rope break a small brush fitted on a sector constantly rubbing against the corrugations of the guides aided by a spring or counterweight brings the main brushes into contact with the guides by a link arrangement like that of the parallel ruler thus arresting the cage and holding it suspended until the brushes are gradually relaxed for braking the cage slowly down to the next landing many attempts have been made to cause a locomotive running at full speed to exert such a mechanical action as would set a signal to danger so as to protect the train from another following in the rear by fitting the engine with a steel brush attached to the axle boxes so as to preserve a uniform height with respect to the rails a stationary lever may be gradually moved so that the signal is set at danger without shock moreover by means of another brush in the event of the engine being turned upon the wrong line a lever may be made to shut off the steam apply the brakes blow the whistle or move an index on a dial recording a neglect of duty or may exert these four actions simultaneously all the above applications of this principlethe division of the masshave been tested experimentally the last named by the model above referred to the clutch arrangement has transmitted six horse power from a petroleum motor making 200 revolutions a minute to a dynamo making 2000 revolutions while applications to industrial purposes are now being made both in this country and in belgium the inventor of the system is m raymond snyers ingnieur des mines du gnie civil et des arts et manufactures of the louvain universityjournal of the society of arts steam generator of serpollet brothers producing steam instantaneously the explosibility of a steam generator may be measured by the relation of its total capacity to its vaporizing power the old fashioned generators and some of the modern ones are so constructed as to contain from fifteen to twenty times more water than they are able to vaporize within one hour thus a great quantity of heat is obtained and a uniform pressure assured but the steamgenerating apparatus is costly heavy and cumbersome it requires a long time before the necessary pressure is obtained and the generator is only suitable for a stationary installation and where it can uninterruptedly work for a long period of time besides the enormous quantity of hot water under pressure constitutes a constant danger and the explosion of a steam generator with boiler tubes becomes a real disaster in order to satisfy the requirements which have newly arisen in connection with navigation locomotion small motors and apparatus which need for their working an intermittent supply of steam it became necessary to modify the construction of steam boilers to augment their heating surface to diminish their residue of water and to gradually construct socalled inexplosible apparatus of which the belleville boiler forms one of the most characteristic prototypes in trying to reduce the inexplosibility to the utmost messrs serpollet brothers have succeeded in constructing a type of boilers which may be called absolutely inexplosible and this result has been obtained by reducing the capacity of the boiler to practically nil thus rendering the explosibility also nil for under the circumstances the relation between capacity and vaporizing power becomes itself nil illustration fig 1instantaneous vaporization boiler of messrs serpollet 1 general view of boiler experimental arrangement 2 cross section of boiler natural size the line a b indicates at somewhat exaggerated scale the cross section of the interior empty space of the boiler the method employed for this purpose by messrs serpollet is an extremely simple one a cylindrical steel tube of convenient diameter and sufficient thickness is rolled flat at a temperature below the white heat of the metal and the last touch of the rollers is given to it when already cold by this means a flat tube is obtained the empty interior space of which looks in a cross section fig 1 no 2 like a black line not thicker than a hair and measures from 01 to 03 millimeter this tube is finally rolled up in the form of a spiral or left straight according to the use to be made of it and put into an appropriate furnace fig 1 no 1 to either end of the tube a joint is attached the one for the purpose of admitting the water the other for admitting the steam when under these circumstances the tube has been heated to a high temperature in a convenient fire box the water which has been pumped into it by a feed pump fastened to one of its extremities is instantly changed into steam and escapes at the other end at a pressure and in a state of dryness depending on the working conditions of the apparatus the ingenious and really original and novel idea in this invention is this flattened tube which constitutes an actual capillary boiler inside of which the water squeezed in between its walls cannot assume its spheroidal state and the formation of drops becomes absolutely impossible there exists no longer a residue of hot water nor are water gauges safety valves or any other of those numerous accessories required which make all steam boilers so complicated and which augment considerably their cost it also becomes unnecessary to connect the joint from which the steam escapes by means of a valve with the motor for which the steam is to be used if the supply of steam is to be stopped this can be done by simply suppressing the supply of water ie by emptying the boiler the regular working is assured by the quantity of heat contained in the heated iron tube to which for this purpose an intentionally great thickness has been given and it is this heat of the iron which replaces the heat furnished by the hot water in the steam generators with boiler tubes from the above it will be easy to understand the general arrangement of the new steam generator when connected with its motor this motor works a small intermitting pump which supplies the capillary boiler with water according to the quantity consumed the machine is started by means of a small special pump worked by hand whenever the velocity of the motor tends to increase a centrifugal regulator placed upon the motor reduces the action of the pump and consequently the supply of water to the tube thus checking the velocity of the machine if the velocity tends to slacken the inverse process is employed in order to stop the machine it suffices to turn off the water furnished by the pump by means of a threeway cock and to send the water back to the reservoir of supply the boiler can be emptied in less than a second and the motor stops in consequence of being deprived of motive power the whole is marvelously simple and creates astonishment and admiration in the mind of even the most skeptical persons who see the apparatus the boiler of the one horse power type weighs 33 kilogrammes it consists of an iron tube having a length of 2 meters and a height of 105 centimeters after it has been flattened the total heating surface thus obtained being 48 square centimeters the power of vaporization amounts to 20 kilogrammes of water per hour while the quantity of coal consumed during the same period amounts to only 4 kilogrammes which is comparatively little for a boiler of so small a power illustration fig 2tricycle propelled by a serpollet boiler fig 2 shows the first model of a tricycle constructed by messrs serpollet as an application of their boiler for locomotion the writer has seen the working of this apparatus and consequently is able to give some data the total weight of the machine is 185 kilogrammes or about 250 kilogrammes when mounted by a person the boiler is placed behind the tricycle the motor is under the seat inside of which is the water reservoir and the supply of coal in the motor employed in the present case the feed pump is a constant supply pump but by means of a directing lever turning around its own axis and acting upon a threeway cock the water can be divided into two streams the one emptying into the feeding reservoir the other into the boiler by varying the position of the cock the power of the machine can be modified and its velocity regulated the machine can be brought to a stop within less than two meters by means of the combined action of a brake and the complete suppression of water in the boiler in order to start the machine the water is sent into the tube by a little extra pump worked for a moment by the left hand of the cyclist when starting on july 25 some experiments were made before the society of civil engineers with the tricycle above described and on that occasion it traversed the rue girardon and the rue de norvino to montmartre streets in which the gradient rises to 15 centimeters per meter with a velocity of three meters per second fig 3 represents the arrangement of the first stationary boiler of the new kind the letters of reference will suffice to indicate the position of the principal parts of it the forms of which may be varied according to the object for which the boiler is to be used illustration fig 3complete view of a serpollet boiler 1 exterior view 2 cross section 3 horizontal section at the height of the tube messrs serpollet are occupied at present with studying the special arrangements which will be needed for connecting their boiler with a quadricycle a torpedo boat a stove a locomotive or a stationary machine of 10 horse power and with rectangular parts the inexplosibility of their boiler has been tested during an experiment made before the engineers of mines on which occasion a manometer steam gauge graduated for a pressure of upward 200 kilogrammes per square centimeter was used and the pressure raised far beyond the limits indicated the result was that the hand of the manometer being pressed against the walls of the box became bent and though the boiler was submitted to a pressure the degree of which it was impossible to measure it was not changed in the slightest incrustation of the boiler is not to be feared for in consequence of the great velocity with which the steam circulates through the tube the solid matter dissolved in the water becomes pulverized and is forced out mechanically assisting to lubricate and polish the parts of the motor the invention of messrs serpollet is still too new to foretell all its possible applications but their apparatus in its present form is exactly the steam generator which will be useful for producing a small motive force while it will be necessary to wait until it has been ascertained by further study how the system can economically be used for high motive power the most natural and immediate application of the invention seems to be its use for the electric lighting of restaurants in which case one of the instantaneous vaporization tubes might be connected with stoves which remain lighted all day and which might thus besides supply the necessary motive force to work a small dynamo charging some accumulatorse hospitalier in la nature gas lighting by highpower burners in the course of a communication presented to the societe industrielle du nord de la france by the manager of the wazemmes gas company he made the following remarks on gas lighting with highpower burners for gas of a standard illuminating value the lighting power increases with the temperature of the flame it also increases under favorable conditions if the quantity of gas consumed by the burner in a certain period is augmented thus two burners consuming 60 liters rather more than 2 cubic feet of gas placed in juxtaposition produce less light than one burner consuming 120 liters as it is impossible to indefinitely increase the supply to ordinary burners multipleflame burners have been invented in which two or more ordinary flames are united so that they may impinge upon each other by an ingenious arrangement for bringing the air into contact with the multiple flames two excellent types of lamps are obtained consuming respectively 700 and 1400 liters per hour which meet with a rapid demand in paris and in many other towns for lighting wide public thoroughfares squares and large open spaces if however it is desired to obtain a flame with a much higher temperature it is necessary to resort to a special arrangement for heating the air intended for combustion with the gas the principle of heating the air by means of waste heat escaping with the products of the waste gasthe regenerative principlewas adopted by mr f siemens and applied not only to gas burners but to high temperature stoves with the siemens burner on the regenerative principle the following results are obtained with a consumption of 150 liters per hour the light of from 1 to 3 carcels 250 to 300 liters 6 to 7 carcels 600 liters 15 carcels 800 liters 20 to 22 carcels 1600 liters 46 to 48 carcels 2200 liters 72 carcels unfortunately the construction of the siemens argand lamps is very delicate and moreover they have the disadvantage of being heavy and rather unsightly in germany they have been widely adopted but in france they have met with but little success the schulke lamp is made on the same principle and this appears to be too delicate to come into general use one of the latest burners of the regenerative class is the wenham which has been before the public for some time in england and is now being adopted in france in point of fact it is merely a very effective improvement on breittmayers burner from which it differs only in its construction being produced in some elegant styles which lend themselves perfectly to the decorations of private houses the no 2 lamp of this type with a consumption of 283 liters 10 cubic feet per hour has given 126 candles in a vertical direction without reflectors horizontally 50 candles but the gas employed in the tests had an illuminating power about 20 per cent higher than that usual in paris when experimenting in paris with a no 3 lamp in a vertical direction it showed a consumption of 346 liters 12 cubic feet per carcel obtained the wenham lamp is constructed to give light in a vertical direction and by adopting a large reflector the illuminating power is increased 18 per cent in a vertical line and 55 per cent at 80 which is a highly satisfactory result there are at present five sizes of these lamps there is also the delmas hot air burner in which the batswing flame is completely inclosed in a glass mounted with a sheetiron casing heated by the products of combustion through which the air passes on its passage downward to feed the flame and it thus increases the temperature improves the illuminating power and produces a beautiful steady light mention also may be made of the siemens radiated heat burner by means of which the heating of the air is effected simply by the radiation of the metallic parts of the appliance which are in contact with the flame these burners produce the light of 1 carcel 95 candles with a gas consumption of 70 liters about 2 cubic feet and are therefore from an economical point of view intermediary between the high power and regenerative burners this degree of economy can be ascertained by an ingenious arrangement of the air supply in a burner with holes which has been made in the laboratory of the wazemmes gas company by m verl the engineer who has invented a very simple burner called the lillois with which the light of 1 carcel is obtained with a consumption of 70 liters this produces a tulipshaped flame and it has a specially constructed glass arrangement on the outside for regulating the combustion comparing the abovementioned burners with each other we arrive at the following results the lillois burner consumes 70 liters of gas per carcel the siemens ordinary 70 liters the siemensbreittmayer 35 to 39 liters the wenham about 35 liters taking this into account and considering that a carcel corresponds with 105 liters of gas consumed in the bengal form of burner we see that the economy in gas might by employing these burners reach from 33 to 71 per cent if this is compared with the batswing burner which produces the light of 1 carcel with a consumption of 120 liters of gas the economy is greatervarying according to the type of lamp from 41 to 85 per cent synchronizing clocks illustration daveys pendulum for

the problem is similar to the present one except that it is roughandready compared to the present one he had a novel electrical pendulum to drive a seconds pendulum by electricity electrical clocks are notoriously bad timekeepers on account of variation in the strength of the electrical current the battery falls off he had constructed an electric clock having a seconds pendulum and recording an

three years ago when the sudden and serious fall took place in the value of the secondary products produced in gas works many gas managersever desirous of doing their very best for their employerswere forced to look around for some better market in which to dispose of the products which had so seriously fallen in value this was no easy task and even now it forms very uphill work indeed a comparatively new market has been created for the disposal of boiled tar at several of the german ports but the expense and difficulty of loading ships with tar in casks take very much from the saving derived from the new manner of disposal it occurred to me therefore that we must look nearer home for a remedy in all gas works of any magnitude a considerable quantity of fuel must be employed for the purpose of supplying the works with steam for the exhauster engines chemical apparatus thawing purposes etc whether this fuel consists of coke or of coal will not in the least affect or alter my figures i have no doubt if any manager discovers that he is working more economically by selling the coke and using a cheap small or other coal he will adopt the cheapest process in dundee where we get a good price for coke i found for the purpose of steam fuel it would be far cheaper to buy small coal costing from 5s to 5s 6d per ton delivered in the works and dispose of the coke the question of fuel then lay between coal and tar and i have experimented somewhat extensively to ascertain the true relative values of the two classes of fuel for the purpose of this paper and within the last few days i made a further examination into the question and the results arrived at will be those here quoted the coal we employed was what is known as stravenhouse small coal which costs 5s per ton delivered the experiment in each case lasted 48 hours the tar employed was what is known as boiled tar the naphtha having been previously removed but the pitch oil left in the tar the value of this tar in dundee is about 4s per ton the following are the figures coal 10 tons 16 cwt at 5s 2 14 0 tar 1460 gallons or 9 tons 3 cwt 160 gallons 1 ton at 4s 1 16 7 saving per day by using tar 0 17 5 and this at the longest day when we are using a mere fraction of steam as compared with our winter requirements and consequently the profit is proportionally less than it will be when we are in full work illustration and now allow me to direct your attention for a short time to the appliance made use of in accomplishing this tar burning on the wall is shown a diagram giving in detail the injector known as c w walkers patent tar sprayer burner and it is supplied only by that firm the tar which has been brought forward to the boilers in a thoroughly liquid state is discharged from the center of the injector into the furnace of the boiler surrounding the center nozzle of the injector is an annular space through which high pressure steam passes also into the furnace the meaning of this steam moving along with the tar is to force a draught as well as to raise the temperature of the tar and so partially convert the tar into vapor thereby making the combustion more complete the flow of the tar is regulated by the very delicate sluices attached to the injectors these valves consist of elongated cones and plugs and are constructed not only for the purpose of regulating the flow of tar but also for removing any obstruction or incrustation which may accumulate in the nozzle in order to keep the tar in a liquid state which in the winter time is not an easy matter a small steam pipe is passed through the center of the tar pipe but of course no steam is discharged among the tar as the presence of water in the injector prevents its correct working the steam pipe is simply passed through the tar pipe and a steam trap attached to its end in changing from the coal or coke fuel to the tar little or no difficulty is experienced and very rarely is a shovelful of any kind of solid material required the furnace bars have only to be kept covered to prevent the waste of tar and the too rapid ingress of air and when the furnaces are in full work and being well and carefully attended to the tar will be found to have been nearly all consumed before reaching the solid material covering the bars the action is very much the same as in the paraffin oil lamp the wick is the medium by which the oil is brought to the point of combustion where it is developed into light but the wick remains little injured although in close proximity to such intense heat the oil burns not the wick in the tar furnace the tar itself burns and the tar only it will be easily understood that a little experience is necessary to enable the attendant to fully understand the quantity of tar by which complete combustion is to be obtained and which in no case must be exceeded the moment one atom of tar is sent into the furnace beyond that which can be thoroughly consumed you have then the most hideous discharge of black smoke carbon which it is difficult to describe but which can be easily understood and i believe can be seen within a few miles of where we now sit i should mention that the injectors are fitted on the furnace doors but the connections are of such a nature that the doors can be opened without disturbing any of the permanent fittings and now i have told you that the results detailed in this short paper were those obtained in the dundee gas works this is so but were i to leave the matter here it might be inferred that i considered similar results might be obtained in any and every gas works i would not mislead you and therefore must detain you for a few moments longer in order to show you how my town is different from many others dundee is very peculiarly situated in this respect it is a long distance from any tar distillers works capable of dealing with the large quantity of tar we have for sale during the winter a large portion of the value of our tar must therefore go to the railway company to cover the cost of transit between the two points and so the tar distiller can allow us but a small figure for it at the starting point then again dundee being far distant from the coal fields the coal is exceptionally high in price i quite believe that in many of the west country towns the coal for which we are paying 5s per ton could be had for 3s and the tar for which we are receiving 4s per ton they would get not much under the double of this therefore you see in a place so circumstanced the figures i have given would be most misleading still i doubt not there are places as badly situated as dundee and it is to such places that my remarks are directed i believe also that in many towns distant from collieries the tar might be sold to manufacturers for use in their steam boilers and such an arrangement would i think prove advantageous both to the seller and the user of this liquid fuel i think that as much has been said in regard to my subject as is necessary but permit me to add that i believe there is a future for liquid fuels i do not say tar but more concentrated fuels such as crude naphthas paraffins and pitch oil when you see one of our large steamers taking coal into her bunker it must have appeared to you that there was great waste of power here every ton of coal laid in must require a certain amount of power to carry it and every ton of coal so laid in reduces the cargocarrying power to this extent a few gallons of oil will give you the steamproducing power of a ton of coal and this is a fact which the owners of nonpaying steamships should note take our locomotives also everything i have said in regard to steamships applies to them and the comfort to the stokers and the general reduction in labor would be very marked indeed of course it may be argued that if there were such a large demand created for oils for furnaces the old fashioned law of supply and demand might come into play and so force up the price of the article for which the increased demand had taken place but i think this state of matters is rather remote when we bear in mind the great oil wells only now becoming developed and the oils from which can be run in bulk direct from the wells into ships and brought to this country at very low ratesjournal of gas lighting watch cleaning and repairing by old fogy before proceeding

purpose so that by making these at the time i happen to want a tool that i cannot purchase i have accumulated quite a variety of odd tools among them are a varied lot of millers for milling and raising jewels and deepening the countersink holes for jewel settings and screw heads also a tool for holding a roller to set the jewel pin and one for holding the hair spring collet and a pair of tweezers for holding jewels while cleaning etc etc as to lathes i have found that there is a necessity of about two lathes one a swiss light running lathe for cementing any pivot work and i prefer these because they run much lighter and easier than those heavier american lathes and yet if confined to but one lathe i would use a small sized american lathe with a good assortment of split chucks particularly those with the smaller sized holes for holding balance staffs wheel arbors etc which come in use almost everyday for taking off the burr from the point of a balance pivot which has come from a collapse of the case driving the end stones down on the end of pivots even sometimes to the extent of heading them over inside of the hole jewel these small size split chucks i have found extremely useful for the last named purpose and i am not so sentimental but that i oftener use these split chucks even for setting fine balance pivots rather than take time to cement them and while i do not advise the use of a split chuck for this purpose in every case yet with a little experience one can tell when a staff is held so that the new pivot when set will line and be true and of a clear beat or swing to make a very nice pivot the cementing process is preferable and yet for nearly a year my old no 1 american lathe was not set up for reasons i need not take space to explain and during that time i employed a very skillful workman to do my pivoting and this man would not think of ever doing a nice job unless he cemented it and i can assure you that he put in more pivots out of line and out of true in the course of those few months than i had done badly in my life speaking of sentiment i will say that too many young workmen use the lathe too much and seem to depend on a fine looking lathe and handsome tools and spend too much time in using the lathe and in decorating their bench with a fine display but dont construe this as meaning that one can do nice work with a jack knife and handsaw for i most certainly believe in a good and substantial set of tools or i would not have taken so much space in speaking of them next one must have a good bench wide and of good length and if no other drawers a shallow depth drawer exactly in center of the bench with no knob in front but rather a lip running its whole length underneath so that wherever you place your hand you can pull it out this drawer i would have large and roomy wide and long and extending back as far as the depth of the bench will allow but shallow not deep down in and then partition it off by narrow slats diagonally across it running these slats from the extreme near right hand corner to the further and extreme left hand corner so that as you reach your right hand in to take out a tool you can grasp it naturally without twisting or cramping your hand about eight inches below the top of the bench i would place a skin drawer the name comes from the practice at watch factories formerly using sheepskins for the bottoms which is made with a square frame say like a picture frame sliding on slats or a groove so that it can be drawn out toward the operator and when so drawn the elbows will rest on this frame with the wrists resting on the edge of the top of the bench thus giving a firm support for both arms and hands and this frame having stretched across its bottom a skin or canvas will catch and retain anything that drops or rolls from the bench this latter drawer i consider almost an indispensable article to doing good and successful work at the right hand of these two drawers named running down to floor if need be there can be a series of drawers for tools and materials now with these equipments and some others not herein named such as vise file block bench stake or anvil and a large variety of such tools as will accumulate i am ready to give you my ideas regarding the cleaning and repairing of watches first and foremost do not undertake any job that you have any or considerable doubt but what you can do successfully and never leave a job worse than you found it and never mar cut or slash any part of a watch in other words dont undertake a job that you have doubts as to whether you can do it correctly one of my old masters told me never to undertake to improve on the makers work and this while not true in every case particularly cheap watches yet is a safe rule to go by never allow your file screwdriver pliers tweezers or any tool to deface any part of a watch i shall speak of this as i proceed first be careful and not let the movement swing so as to in any way injure the balance in taking from case and if a lever watch take out the balance the first thing after getting out of case now see that the mainspring is let down and then remove the screws from the plates taking care not to damage or bend any of the pivots as you do this when all in pieces before you proceed to clean examine with a strong glass to see if the rim of any wheel is rubbing or clashing with anything particularly the center wheel in any full plate american watch for these wheels are often dragging on the plate or striking the ratch wheel because it is not true and if examined before cleaning the places where it drags are a telltale of the mischief also make any diagnosis of the watch that is needed to discover any errors from wear or accident and correct them before going further such as looking to each jewel pivot and other parts and make all necessary repairs before cleaning i have been in the habit for several years of putting my balance wheel separate from all connections and trying its freedom in all positions and if you will try this method you will be surprised how many you will find that bind or are not perfectly free in all positions when you give them the very slightest impulse by a twirl of the hand holding the plate then too a careful examination of each jewel you will be surprised how many are either loose in the setting or plate in regard to cleaning i use the old method after trying all ways suggestedthat of chalk but i use the old lump chalk for those carpenters chalk balls are made with some kind of paste that adheres to the plateand have this lump of chalk at my right hand in a perforated bottom box so that any coarse pieces fall through to the floor and by rubbing the brush across it and then giving it a slight rap before applying it to plate any hard or heavy substance will fall out and then with light pressure with the brush that is medium soft and prepared on grindstone as before mentioned if a new one brush the plates with an occasional breathing on the surface clean the old oil or tarnish and then peg out each hole many times until you are sure every hole is clean by pegging both sides and then with a soft dust brush dust thoroughly by striking the brush into the holes on both sides of course remove all end stones and clean out with soft pith holding the jewels in a pair of hook nose tweezers mentioned should the plates and wheels be very much soiled and oily a covered dish of alcohol is indispensable and i have had a glass stopper bottle with ether in which to dip the jewels pallets and other small pieces which takes the oil all off but be sure and clean off with soft pith or pegwood such pieces as you have thus dipped this ether will carry all loose lint or other things to its bottom from hairsprings or roller table and if held but a moment will do effective work and not loosen shellac regarding loose jewels i am not so sentimental as to refuse using some shellac if the burnished lip has been so thin as to be partially gone thus loosening the jewel to hold in the jewel by taking small and minute particles and placing around the edge of the jewel and then holding the plate or bridge over an alcohol flame and allowing the shellac to flow around the jewel and fasten it firm and by this process i have kept jewels firm in place for years with no other attention than the first and as a rule this can be done and not show when you have thoroughly cleaned the different parts holding everything with soft tissue paper then with the paper put the watch together never forcing any part into place and when screwed or pinned together try every wheel to see that there is the proper end and side shake to each pivot then introduce the balance wheel having been once tried alone as described and see that the banking pins are so adjusted that the guard pin on the fork lever does not drag on either side and that the jewel pin enters the slot clearing the opposite corner and that the guard pin is so in position that it will not allow the pin to pass by at any point and bring the jewel pin outside the lever or so it will strike in hollow or on the corners of the hollow of the roller when you have oiled each pivot exactly on its connecting point of bearing with just the right amount of oil of course oil those jewels having end stones before putting watch together your watch is ready for the dial and in replacing the hands you cannot be too particular about their being free and clearing each other and the dial and glass there is the care of the mainspring i have intentionally reserved till the last there are lots of theories why a spring will break just after cleaning but i only know that since i have adopted the method of never taking out the spring except when after taking off the cap of barrel i find it is all gummed up with bad oil and then of course clean it i have found that a spring does not break any oftener than is common even if the watch is not cleaned but i invariably remove the barrel arbor and clean out the holes and the arbor itself of course to explain every detail of the method of repairing the various parts of a watch would take more space than you would allow in your journal and hence i will not attempt to go into minute detail except perhaps some of the more important items and the most common things found in everyday experience among these are broken pivots worn pivots sometimes requiring new ones worn holes in plates and at the intersection of barrel arbor ratch and bridge of swiss watches etc which as a rule require common sense as much as practice and it varies in different watches so that the common sense rule applies the best to nearly all of these and if you have not got common mechanical sense then you have mistaken your calling and should do something else in any of these repairs dont go it blind but study your case carefully and do the best thing you study out when there is a worn pivot hole in a plate and one side is countersunk for oil then have a punch rounded at the point just the shape of the countersink and if you have not one make one and here is where my rule that of making a tool as the need comes for it comes in play and by screwing this punch into the vise and with a smooth flat point punch slightly cornered of course in one hand and holding the plate or bridge with the other with the countersink on the punch have a striker tap light and quick blows and you move the punch around on the side most worn and one side is almost invariably worn most throwing the wheel arbor out of upright and close up even a little too much and then with a round smooth broach enlarge it so that it will be right size and this leaves it hard and smooth broken pivots as i have hinted i place the arbor in a split chuck and if true i drill into the staff with a drill made from a nice piece of steel wire the old and ordinary shape of a drill which is a trifle larger at the cutting point than it is back of the point and i make these as i need them and harden simply by holding the wire in a flame till red hot and then dash into an apple potato soap or pure rubber which is the best of these i have as yet been unable to determine so i use either as the most handy take a good tough and small pointed graver and turn a slight center in the end of arbor i am to drill and then by giving my lathe a back and forward motion i begin to drill and by the sense of feeling i can tell whether my drill is cutting or not and if not i have a small smooth oilstone at hand and sharpen the drill as often as it refuses to cut and if that drill will not cut i make another i make my drills of very small wire filing them at point and then tap the point holding the wire in a very fine pin vise thus flattening as well as spreading it and then shape the cutting edges as spoken of above when you have drilled sufficiently to hold a plug firmly then have a piece of steel of spring temper filed so as to fit closely and so straight that it will not act too wedging and split the arbor drive it in cut it off and turn down finishing with an oilstone slip and polish by running the lathe rapidly and with a piece of thin boxwood or hard pegwood charged with diamantine being sure that the end of the pivot has no burr thrown either way over end or on side for such a burr will cause a lack of freedom of a balance pivot particularly this matter of setting pivots requires a longer experience than almost any other work and it needs a long practice to do a nice job if your split chuck will not hold your staff or arbor true then use cement but in this too you must be sure that your center is true and that the sound pivot enters it perfectly sometimes you meet with steel so hard that you cannot touch it with a drill in which case draw the temper of the staff or arbor you are drilling and if it projects so little that you cannot draw the temper without injury to the wheel then unstake or separate the wheel and by drilling a hole into a piece of brass wire about the size of the staff you are drilling insert the staff in this hole and then heat the wire near the staff and thus gradually and yet effectively draw the temper i consider it well for young workmen to practice pivot setting in some old and useless watch any spare time they may have and thus become adepts at this work unhindered i am not over on an average of onehalf hour in setting any ordinary pivot especially if i do not have to cement my work if this is a balance pivot be very careful to see that your balance is true and poised before putting on hairspring and roller there are some pivots that are underturned to make look tidy and light and sometimes it is about an impossibility to put in a new one and in this case if an american watch i always put in an entire new staff and hence keep a full assortment on hand regarding replacing broken jewels i also keep a full stock of these turned the setting to match any make or style of watch except of course swiss watches and for these i keep a large assortment of sizes both of cock and foot and wheel jewels and a full stock once procured they last a long time and are a good investment for with them you can meet any emergency in a swiss watch or any watch where the jewel is set into the plate have some one of the devices for throwing up the burnished lip and then select a jewel that just fills the space and then with a smooth pointed punch such as i described i used for closing up a pivot hole i turn this lip back by sliding this round pointed punch around the outside making it act as a burnish cap jewels i either treat in the same manner as the last or cut away the setting and insert them as they are inserted in most swiss watches i have now taken up the more common repairs and will close by hastily speaking of the more rare cases and the adjustment of the hair spring etc etc it is often the case that there is never end shake to the balance to make it absolutely safe when screwed into the case and when this happens i take the point of a sharp graver and prick up a burr on the bridge and never on the plate as any unskilled workman does for the under side of the bridge never being finished you really mar nothing and sometimes this raising of the cock or bridge becomes a necessity to have it clear the rim of the balance which if raised it will clear and then by bending down the end of the cock at point where the jewel is and thus regulate the end shake i hardly know how to give directions how to proceed in adjusting hairsprings when they are disarranged but if i could see you i could explain by example what i cannot well do in words to commence a hairspring when there is no power applied to balance from the jewel pin should be when pinned just as free from any twist or cramping as it would be if lying flat and free on a smooth piece of glass before it has been pinned at either end and when it is pinned in the watch at stud and collet it should be thus free to bring it thus requires demonstration that cannot be made on paper unless you could make diagrams too numerous for this article what i have said regarding it however gives an idea of how a hairspring should be pinned common sense is demanded here as elsewhere to put a watch in beat too is a very important item which i do by placing sharp pointed tweezers first on one side of the arm of balance and then on the other and so pin my hairspring in the stud that it will let off as readily on one side as the other i had forgotten to say that every watch should have a little oil on the face of the pallet stones i know full well that some workmen will say that there should be none but i can tell of scores of watches that have failed and indeed stopped simply for want of oil on the pallets selecting mainsprings too needs much more care than is usually given to this department and as a rule even the watch factories fill the barrel too full that is too long springs whether i am correct in this or not you cannot be too particular in selecting the right strength length and width of mainsprings mainsprings should be well and carefully oiled there are many ways of replacing broken teeth in wheels and the width of the web and the size of the teeth has much to do with how they are put in but i usually dovetail them in and then with the very tiniest bit of soft solder fasten them but in so doing be positive you have got off all soldering fluid that it will not rust the pinion into which it meshes and be very particular to have it exactly like the rest of the teeth in same wheel and dont mar the web of the wheel more than is possible i will now draw this article to a close well appreciating the fact that i have only made a superficial attempt to instruct younger men in the cleaning and repairing of watches for there is almost an endless variety of special repairs coming almost unexpectedly to any one even if they have been in the business a long time as i have and as i first said i am learning daily some new phase of the business and am surprised that i never had known it before i have too taken perhaps more space than i ought regarding tools and bench yet the older i grow the more i can see the importance of this part that i may be enabled to do work well and quick besides i have left such repairs as the chain and fusee uprighting wheels repairing cases adjustment to position heat and cold isochronism enlarging jewels or changing angles of pallet stones etc etc all of which i do as necessity demands as well as the care of striking watches fly backs etc which too i make a specialty of and of chronometer escapement watches which would take more space than i feel disposed to ask you to give meamerican jeweler the new central railway station at frankfort on the main the new central railway station at frankfort on the main is one of the most imposing structures of modern times not only as regards its dimensions but also because of the effect which its architectural proportions produce upon the eye nobody looking at the long line of buildings surrounded by gigantic perron halls can help being impressed with their grandeur the beholder however is not only struck by the general aspect but also by the beauty of detail in this magnificent specimen of the renaissance style the interior of the perron hall shown in one of our engravings is especially impressive and every one will admire the graceful outlines of the heavy iron structures in the upper part which in consequence of their enormous height look from below like a spider web the base and the earth works were begun in the summer of 1881 and if we take into consideration the fact that 2700000 cubic meters of sand and gravel were necessary for the foundation we will have some idea of the scale on which the edifice was undertaken in 1883 the great hall which has a width of 220 meters and which will shortly be opened to traffic was begun the perspective view of this portion of the station is given in one of our engravings inspector eggert had the general management of the building which was erected after the plan submitted by him and which received the prize in the competition between the different architects herr frantz a distinguished engineer who undertook the general supervision of the construction had an important part in the execution of the entrance hall for the trains and it was he also who built the perron hall after designs of herr schwedler the middle part of the station which contains the porch the ticket offices the baggage department the police quarters and the telegraph offices projects as shown in the picture considerably beyond the rest of the building and by the distinct membering of its moulding stands out conspicuously from the whole protruding portals of peculiar structure and corner pavilions enliven the aspect of the wings of the edifice the great round arched windows of which are separated from each other by powerful stone pillars the corner pavilions to the left in the view contain the socalled imperial apartments for the reception of royal travelers and on the other side are the meeting hall and reception rooms of the different railway administrations on the right and left of the imposing main vestibule which is distinguished by the strength and the beauty of its style lobbies with arched roofs lead to the waiting and dining rooms the ladies rooms the imperial apartments and the above mentioned meeting hall of the administration illustration the new central railway station frankfort on the maindrawn by fr schurmann the ladies and gentlemens toilet rooms also are in that part of the building the architect has laid especial stress upon the architectural ornamentation of the building upon the apex of the arch over the main vestibule a great group will be placed representing atlas carrying the world on his shoulders and supported in his work by the allegorical figures of steam and electricity this group which is at the present moment being executed in copper by houwald in brunswick is the work of a frankfort sculptor herr gustav herold in the arch itself near the clock we see two allegorical female figures over life size in a sitting posture modeled by prof gustav kaupert in frankfort and representing day and night in front of the pillars supporting the arch two other female sitting figures also above life size will be perceived these were modeled by professor calandrelli in berlin and represent agriculture and commerce and in the niches on both sides there are the statues of navigation and industry the work of the sculptor hundrieser of berlin the two side portals of the entrance hall are surmounted by figures of boys having a height 240 meters on the left the commercial traveler and traveling student modelled by rudolph eckhardt in frankfort on the right the traveler for pleasure and the emigrant the works of the sculptor scholl of mayence the groups of the corner pavilions allegoric representations of machine building and engineering were modeled by professor max wiese of hanau the figures like the whole building are of heibronn sandstone either wing has a vestibule leading to the middle perron of the great hall they resemble in style the architecture of the front of the middle building only their arches are smaller here also we meet rich architectural ornamentation on the pillars in the great arch the ornaments consist as in the former case of allegorical figures of boys they have a height of 220 meters and represent agriculture and art industry on the one side and art and the retail trade of frankfort on the other side the two former figures are the work of the sculptor a brutt of berlin the two latter were modeled by hermann becker of frankfort the side facades are very long but of simpler style than the front of the building and connect with the perron halls which on their part end in semitowers there the offices of the administrations are located the main vestibule leads directly to the middle of the perron in the large hall which consists of three naves and into which enter the trains of six railway lines each separated from the other by perrons the perron hall has a length of 186 meters and a width of 168 meters the height of the naves with their low arched roofs rises in the center to 285 meters tunnels connect the different railway lines in order to assist the rapid transit of through trains the port also benefits by these tunnels the inside front of the main vestibule is very richly decorated in its center a large clock is situated and on both sides of it are colossal allegorical figures modeled by f kruger of frankfort and representing the hours of morning and evening while on the pillars we perceive large male figures in a sitting posture representing the defense of the country and mining the work of herr keller of frankfort the pillars are crowned by groups of sculpture representing the honeymoon travel and instruction in traveling the one modeled by a c rumpf and the other by friedrich schierholz of frankfort the whole edifice is fire proof scarcely any wood having been used in its erection the hall as well as the other parts of the building are heated by steam and lighted by electricity the whole cost of the structure amounted to about 8500000illustrirte zeitung the commercial exchange paris at the beginning of the year 1881 the committee on finances of the common council of paris received a petition from the central committee of the syndical chambers asking for the establishment of an official exchange for merchandise and commercial transactions for the especial use of parisian commerce to this petition was added a project of organization which proposed the appropriation of the grain market with a clearing of the approaches the paris chamber of commerce had likewise been for a long time contemplating the establishment of a merchandise exchange and was studying the practical means of organizing it called upon to decide the common council at its session of may 28 1881 decreed that an official merchandise exchange for the commerce of paris should be organized and that the grain market or any other place considered favorable by the administration should be appropriated desirous of aiding in carrying out this decree the chamber of commerce offered its services to the city it proposed to take upon itself the responsibility of organizing and managing the exchange and of borrowing the money necessary for converting the grain market into a merchandise exchange and for clearing the approaches and opening louvre street the study of this project soon became connected by reason of the proximity of the places with the one having for its object the enlarging of the central markets and the construction of two pavilions to complete them it was recognized that it would be of interest to make the appropriation necessary for the enlarging of the markets and to unite the two operations after many vicissitudes this project received the approval of the common council illustration fig 1external view of the commercial exchange of paris the contract for the work was given on the 2d of march 1886 to mr blondel the well known architect let us now see how the contract has been followed out the grain market was built in 1767 upon the site of the hotel of soissons of this nothing was preserved but the astronomical tower of catherine de medicis which still remains the central part of the market left free was soon covered with a wooden framework which was destroyed by fire in 1802 this was then replaced by the architect brunet with an iron cupola covered with sheet copper this market was designed for the reception of the grain and flour necessary to supply the city but was soon supplanted by public granaries and then by general stores it afterward became a depot in which grain and flour brokers received merchandise from shippers in order to effect a sale of it the abolition of the factorat gave it its last blow let us examine the transformations made by mr blondel in the old structure he began by excavating under the entire extent of the market a basement 13 ft in depth the old foundations of the circular walls which are more than 6 ft thick and which are extremely solid extend to a depth of about 2 ft beneath the surface the ceiling of the basement in the annular part between the walls is formed of large t iron girders resting upon the circular walls these support transverse girders which in turn support the floor irons the flooring of the hall is formed of ordinary floor irons assembled upon large girders which are supported here and there by cast iron columns under this flooring there is a second one leaving a free space of about ten inches in which will be placed the tubes serving for ventilation to these pipes will be joined vertical ones debouching in the flooring of the hall the old dome did not have apertures enough and the skylight even was not transparent and so the lighting of the hall was very defective the mode of covering the dome was therefore completely modified the copper was removed and upon the old framework was laid a wooden framework to which will be nailed laths designed to receive a slate roof the slate will not extend to the summit of the dome but will leave above it a spherical cap which will be glazed and through which the light will enter the hall in abundance illustration fig 2internal view of the exchange in the basement will be installed the ventilating and heating apparatus another part of the basement will be occupied by the dynamo machines that are to furnish the electric light another part will receive the bake ovens that belong to the laboratory of the committee on grain and flour the rest of the basement will be rented the central part will probably be converted into a cold room for the preservation of early fruit and vegetables on the ground floor we find in the first place the rooms that the contractor is to furnish gratuitously for post office telegraph and telephones and to licensed brokers and especially a hall of superb dimensions designed for the public sale of raw materials by the brokers what remains of the ground floor will be devoted to offices looking at once upon the hall and viarones street the entresol and the two stories will be connected by several staircases the various stories will also be reached through elevators a circular balcony will extend around the hall at the level of each of the two upper stories these will be occupied by offices smaller than those on the ground floor which will some of them get their light from the hall and others from the street a part of the second story will be reserved for the service of the committees on grain and flour who as experts are called upon to determine to what type each specimen is to be referred from the exchange let us pass to the annexes the one on the right is destined to become a large hotel for the accommodation of provincial and foreign merchants the one to the left will be a tenement house with shops and apartments along each of these annexes on viarones street will extend a covered colonnadeabstract from le genie civil a basis from which to calculate charges for electric motor service1 footnote 1 read before the electric light convention new york august 1888 the theoretical side of the electric motor question has been very ably presented to and discussed by this association but thus far the practical side has been somewhat neglected it will be my purpose in this paper if possible to show that there is a general average controlling the use of machinery which it will be safe for electric light and power companies to follow in making their charges for motor service rather than adopt an arbitrary price per horse power regardless of the character of service required of the motor i have arranged what might be called a power curve representing the approximate average actual service in electric motors in connection with the several classes of work represented in the list accompanying the diagram this curve is calculated on motors which are only of sufficient capacity in each case to carry the full load if the motor should be larger than is necessary to drive the machinery the percentage of actual service will of course drop below that shown in the diagram by adopting a basis of averages which shall be general among members of this association the charges for a constant horse power of current may vary with the circumstances of its first cost in each case but the general classification of motor service may be a comparatively fixed rule i am not prepared to say that this is the best plan to follow but respectfully submit the following as a possible solution of the frequently asked question how shall we charge for electric motor service exhaust fans first on the list of power consumers is the exhaust fan taking it in average use there are however circumstances under which its use will be limited to as low as 70 or 75 per cent of its contract hours of service as for instance in a dining room it may be cut out except during meal hours or entirely cut out on cool days in places of this description however its contract use is usually limited to five or six months in the year and other than electric power is by circumstances of first cost and inconvenience but a feeble competitor the first four applications on the accompanying list viz exhaust fans blowers ceiling fans and fan outfits are all more or less subject to the foregoing conditions and therefore currents supplied to motors for these purposes command the maximum price per horse power one important feature in the installation of ceiling fans is the countershafting to the motor in one recent case we had a complaint from a customer that the half horse power motor sent him would not drive the ceiling fans and that the motor must be defective and should he return it for repairs we immediately sent a representative to find out the difficulty which was found as is usual in such cases in the countershafting or rather the want of it the 3 in pulley on the motor was connected to a 6 in pulley on the line shafting the rated speed of the motor was 2000 revolutions and had it been able to develop this speed would have driven the line shaft 1000 revolutions and the fans a relative speed to accomplish this would probably require a motor of 3 or 4 h p the line shafting driving ceiling fans usually runs about 75 revolutions to give this speed on the line shaft with a rated speed of 2000 on the 3 in pulley of the motor would require a countershaft with a 24 in pulley belted to the motor on the same countershaft should be a 5 in pulley belted to a 15 or 16 in pulley on the line shaft fully threefourths of the trouble found in electric motors arises from improper shafting and belting the average make of 30 in exhaust wheel a h p motor should drive about 400 revolutions say then the speed of the motor is 2000 and the pulley 3 in it would require a 15 in pulley on the fan to do the work a 36 in wheel requires 1 h p to develop the same speed if the motor speed is 1800 the pulley 4 in it would require an 18 in pulley on the fan to do the work these are the most popular sizes of exhaust wheels the next application on the list open tank elevator pumps commands the highest price for current per h p in the motor of any elevator application the methods of operating the open tank hydraulic elevators in question are undoubtedly familiar to you all instead of the usual steam pump a power pump of some approved design is substituted and connected to the motor by suitable countershafting to give the required revolutions at the pump the regulation of the motor in this case should be controlled by the position of water in the lower tank as in the case of the steam pump and in this connection let me suggest the necessity of great care both in installation and insulation on all installations in basements and cellars or elsewhere where there is the slightest tendency to dampness raise the motor off the floor on a suitable frame or stand and build around it on all sides of possible approach a low platform using glass insulators as legs or standards to support it so arrange this that the motor or its connections cannot be reached except when standing on this insulated platform and the liability to a shock will be reduced to the difference of potential between the terminals of the machine to return to the subject let us take for an illustration an elevator using 120 gallons of water per trip and consuming one minute in making its entire up trip or about two per round trip the lower tank or water supply is on a level with the pump the upper tank is 70 ft above the pump and in the piping to the upper tank are five elbows for each elbow add 2 ft to the elevation or an approximate total elevation of 80 ft 120 gallons gives us 9600 foot gallons this amount would be required every two minutes if the elevator was in absolutely constant operation or 4800 foot gallons per minute 8 gives us 40800 foot pounds this we must at least double to allow for friction in pump shafting etc making 81600 foot pounds or about 2 h p say 3 required in the motor this class of elevator is confined almost entirely to passenger use therefore the service required of the motor is much more constant and the margin between the h p hours contracted for and the h p hours of actual service much smaller than in any other elevator use excepting possibly the services in connection with pressure tank elevators in the more popular office buildings in this case we have a maximum average use of 80 and instances such as the hotels small office buildings etc where the service will not exceed 60 of the contract h p hours in order however that the electric light company shall derive the greatest benefit from this inconstant service the installation and wiring should be the best and only the most approved and economical apparatus employed the next application on our list pressure tank pumps in connection with elevators represents a somewhat smaller percentage of h p hours of actual service in the motor as compared with the possible h p hours than in the case of an open tank pump in case of the pressure tank the water reserve is usually limited and the motor therefore must be equal to the continuous operation of the elevator at maximum load taking this fact into consideration and the circumstances of elevator use being about the same in this case as in the case of the open tank elevator we have a greater ratio of difference between the possible or contract h p hours in the motor and the h p hours of actual service the maximum average use being about 70 per cent to 75 per cent and the minimum as low as 35 per cent to 40 per cent depending of course on the character of building in which the elevator is employed or the character of service in calculating the size of motor required on an elevator of this description a very convenient fact to remember is that every pound of pressure per square inch is equivalent to lifting water about 23 ft or about 230 ft per 100 pounds pressure by reducing the required pressure to a relative lift in feet and knowing the amount of water required by the elevator per minute the motor calculation becomes the same as in case of the open tank elevator the same allowances being made for friction etc as in the first case the regulation of the motor in this case should be accomplished by the conditions of pressure in the pressure tank as is the case with a steam pump employed in this service the next application of importance on the list is sewing machines in the tests i have been able to make on this class of work i have obtained some singular results one item of importance is the fact that the single thread machines which are lightest running consume the most power in operating paradoxical as this may seem it is easily explained as a rule this class of machine is used on light work such as shirts ladies underwear etc and operated at a higher speed than any other class of machine at equal speed the volts consumed on a single thread machine as compared with a shuttle machine is about as 2 to 3 in average commercial use however the positions are reversed and the ratio of volts consumed in the single thread as compared with the shuttle machine is about as 5 to 3 to double the speed on a sewing machine requires about 2 times the power the difference in volts consumed on the different makes of sewing machines is so small that we may disregard it entirely as well as the character of work done by the machine for the heavier the work the slower the speed and more frequent and longer stops on the machine thus keeping the average volts per operator about constant in all cases this leaves the speed in stitches per minute at the sewing machine the factor from which we must calculate the power required in a sewing machine plant to illustrate this i will give you the record of two cases which are about the average case no 1 is a shop in which are 30 sewing machines connected to a 2 h p motor at the time tests were made there were but twenty operators at work leaving ten idle machines the entire shafting however being in operation the class of goods manufactured in this shop is a cheap grade of cotton and wool pants rather heavy goods to sew a volt meter across the terminals of the motor gave the following readings with the current at 9 amperes minimum 90 volts maximum 148 volts average 119 which gives us a minimum average per operator of 45 volts and a maximum average of 74 volts or a general average of 59 volts per operator this motor was driving the shafting for 30 machines and as the average operators employed the year round will not exceed 75 per cent of the shop capacity it will i think be entirely fair to estimate the average volts per machine rather than per operator as the user of the motor has contracted for power sufficient to drive his entire plant in this case then we have a minimum average of 3 volts per machine and a maximum of 49 volts or a general average of say 4 volts per machine a 2 horse motor of 82 per cent efficiency with 9 amperes of current will require about 200 volts to develop 2 actual h p two hundred volts therefore is what the electric light company contract to deliver while in reality they deliver only 129 volts or 60 percent or a minimum average of 90 volts or 45 per cent of the power contracted for these machines were making about 1200 stitches per minutean average of 4 volts per 100 stitches case no 2 is a shop in which there are 32 machines running about 1200 stitches each being supplied with an individual motor of 18 h p capacity and the class of goods manufactured being mens summer clothing such as white duck vests flannel coats and vests etc the duck from which these vests are made being about as hard work on a sewing machine as can be found in this shop were 24 operators at work the maximum volts in this case were 116 and the minimum 40 or general average of but 78 volts or about 2 volts per machine with 4 more operators than in the first case in which we had an average of 119 volts this shop has been paying the electric light company 32 per month for more than a year which is the price the company charge for current for a 4 h p motor which approximates 400 volts the company contracts to deliver this gives us a minimum average use of but 10 per cent and a maximum of 29 per cent with a general average of 19 per cent in other words the company is saving in this shop the price of a 18 h p motor each month besides making a profit on the volts actually delivered on a contract for three years the electric light company would be money in pocket if they would present the customer with 30 small motors charging him 1 per month per motor for current rather than let him buy a 2 h p motor to operate the same machines with the necessary shafting at a charge of 18 per month for current taking this average in case no 2 of 2 volts per machine from a 50 light machine we could run not less than 900 sewing machines or about 18 to the arc lamp at 1 per month per machine an income of 900 per month would be derived from a 50 light machine without any lamp expenses such as carbons repairs on lamps globes etc on the average in case no 1 of 4 volts per machine we could operate but about 562 say 600 machines divided up in shops of 30 machines and a 2 h p motor to each shop we would have 20 two h p motors at a charge of 18 per month each we would have an earning capacity of but 360 per month from the same 50 light machine this is but one page from the thus far unwritten history of the much maligned small motor still the question is frequently asked can we sell current for 1 per month for a small motor driving a sewing machine and make a profit as a matter of fact 50 cents per month for small motors driving sewing machines yields a better profit to the company supplying the current than 10 per month per h p in large motors to drive the same machines besides the immense advantage which the small motors possess of keeping the circuit in much better balance the fluctuations due to the stopping and starting of large motors being at times a serious matter one electric light company making rather a specialty of these small machines rent the motor and supply the current for 125 per month per sewing machine and report that at this price the motor pays them a better percentage of profit than their lamps this company have some 200 small motors on their circuits a more striking illustration of the advantages to the electric light company in the subdivision of power into the smallest possible units it would be hard to find there is a difference in efficiency of from 15 to 20 per cent in these two sizes of motors but this difference is fully lost to the large motor in driving the shafting and the small motor still has the advantage of being out of circuit entirely when the machine it is driving is stopped there is scarcely a manufacturing industry which does not possess its busy and dull seasons this means that in no industry will over 75 per cent of the machines or machinery employed be in average operation the entire shafting in the shops must be kept in operation the entire year often for less than 50 per cent of the machinery subdivide these same shops into as many small units as possible and the current necessary to operate the shafting for this idle machinery will be saved besides the saving from frequent stops while the machinery is in active use to return again to the list the next two applications picture frame manufacturers and moulding manufacturers are very similar their busy seasons as a rule are in the spring and fall and also follow closely any activity in house building in the case of the larger manufacturers in this line a maximum average of 75 per cent will possibly be reached but probably never exceeded in the case however of the picture dealer who has a small shop in which he makes picture frames and mouldings to order the actual service of the motor will fall as low as 25 per cent or 30 per cent of its contract hours one case in our experience the actual service having reached this low average a fair general average in this class of works would be about 60 per cent the next application nickel and silver platers and buffers are good contract customers as a rule one case in our experience showing but an average use of 20 per cent of the contract horse power hours this however is probably an exceptional case and as near as we can estimate on this class of work the actual motor service will not exceed in any case 60 per cent of the contract hours a fair average being probably 45 or 50 per cent the next two applications printing presses on news and job work are probably met with more frequently than any other on exclusively news work the instances where the motor is in service more than 3 or 4 hours is rare it is however usual in news offices to find two or more job presses if the newspaper printed happens to be a morning paper the hours of news work are usually between 12 midnight and 4 oclock in the morning the job work being done through the day i have in mind a case of this description in the shop is one cylinder press and three job presses connected to a 2 h p motor this motor is on an incandescent circuit of 110 volts to develop its rated power at 110 volts would require about 16 amperes in the motor an ampere motor in series with the motor while running off the morning paper with only the cylinder press in operation stood at 12 amperes for 3 hours this load was practically constant when it was thrown off entirely this gave on the night service but 30 per cent of the contract hours this motor required 5 amperes to drive the shafting and but 8 amperes or one h p to drive the three job presses with the cylinder press off here then is but a 50 per cent use if the presses be used constantly there are however many days when they are comparatively idle 30 to 40 per cent therefore is a very safe estimate of the maximum use of this motor on the day circuit or had the motor been a 1 h p which would have been sufficient to drive the job presses the use would be 60 to 80 per cent of the contract hours probably not above 60 per cent all printing offices will probably come within this range unless the motor be larger than is necessary to do the work machine shops doing principally lathe work as a matter of course use a larger percentage of their contracted power than shops doing lathe and bench work with the same hands in no case will the service of the motor exceed 65 or 70 per cent of its contract use for machine shops like sewing machine shops will never average over 75 per cent of the shop capacity for operators the year round the average especially in the case of a shop doing much bench work will fall as low as 40 per cent the driving of laundry machinery which is our next application usually proves a profitable contract according to reports this fact arises from the intermittent use of the machinery the heaviest service on motor will probably be found during the early part of each week with a general falling off in work during the summer months while the patrons of the laundry are away at the seashore or in the mountains in this application therefore a 75 per cent service would probably be an exception with probably many instances where the service would fall below 50 per cent the next application model and pattern makers are small users of power as their occupation requires a large proportion of hand work 50 per cent service in the motor will be found a fair average maximum use with instances as low as 20 or 25 per cent the next application direct power or belt elevators is another application frequently met the average service in the motor is also much smaller than in any other elevator application let us suppose a case of the familiar grip connected to the ordinary hand hoist with a lifting capacity of 2000 pounds in this case the motor is in use only going up and the usual brake is used in coming down connected to this elevator in the loft of the building we have a 5 h p motor wired to a cutout on the ground floor we will call the lift 45 feet and the time consumed per trip 1 minute we will allow 60 full trips of the elevator at full load at 2000 lb per trip each day this would approximate 10 car loads of merchandise handled by the elevator which is certainly above the average this motor we will say is on a ten hour day circuit its possible horse power hours therefore would be 5 h p for 10 hours or 50 h p hours per day 60 trips of 1 minute each gives us exactly 1 hours service of the full 5 h p or 5 h p hours to drive the shafting only while the elevator is coming down or idle would require about 150 volts or 1 h p and if this was in constant operation the balance of the day 9 hours its total use on shafting would be 13 h p hours which added to the 5 h p hours gives us a grand total of 18 h p hours or 37 per cent of the contract hours if however the user of the motor avails himself of the cutout box and cuts the current out when the motor is not in use the average use would drop to 20 or 25 per cent instead of 37 per cent in the case of a direct power passenger elevator the use might possibly run up to 60 per cent but this would be exceptional coffee mills will average from 40 to 60 per cent of their contract hours manufacturing jewelers about the same while retail jewelers will run as low as 25 per cent ice cream freezers will not average over 25 per cent but as the contract season in this case is usually short they should be rated at least a 50 per cent basis except possibly in cases where the customer pays the cost of installation and wiring which is usual in these cases a dentist is one of the smallest of power users so small in fact that if every one in a city were connected with a circuit the load from this cause would never be felt we will however put them down at from 10 to 20 per cent the optician uses a motor to turn his grind stones and its use in this case will average from 20 to 30 per cent the last application on the listchurch organsuses only from 10 to 20 per cent of the contract service these are of course but few of the very many applications of the electric motor and if as i trust the possible subsequent discussion of this general plan may establish a basis for rating motor applications not only will the objects of this paper be obtained but a question of considerable annoyance now existing between the motor man and the electric light or power company will be solved in conclusion mr chairman i beg to suggest that the supply and rates of charge for electric power have become of sufficient importance to this association to be represented by a permanent committee whose duty it should be to obtain from the different members of the association as far as possible their experience in the supply of power in such manner and form as shall be deemed by the committee best suited to the wants of this association some abyssinian customs illustration woman with undressed hair illustration abyssinian hair dresser abyssinian women have an extraordinary head

exploring mounds in ohio this season under the direction of the national bureau of ethnology says mr gerard fowke in a paper prepared for science i used great care in the examination of one mound in pike county in order to ascertain if possible the exact method of its construction the mound was built upon the site of a house which had probably been occupied by those whose skeletons were found the roof had been supported by side posts and at intervals by additional inner posts the outer posts were arranged in pairs a few inches apart then an interval of about three feet then two more and so on they were all about eight inches in diameter and extended from two and a half to three feet into the ground except one a few feet from the center which went down fully five feet all the holes were filled with the loose dark dirt which results from decay of wood a few contained fragments of charcoal burned bones or stone but no ashes nor was the surrounding earth at all burned around the outside a trench from three to four feet wide and from eighteen to twenty inches deep had been dug to carry away the water which fell from the roof near the middle of this house which measured about forty feet from side to side a large fire had been kept burning for several hours the ashes being removed from time to time the ash bed was elliptical in form measuring about thirteen feet from east to west and five from north to south under the center of it was a hole ten inches across and a foot deep filled with clean white ashes in which was a little charcoal packed very hard at the western end on the south side or farthest from the center of the house was a mass of burned animal bones ashes and charcoal this was continuous with the ash bed though apparently not a part of it the bones were in small pieces and were no doubt the remains of a funeral feast or offering after the fire died down rude tools were used to dig a grave at the middle of the house it measured ten feet in length from east to west by a little more than six in breadth the sides were straight slanting inward with rounded corners the bottom was nearly level fourteen inches deep but slightly lower at the center over the bottom ashes had been thinly sprinkled and on these a single thickness of bark had been laid the sides had been lined with wood or bark from two to four inches thick when this was done two bodies were placed side by side in the grave both extended at full length on the back with heads directly west one judging from the bones and condition of the teeth was a woman of considerable age she was placed in the middle of the grave her right arm lay along the side the left hand being under the pelvic bones of the other skeleton this was apparently of a man not much if any past maturity the right arm lay across the stomach the left across the hips this skeleton was five feet ten inches in length the other five feet four inches the space between the first skeleton and the south side of the grave was covered with the ashes that had been removed from the fire beginning at the feet in a thin layera mere streakthey gradually increased in thickness toward the head where they were fully six inches thick the head was embedded in them they extended to the end of the grave reaching across its entire width and coming almost but not quite in contact with the other head a considerable amount of the burned bones lay in the southwestern corner of the grave and the ashes along this part curved up over the side until they merged into what remained of the ash bed this had extended to the west slightly beyond the end of the grave as the earth removed from the grave had been thrown out on every side the bodies were in a hole that was nearly two feet deep the next step was to cover them there was no sign of bark cloth or any other protecting material above them they were covered with a black sandy earth which must have been brought from the creek not far distant this was piled over them while wet or at least damp enough to pack firmly as it required the pick to loosen it and besides was steeper on the sides than dry dirt would have been it reached just beyond the grave on every side and was about five and a half feet high or as high as it could be conveniently piled so far all was plain enough but now another question presented itself that puzzled me not a little and that was what became of the house that there had been one the arrangement of the numerous post holes plainly showed but the large earth mound above the tumulus or grave was perfectly solid above the original surface giving not the slightest evidence that the posts or any part of the house had ever reached up into it i incline to the opinion that the great fire near the middle of the house had been made from the timbers composing it that the upper timbers had been torn down and the posts cut off at the surface the whole being a kind of votive offering to the dead at any rate it is plain that a house stood there until the time the mound was built and it was not there afterward for the purpose of covering the grave sand was brought from a ridge a short distance away there was no stratification either horizontal or curving earth had been piled up first around the black mass forming the grave mound and then different parties had deposited their loads at convenient places until the mound assumed its final conical arrangement the lenticular masses through almost the whole mound showed that the earth had been carried in skins or small baskets the completed mound was thirteen feet high and about one hundred feet in diameter two and a half feet above the original surface was an extended skeleton head west it lay just east of the black earth over the grave sixteen feet south of the grave on the original surface and within the outer row of post holes were two skeletons extended heads nearly west it would seem that the flesh was removed before burial as the bones were covered with a dull red substance which showed a waxy texture when worked with a knife blade no relics of any description were found with any of the skeletons but a fine copper bracelet was picked up in a position that showed it was dropped accidentally a chinese imperial cemetery by lieut hon h n shore rn some ten miles north of peking in a valley where silence reigns supreme is situated one of the most remarkable and imposing burial grounds in the world here nestling along the slopes of the inclosing mountains which form a natural amphitheater are a series of vast mausoleums where lie buried the emperors of the last chinese dynasty this was the celebrated ming dynasty which continued from 1366 till 1644 when after a sanguinary struggle lasting for twentyseven years it succumbed to the manchu tartars who under the title of the tsin dynasty have occupied the throne to the present time illustration the avenue it has been very truly remarked of the chinese that they have probably expended more labor over their public works than any other nation of antiquity and assuredly when any great national work is undertaken however rare the occurrence it is invariably carried out on a scale of unparalleled magnificence it was therefore only fitting that the tombs containing the emperors of their own native dynasty should be constructed on a scale commensurate with the wealth and extent of the empire whose destinies they swayed for nigh 300 years the valley contains altogether thirty tombs each of which stands in the center of a wooded inclosure several acres in extent surrounded by a high wall with an imposing gateway the largest and most celebrated is that of yenwang whose body reposes in a lofty building resting on an immense brick mound pierced by a slanting tunnel whose curious acoustic properties entitle it to be ranked as a whispering gallery in front of the mausoleum is a hall measuring 220 ft long by over 90 ft broad which contains the emperors tablet the roof of this building is supported in the center by thirtytwo pillars composed of single trees 60 ft high and over 11 ft in circumference which are said to have been brought from corea the transport of these enormous blocks must have been a work of no ordinary difficulty more especially in the absence of good roads according to the description of a missionary who recently witnessed the moving of a somewhat similar object it would seem that the chinese followed the practice of the ancient egyptians as depicted on their tombs and in a country where labor is abundant such a method would be natural an inscription near the entrance states that this tomb among others was repaired by the emperor kienlung who reigned in the early part of last century but like every other ancient building in china at the present day it is fast going to ruin for the want of ordinary care large trees being permitted to grow out of the very roof itself although there are several attendants residing in the inclosure while doubtless certain officials are entrusted with the care of this splendid mausoleum and draw their salaries regularly but laisser faire is the order of the day everywhere in the neighborhood of peking and nothing is ever repaired nowadays by any chance illustration the road to peking a part of the original scheme which shows the magnificent scale on which the whole thing was planned and executed was a fine paved road carried over streams and rivers by marble bridges and extending the whole way from peking a distance of ten miles on approaching the valley where the tombs repose the road passes under three handsome pailaus or gateways and then through one of the most imposing avenues that was ever constructed this avenue which extends for about twothirds of a mile is flanked on either side with colossal stone figures at intervals of about 50 yards representing men and animals in the following order six men apparently warriors and priests in pairs standing four horses four griffins four elephants four camels and four lions the first pair in each set standing the second recumbent as the chinese have never achieved any great distinction in the art of sculpture the representations of animal life are needless to say somewhat caricatured but the conception of the whole was magnificent and the effect of this long avenue of colossal figures standing in silent grandeur is as impressive as anything that ever emanated from the genius of the chinese raceill naval and military magazine dyspepsia its causes and prevention dyspepsia has once been called the american sickness and although this may be a slander against which many of the inhabitants of our great republic might protest bad digestion is a disease frequent enough among us to justify us in considering its causes and in ascertaining by what means this curse of modern civilization may be avoided a frenchman under the title la dyspepsie des gens desprit in the paris revue scientifique of august 18 shows how utterly disregarded are the sanitary rules at the dinners of well bred people in france and an american lady in a recent edition of a well known new york daily humoristically enlarges upon the offenses committed against health by persons of her own sex while dining in the largest city of the united states speaking of the lunch of shop girls up town the contributor to the american paper deprecates the fact that the young american girls employed in business houses at luncheon time live almost entirely on sweets and food that renders little or no nourishment rather than procuring at the same cost a repast which though perhaps less dainty would be far better for their constitution left to herself the writer says miss saleslady pretty and refined though she may be day after day and day after day keeps her temper and waits on her customers leaning on a slim luncheon of pie and tea it is sweet and nice pleaded one girl to me the other day and it goes so much further than anything else not further than bread and milk i urged and it is surely not half as good for your complexion oh but the other ladies would laugh at me well if they saw me eating bread and milk for my luncheon i think myself a bit of something light and nice like eclairs or a charlotte russe is ever so much more ladylike and nice heaven save the mark what sort of flesh and blood do they make to put on the slender bones of a growing girl how will they stand by her when perhaps she leaves the shop and chooses the life of wife and mother the answer is easy when the pieeating cookyfeeding girl gets married put it down in your note book one more dyspeptic peevish woman entered the lists of the unlovely the contributor to the french review although also condemning the careless choice of food more especially points out the evil consequences of eating too hastily and though m julva directs his attack chiefly against the gens desprit ie the well bred people of france who neglect the rules of health for politeness sake his words apply equally well to the american business man who sacrifices his health during luncheon to the almighty dollar the feverish activity of modern life he says induces many people to abridge the duration of their repast and particularly luncheon is taken too hastilya practice the danger of which as a cause of dyspepsia cannot be overrated this practice might not be so dangerous if during the short time which we dedicate to our midday meal we would at least imitate the habit of the japanese whom politeness requires to be absolutely silent while eating when they like a certain dish they express their satisfaction by graceful gestures addressed to their host but they think it would offend him if they open their mouth for anything else except eating watch on the other hand one of our lawyers at luncheon he has just dismissed his last client at the moment when he should be already at court and in order not to be too late he has to lunch in double quick time he has to eat his viands without having time to masticate them and he swallows his big pieces washing them down with several glasses of wine and water and hastens to his carriage almost without giving himself time to breathe in order not to miss his call look at a parisian dining in town french politeness forbids him to be silent like the japanese and also requires of him not to speak with his mouth full of food and if this were not enough french gallantry commands him to serve the ladies first so that just about when they have finished he may commence to eat in addition to this if he does not want to appear ill bred he must reply to all their questions which he would not be able to do if he did not gulp down his morsels unchewed what wonder then that most men have to suffer from eating dinner in such a manner while all discomfort could be avoided if the viands were served to one guest after the other in succession we dont want to exaggerate there are privileged stomachs which can stand all that but there are many to which halfmasticated food is a real poison the unconscious dyspeptic constitutes an extremely frequent variety dyspeptics rarely complain of suffering from the stomach many of them will even say to you that their stomach is excellent but let us remember the old fable of menenius agrippa the whole organism suffers when the stomach is ill treated premature calvity baldness some eruptions of acne pustules of the skin a slight dyspnoea difficulty in breathing when mounting stairs a blush of heat on the cheeks a quarter of an hour after luncheon a violent craving for smoking after the repast a feeling of sleepiness which however quickly fades toward ten oclock in the evening little inclination to work during the first hours after awakening in the morning all these symptoms or any part of them show that you have before you a candidate of the disease known as bloating of the stomach or the gout according to the wise enumeration of moliere who was evidently prompted by renaudot such a person begins with bradypepsia slow digestion then suffers from dyspepsia bad digestion afterward from apepsia indigestion and later lyentery a lax or diarrhea in which food is discharged only half digested and at the last the vicious circle is often completed by obesity uric affections of the liver or bladder and all the other diseases belonging to that class unfortunately we are still far from the time when the public will appreciate that prevention is better than cure perhaps this fundamental principle of health will be honored during the 20th century at present it certainly is not meanwhile those who have ruined their health by modern city life take recourse for their cure to a holiday hasten to places where they find mineral waters or try laxatives or milk diet to improve their condition they wish to do something for their health once or twice a year how much better if they had not been acting against their health all the year round it is extremely difficult to teach our people to eat healthily you will find no difficulty to persuade them to take medicine people have always time to swallow a pill but you will certainly have trouble to teach them to chew with leisure how many people who find time every year to spend the season at vichy will tell you it is quite impossible for them to spend five minutes more every day at luncheon time and nevertheless they would regain these few minutes a day with interest if they would avoid that host of maladies which will stop them one day in the midst of their occupations i have seen a good many of my clients getting entirely rid of their rheumatic pains and gout and ceasing to suffer from sleepless nights by observing the following simple rules in order to chew meat convenientlyand this is one of the main pointsone must accustom ones self never to mix meat and bread in the same mouthful take a small mouthful chew it about thirty times then swallow that part which has been reduced to pulp and so on until all has been masticated in doing this you will soon find out that roasted and broiled beef or mutton requires a longer trituration than boiled meats or stews you will also perceive that fish is more easily masticated than meat and you will finally understand why certain dyspeptics are forced to limit their food to fish eggs and milk diet in fact milk diet serves no other purpose than to furnish a perfectly digestible nourishment one of the indirect and unforeseen benefits of a careful mastication is that people gradually become accustomed to be satisfied with a comparatively small quantity of food for as slow chewing is always more or less tedious those who observe this rule soon cease to be great eaters and also learn quickly to accustom themselves to another very important rule viz to drink moderately while eating two glasses of liquid will then quite suffice for a person who would drink four if he ate his viands swallowing them down without chewing many obese dyspeptics when they once commence to masticate carefully and to take liquid moderately while eating lose weight with an astonishing rapidity and become cured of the bloating of the stomach without being finally obliged to have recourse to the rigorous dry diet of prof bouchard wine and water the french national drink is an extremely frequent and very often misunderstood cause of dyspepsia a good many people would enjoy excellent health if they were satisfied with pure water that favorite drink of the aged it is quite perplexing sometimes to see at the same table three neighbors drinking at their dinner the one wine the other beer and the third tea how much better would it be if people instead of choosing their habitual drink according to the place that they come from would select it more with regard to their individual constitution i know many who after having for fifty years quietly ignored the fact have come to the recognition that for them wine even if diluted with much water is absolutely hurtful and who by giving it up and by taking pure water tea or cider to which prof c attributes great success in his practice instead have got rid of their ailments almost as if by enchantment in conclusion i should like to say a word with regard to salt this panacea of arthritic persons persons suffering from arthritis swelling of the joints as in gout for many years i have been laboring under the wrong impression that salt is placed on the table merely for the purpose of salting boiled eggs which the cook cannot salt in advance great mistake the wisdom of nations has discovered that there are people for whom a great quantity of salt is a necessity and that there are others who would become ill if they were to eat viands that are much salted the salt cellar is there in order to enable every one to salt his food according to his own requirements many people are led by their natural instinct to salt their viands in a proportion to suit them but there are others among them above all the well bred persons previously mentioned who treat eating with disdain and for whom the whole attraction of a repast is the charm of conversation and to them the idea of having recourse to the salt cellar never occurs whether salt is needed in order to add acid to the gastric juice or whether it has an antiseptic action in the digestive channel i do not know certain however it is that it possesses very appreciable laxative qualities and under its influence those who go to drink the waters at wiesbaden often see their intestinal functions restored to a surprising degree it is just as well however and even better to take ones vichy at home and nothing is more simple than to use ones wiesbaden at home by using the salt cellar the cure may then be completed by distributing over a whole year the thirty warm baths which have to be taken during the season at that watering place the bath at 40 celsius is a real boon for arthritic persons the warmer it is whether salt or not the better it acts in producing an exuberant perspiration and the less is one apt to catch cold when leaving it the above by no means exhausts the vast subject of dyspepsia and arthritis but without ignoring the utility of thermal waters of morning promenades of dry frictions and gymnastics the sufferers should above all be advised to minutely masticate their food to limit the amount of liquids at meal time to use salt which will by no means increase their thirst and in certain cases to abstain entirely from alcoholic drinks those who observe these rules may with impunity dine out although those socalled great dinners where all rules of health are left aside are absolutely baneful for a great number of the inhabitants of our cities a new surgical operation among the matters of interest which were brought before the british medical association at the recent glasgow meeting was an account by mr brudenell carter of a method which he had devised of opening the sheath of the optic nerve behind the eye for the relief of pressure within this sheath and within the cavity of the skull the brain is invested by firm membranes which secrete a certain amount of fluid and are continued down to the eye in the form of a sheath which surrounds the optic nerve and whenever the pressure within the cavity of the skull is increased as by the growth of a brain tumor or even by excess of secretion from the membranes themselves a superabundance of fluid is apt to find its way down the nerve sheath to the level of the eye to subject the optic nerve to injurious pressure and in many cases to destroy the sight it not infrequently happens that the pressure within the brain cavity may be increased by temporary or curable causes which nevertheless continue in action sufficiently long to produce permanent blindness even although the patient may in other respects recover in view of these conditions it was suggested by dr de wecker of paris sixteen or seventeen years ago that it might be possible to open the optic nerve sheath and thus not only to relieve the nerve from pressure and to preserve it from injury but also on account of the position of the eye relatively to the brain cavity to drain the latter by gravitation and to relieve the brain as well as the eye dr de wecker made two endeavors to accomplish this object but he tried to feel his way to the optic nerve without the aid of sight and to incise the sheath by means of an instrument carrying a concealed knife capable of being projected by means of a spring the risks of failure and still more the risks of inflicting irreparable injury upon the nerve were such that he only attempted his operation in two well nigh hopeless cases and only one attempt to follow his example has been recorded mr carters attention was called to the matter last year by a case in which the diminution of pressure within the optic nerve sheath was manifestly desirable and he devised a method of operating by which the sheath could be exposed to view and the object attained with certainty under the guidance of sight at every step of the process he read before the medical society of london last year an account of the first case in which he operated which was successful and he read an account of three more cases at glasgow in one of which the result was negative as far as sight was concerned while in the other two the patients were not only quickly restored to useful vision in one instance from complete in the other from nearly complete blindness but were at the same time relieved or cured of other symptoms such as headache and sickness arising from direct pressure on the brain in his paper at glasgow mr carter claimed for the new operation that it could be performed with certainty and without risk either to life or to any important structure and that it afforded a reasonable prospect of the preservation of sight in many forms of disease in which it is now habitually or frequently lost as in the case of every new operation time and further experience of its effects are required in order to determine the precise limits of its usefulness in the discussion which followed the paper mr bickerton of liverpool said that in consequence of reading the account of mr carters first case he had himself performed the operation in two instances in one of which temporary restoration of sight was followed by relapse while in the second the ultimate issue was favorablelondon times putzeys flushing reservoir every sewer is more or less exposed to intermissions in the flow of the water that it leads and the result is a diminution in velocity which leads to deposits of solid material hence the necessity of regularly flushing the sewer with water which removes from the sides the substances that have attached themselves thereto and which without such precaution soon decompose in a word it is necessary that a perfect washing shall be assured and this can be done only by heavy rains or by strong currents of water as regards rain that could not be relied upon and to have a force of men specially charged with the service of washing that would be too costly and so recourse has been had to automatic apparatus illustration flushing reservoir the automatic siphons used for flushing sewers are characterized in general by the presence at the base of the discharge branch of a fixed or movable receiving vessel full of water this vessel has the inconvenience of breaking the effect of the charge and the result is that these apparatus do not render the services that might be expected from them some of these apparatus have valves floats chains pulleys and levers these are still more defective since their operation is delicate the parts of which they are composed easily get out of order and then the reservoir does no more flushing at all a good automatic flushing reservoir must therefore be of the greatest simplicity and its parts must be fixed and strong and the outflow of the water must be rapid and energetic and directly from the reservoir into the sewer in a word its construction should be such that there shall be no need of inspecting it and that its operation be regular the apparatus devised by mr e putzeys director of works of the city of verviers well fulfills the conditions of an excellent flushing reservoir with an automatic siphon the siphon has a double curve but may however have different forms according to the various uses for which it may be employed such as for flushing sewers urinals closets etc the annexed figure represents the apparatus as arranged for flushing a sewer the apparatus operates as follows in the bottom of the branch of the siphon s there is always some water so that during the filling of the reservoir by means of the cock seen in the figure the air is compressed in the branch s to a degree that cannot exceed the pressure of an equal height of water to about double the height of the siphon the reservoir therefore can continue to fill without the water escaping the submersion of the small siphon a b c is less than that of the principal siphon s and it follows that when the level of the reservoir reaches a height equal to b a a new influx however small it be causes the discharge of a few drops of water from the auxiliary siphon a b c which is always full of water at this moment the water that it contains can no longer resist the thrust of the compressed air in the branch of the siphon s and is therefore forced along with the compressed air into the flushing pipe by virtue of the principle of communicating vessels the water of the reservoir tends to resume its level in the interior of the apparatus and it then enters with such impetuosity that the siphon whatever be its dimensions is primed the entire reservoir empties instantaneously and the water flows to open the sewer from the experiments made at verviers by the inventor it results that with a pipe 10 inches in diameter the emptying of a 175 cubic foot reservoir can be effected in 30 seconds we may remark that with this apparatus we obtain the maximum of useful effect seeing that the work developed is represented by the total head of the water diminished simply by losses of charge due to friction in the pipes in other apparatus the loss of charge is much less since the flushing is broken by a receiver putzeys apparatus therefore with a much less discharge of water is capable of producing an effect superior to that of similar apparatus on account of its simplicity and plain character there is no need of precision in the installation of this apparatus and horizontality even is not a sine qua non for its perfect operation the siphon is very easily cleaned and this is a great advantage since it permits of utilizing sewage matter for filling the flushing reservoirchronique industrielle pepsin by a percy smith fic fcs rugby the method usually adopted for estimating the peptonizing power of pepsina porci consists in dissolving 1 to 2 grains in 8 to 12 ounces of water to which 40 to 60 minims of hydrochloric acid has been added 500 to 1000 grains of hardboiled white of egg granulated by rubbing through a wire sieve is immersed in the liquid and the whole kept at 98 to 130 f for four hours when the undissolved albumen is filtered off through muslin and after partial drying is weighed to ascertain the amount dissolved the variable numbers above quoted embrace various formul recommended by different experimenters this method of analysis is excessively crude and untrustworthy when hardboiled white of egg is kept in warm water it absorbs a considerable quantity of that menstruum as much as several units per cent consequently on weighing the residual albumen you may find that the weight is greater instead of less than that with which you started the gain in weight due to absorbed water more than counterbalancing the loss obtaining through solution as has happened with indifferent samples of pepsin then who shall say when by simple air drying the albumen has regained its former condition the enormous quantity of albumen is foreign to the usual habits of the scientific analyst and involves an enormous waste of time in manipulation one trial of this method was enough for me the first modification i adopted consisted in substituting for the large quantity of granulated albumen a single half of the white of an egg in one piece i likewise arranged a check experiment in which the pepsin was omitted other conditions remaining unaltered at the end of four hours the residual pieces of albumen were placed on blotting paper to remove superfluous moisture and weighed the gain in weight of the albumen in the check experiment due to absorbed water was calculated into percentage and the same deducted from the weights of the other portions which had been subjected to the action of various pepsins this although an improvement upon the old method proved likewise unreliable because the water absorbed was not equal in each experiment the albumen which was immersed in acidulated water only quickly dried superficially when placed on blotting paper whereas that which had been acted on by pepsin was rendered glutinous and incapable of being dried in this manner in fact one sample weighed considerably more than it did at starting even after deducting the allowance for water absorbed i next tried much smaller pieces of albumen about 1 cc in hope that complete solution might ensue and a time value be obtained i soon found however that the solubility does not depend upon the mass but upon the surface exposed finally i discarded altogether the use of fresh white of egg and had recourse to dry powdered albumen prepared by drying in a steam oven and levigation in a mortar with this i succeeded in getting accurate comparisons between the digestive powers of various pepsins albumen in this form dissolves with rapidity owing to its state of fine division any remaining undissolved can be filtered off on a counterpoised filter paper and heated in a water oven until absolutely dry it is however unnecessary to do this when two samples only are compared against each other nor is it essential to know the actual weight of albumen employed provided it be the same in each experiment this is insured by placing some on the naked pan of the balance there is no objection to so doing as it is a dry gritty powder and does not adhere to the metal and counterpoising by a similar addition to the other pan let the albumen fall on the center of the filtered liquid avoiding if possible contact with the glass of the beaker it soon sinks and after the lapse of some time a simple inspection will show which is dissolving with the greater rapidity agitation assists solution therefore take the two beakers one in each hand and rotate the contents equally when one sample has dissolved all the albumen it is manifestly superior to the other which has failed to do so in the given time if many samples have to be compared it will be necessary to start with known quantities of albumen and weigh the undissolved residues in the manner above indicated an objection may possibly be raised to this modified method viz that albumen as ingested is not in the form of a dry powder and that we ought to copy as nearly as possible the conditions existing in the stomach to this i would reply that it does not matter in the least to us as analysts what are the conditions which obtain in the stomach since there is no absolute test for pepsin we can only compare one sample against another and that which dissolves the most albumen in the shortest time is taken to be the best another imperfect method of analysis is that employed in the examination of malt extracts for diastase in which a certain weight of extract ought to dissolve a certain weight of starch in ten minutes when if it does so dissolve it the extract is a good one if not it is to be condemned the more correct way is to ascertain the reducing power on fehlings solution before and after digestion with an excess of starch and i intend to say a few words upon this subject on a future occasion when i have ascertained the maximum amount of diastase existing in the best samples of maltthe analyst subterraneous flora and fauna by dr otto zacharias it is generally correct to say that air light and moisture form the chief conditions necessary for the development of organic plant or animal life one of these conditions however namely light is not of equal importance with the two others for modern investigation and the discoveries made during the progress of natural sciences have shown that in the depths of the ocean where an everlasting darkness reigns and where the temperature is extremely low nevertheless a great abundance of animal life is to be found and that there exist living beings not only of the lowest organization but even fishes and crustaceans of very complicated structure all of which thrive without enjoying the slightest ray of light a similar example of animal life in the absence of light is to be found in the fauna of caves and grottoes this was first made known to the world by austrian and american naturalists the well known adelsberg grotto in krain and the gigantic mammoth cave in kentucky furnished much interesting material for a detailed study of the biological conditions of subterraneous animal life it was gradually discovered that in those dark places there existed not only insects spiders crustaceans centipedes worms and snails but also a kind of salamander and fishes but what gave special interest to these discoveries was the fact ascertained by careful study that not all of these beings were gifted with normally developed organs of vision but that in some these organs had undergone a retrograde development while others were entirely blind among the latter the blind fish of the mammoth cave amblyopsis spelacus is especially remarkable because in this being the retrograde development of the organ of vision is accompanied by the production of certain ridges of skin on the body which are endowed with an extreme sensitiveness of touch and which according to a work lately published by professor von leydig are composed of little warts in which the nerve fibers end nature therefore has in this case compensated the amblyopsis for his loss of sight by endowing him with a highly developed organ of feeling a similar phenomenon is to be observed in the blind crab cambaras pellucidus which is also found in the mammoth cave for in this being according to professor von leydig the little warts on the interior feelers which constitute the organ of smell have also received an abnormal development illustration fig 1the semiblind salamander proteus anguineus of the adelsberg grotto in austria better known than the blind fish and the blind crab of kentucky is the proteus anguineus a kind of salamander of a pale rose color endowed with gills and found in the adelsberg grotto in austria fig 1 this amphibium has an eye which lies very deep in the body and is almost overgrown by the skin but this eye is by no means as developed as the organ of vision for instance of the water salamander the triton or of the socalled axolotl for it exists only in a kind of embryonic development and contains neither a vitreous humor nor a lens for the refraction of the rays of light as however the nerve of vision exists it is possible that this salamander may be able to discern in some manner between light and darkness the thinking student when discovering such imperfect organs of sight will naturally ask how the eye of this salamander which is so useless for its real purpose has come into existence and he will weigh the comparative value of the two following explanations it may be assumed that there existed once in the adelsberg grotto a salamander which was absolutely blind and in which in consequence of an innate power of evolution an organ of vision of the lowest kind was gradually formed but to this assumption the objection may be raised at once why nature should have produced an organ of vision in an animal living in a grotto where such an organ is absolutely useless and where such a development would be quite as paradoxical and improbable as for instance the development of fins instead of legs in an animal living on dry land on the other hand one may suppose and this is the more probable explanation that the proteus anguineus is descended from a kind of salamander which possessed perfectly developed eyes in the beginning and that the imperfect organ of vision in the descendants living in the dark caves is the result of gradual degeneration this is the more likely to be true as in many other cases also we find that organs which become useless and cannot be employed have gradually degenerated our common mole furnishes an example its eyes also have become small and are deeply hidden in the muscles although they are by no means as much degenerated as in the proteus anguineus and are still possessed of a lens and a retina their nerve of vision however has become very imperfect and its connection with the brain is interrupted so that the animal for this reason can have no perception of light notwithstanding the above however it is doubtful whether the degeneration and gradual disappearance of the visual organ is in all cases the result of their being no longer employed since there exists in dark caves a kind of beetle the machaerites in which species the female only is blind while the male has a well developed organ of sight in this case it cannot be maintained that the absence of light has been the cause of the blindness of the female beetle because it would have acted equally upon the male nevertheless no other explanation can be found for the blindness the problem therefore is hitherto unsolved of late the investigations of naturalists have been extended to the animal life existing not only in grottoes and caves but also in mines and pits created by the action of man and this has led to many interesting discoveries and remarkable results a naturalist who has especially enlarged our knowledge with regard to the subterraneous fauna and flora is dr robert schneider of berlin who made his studies in the coal mines near waldenburg and altwasser in silesia the salt mines of stassfurt and the metal mines of klausthal in the upper harz mountains illustration fig 2group of pyrenomycetes a species of fungi frequent in the waters of mines a found in the mines of waldenburg b in the browncoal pits near westeregeln c in the dorothea pit at klausthal illustration fig 3 a rhizomorpha canalicularis of hoffmann b club fungus clavaria deflexa of hoffmann found in the mines at klausthal as regards the subterraneous flora dr schneiders investigations resulted in showing that the plants which thrive in the dark regions under ground are those which possess no chlorophyl and are sensitive to light those which vegetate most luxuriantly there are the fungi and among them especially the pyrenomycetes which are frequent in the waters of mines their general aspect is shown in a 480 times magnified form in fig 2 they resemble fine threads of delicate structure and where found are always discovered in great abundance most conspicuous by their shape and considerable size are the rhizomorph fig 3a and they are remarkable not only for their brilliant phosphorescence but also for the peculiar fact that they are only found in places where light does not enter these rhizomorph though this is not easily recognizable from their external appearance also belong to the fungi and are often seen in strings of the length of over a meter and the thickness of a quill spreading out in peculiar branches and hanging down from moist beams in dark places sometimes they grow like seaweed in the water of the mines and in this case they give much embarrassment to the miners because they are apt to obstruct the channels constructed for leading off the superfluous water in the mines of freiberg these rhizomorph exist in great abundance and humboldt already mentions specimens of the length of 4 feet miners in germany call them zwirn thread the student of natural sciences when encountering these peculiar forms of vegetation will ask in how far they are the product of their surrounding circumstances ie of the absence of light or the presence of moisture and in order to find a reply to this question experiments have been made to grow these rhizomorph under different conditions of existence these experiments have shown that from several species of rhizomorph other ordinary fungi can be developed and that the subterraneous specimens therefore may be considered a degeneration and variation of the fungi found above the surface of the ground illustration fig 4 a agaricus myurus of hoffmann a subterranean fungus b himantia villosa a species of rhizomorpha found in the upper harz mountains in fig 4b the himantia villosa is represented a rhizomorpha found in the mines of the upper harz mountains thus showing another form of this vegetable growth though it is difficult as above stated to recognize by their shape the rhizormorph as fungi the origin of the peculiar agaricus myurus of hoffmann fig 4a will be much easier discovered though a retrograde development and degeneration has taken place also in this fungus it still shows however the elements of a regular toadstool only that the stem is much elongated and looks like a thread or a tube while the cap is small and this explains how by gradual degeneration the cap may disappear entirely leaving nothing but a stem as for instance in the case of the clavaria deflexa the club fungus shown in fig 3b in connection with the above it may be well to speak of the fungi constituting the mould which often covers the roof and the doors in the browncoal mines of halle specimens of which are shown in fig 5 illustration fig 5forms of mould fungi found in the browncoal mines near halle a s we now come to the animal life in mines and pits this is mostly represented of course by lower organisms as infusoria and worms thus in the slime on the bottom of the waters in mines several species of amoeb are found which consist of microscopically small animated bodies continually floating about nourishing themselves by absorbing organic matter possessing sensation propagating etc and in fact having actually the qualities of real animal nature further we find in those subterraneous waters a species of the sun infusorium actinophrys which is especially frequent in the mines of klausthal fig 6 shows one of these peculiar little beings also the stylonychia fig 7 is a characteristic inhabitant of those places and always present there illustration fig 6the sun infusorium actinophrys illustration fig 7the rapacious infusorium stylonychia it moves with great rapidity in the water by means of the numerous hairs covering its body can turn quickly in any direction and thus is enabled to catch suddenly the little beings on which it lives and which it hunts for which reason the stylonychia is called the rapacious infusorium the above are organisms which can be seen only through the microscope but the fauna of mines contains also larger organisms though they are not found as regularly and are not as characteristic for those places as the forms mentioned hitherto among these organisms there are several species of worms spiders gnats and above all crustaceans of the lower class the most interesting of the latter is perhaps a variety of the sand flea fig 8gammarus pulex the crustacean found in the pits of mines which is related to the sand flea shows according to dr r schneider a slight degeneration of the organ of sight which has taken place in consequence of its adaptation to the dark places in which this variety of the gammarus pulex is found which can make no use of eyes while the sand flea possesses them fully developed otherwise however the two varieties are almost absolutely alike differing only in some details illustration fig 8the sand flea gammarus pulex from the above the reader will see that breathing in the rosy light as schiller calls it is not an absolutely necessary condition for the existence of organic beings but that life exists everywhere where there is air and moisture and a temperature which is not always below freezing point though even eternal frost does not exclude life entirely as is proved by the existence of the glacier flea showing that even in the icy coverings of the alps life still is possible mephistopheles may therefore well say from water earth and air unfolding a thousand germs break forth and grow in dry and wet and warm and chilly and had i not the flame reserved why really theres nothing special of my own to show leipziger illustrirte zeitung nature timber and some of its diseases1 footnote 1 continued from supplement no 661 page 10558 by h marshall ward ix in the months of april and may the younger needlelike leaves of the scotch pine are occasionally seen to have assumed a yellow tinge and on closer examination this change in color from green to yellow is seen to be due to the development of what look like small orange colored vesicles standing off from the surface of the epidermis and which have in fact burst through from the interior of the leaf fig 31 between these larger orange yellow vesicles the lens shows certain smaller brownish or almost black specks each of the vesicular swellings is a form of fungus fructification known as an cidium and each of the smaller specks is a fungus structure called a spermogonium and both of these bodies are developed from a mycelium in the tissues of the leaf i must employ these technical terms but will explain them more in detail shortly the point to be attended to for the moment is that this fungus in the leaf has long been known under the name of peridermium pini var acicola ie the variety which lives upon the needlelike leaves illustration fig 31to the right is a pair of leaves of the scotch pine with the blisterlike cidia a of peridermium pini var acicola projecting from their tissues these blisters are orange yellow in color and contain spores as shown in fig 33 between the blisters are the minute spermogonia b to the left is a small branch killed at a a a by peridermium pini var corticola the blisterlike yellow cidia of the fungus being very conspicuous reduced after hartig on the younger branches of the scotch pine the weymouth pine the austrian pine and some others there may also be seen in may and june similar but larger bladderlike orange vesicles cidia bursting through the cortex fig 31 and here again careful examination shows the darker smaller spermogonia in patches between the cidia these also arise from a fungus mycelium in the tissues of the cortex whence the fungus was named peridermium pini var corticola it is thus seen that the fungus peridermium pini was regarded as a parasite of pines and that it possessed two varieties one inhabiting the leaves and the other the cortex the varieties were so considered because certain trivial differences were found in the minute structure of the cidia and spermogonia illustration fig 32blisters cidia of peridermium pini var corticola on a branch of the scotch pine some of the cidia have already burst at the apex and scattered their spores b b the others are still intact natural size after hess if we cut thin vertical sections through a leaf and one of the smallest cidia and examine the latter with the microscope it will be found to consist of a mass of spores arranged in vertical rows each row springing from a branch of the mycelium the outermost of these sporesie those which form a compact layer close beneath the epidermisremain barren and serve as a kind of membrane covering the rest fig 33 p it is this membrane which protrudes like a blister from the tissues the hyph of the fungus are seen running in all directions between the cells of the leaf tissue and as they rise up and form the vertical chains of spores the pressure gradually forces up the epidermis of the leaf bursts it and the mass of orange yellow powdery spores protrude to the exterior enveloped in the aforesaid membrane of contiguous barren spores if we examine older cidia it will be found that this membrane bursts also at length and the spores escape similar sections across a spermogonium exhibit a structure which differs slightly from the above here also the hyph in the leaf turn upward and send delicate branches in a converging crowd beneath the epidermis the latter gives way beneath the pressure and the free tips of the hyph constrict off very minute sporelike bodies these minute bodies are termed spermatia and i shall say no more about them after remarking that they are quite barren and that similar sterile bodies are known to occur in very many of the fungi belonging to this and other groups sections through the cidia and spermogonia on the cortex present structures so similar except in minute details which could only be explained by lengthy descriptions and many illustrations that i shall not dwell upon them simply reminding the reader that the resemblances are so striking that systematic mycologists have long referred them to a mere variety of the same fungus now as to the kind and amount of damage caused by the ravages of these two forms of fungus in the leaves the mycelium is found running between the cells fig 33 h and absorbing or destroying their contents since the leaves do not fail the first season and the mycelium remains living in their tissues well into the second year it is generally accepted that it does very little harm at the same time it is evident that if very many leaves are being thus taxed by the fungus they cannot be supplying the tree with food materials in such quantities as if the leaves were intact however the fungus is remarkable in this respectthat it lives and grows for a year or two in the leaves and does not as so many of its allies do kill them after a few weeks it is also stated that only young pines are badly attacked by this form it is rare to find cidia on trees more than twenty years or so old illustration fig 33vertical section through a very young cidium of peridermium pini var acicola with part of the subjacent tissue of the leaf h the mycelium of the parasitic fungus running between the cells of the leaf immediately beneath the epidermis of the leaf the ends of the hyph give rise to the vertical rows of spores b the outermost of which p remain barren and form the membrane of the blisterlike body the epidermis is already ruptured at p by the pressure of the young cidium after k hartig highly magnified much more disastrous results can be traced directly to the action of the mycelium in the cortex the hyph grow and branch between the green cells of the true cortex as well as in the vast tissues beneath and even make their way into the medullary rays and resin canals in the wood though not very deep short branches of the hyph pierce the cells and consume their starch and other contents causing a large outflow of resin which soaks into the wood or exudes from the bark it is probable that this effusion of turpentine into the tissues of the wood cambium and cortex has much to do with the drying up of the parts above the attacked portion of the stem the tissues shrivel up and die the turpentine in the canals slowly sinking down into the injured region the drying up would of course occur if the conducting portions are steeped in turpentine preventing the conduction of water from below the mycelium lives for years in the cortex and may be found killing the young tissues just formed from the cambium during the early summer of course the annual ring of wood etc is here impoverished if the mycelium is confined to one side of the stem a flat or depressed spreading wound arises if this extends all round the parts above must die when fairly thick stems or branches have the mycelium on one side only the cambium is injured locally and the thickening is of course partial the annual rings are formed as usual on the opposite side of the stem where the cambium is still intact or they are even thicker than usual because the cambium there diverts to itself more than the usual share of food substances where the mycelium exists however the cambium is destroyed and no thickening layer is formed from this cause arise cancerous malformations which are very common in pine woods fig 34 illustration fig 34section across an old pine stem in the cancerous region injured by peridermium pini var corticola as shown by the figures the stem was fifteen years old when the ravages of the fungus began to affect the cambium near a the mycelium spreading in the cortex and cambium on all sides gradually restricted the action of the latter more and more at thirty years old the still sound cambium only extended half way round the stemno wood being developed on the opposite side by the time the tree was eighty years old only the small area of cambium indicated by the thin line marked 80 was still alive and soon afterward the stem was completely ringed and dead all the tissues being suffused with resin after hartig putting everything together it is not difficult to explain the symptoms of the disease the struggle between the mycelium on the one hand which tries to extend all round in the cortex and the tree itself on the other as it tries to repair the mischief will end in the triumph of the fungus as soon as its ravages extend so far as to cut off the water supply to the parts above this will occur as soon as the mycelium extends all round the cortex or even sooner if the effusion of turpentine hastens the blocking up of the channels this may take many years to accomplish so far and taking into account the enormous spread of this disastrous disease the obvious remedial measures seem to be to cut down the diseased treesof course this should be done in the winter or at least before the spores comeand use the timber as best may be but we must first see whether such a suggestion needs modifying after learning more about the fungus and its habits it appears clear at any rate however that every diseased tree removed means a source of cidiospores the less probably every one knows the common groundsel which abounds all over britain and the continent and no doubt many of my readers are acquainted with other species of the same genus senecio to which the groundsel belongs and especially with the ragwort senecio jacoba it has long been known that the leaves of these plants and of several allied species are attacked by a fungus the mycelium of which spreads in the leaf passages and gives rise to powdery masses of orange yellow spores arranged in vertical rows beneath the stomata these powdery masses of spores burst forth through the epidermis but are not clothed by any covering such as the cidia of peridermium pini for instance these groups of yellow spores burst forth in irregular powdery patches scattered over the under sides of the leaves in july and august toward the end of the summer a slightly different form of spore but similarly arranged springs from the same mycelium on the same patches from the differences in their form time of appearance and as we shall see functions these two kinds of spores have received different names those first produced have numerous papill on them and were called uredospores from their analogies with the uredospore of the rust of wheat the second kind of spore is smooth and is called the teleutospore also from analogies with the spores produced in the late summer by the wheat rust the fungus which produces these uredospores and teleutospores was named and has been long distinguished as coleosporium senecionis pers we are not immediately interested in the damage done by this parasite to the weeds which it infests and at any rate we might well be tempted to rejoice in its destructive action on these garden pests it is sufficient to point out that the influence of the mycelium is to shorten the lives of the leaves and to rob the plant of food material in the way referred to generally in my last article what we are here more directly interested in is the following a few years ago wolff showed that if the spores from the cidia peridermium pini var acicola are sown on the leaf of senecio the germinal hyph which grow out from the spores enter the stomata of the senecio leaf and there develop into the fungus called coleosporium senecionis in other words the fungus growing in the cortex of the pine and that parasitic on the leaves of the groundsel and its allies are one and the same it spends part of its life on the tree and the other part on the herb illustration fig 35 a spore of peridermium pini germinating it puts forth the long branched germinal hyph on the damp surface of a leaf of senecio and one of the branches enters a stoma and forms a mycelium in the leaf after some time the mycelium gives rise to the uredospores and teleutospores of coleosporium senecionis after tulasne highly magnified if i left the matter stated only in this bald manner it is probable that few of my readers would believe the wonder but as a matter of fact this phenomenon on the one hand is by no means a solitary instance for we know many of these fungi which require two host plants in order to complete their life history and on the other hand several observers of the highest rank have repeated wolffs experiment and found his results correct hartig for instance to whose indefatigable and ingenious researches we owe most that is known of the disease caused by the peridermium has confirmed wolffs results it was to the brilliant researches of the late prof de bary that we owe the first recognition of this remarkable phenomenon of heteroecismie the inhabiting more than one hostof the fungi de bary proved that the old idea of the farmer that the rust is very apt to appear on wheat growing in the neighborhood of berberry bushes was no fable but on the contrary that the yellow cidium on the berberry is a phase in the life history of the fungus causing the wheat rust many other cases are now known eg the cidium abietinum on the spruce firs in the alps passes the other part of its life on the rhododendrons of the same region another well known example is that of the fungus gymnosporangium which injures the wood of junipers oersted first proved that the other part of its life is spent on the leaves of certain rosace and his discovery has been repeatedly confirmed i have myself observed the following confirmation of this the stems of the junipers so common in the neighborhood of silverdale near morecambe bay used to be distorted with gymnosporangium and covered with the teleutospores of this fungus every spring in july all the hawthorn hedges in the neighborhood had their leaves covered with the cidium form formerly called roestelia and it was quite easy to show that the fungus on the hawthorn leaves was produced by sowing the gymnosporangium spores on them many other well established cases of similar heteroecism could be quoted but we must return to the peridermium pini it will be remembered that i expressed myself somewhat cautiously regarding the peridermium on the leaves var acicola it appears that there is need for further investigations into the life history of this form for it has been thought more than probable that it is not a mere variety of the other but a totally different species only so lately as 1883 however wolff succeeded in infecting the leaves of senecio with the spores of peridermium pini acicola and developing the coleosporium thus showing that both the varieties belong to the same fungus it will be seen from the foregoing that in the study of the biological relationships between any one plant which we happen to value because it produces timber and any other which grows in the neighborhood there may be and there usually is a series of problems fraught with interest so deep scientifically and so important economically that one would suppose no efforts would be spared to investigate them no doubt it will be seen as time progresses that what occasionally looks like apathy with regard to these matters is in reality only apparent indifference due to want of information returning once more to the particular case in question it is obvious that our new knowledge points to the desirability of keeping the seed beds and nurseries especially clean from groundsel and weeds of that description on the one hand such weeds are noxious in themselves and on the other they harbor the coleosporium form of the fungus peridermium under the best conditions for infection it may be added that it is known that the fungus can go on being reproduced by the uredospores on the groundsel plants which live through the winter
