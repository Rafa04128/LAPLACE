by the past patrick henry report of a select committee of the senate of ohio in 1857 on a bill proposed to protect the passenger pigeon the passenger pigeon needs no protection wonderfully prolific having the vast forests of the north as its breeding grounds traveling hundreds of miles in search of food it is here today and elsewhere tomorrow and no ordinary destruction can lessen them or be missed from the myriads that are yearly produced the snipe scolopax wilsonii needs no protection the snipe too like the pigeon will take care of itself and its yearly numbers can not be materially

this volume is dedicated by a sincere admirer i drink to him he is not here yet i would guard his glory a knight without reproach or fear should live in song and story walsh foreword the preservation of animal and plant life and of the general beauty of nature is one of the foremost duties of the men and women of today it is an imperative duty because it must be performed at once for otherwise it will be too late every possible means of preservationsentimental educational and legislativemust be employed the present warning issues with no uncertain sound because this great battle for preservation and conservation cannot be won by gentle tones nor by appeals to the aesthetic instincts of those who have no sense of beauty or enjoyment of nature it is necessary to sound a loud alarm to present the facts in very strong language backed up by irrefutable statistics and by photographs which tell no lies to establish the law and enforce it if needs be with a bludgeon this book is such an alarm call its forceful pages remind me of the sounding of the great bells in the watchtowers of the cities of the middle ages which called the citizens to arms to protect their homes their liberties and their happiness it is undeniable that the welfare and happiness of our own and of all future generations of americans are at stake in this battle for the preservation of nature against the selfishness the ignorance or the cruelty of her destroyers we no longer destroy great works of art they are treasured and regarded as of priceless value but we have yet to attain the state of civilization where the destruction of a glorious work of nature whether it be a cliff a forest or a species of mammal or bird is regarded with equal abhorrence the whole earth is a poorer place to live in when a colony of exquisite egrets or birds of paradise is destroyed in order that the plumes may decorate the hat of some lady of fashion and ultimately find their way into the rubbish heap the people of all the new england states are poorer when the ignorant whites foreigners or negroes of our southern states destroy the robins and other song birds of the north for a mess of pottage travels through europe as well as over a large part of the north american continent have convinced me that nowhere is nature being destroyed so rapidly as in the united states except within our conservation areas an earthly paradise is being turned into an earthly hades and it is not savages nor primitive men who are doing this but men and women who boast of their civilization air and water are polluted rivers and streams serve as sewers and dumping grounds forests are swept away and fishes are driven from the streams many birds are becoming extinct and certain mammals are on the verge of extermination vulgar advertisements hide the landscape and in all that disfigures the wonderful heritage of the beauty of nature today we americans are in the lead fortunately the tide of destruction is ebbing and the tide of conservation is coming in americans are practical like all other northern peoples they love money and will sacrifice much for it but they are also full of idealism as well as of moral and spiritual energy the influence of the splendid body of americans and canadians who have turned their best forces of mind and language into literature and into political power for the conservation movement is becoming stronger every day yet we are far from the point where the momentum of conservation is strong enough to arrest and roll back the tide of destruction and this is especially true with regard to our fast vanishing animal life the facts and figures set forth in this volume will astonish all those lovers of nature and friends of the animal world who are living in a false or imaginary sense of security the logic of these facts is inexorable as regards our birds and mammals the failures of supposed protection in americaunder a system of free shootingare so glaring that we are confident this exposure will lead to sweeping reforms the author of this work is no amateur in the field of wildlife protection his ideas concerning methods of reform are drawn from long and successful experience the states which are still behind in this movement may well give serious heed to his summons and pass the new laws that are so urgently demanded to save the vanishing remnant the new york zoological society which is cooperating with many other organizations in this great movement sends forth this work in the belief that there is no one who is more ardently devoted to the great cause or rendering more effective service in it than william t hornaday we believe that this is a great book destined to exert a worldwide influence to be translated into other languages and to arouse the defenders and lovers of our vanishing animal life before it is too late henry fairfield osborn 10 december 1912 president of the new york zoological society preface the writing of this book has taught me many things beyond question we are exterminating our finest species of mammals birds and fishes according to law i am appalled by the mass of evidence proving that throughout the entire united states and canada in every state and province the existing legal system for the preservation of wild life is fatally defective there is not a single state in our country from which the killable game is not being rapidly and persistently shot to death legally or illegally very much more rapidly than it is breeding with extermination for the most of it close in sight this statement is not open to argument for millions of men know that it is literally true we are living in a fools paradise the rage for wildlife slaughter is far more prevalent today throughout the world than it was in 1872 when the buffalo butchers paved the prairies of texas and colorado with festering carcasses from one end of our continent to the other there is a restless resistless desire to kill kill i have been shocked by the accumulation of evidence showing that all over our country and canada fully ninetenths of our protective laws have practically been dictated by the killers of the game and that in all save a very few instances the hunters have been exceedingly careful to provide open seasons for slaughter as long as any game remains to kill and yet the game of north america does not belong wholly and exclusively to the men who kill the other ninetyseven per cent of the people have vested rights in it far exceeding those of the three per cent posterity has claims upon it that no honest man can ignore i am now going to ask both the true sportsman and the people who do not kill wild things to awake and do their plain duty in protecting and preserving the game and other wild life which belongs partly to us but chiefly to those who come after us can they be aroused before it is too late the time to discuss tiresome academic theories regarding bag limits and different open seasons as being sufficient to preserve the game has gone by we have reached the point where the alternatives are long closed seasons or a gameless continent and we must choose one or the other speedily a continent without wild life is like a forest with no leaves on the trees the great increase in the slaughter of song birds for food by the negroes and poor whites of the south has become an unbearable scourge to our migratory birdsthe very birds on which farmers north and south depend for protection from the insect hordesthe very birds that are most near and dear to the people of the north songbird slaughter is growing and spreading with the decrease of the game birds it is a matter that requires instant attention and stern repression at the present moment it seems that the only remedy lies in federal protection for all migratory birdsbecause so many states will not do their duty we are weary of witnessing the greed selfishness and cruelty of civilized man toward the wild creatures of the earth we are sick of tales of slaughter and pictures of carnage it is time for a sweeping reformation and that is precisely what we now demand i have been a sportsman myself but times have changed and we must change also when game was plentiful i believed that it was right for men and boys to kill a limited amount of it for sport and for the table but the old basis has been swept away by an army of destruction that now is almost beyond all control we must awake and arouse to the new situation face it like men and adjust our minds to the new conditions the three million gunners of today must no longer expect or demand the same generous hunting privileges that were right for hunters fifty years ago when game was fifty times as plentiful as it is now and there was only one killer for every fifty now in the field the fatalistic idea that baglimit laws can save the game is today the curse of all our game birds mammals and fishes it is a fraud a delusion and a snare that miserable fetish has been worshipped much too long our game is being exterminated everywhere by blind insistence upon open seasons and solemn reliance upon legal baglimits if a majority of the people of america feel that so long as there is any game alive there must be an annual two months or four months open season for its slaughter then assuredly we soon will have a gameless continent the only thing that will save the game is by stopping the killing of it in establishing and promulgating this principle the cause of wildlife protection greatly needs three things money labor and publicity with the first we can secure the second and third but can we get itand get it in time to save this volume is in every sense a contribution to a cause and as such it ever will remain i wish the public to receive it on that basis so much important material has drifted straight to it from other hands that this unexpected aid seems to the author like a good omen the manuscript has received the benefit of a close and critical reading and correcting by my comrade on the firingline and esteemed friend mr madison grant through which the text was greatly improved but for the splendid encouragement and assistance that i have received from him and from professor henry fairneld osborn the work involved would have borne down rather heavily the four chapters embracing the new laws needed a rollcall of the states were critically inspected corrected and brought down to date by dr ts palmer our highest authority on the game laws of the nation and the states for this valuable service the author is deeply grateful of course the author is alone responsible for all the opinions and conclusions herein recorded and for all errors that appear outside of quotations i trust that the reader will kindly excuse and forget all the typographic and clerical errors that may have escaped me in the rush that had to be made against time wth university heights

marsh island and adjacent preserves most important game preserves of africa our vanishing wild life part i extermination chapter i the former abundance of wild life by my labors my vineyard flourished but ahab came alas for naboth in order that the american people may correctly understand and judge the question of the extinction or preservation of our wild life it is necessary to recall the near past it is not necessary however to go far into the details of history for a few quick glances at a few high points will be quite sufficient for the purpose in view any man who reads the books which best tell the story of the development of the american colonies of 1712 into the american nation of 1912 and takes due note of the wildlife features of the tale will say without hesitation that when the american people received this land from the bountiful hand of nature it was endowed with a magnificent and allpervading supply of valuable wild creatures the pioneers and the early settlers were too busy even to take due note of that fact or to comment upon it save in very fragmentary ways nevertheless the wildlife abundance of early american days survived down to so late a period that it touched the lives of millions of people now living any man 55 years of age who when a boy had a taste for huntingfor at that time there were no sportsmen in americawill remember the flocks and herds of wild creatures that he saw and which made upon his mind many indelible impressions abundance is the word with which to describe the original animal life that stocked our country and all north america only a short halfcentury ago throughout every state on every shoreline in all the millions of fresh water lakes ponds and rivers on every mountain range in every forest and even on every desert the wild flocks and herds held sway it was impossible to go beyond the settled haunts of civilized man and escape them it was a full century after the complete settlement of new england and the virginia colonies that the wonderful biggame fauna of the great plains and rocky mountains was really discovered but the bison millions the antelope millions the mule deer the mountain sheep and mountain goat were there all the time in the early days the millions of pinnated grouse and quail of the central states attracted no serious attention from the american peopleatlarge but they lived and flourished just the same far down in the seventies when the greedy market gunners systematically slaughtered them and barreled them up for the market while the foolish farmers calmly permitted them to do it we obtain the best of our history of the former abundance of north american wild life first from the pages of audubon and wilson next from the records left by such pioneers as lewis and clark and last from the testimony of living men to all this we can many of us add observations of our own to me the most striking fact that stands forth in the story of american wild life one hundred years ago is the wide extent and thoroughness of its distribution wide as our country is and marvelous as it is in the diversity of its climates its soils its topography its flora its riches and its poverty nature gave to each square mile and to each acre a generous quota of wild creatures according to its ability to maintain living things no pioneer ever pushed so far or into regions so difficult or so remote that he did not find awaiting him a host of birds and beasts sometimes the pioneer was not a good hunter usually he was a stupid fisherman but the game was there nevertheless the time was when every farm had its quota the part that the wild life of america played in the settlement and development of this continent was so farreaching in extent and so enormous in potential value that it fairly staggers the imagination from the landing of the pilgrims down to the present hour the wild game has been the mainstay and the resource against starvation of the pathfinder the settler the prospector and at times even the railroadbuilder in view of what the bison millions did for the dakotas montana wyoming kansas and texas it is only right and square that those states should now do something for the perpetual preservation of the bison species and all other big game that needs help for years and years the antelope millions of the montana and wyoming grasslands fed the scout and indianfighter freighter cowboy and surveyor ranchman and sheepherder but thus far i have yet to hear of one western state that has ever spent one penny directly for the preservation of the antelope and today we are in a handtohand fight in congress and in montana with the woolgrowers association which maintains in washington a keen lobbyist to keep aloft the tariff on wool and prevent congress from taking 15 square miles of grass lands on snow creek montana for a national antelope preserve all that the woolgrowers want is the entire earth all to themselves mr mcclure the secretary of the association says the proper place in which to preserve the big game of the west is in city parks where it can be protected to the colonist of the east and pioneer of the west the whitetailed deer was an ever present help in time of trouble without this omnipresent animal and the supply of good meat that each white flag represented the commissariat difficulties of the settlers who won the country as far westward as indiana would have been many times greater than they were the backwoods pilgrims progress was like this trail deer cabin deer clearing bear corn deer hogs deer cattle wheat independence and yet how many men are there today out of our ninety millions of americans and pseudoamericans who remember with any feeling of gratitude the part played in american history by the whitetailed deer very few how many americans are there in our land who now preserve that deer for sentimental reasons and because his forbears were nationbuilders as a matter of fact are there any on every eastern pioneers monument the whitetailed deer should figure and on those of the great west the bison and the antelope should be cast in enduring bronze lest we forget the game birds of america played a different part from that of the deer antelope and bison in the early days shotguns were few and shot was scarce and dear the wild turkey and goose were the smallest birds on which a rifleman could afford to expend a bullet and a whole charge of powder it was for this reason that the deer bear bison and elk disappeared from the eastern united states while the game birds yet remained abundant with the disappearance of the big game came the fat steer hog and hominy the wheatfield fruit orchard and poultry galore the game birds of america as a class and a mass have not been swept away to ward off starvation or to rescue the perishing even back in the sixties and seventies very very few men of the north thought of killing prairie chickens ducks and quail snipe and woodcock in order to keep the hunger wolf from the door the process was too slow and uncertain and besides the reallypoor man rarely had the gun and ammunition instead of attempting to live on birds he hustled for the staple food products that the soil of his own farm could produce first last and nearly all the time the game birds of the united states as a whole have been sacrificed on the altar of rank luxury to tempt appetites that were tired of fried chicken and other farm delicacies today even the average poor man hunts birds for the joy of the outing and the pampered epicures of the hotels and restaurants buy game birds and eat small portions of them solely to tempt jaded appetites if there is such a thing as class legislation it is that which permits a few sordid marketshooters to slaughter the birds of the whole people in order to sell them to a few epicures the game of a state belongs to the whole people of the state the supreme court of the united states has so decided geer vs connecticut if it is abundant it is a valuable asset the great value of the game birds of america lies not in their meat pounds as they lie upon the table but in the temptation they annually put before millions of fieldweary farmers and deskweary clerks and merchants to get into their beloved hunting togs stalk out into the lap of nature and say begone dull care and the man who has had a fine day in the painted woods on the bright waters of a duckhaunted bay or in the golden stubble of september can fill his day and his soul with six good birds just as well as with sixty the idea that in order to enjoy a fine day in the open a man must kill a wheelbarrow load of birds is a mistaken idea and if obstinately adhered to it becomes vicious the outing in the open is the thingnot the bloodstained feathers nasty viscera and death in the gamebag one quail on a fence is worth more to the world than ten in a bag the farmers of america have by their own supineness and lack of foresight permitted the slaughter of a stock of game birds which had it been properly and wisely conserved would have furnished a good annual shoot to every farming man and boy of sporting instincts through the past right down to the present and far beyond they have allowed millions of dollars worth of their birds to be coolly snatched away from them by the greedy marketshooters there is one state in america and so far as i know only one in which there is at this moment an oldtime abundance of gamebird life that is the state of louisiana the reason is not so very far to seek for the birds that do not migratequail wild turkeys and dovesthe cover is yet abundant for the migratory game birds of the mississippi valley louisiana is a grand central depot with terminal facilities that are unsurpassed her reedy shores her vast marshes her long coast line and abundance of food furnish what should be not only a haven but a heaven for ducks and geese after running the gauntlet of guns all the way from manitoba and ontario to the sunk lands of arkansas the shores of the gulf must seem like heaven itself the great forests of louisiana shelter deer turkeys and furbearing animals galore and rabbits and squirrels abound naturally this abundance of game has given rise to an extensive industry in shooting for the market the big interests outside the state send their agents into the best game districts often bringing in their own force of shooters they comb out the game in enormous quantities without leaving to the people of louisiana any decent and fair quidproquo for having despoiled them of their game and shipped a vast annual product outside to create wealth elsewhere at present however we are but incidentally interested in the shortsightedness of the people of the pelican state as a state of oldtime abundance in killable game the killing records that were kept in the year 190910 possess for us very great interest they throw a startling searchlight on the subject of this chapterthe former abundance of wild life from the records that with great pains and labor were gathered by the state game commission and which were furnished me for use here by president frank m miller we set forth this remarkable exhibit of oldfashioned abundance in game ad 1909 official record of game killed in louisiana during the season 12 months of 190910 birds wild ducks sea and river 3176000 coots 280740 geese and brant 202210 snipe sandpiper and plover 606635 quail bobwhite 1140750 doves 310660 wild turkeys 2219 total number of game birds killed 5719214 mammals deer 5470 squirrels and rabbits 690270 total of game mammals 695740 furbearing mammals 1971922 total of mammals 2667662 grand total of birds and mammals 8386876 of the thousands of slaughtered robins it would seem that no records exist it is to be understood that the annual slaughter of wild life in louisiana never before reached such a pitch as now without drastic measures what will be the inevitable result does any man suppose that even the wild millions of louisiana can long withstand such slaughter as that shown by the official figures given above it is wildly impossible but the darkest hour is just before the dawn at the session of the louisiana legislature that was held in the spring of 1912 great improvements were made in the game laws of that state the most important feature was the suppression of wholesale market hunting by persons who are not residents of the state a very limited amount of game may be sold and served as food in public places but the restrictions placed upon this traffic are so effective that they will vastly reduce the annual slaughter in other respects also the cause of wild life protection gained much for which great credit is due to mr edward a mcilhenny it is the way of americans to feel that because game is abundant in a given place at a given time it always will be abundant and may therefore be slaughtered without limit that was the case last winter in california during the awful slaughter of bandtailed pigeons as will be noted elsewhere it is time for all men to be told in the plainest terms that there never has existed anywhere in historic times a volume of wild life so great that civilized man could not quickly exterminate it by his methods of destruction lift the veil and look at the stories of the bison the passenger pigeon the wild ducks and shore birds of the atlantic coast and the furseal illustration shall we leave any one of them open as reasoning beings it is our duty to heed the lessons of history and not rush blindly on until we perpetrate a continent destitute of wild life chapter ii extinct species of north american birds for educated civilized man to exterminate a valuable wild species of living things is a crime it is a crime against his own children and posterity no man has a right either moral or legal to destroy or squander an inheritance of his children that he holds for them in trust and man the wasteful and greedy spendthrift that he is has not created even the humblest of the species of birds mammals and fishes that adorn and enrich this earth the earth is the lords and the fulness thereof with all his wisdom man has not evolved and placed here so much as a groundsquirrel a sparrow or a clam it is true that he has juggled with the wild horse and sheep the goats and the swine and produced some hardy breeds that can withstand his abuse without going down before it but as for species he has not yet created and placed here even so much as a protozoan the wild things of this earth are not ours to do with as we please they have been given to us in trust and we must account for them to the generations which will come after us and audit our accounts but man the shameless destroyer of natures gifts blithely and persistently exterminates one species after another fully ten per cent of the human race consists of people who will lie steal throw rubbish in parks and destroy forests and wild life whenever and wherever they can do so without being stopped by a policemen and a club these are hard words but they are absolutely true from ten per cent or more of the human race the high moral instinct which is honest without compulsion is absent the things that seemingly decent citizensmen posing as gentlemenwill do to wild game when they secure great chances to slaughter are appalling i could fill a book of this size with cases in point today the women of england europe and elsewhere are directly promoting the extermination of scores of beautiful species of wild birds by the devilish persistence with which they buy and wear feather ornaments made of their plumage they are just as mean and cruel as the truckdriver who drives a horse with a sore shoulder and beats him on the street but they do it and appeals to them to do otherwise they laugh to scorn saying i will wear what is fashionable when i please and where i please as a famous bird protector of england has just written me the women of the smart set are beyond the reach of appeal or protest today the thing that stares me in the face every waking hour like a grisly spectre with bloody fang and claw is the extermination of species to me that is a horrible thing it is wholesale murder no less it is capital crime and a black disgrace to the races of civilized mankind i say civilized mankind because savages dont do it there are three kinds of extermination the practical extermination of a species means the destruction of its members to an extent so thorough and widespread that the species disappears from view and living specimens of it can not be found by seeking for them in north america this is today the status of the whooping crane upland plover and several other species if any individuals are living they will be met with only by accident the absolute extermination of a species means that not one individual of it remains alive judgment to this effect is based upon the lapse of time since the last living specimen was observed or killed when five years have passed without a living record of a wild specimen it is time to place a species in the class of the totally extinct extermination in a wild state means that the only living representatives are in captivity or otherwise under protection this is the case of the heath hen and davids deer of china the american bison is saved from being wholly extinct as a wild animal by the remnant of about 300 head in northern athabasca and 49 head in the yellowstone park it is a serious thing to exterminate a species of any of the vertebrate animals there are probably millions of people who do not realize that civilized man is the most persistently and wickedly wasteful of all the predatory animals the lions the tigers the bears the eagles and hawks serpents and the fisheating fishes all live by destroying life but they kill only what they think they can consume if something is by chance left over it goes to satisfy the hunger of the humbler creatures of prey in a state of nature where wild creatures prey upon wild creatures such a thing as wanton wholesale and utterly wasteful slaughter is almost unknown when the wild mink weasel and skunk suddenly finds himself in the midst of scores of mans confined and helpless domestic fowls or his caged gulls in a zoological park an unusual criminal passion to murder for the joy of killing sometimes seizes the wild animal and great slaughter is the result from the earliest historic times it has been the way of savage man red black brown and yellow to kill as the wild animals doonly what he can use or thinks he can use the cree indian impounded small herds of bison and sometimes killed from 100 to 200 at one time but it was to make sure of having enough meat and hides and because he expected to use the product i think that even the worst enemies of the plains indians hardly will accuse them of killing large numbers of bison elk or deer merely for the pleasure of seeing them fall or taking only their teeth illustration six recently exterminated north american birds great auk labrador duck eskimo curlew pallas cormorant passenger pigeon carolina parrakeet it has remained for the wolf the sheepkilling dog and civilized man to make records of wanton slaughter which puts them in a class together and quite apart from other predatory animals when a man can kill bison for their tongues alone bull elk for their tusks alone and shoot a whole colony of hippopotamiactually damming a river with their bloated and putrid carcasses all untouched by the knifethe men who do such things must be classed with the cruel wolf and the criminal dog it is now desirable that we should pause in our career of destruction long enough to look back upon what we have recently accomplished in the total extinction of species and also note what we have blocked out for the immediate future here let us erect a monument to the dead species of our own times it is to be doubted whether up to this hour any man has made a list of the species of north american birds that have become extinct during the past sixty years the specialists have no time to spare from their compound differential microscopes and the birdkillers are too busy with shooting netting and clubbing to waste any time on such trifles as exterminated species what does a marketshooter care about birds that can not be killed a second time as for the farmers they are so busy raising hogs and prices that their best friends the birds get scant attention from themuntil a henhawk takes a chicken down south the negroes and poor whites may slaughter robins for food by the ten thousand but does the northern farmer bother his head about a trifle of that kind no indeed will he contribute any real money to help put a stop to it ask him yourself let us pause long enough to reckon up some of our expenditures in species and in millions of individuals let us set down here in cold blood a list of the species of our own north american birds that have been totally exterminated in our own times after that we will have something to say about other species that soon will be exterminated and the second task is much greater than the first roll call of the dead species of american birds the great aukplautusimpennis linn was a seagoing diving bird about the size of a domestic goose related to the guillemots murres and puffins for a bird endowed only with flipperlike wings and therefore absolutely unable to fly this species had an astonishing geographic range it embraced the shores of northern europe to north cape southern greenland southern labrador and the atlantic coast of north america as far south as massachusetts some say as far south as massachusetts the carolinas and florida but that is a large order and i leave the aou to prove that if it can in the life history of this bird a great tragedy was enacted in 1800 by sailors on funk island north of newfoundland where men were landed by a ship and spent several months slaughtering great auks and trying out their fat for oil in this process the bodies of thousands of auks were burned as fuel in working up the remains of tens of thousands of others on funk island a favorite breedingplace the great auk was exterminated in 1840 and in iceland in 1844 many natives ate this bird with relish and being easily captured either on land or sea the commercialism of its day soon obliterated the species the last living specimen was seen in 1852 and the last dead one was picked up in trinity bay ireland in 1853 there are about 80 mounted and unmounted skins in existence four skeletons and quite a number of eggs an egg is worth about 1200 and a good mounted skin at least double that sum the labrador duckcamptorhynchus labradoricus gmelthis handsome seaduck of a species related to the eider ducks of arctic waters became totally extinct about 1875 before the scientific world even knew that its existence was threatened with this species the exact and final cause of its extinction is to this day unknown it is not at all probable however that its unfortunate blotting out from our bird fauna was due to natural causes and when the truth becomes known it is very probable that the hand of man will be revealed the labrador duck bred in labrador and once frequented our atlantic coast as far south as chesapeake bay but it is said that it never was very numerous at least during the twentyfive years preceding its disappearance about thirtyfive skins and mounted museum specimens are all that remain to prove its former existence and i think there is not even one skeleton the pallas cormorantcarbo perspicillatus pallasin 1741 when the russian explorer commander bering discovered the bering or commander islands in the farnorth pacific and landed upon them he also discovered this striking bird species its plumage both above and below was a dark metallic green with blue iridescence on the neck and purple on the shoulders a pale ring of naked skin around each eye suggested the latin specific name of this bird the pallas cormorant became totally extinct through causes not positively known about 1852 the passenger pigeonectopistes migratoria linnwe place this bird in the totallyextinct class not only because it is extinct in a wild state but only one solitary individual a twentyyearold female in the cincinnati zoological gardens now remains alive one living specimen and a few skins skeletons and stuffed specimens are all that remain to show for the uncountable millions of pigeons that swarmed over the united states only yesterday as it were there is no doubt about where those millions have gone they went down and out by systematic wholesale slaughter for the market and the pot before the shotguns clubs and nets of the earliest american pothunters wherever they nested they were slaughtered it is a long and shameful story but the grisly skeleton of its michigan chapter can be set forth in a few words in 1869 from the town of hartford mich three car loads of dead pigeons were shipped to market each day for forty days making a total of 11880000 birds it is recorded that another michigan town marketed 15840000 in two years see mr wb mershons book the passenger pigeon alexander wilson the pioneer american ornithologist was the man who seriously endeavored to estimate by computations the total number of passenger pigeons in one flock that was seen by him here is what he has said in his american ornithology to form a rough estimate of the daily consumption of one of these immense flocks let us first attempt to calculate the numbers of that above mentioned as seen in passing between frankfort and the indiana territory if we suppose this column to have been one mile in breadth and i believe it to have been much more and that it moved at the rate of one mile in a minute four hours the time it continued passing would make its whole length two hundred and forty miles again supposing that each square yard of this moving body comprehended three pigeons the square yards in the whole space multiplied by three would give 2230272000 pigeons an almost inconceivable multitude and yet probably far below the actual amount happening to go ashore one charming afternoon to purchase some milk at a house that stood near the river and while talking with the people within doors i was suddenly struck with astonishment at a loud rushing roar succeeded by instant darkness which on the first moment i took for a tornado about to overwhelm the house and every thing around in destruction the people observing my surprise coolly said it is only the pigeons on running out i beheld a flock thirty or forty yards in width sweeping along very low between the house and the mountain or height that formed the second bank of the river these continued passing for more than a quarter of an hour and at length varied their bearing so as to pass over the mountains behind which they disappeared before the rear came up in the atlantic states though they never appear in such unparalleled multitudes they are sometimes very numerous and great havoc is then made amongst them with the gun the clapnet and various other implements of destruction as soon as it is ascertained in a town that the pigeons are flying numerously in the neighborhood the gunners rise en masse the clapnets are spread out on suitable situations commonly on an open height in an old buckwheat field four or five live pigeons with their eyelids sewed upa are fastened on a movable stick a small hut of branches is fitted up for the fowler at the distance of forty or fifty yards by the pulling of a string the stick on which the pigeons rest is alternately elevated and depressed which produces a fluttering of their wings similar to that of birds alighting this being perceived by the passing flocks they descend with great rapidity and finding corn buckwheat etc strewed about begin to feed and are instantly by the pulling of a cord covered by the net in this manner ten twenty and even thirty dozen have been caught at one sweep meantime the air is darkened with large bodies of them moving in various directions the woods also swarm with them in search of acorns and the thundering of musquetry is perpetual on all sides from morning to night wagon loads of them are poured into market where they sell from fifty to twentyfive and even twelve cents per dozen and pigeons become the order of the day at dinner breakfast and supper until the very name becomes sickening footnote a today we think that the fowlers of the roccolos of northern italy are very cruel in their methods of catching songbirds wholesale for the market chapter xi but our own countrymen of wilsons day were just as cruel in the method described above the range of the passenger pigeon covered nearly the whole united states from the atlantic coast westward to the rocky mountains a few bold pigeons crossed the rocky mountains into oregon northern california and washington but only as stragglers few and far between the wide range of this bird was worthy of a species that existed in millions and it was persecuted literally all along the line the greatest slaughter was in michigan ohio and pennsylvania in 1848 massachusetts gravely passed a law protecting the netters of wild pigeons from foreign interference there was a fine of 10 for damaging nets or frightening pigeons away from them this was on the theory that the pigeons were so abundant they could not by any possibility ever become scarce and that pigeonslaughter was a legitimate industry in 1867 the state of new york found that the wild pigeon needed protection and enacted a law to that effect the year 1868 was the last year in which great numbers of passenger pigeons nested in that state eaton in the birds of new york said that millions of birds occupied the timber along bells run near ceres alleghany county on the pennsylvania line in 1870 massachusetts gave pigeons protection except during an open season and in 1878 pennsylvania elected to protect pigeons on their nesting grounds the passenger pigeon millions were destroyed so quickly and so thoroughly en masse that the american people utterly failed to comprehend it and for thirty years obstinately refused to believe that the species had been suddenly wiped off the map of north america there was years of talk about the great flocks having taken refuge in south america or in mexico and being still in existence there were surmises about their having all gone out to sea and perished on the briny deep a thousand times at least wild pigeons have been reported as having been seen these rumors have covered nearly every northern state the whole of the southwest and california for years and years we have been patiently writing letters to explain over and over that the bandtailed pigeon of the pacific coast and the redbilled pigeon of arizona and the southwest are neither of them the passenger pigeon and never can be there was a long period wherein we believed many of the pigeon reports that came from the states where the birds once were most numerous but that period has absolutely passed during the past five years large cash rewards aggregating about 5000 have been offered for the discovery of one nesting pair of genuine passenger pigeons many persons have claimed this reward of professor cf hodge of clark university worcester mass and many claims have been investigated the results have disclosed many mourning doves but not one pigeon now we understand that the quest is closed and hope has been abandoned the passenger pigeon is a dead species the last wild specimen so we believe that ever will reach the hands of man was taken near detroit michigan on sept 14 1908 and mounted by c campion that is the one definite positive record of the past ten years the fate of this species should be a lasting lesson to the world at large any wild bird or mammal species can be exterminated by commercial interests in twenty years time or less the eskimo curlewnumenius borealis forst this valuable game bird once ranged all along the atlantic coast of north america and wherever found it was prized for the table it preferred the fields and meadows to the shore lines and was the companion of the plovers of the uplands especially the golden plover about 1872 says mr forbush there was a great flight of these birds on cape cod and nantucket they were everywhere and enormous numbers were killed they could be bought of boys at six cents apiece two men killed 300 worth of these birds at that time apparently that was the beginning of the end of the dough bird which was another name for this curlew in 1908 mr gh mackay stated that this bird and the golden plover had decreased 90 per cent in fifty years and in the last ten years of that period 90 per cent of the remainder had gone now 1908 says mr forbush ornithologists believe that the eskimo curlew is practically extinct as only a few specimens have been recorded since the beginning of the twentieth century the very last record is of two specimens collected at waco york county nebraska in march 1911 and recorded by mr august eiche of course it is possible that other individuals may still survive but so far as our knowledge extends the species is absolutely dead in the west indies and the guadeloupe islands five species of macaws and parrakeets have passed out without any serious note of their disappearance on the part of the people of the united states it is at least time to write brief obituary notices of them we are indebted to the hon walter rothschild of tring england for essential facts regarding these species as set forth in his sumptuous work extinct birds the cuban tricolored macawara tricolor gm in 1875 when the author visited cuba and the isle of pines he was informed by professor poey that he was about ten years too late to find this fine species alive it was exterminated for food purposes about 1864 and only four specimens are known to be in existence illustration sacred to the memory of the north american great auk pallas cormorant labrador duck passenger pigeon eskimo curlew cuban tricolor macaw gosses macaw guadeloupe macaw yellow winged green parrot purple guadaloupe parakeet carolina parakeet exterminated by civilized man 18401910 gosses macawara gossei roththis species once inhabited the island of jamaica it was exterminated about 1800 and so far as known not one specimen of it is in existence guadeloupe macawara guadeloupensis clarkall that is known of the life history of this large bird is that once it inhabited the guadeloupe islands the date and history of its disappearance are both unknown and there is not one specimen of it in existence yellowwinged green parrotamazona olivacea gmof the history of this guadeloupe species also nothing is known and there appear to be no specimens of it in existence purple guadeloupe parrakeetanodorhynchus purpurescens rothschildthis is another dead species that once lived in the guadeloupe islands and passed away silently and unnoticed at the time leaving no records of its existence and no specimens the carolina parrakeetconuropsis carolinensis linn brings us down to the present moment to this charming little greenandyellow bird we are in the very act of bidding everlasting farewell ten specimens remain alive in captivity six of which are in the cincinnati zoological garden three are in the washington zoological park and one is in the new york zoological park regarding wild specimens it is possible that some yet remain in some obscure and neglected corner of florida but it is extremely doubtful whether the world ever will find any of them alive mrs minnie moore willson of kissimee fla reports the species as totally extinct in florida unless we would strain at a gnat we may just as well enter this species in the dead class for there is no reason to hope that any more wild specimens ever will be found the former range of this species embraced the whole southeastern and central united states from the gulf it extended to albany ny northern ohio and indiana northern iowa nebraska central colorado and eastern texas from which it will be seen that once it was widely distributed it was shot because it was destructive to fruit and for its plumage and many were trapped alive to be kept in captivity i know that one colony near the mouth of the sebastian river east coast of florida was exterminated in 1898 by a local hunter and i regret to say that it was done in the hope of selling the living birds to a new york birddealer by holding bags over the holes in which the birds were nesting the entire colony of about 16 birds was caught everywhere else than in florida the carolina parrakeet has long been extinct in 1904 a flock of 13 birds was seen near lake okechobee but in florida many calamities can overtake a flock of birds in eight years the birds in captivity are not breeding and so far as perpetuation by them is concerned they are only one remove from mounted museum specimens this parrakeet is the only member of its order that ranged into the united states during our own times and with its disappearance the order psittaciformes totally disappears from our country chapter iii the next candidates for oblivion in the world of human beings murder is the most serious of all crimes to take from a man that which no one ever can restore to him his life is murder and its penalty is the most severe of all penalties there are circumstances under which the killing of a wild animal may be so wanton so revolting and so utterly reprehensible that the act may justly be classed as murder the man who kills a walrus from the deck of a steamer that he knows will not stop the man who wantonly killed the whole colony of hippopotami that mr dugmore photographed in life the man who last winter shot bull elk in wyoming for their two ugly and shapeless teeth and the man who wantonly shot down a halftame deer for fun near carmel putnam county new york in the summer of 1912all were guilty of murdering wild animals the murder of a wild animal species consists in taking from it that which man with all his cunning and all his preserves and breeding can not give back to itits godgiven place in the ranks of living things where is mans boasted intelligence or his sense of proportion that every man does not see the monstrous moral obliquity involved in the destruction of a species if the beautiful taj mehal at agra should be destroyed by vandals the intelligent portion of humanity would be profoundly shocked even though the hand of man could at will restore the shrine of sorrowing love today the great indian rhinoceros certainly one of the most wonderful fourfooted animals still surviving is actually being exterminated and even the people of india and england are viewing it with an indifference that is appalling of course there are among englishmen a great many sportsmen and several zoologists who really care but they do not constitute onetenth of one percent of the men who ought to care in the museums we stand in awe and wonder before the fossil skeleton of the megatherium and the savants struggle to unveil its past while the equally great and marvelous rhinoceros indicus is being rushed into oblivion we marvel at the fossil shell of the gigantic turtle called collosochelys atlas while the last living representatives of the gigantic land tortoises are being exterminated in the galapagos islands and the sychelles for their paltry oil and meat and only one man hon walter rothschild is doing aught to save any of them in their haunts where they can breed the dodo of mauritius was exterminated by swine whose bipedal descendants have exterminated many other species since that time a failure to appreciate either the beauty or the value of our living birds quadrupeds and fishes is the hallmark of arrested mental development and ignorance the victim is not always to blame but in this practical world the cornerstone of legal jurisprudence is the inexorable principle that ignorance of the law excuses no man these pages are addressed to my countrymen and the world at large not as a reproach upon the dead past which is gone beyond recall but in the faint hope of somewhere and somehow arousing forces that will reform the present and save the future the extermination of wild species that now is proceeding throughout the world is a dreadful thing it is not only injurious to the economy of the world but it is a shame and a disgrace to the civilized portion of the human race it is of little avail that i should here enter into a detailed description of each species that now is being railroaded into oblivion the bookshelves of intelligent men and women are filled with beautiful and adequate books on birds and quadrupeds wherein the status of each species may be determined almost without effort there is time and space only in which to notice the most prominent of the doomed species and perhaps discuss a few examples by way of illustration here is a partial list of north american birds threatened with early extermination whooping crane trumpeter swan american flamingo roseate spoonbill scarlet ibis longbilled curlew hudsonian godwit upland plover redbreasted sandpiper golden plover dowitcher willet pectoral sandpiper blackcapped petrel american egret snowy egret wood duck bandtailed pigeon heath hen sage grouse prairie sharptail pinnated grouse whitetailed kite the whooping cranethis splendid bird will almost certainly be the next north american species to be totally exterminated it is the only new world rival of the numerous large and showy cranes of the old world for the sandhill crane is not in the same class as the white black and blue giants of asia we will part from our stately grus americanus with profound sorrow for on this continent we neer shall see his like again the wellnigh total disappearance of this species has been brought close home to us by the fact that there are less than half a dozen individuals alive in captivity while in a wild state the bird is so rare as to be quite unobtainable for example for nearly five years an english gentlemen has been offering 1000 for a pair and the most enterprising bird collector in america has been quite unable to fill the order so far as our information extends the last living specimen captured was taken six or seven years ago the last wild birds seen and reported were observed by ernest thompson seton who saw five below fort mcmurray saskatchewan october 16th 1907 and by john f ferry who saw one at big quill lake saskatchewan in june 1909 the range of this species once covered the eastern twothirds of the continent of north america it extended from the atlantic coast to the rocky mountains and from great bear lake to florida and texas eastward of the mississippi it has for twenty years been totally extinct and the last specimens taken alive were found in kansas and nebraska illustration whooping cranes in the zoological park very soon this species will become totally extinct the trumpeter swansix years ago this species was regarded as so nearly extinct that a doubting ornithological club of boston refused to believe on hearsay evidence that the new york zoological park contained a pair of living birds and a committee was appointed to investigate in person and report even at that time skins were worth all the way from 100 to 150 each and when swan skins sell at either of those figures it is because there are people who believe that the species either is on the verge of extinction or has passed it the pair referred to above was acquired in 1900 since that time dr leonard c sanford procured in 1910 two living birds from a bird dealer who obtained them on the coast of virginia we have done our utmost to induce our pair to breed but without any further results than nestbuilding the loss of the trumpeter swan olor americanus will not be so great nor felt so keenly as the blotting out of the whooping crane it so closely resembles the whistling swan that only an ornithologist can recognize the difference a yellow spot on the side of the upper mandible near its base the whistling swan yet remains in fair numbers but it is to be feared that soon it will go as the trumpeter has gone the american flamingo scarlet ibis and roseate spoonbill are three of the most beautiful and curious waterhaunting birds of the tropics once all three species inhabited portions of the southern united states but now all three are gone from our starspangled bird fauna the brilliant scarlet plumage of the flamingo and ibis and the exquisite pink rosecolor and white of the spoonbill naturally attracted the evil eyes of the milliners taxidermists and other birdbutchers from florida these birds quickly vanished the six great breeding colonies of flamingoes on andros island bahamas have been reduced to two and from prof ea goeldi of the state museum goeldi para brazil have come bitter complaints of the slaughter of scarlet ibises in south america by plumehunters in european pay i know not how other naturalists regard the future of the three species named above but my opinion is that unless the european feather trade is quickly stopped as to wild plumage they are absolutely certain to be shot into total oblivion within a very few years the plumage of these birds has so much commercial value for fishermens flies as well as for womens hats that the birds will be killed as long as their feathers can be sold and any birds remain alive zoologically the flamingo is the most odd and interesting bird on the american continent except the emperor penguin its beak baffles description its long legs and webbed feet are a joke its nesting habits are amazing and its food habits the despair of most zoologicalgarden keepers millions of flamingos inhabit the shores of a number of small lakes in the interior of equatorial east africa but that species is not brilliant scarlet all over the neck and head as is the case with our species if the american flamingo scarlet ibis and roseate spoonbill one or all of them are to be saved from total extinction efforts must be made in each of the countries in which they breed and live their preservation is distinctly a burden upon the countries of south america that lie eastward of the andes and on yucatan cuba and the bahamas the time has come when the government of the bahama islands should sternly forbid the killing of any more flamingos on any pretext whatever and if the capture of living specimens for exhibition purposes militates against the welfare of the colonies they should forbid that also the upland plover or bartramian sandpiperapparently this is the next shorebird species that will follow the eskimo curlew into oblivion four years agoa long period for a species that is on the edge of exterminationmr eh forbushb wrote of it as follows the bartramian sandpiper commonly known as the upland plover a bird which formerly bred on grassy hills all over the state and migrated southward along our coasts in great flocks is in imminent danger of extirpation a few still breed in worcester and berkshire counties or nantucket so there is still a nucleus which if protected may save the species five reports from localities where this bird formerly bred give it as nearing extinction and four as extinct this is one of the most useful of all birds in grass land feeding largely on grasshoppers and cutworms it is one of the finest of all birds for the table an effort should be made at once to save this useful species footnote b special report on the decrease of certain birds and its causesmass state board of agriculture 1908 the blackcapped petrel aestrelata hasitatathis species is already recorded in the aou check list as extinct but it appears that this may not as yet be absolutely true on january 1 1912 a strange thing happened a much battered and exhausted blackcapped petrel was picked up alive in central park new york taken to the menagerie and kept there during the few days that it survived when it died it was sent to the american museum and this may easily prove to be the last living record for that species in reality this species might as well be listed with those totally extinct formerly it ranged from the antilles to ohio and ontario and the causes of its blotting out are not yet definitely known this oceangoing bird once had a wide range overseas in the temperate areas of the north atlantic it is recorded from ulster county new york new hampshire kentucky ohio virginia and florida it was about of the size of the common tern the california condor gymnogyps californianusi feel that the existence of this species hangs on a very slender thread this is due to its alarmingly small range the insignificant number of individuals now living the openness of the species to attack and the danger of its extinction by poison originally this remarkable birdthe largest north american bird of preyranged as far northward as the columbia river and southward for an unknown distance now its range is reduced to seven counties in southern california although it is said to extend from monterey bay to lower california and eastward to arizona regarding the present status and the future of this bird i have been greatly disturbed in mind when a unique and zoologically important species becomes reduced in its geographic range to a small section of a single state it seems to me quite time for alarm for some time i have counted this bird as one of those threatened with early extermination and as i think with good reason in view of the swift calamities that now seem able to fall on species like thunderbolts out of clear skies and wipe them off the earth even before we know that such a fate is impending no species of sevencounty distribution is safe any species that is limited to a few counties of a single state is liable to be wiped out in five years by poison or traps or lack of food illustration california condor now living in the new york zoological park on order to obtain the best and also the most conservative information regarding this species i appealed to the curator of the museum of vertebrate zoology of the university of california although written in the mountain wilds i promptly received the valuable contribution that appears below as a clear precise and conservative survey of an important species it is really a model document the status of the california condor in 1912 by joseph grinnell to my knowledge the california condor has been definitely observed within the past five years in the following california counties los angeles ventura santa barbara san luis obispo monterey kern and tulare in parts of ventura santa barbara san luis obispo and kern counties the species is still fairly common for a large bird probably equal in numbers to the golden eagle in those regions that are suited to it by suitable country i mean cattleraising mountainous territory of which there are still vast areas and which are not likely to be put to any other use for a very long time if ever on account of the lack of water while in kern county last april i was informed by a reliable man who lives near the tejon rancho that he had counted twentyfive condors in a single day since january 1 of the present year these were on the tejon rancho which is an enormous cattle range covering parts of the tehachapi and san emigdio mountains our present state law provides complete protection for the condor and its eggs and the state fish and game commission in granting permits for collectors always adds the phraseexcept the california condor and its eggs i know of two special permits having been issued but neither of these were used that is no specimens have been taken since 1908 as far as i am aware in my travels about the state i have found that practically everyone knows that the condor is protected still there is always the hunting element who do not hesitate to shoot anything alive and out of the ordinary and a certain percentage of the condors are doubtless picked off each year by such criminals it is possible also that the mercenary eggcollector continues to take his annual rents though if this is done it is kept very quiet it is my impression that the present fatalities from all sources are fully balanced by the natural rate of increase there is one factor that has militated against the condor more than any other one thing namely the restriction in its food source its forage range formerly included most of the great valleys adjacent to its mountain retreats but now the valleys are almost entirely devoted to agriculture and of course far more thickly settled than formerly the mountainous areas where the condor is making its last stand seem to me likely to remain adapted to the birds existence for many yearsfifty years if not longer of course this is conditional upon the maintenance and enforcement of the present laws there is also the enlightenment of public sentiment in regard to the preservation of wild life which i believe can be depended upon this is a matter of general education which is fortunately and with no doubt whatever progressing at a quite perceptible rate yes i should say that the condor has a fair chance to survive in limited numbers another bird which in my opinion is far nearer extinction than the condor so far as california is concerned is the whitetailed kite this is a perfectly harmless bird but one which harries over the marshes where it has been an easy target for the idle duckhunter then too its range was limited to the valley bottoms where human settlement is increasingly close i know of only two live pairs within the state last year finally let me remark that the rate of increase of the california condor is not one whit less than that of the bandtailed pigeon yet there is no protection at all for the latter in this state even in the nesting season and thousands were shot last spring in the unprecedented concentration of the species in the southern coast counties see chambers in the condor for may 1912 p 108 the california condor is one of the only two species of condor now living and it is the only one found in north america as a matter of national pride and a duty to posterity the people of the united states can far better afford to lose a million dollars from their national treasury than to allow that bird to become extinct its preservation for all coming time is distinctly a white mans burden upon the state of california the laws now in force for the condors protection are not half adequate i think there is no law by which the accidental poisoning of those birds by baits put out for coyotes and foxes can be stopped a law to prevent the use of poisoned meat baits anywhere in southern california should be enacted at the next session of californias legislature the fine for molesting a condor should be raised to 500 with a long prisonterm as an alternative a competent interested game warden should be appointed solely for the protection of the condors it is time to count those birds keep them under observation and have an annual report upon their condition the heath henbut for the protection that has been provided for it by the ornithologists of massachusetts and particularly dr george w field william brewster and john e thayer the heath hen or eastern pinnated grouse would years ago have become totally extinct new york new jersey and massachusetts began to protect that species entirely too late it was given fiveyear close seasons without avail then it was given tenyear close seasons but it was too late today the species exists only in one locality the island of marthas vineyard and concerning its present status mr forbush has recently furnished us the following clear statement the heath hens increased for two years after the massachusetts fish and game commission established a reservation for them but in 1911 they had not increased there are probably about two hundred birds extant i found a great many marsh hawks on the island and the commission did not kill them believing them to be beneficial in watching them i concluded that they were catching the young heath hens a large number of these hawks have been shot and their stomachs sent to washington for examination as i was too busy at the time to examine them so far as i know no report of the examination has been made but dr field himself examined a few of the stomachs and found the remains of the heath hen in some the warden now says that during the past two years the heath hen has not increased but i can give you no definite evidence of this i am quite sure they are being killed by natives of the island and that at least one collector supplies birds for museums we are trying to get evidence of this i believe if the heath hen is to be increased in numbers and brought back to this country we shall have to have more than one warden on the reservation and eventually we shall have to establish the bird on the mainland also illustration pinnated grouse or prairie chicken from the american natural history the pinnated grouse sage grouse and prairie sharptailin view of the fate of the grouse of the united states as it has been wrought out thus far in all the more thickly settled areas and particularly in view of the history of the heath hen we have no choice but to regard all three of the species named above as absolutely certain to become totally extinct within a short period of years unless the conditions surrounding them are immediately and radically changed for the better personally i do not believe that the gunners and gamehogs of minnesota montana nebraska idaho washington oregon and california will permit any one of those species to be saved if the present open seasons prevail in the states that i have mentioned above no power on earth can save those three species of grouse from the fate of the heath hen today their representatives exist only in small shreds and patches and from fully nineteentwentieths of their original ranges they are forever gone the sage grouse will be the first species to go it is the largest the most conspicuous the one most easily found and the biggest mark for the gunner those who have seen this bird in its native sagebrush well understand how fatally it is exposed to slaughter many appeals have been made in behalf of the pinnated grouse but the open seasons continue the gunners of the states in which a few remnants still exist are determined to have them all and the state legislatures seem disposed to allow the killers to have their way it may be however that like new york with the heath hen they will arouse and virtuously lock the stable doorafter the horse has been stolen illustration sage grouse the first of the upland game birds that will become extinct the snowy egret and american egret egretta candidissima and herodias egrettathese unfortunate birds cursed for all time by the commercially valuable aigrette plumes that they bear have had a very narrow escape from total extinction in the united states despite all the efforts made to save them the plumehunters of the millinery trade have been and still are determined to have the last feather and the last drop of egret blood in an effort to stop the slaughter in at least one locality in florida warden guy bradley was killed by a plumehunter who of course escaped all punishment through the heavenborn sympathy of a local jury of the bloody egret slaughter in florida not onetenth of the whole story ever has been told millions of adult birdsall there werewere killed in the breeding season when the plumes were ripe for the market and millions of young birds starved in their nests it was a common thing for a rookery of several hundred birds to be attacked by the plumehunters and in two or three days utterly destroyed the same bloody work is going on today in venezuela and brazil and the stories and affidavits stating that the millions of egret plumes being shipped annually from those countries are shed feathers picked up off the ground are absolute lies the men who have sworn to those lies are perjurers and should be punished for their crimes see chapter xiii by 1908 the plumehunters had so far won the fight for the egrets that florida had been swept almost as bare of these birds as the colorado desert until mr ea mcilhennys egret preserve at avery island louisiana became a pronounced success we had believed that our two egrets soon would become totally extinct in the united states but mr mcilhenny has certainly saved those birds to our fauna in 1892 he started an egret and heron preserve close beside his house on avery island by 1900 it was an established success today 20000 pairs of egrets and herons are living and breeding in that bird refuge and the two egret species are safe in at least one spot in our own country illustration snowy egrets in the mcilhenny egret preserve it is at this period that the parent birds are killed for their plumes and the young starve in the nest photo by ea mcilhenny three years ago i think there were not many birdlovers in the united states who believed it possible to prevent the total extinction of both egrets from our fauna all the known rookeries accessible to plumehunters had been totally destroyed two years ago the secret discovery of several small hidden colonies prompted william dutcher president of the national association of audubon societies and mr t gilbert pearson secretary to attempt the protection of those colonies with a fund contributed for the purpose wardens were hired and duly commissioned as previously stated one of those wardens was shot dead in cold blood by a plume hunter the task of guarding swamp rookeries from the attacks of moneyhungry desperadoes to whom the accursed plumes were worth their weight in gold is a very chancy proceeding there is now one warden in florida who says that before they get my rookery they will first have to get me thus far the protective work of the audubon association has been successful now there are twenty colonies which contain all told about 5000 egrets and about 120000 herons and ibises which are guarded by the audubon wardens one of the most important is on bird island a mile out in orange lake central florida and it is ably defended by oscar e baynard today the plume hunters who do not dare to raid the guarded rookeries are trying to study out the lines of flight of the birds to and from their feedinggrounds and shoot them in transit their motto isanything to beat the law and get the plumes it is there that the state of florida should take part in the war the success of this campaign is attested by the fact that last year a number of egrets were seen in eastern massachusettsfor the first time in many years and so today the question is can the wardens continue to hold the plumehunters at bay the woodduck aix sponsa by many birdlovers regarded as the most beautiful of all american birds is threatened with extinction in all the states that it still inhabits with the exception of eight long ago 1901 the us biological survey sounded a general alarm for this species by the issue of a special bulletin regarding its disappearance and advising its protection by long close seasons to their everlasting honor eight states responded by the enactment of long closeseason laws this is the roll of honor connecticut maine massachusetts new hampshire new jersey new york vermont west virginia illustration wood duck regularly killed as food in 15 states and how is it with the other states that number the woodduck in their avian faunas i am ashamed to tell but it is necessary that the truth should be known surely we will find that if the other states have not the grace to protect this bird on account of its exquisite beauty they will not penalize it by extra long open seasons a number of them have taken pains to provide extra long open seasons on this species usually of five or six months and this for a bird so exquisitely beautiful that shooting it for the table is like dining on birds of paradise here is a partial list of them woodduckeating states 1912 georgia kills and eats the woodduck from sept 1 to feb 1 indiana iowa and kansas do so sept 1 to apr 15 kentucky extra long does so aug 15 to apr 1 louisiana extra long sept 1 to mar 1 maryland nov 1 to apr 1 michigan oct 15 to jan 1 nebraska extra long sept 1 to apr 1 ohio sept 1 to jan 1 pennsylvania extra long sept 1 to apr 11 rhode island aug 15 to apr 1 south carolina sept 1 to mar 1 south dakota sept 10 to apr 10 tennessee aug 1 to apr 15 virginia aug 1 to jan 1 wisconsin sept 1 to jan 1 the above are the states that really possess the woodduck and that should give it one and all a series of fiveyear close seasons now is not the record something to blush for is there in those fifteen states nothing too beautiful or too good to go into the pot the woodcock philohela minor is a bird regarding which my birdhunting friends and i do not agree i say that as a species it is steadily disappearing and presently will become extinct unless it is accorded better protection they reply well i can show you where there are woodcock yet a few months ago a nova scotian writer in forest and stream came out with the bold prediction that three more years of the usual annual slaughter of woodcock will bring the species to the verge of extinction in that province it is such occurrences as this that bring the end of a species last fall 1911 at norwalk conn we had a good flight of woodcock and it is a shame the way they were slaughtered i know of a number of cases where twenty were killed by one gun in the day and heard of one case of fifty this is all wrong and means the end of the woodcock if continued there is no doubt we need a bag limit on woodcock as much as on quail or partridge woodcock in forest and stream mar 2 1912 as far back as 1901 dr ak fisher of the biological survey predicted that the woodcock and woodduck would both become extinct unless better protected as yet the better protection demanded has not materialized to any great extent says mr forbush state ornithologist of massachusetts in his admirable special report p 45 the woodcock is decreasing all over its range in the east and needs the strongest protection of thirtyeight massachusetts reports thirtysix state that woodcock are decreasing rare or extinct while one states that they are holding their own and one that they are increasing slightly since the law was passed prohibiting their sale let not any honest american or canadian sportsman lullaby himself into the belief that the woodcock is safe from extermination as sure as the world it is going the fact that a little pocket here or there contains a few birds does not in the slightest degree disprove the main fact if the sportsmen of this country desire to save the seed stock of woodcock they must give it everywhere five or tenyear close seasons and do it immediately our shore birds in generalthis group of game birds will be the first to be exterminated in north america as a group of all our birds these are the most illy fitted to survive they are very conspicuous very unwary easy to find if alive and easy to shoot never in my life have any shore birds except woodcock and snipe appealed to me as real game they are too easy to kill too trivial when killed and some of them are too rank and fishy on the plate as game for men i place them on a level with barnyard ducks or orchard turkeys i would as soon be caught stealing a sheep as to be seen trying to shoot fishy yellow legs or little joke sandpipers for the purpose of feeding upon them and yet thousands of fullgrown men some of them six feet high grow indignant and turn red in the face at the mention of a law to give all the shorebirds of new york a fiveyear close season but for all that gentlemen of the gun there are exactly two alternatives between which you shall choose 1 either give the woodcock of the eastern united states just ten times the protection that it now has or 2 bid the species a long farewell if you elect to slaughter old philohela minor on the altar of selfishness then it will be in order for the millions of people who do not kill birds to say whether that proposal shall be consummated or not read if you please mr wa mcatees convincing pamphlet biological survey no 79 on our vanishing shore birds reproduced in full in chapter xxiii he says throughout the eastern united states shore birds are fast vanishing many of them have been so reduced that extermination seems imminent so averse to shore birds are present conditions of slaughter that the wonder is that any escape all the shore birds of the united states are in great need of better protection shore birds have been hunted until only a remnant of their once vast numbers are left their limited powers of reproduction coupled with the natural vicissitudes of the breeding period make their increase slow and peculiarly expose them to danger of extermination so great is their economic value that their retention in the game list and their destruction by sportsmen is a serious loss to agriculture and yet here in new york state there are many men who think they know who indignantly scoff at the idea that our shore birds need a fiveyear close season to help save them from annihilation the writers appeal for this at a recent convention of the new york state fish game and forest league fell upon deaf ears and was not even seriously discussed the shorebirds must be saved and just at present it seems that the only persons who will do it are those who are not sportsmen and who never kill game if the sportsmen persist in refusing to act to them we must appeal besides the woodcock and snipe the species that are most seriously threatened with extinction at an early date are the following species in great danger willet catoptrophorus semipalmatus dowitcher macrorhamphus griseus knot redbreasted sandpiper tryngites subruficollis upland plover bartramia longicauda golden plover charadrius dominicus pectoral sandpiper pisobia maculata of these fine species mr forbush whose excellent knowledge of the shore birds of the atlantic coast is well worth the most serious consideration says that the upland plover or bartramian sandpiper is in imminent danger of extinction five reports from localities where this bird formerly bred give it as nearing extinction and four as extinct this is one of the most useful of all birds in grass land feeding largely on grasshoppers and cutworms there is no difference of opinion in regard to the diminution of the shore birds the reports from all quarters are the same it is noteworthy that practically all observers agree that considering all species these birds have fallen off about 75 per cent within twentyfive to forty years and that several species are nearly extirpated illustration the gray squirrel a familiar friend when protected in 1897 when the zoological society published my report on the extermination of our birds and mammals we put down the decrease in the volume of bird life in massachusetts during the previous fifteen years at twentyseven per cent the later and more elaborate investigations of mr forbush have satisfactorily vindicated the accuracy of that estimate there are other north american birds that easily might be added to the list of those now on the road to oblivion but surely the foregoing citations are sufficient to reveal the present desperate conditions of our bird life in general now the question is what are the great american people going to do about it the gray squirrelthe gray squirrel is in danger of extermination although it is our most beautiful and companionable small wild animal and really unfit for food americans have strangely elected to class it as game and shoot it to death to eat and this in stallfed america in the twentieth century americans are the only white people in the world who eat squirrels it would be just as reasonable and no more barbarous to kill domestic cats and eat them their flesh would taste quite as good as squirrel flesh and some of them would afford quite as good sport every intelligent person knows that in the united states the deadly shotgun is rapidly exterminating every bird and every small mammal that is classed as game and which legally may be killed even during two months of the twelve the market gunners slaughter ducks grouse shore birds and rabbits as if we were all starving the beautiful gray squirrel has clung to life in a few of our forests and woodlots long after most other wild mammals have disappeared but throughout at least ninetyfive per cent of its original area it is now extinct during the past thirty years i have roamed the woods of my state in several widely separated localitiesthe adirondacks catskills berkshires western new york and elsewhere and in all that time i have seen only three wild gray squirrels outside of city parks except over a very small total area the gray squirrel is already gone from the wild fauna of new york state do the wellfed people of america wish to have this beautiful animal entirely exterminated do they wish the woods to become wholly lifeless or do they desire to bring back some of the wild creatures and keep them for their children to enjoy there is no wild mammal that responds to protection more quickly than the gray squirrel in two years time wild specimens that are set free in city parks learn that they are safe from harm and become almost fearless they take food from the hands of visitors and climb into their arms one of the most pleasing sights of the zoological park is the enjoyment of visitors young and old in petting our wild gray squirrels we ask the boy scouts of america to bring back this animal to each state where it belongs by securing for it from legislatures and governors the perpetual closed seasons that it imperatively needs it is not much to ask this can be done by writing to members of the legislatures and requesting a suitable law such a request will be both right and reasonable and three states have already granted it the gray squirrel is naturally the childrens closest wildanimal friend surely every farmer boy would like to have colonies of gray squirrels around him to keep him company and furnish him with entertainment a woodlot without squirrels and chipmunks is indeed a lifeless place for 20 anyone can restock any bit of woods with the most companionable and most beautiful treedweller that nature has given us the question now is which will you choosea gray squirrel colony to every farm or lifeless desolation we ask every american to lend a hand to save silvertail chapter iv extinct and nearly extinct species of mammals when we pause and consider the years the generations and the ages that nature spends in the production of a high vertebrate species the preservation of such species from extermination should seriously concern us as a matter of fact in modern mans wild chase after wealth and pleasure it is only one person out of every ten thousand who pauses to regard such causes unless cornered by some protectionist fanatic held fast and coerced to listen we are not discussing the animals of the pleistocene or the eocene or any period of the fardistant past we are dealing with species that have been ruthlessly needlessly and wickedly destroyed by man during our own times species that had they been given a fair chance would be alive and well today in reckless waste of blood and treasure the nineteenth century has much for which to answer wars and pillage fires earthquakes and volcanoes are unhappily unavoidable like the poor of holy writ we have them with us always but the destruction of animal life is in a totally different category from the accidental calamities of life it is deliberate coldblooded persistent and in its final stage criminal worst of all there is no limit to the devilish persistence of the confirmed destroyer this side of the total extinction of species no polar night is too cold no desert inferno is too hot for the man who pursues wild life for commercial purposes the rhytina has been exterminated in the far north the elephant seals on kerguelen are being exterminated in the far south and midway in the desert mountains of lower california a fine species of mountain sheep is rapidly being shot into oblivion large mammals completely exterminated the arizona elk cervus merriamiright at our very door under our very noses and as it were only yesterday a welldefined species of american elk has been totally exterminated until recently the mountains of arizona and new mexico were inhabited by a lightcolored elk of smaller size than the wyoming species whose antlers possessed on each side only one brow tine instead of two the exact history of the blotting out of that species has not yet been written but it seems that its final extinction occurred about 1901 its extermination was only a routine incident of the devilish general slaughter of american big game that by 1900 had wiped out nearly everything killable over a large portion of the rocky mountain region and the great plains the arizona elk was exterminated before the separate standing of the species had been discovered by naturalists and before even one skin had been preserved in a museum in 1902 mr ew nelson described the species from two male skulls all the material of which he knew since that time a third male skull bearing an excellent pair of antlers has been discovered by mr ferdinand kaegebehn a member of the new york zoological society and presented to our national collection of heads and horns it came from the santa catalina mountains arizona in 1884 the species was first exterminated in the central and northern mountains of arizona probably twenty years ago and made its last stand in northwestern new mexico precisely when it became extinct there its last abiding place we do not know but in time the facts may appear the quagga equus quaggabefore the days of livingstone gordoncumming and anderson the grassy plains and halfforested hills of south africa were inhabited by great herds of a wild equine species that in its markings was a sort of connecting link between the striped zebras and the stripeless wild asses the quagga resembled a wild ass with a few zebra stripes around its neck and no stripes elsewhere there is no good reason why a mammal that is not in any one of the families regularly eaten by man should be classed as a game animal white men outside of the western border of the continent of europe do not eat horses and by this token there is no reason why a zebra should be shot as a game animal any more than a baboon a big male baboon is dangerous a male zebra is not nevertheless white men have elected to shoot zebras as game and under this curse the unfortunate quagga fell to rise no more the species was shot to a speedy death by sportsmen and by the british and dutch farmers of south africa it became extinct about 1875 and today there are only 18 specimens in all the museums of the world the blaubok hippotragus leucophaeusthe first of the african antelopes to become extinct in modern times was a species of large size closely related to the roan antelope of today and named by the early dutch settlers of cape colony the blaubok which means bluebuck it was snuffed out of existence in the year 1800 so quickly and so thoroughly that like the arizona elk it very nearly escaped the annals of natural history according to the careful investigations of mr graham renshaw there are only eight specimens in existence in all the museums of europe in general terms it may be stated that this species has been extinct for about a century davids deer elaphurus davidianuswe enter this species with those that are totally extinct because this is true of it so far as its wild state is concerned it is a deer nearly as large as the red deer of europe with 3tined antlers about equal in total length to those of the red deer its most striking differential character is its long tail a feature that among the deer of the world is quite unique originally this species inhabited northern mongolia china but in a wild state it became extinct before its zoological standing became known to the scientific world the species was called to the attention of zoologists by a roman catholic missionary called father david and when finally described it was named in his honor at the outbreak of the boxer rebellion in 1900 there were about 200 specimens living in the imperial park of china a short distance south of pekin but during the rebellion all of them were killed and eaten thus totally exterminating the species from asia fortunately previous to that calamity in 1894 the duke of bedford had by considerable effort and expenditure procured and established in his matchless park surrounding woburn abbey england a herd of eighteen specimens of this rarest of all deer that nucleus has thriven and increased until in 1910 it contained thirtyfour head owing to the fact that all the living female specimens of this remarkable species are concentrated in one spot and perfectly liable to be wiped out in one year by riot war or disease there is some cause for anxiety the writer has gone so far as to suggest the desirability of starting a new herd of davids deer at some point far distant from england as an insurance measure against the possibility of calamity at woburn excepting two or three specimens in european zoological gardens that have been favored by the duke of bedford there are no living specimens outside of woburn park illustration skeleton of a rhytina or arctic seacow in the united states national museum the rhytina rhytina gigasthe most northerly sirenian that so far as we know ever inhabited the earth lived on the commander islands in the northern end of behring sea and was exterminated by man for its oil and its flesh about 1768 it was first made known to the world by steller in 1741 and must have become extinct near the beginning of the nineteenth century the rhytina belonged to the same mammalian order as the manatee of florida and south america and the dugong of australia the largest manatee that florida has produced so far as we know was thirteen feet long the rhytina attained a length of between thirty and thirtyfive feet and a weight of 6000 pounds or over the flesh of this animal like that of the manatee and dugong must have been edible and surely was prized by the hungry sailors and natives of its time it is not strange that such a species was quickly exterminated by man in the arctic regions the wonder is that it ever existed at a latitude so outrageous for a sirenian an animal which by all precedents should prefer life in temperate or warm waters illustration burchells zebra in the us national museum now believed to be totally extinct burchells zebra equus burchelli typicusthe foundation type of what now is the burchell group of zebras consisting of four or five subspecies of the original species of burchelli is an animal abundantly striped as to its body neck and head but with legs that are almost white and free from stripes the subspecies have legs that are striped about half as much as the mountain zebra and the grevy species while there are chapman zebras and grant zebras in plenty and of crawshays not a few all these are forms that have developed northward of the range of the parent species the original equus burchelli for half a century in south africa the latter had been harried and driven and shot and now it is gone forever now the museum people of the world are hungrily enumerating their mounted specimens and live ones cannot be procured with money because there are none already it is common talk that the true burchell zebra is extinct and unfortunately there is no good reason to doubt it even if there are a few now living in some remote nook of the transvaal or zululand or portuguese east africa the chances are as 100 to 1 that they will not be suffered to bring back the species and so to burchells zebra the world is today saying farewell illustration thylacine or tasmanian wolf now being exterminated by the sheep owners of tasmania species of large mammals almost extinct the thylacine or tasmanian wolf thylacinus cynocephalusfour years ago when mr whd le souef director of the melbourne zoological garden australia stood before the cage of the living thylacine in the new york zoological park he first expressed surprise at the sight of the animal then said i advise you to take excellent care of that specimen for when it is gone you never will get another the species soon will be extinct this opinion has been supported quite independently by a lady who is the highest authority on the present status of that species mrs mary g roberts of hobart tasmania for nearly ten years mrs roberts has been procuring all the living specimens of the thylacine that money could buy and attempting to breed them at her private zoo she states that the mountain home of this animal is now occupied by flocks of sheep and because of the fact that the tasmanian wolves raid the flocks and kill lambs the sheepowners and herders are systematically poisoning the thylacines as fast as possible inasmuch as the species is limited to tasmania mrs roberts and others fear that the sheepmen will totally exterminate the remnant at an early date this animal is the largest and also the most interesting carnivorous marsupial of australia and its untimely end will be a cause for sincere regret illustration west indian seal in the new york aquarium the west indian seal monachus tropicalisfor at least fifty years all the zoologists who ever had heard of this species believed that the oilhunters had completely exterminated it in 1885 when the national museum came into possession of one poorlymounted skin from professor poey of havana it was regarded as a great prize most unexpectedly in 1886 american zoologists were startled by the discovery of a small herd on the triangle islands in the caribbean sea near yucatan by mr henry l ward now director of the milwaukee public museum and professor ferrari of the national museum of mexico they found about twenty specimens and collected only a sufficient number to establish the true character of the species since that time four living specimens have been captured and sent to the new york aquarium where they lived for satisfactory periods the indoor life and atmosphere did not seem to injure the natural vitality of the animals in fact i think they were far more lively in the aquarium than were the sluggish creatures that mr ward saw on the triangle reefs and described in his report of the expedition it is quite possible that there are yet alive a few specimens of this odd species but the damocletian sword of destruction hangs over them suspended by a fine hair and it is to be expected that in the future some roving sea adventurer will pounce upon the remnant and wipe it out of existence for whatever reason may to him seem good illustration california elephant seal photographed on guadalupe island by ch townsend the california elephant seal mirounga angustirostristhis remarkable longsnouted species of seal was reluctantly stricken from the fauna of the united states several years ago and for at least fifteen years it has been regarded as totally extinct last year however 1911 the albatross scientific expedition under the control of director ch townsend of the new york aquarium visited guadalupe island 175 miles off the pacific coast of lower california and there found about 150 living elephant seals they took six living specimens all of which died after a few months in captivity ever since that time first one person and then another comes to the front with a cheerful proposition to go to those islands and clean up all the remainder of those wonderful seals one hunting party could land on guadalupe and in one week totally destroy the last remnant of this almost extinct species today the only question is who will be mean enough to do it fortunately those seals have no commercial value whatsoever the little oil they would yield would not pay the wages of cooks mate the proven impossibility of keeping specimens alive in captivity even for one year and the absence of cash value in the skins even for museum purposes has left nothing of value in the animals to justify an expedition to kill or to capture them no zoological garden or park desires any of them at any price adult males attain a length of sixteen feet and females eleven feet formerly this species was abundant in san christobal bay lower california at present mexico is in no frame of mind to provide real protection to a small colony of seals of no commercial value 175 miles from her mainland on an uninhabited island it is wildly improbable that those seals will be permitted to live it is a safe prediction that our next news of the elephant seals of guadalupe will tell of the total extinction of those last 140 survivors of the species the california grizzly bear ursus horribilis californicusno one protects grizzly bears except in the yellowstone park and other game preserves for obvious reasons it is impossible to say whether any individuals of this huge species now remain alive or how long it will be until the last one falls before a 405 winchester engine of extermination we know that a living specimen can not be procured with money and we believe that old monarch now in golden gate park san francisco is the last specimen of his species that ever will be exhibited alive i can think of no reason save general californian apathy why the extinction of this huge and remarkable animal was not prevented by law the sunset grizzly on a railroad track is the advertising emblem of the golden state and surely the state should take sufficient interest in the species to prevent its total extermination but it will not california is hellbent on exterminating a long list of her wildlife species and it is very doubtful whether the masses can be reached and aroused in time to stop it name some of the species certainly with all the pleasure in life the bandtailed pigeon the whitetailed kite the sharptailed grouse the sage grouse the mountain sheep pronghorned antelope california mule deer and ducks and geese too numerous to mention chapter v the extermination of species state by state early in 1912 i addressed to about 250 persons throughout the united states three questions as follows 1 what species of birds have become totally extinct in your state 2 what species of birds and mammals are threatened with early extinction 3 what species of mammals have been exterminated throughout your state these queries were addressed to persons whose tastes and observations rendered them especially qualified to furnish the information desired the interest shown in the inquiry was highly gratifying the best of the information given is summarized below but this tabulation also includes much information acquired from other sources the general summary of the subject will i am sure convince all thoughtful persons that the present condition of the best wild life of the nation is indeed very grave this list is not submitted as representing

practice it matters not how murderous to accomplish the pernicious ends of their nefarious campaign of relentless extermination of fur and feather they cannot be controlled by local laws for these after having been tried for several generations have proven consummate failures for the reason that local authorities will not enforce the provisions of game and bird protective statutes experience has demonstrated the fact that no one desires to inform voluntarily on his neighbors and since breaking the game law is not construed to involve moral turpitude even to an infinitesimal degree by many of our citizens the plunderers of natures storehouse thus go free it matters not how great the damage done to the people as a wholejohn h wallace jr game commissioner of alabama alaska thanks to geographic and climatic conditions the alaskan game laws and 15000 with which to enforce them the status of the wild life of alaska is fairly satisfactory i think that at present no species is in danger of extinction in the near future when it was pointed out to congress in 1902 by madison grant ts palmer and others that the wild life of alaska was seriously threatened congress immediately enacted the law that was recommended and now appropriates yearly a fair sum for its enforcement i regard the alaskan situation as being for so vast and difficult a region reasonably well in hand even though open to improvement there is one fatal defect in our alaskan game law in the perpetual and sweeping license to kill that is bestowed upon natives and prospectors under cover of this law the indians can slaughter game to any extent they choose and they are great killers for example in 1911 at sand point kenai peninsula frank e kleinchmidt saw 82 caribou tongues in the boat of a native

doomed to early extinction many will testify to their abundance in those years in south dakota 1902 when the great land movement was taking place the influx of hungry settlers together with an occasional bad season decimated their ranks they were eaten by the farmers both in and out of season driven from pillar to post with no friends and insufficient foodwhat else then can be expected mr

obtain answers from fortyeight states to the three questions that i have asked that could be offered as absolutely exact all these reports are submitted on the wellrecognized courttestimony basisto the best of our knowledge and belief gathered as they have been from persons whose knowledge is good these opinions are therefore valuable and they furnish excellent indices of wildlife conditions as they exist in 1912 in the various states and provinces of north america north of mexico chapter vi the regular army of destruction in order to cure any disease the surgeon must make of it a correct diagnosis it is useless to try to prescribe remedies without a thorough understanding of the trouble that the best and most interesting wild life of america is disappearing at a rapid rate we all know only too well that proposition is entirely beyond the domain of argument the fact that a species or a group of species has made a little gain here and there or is stationary does not sensibly diminish the force of the descending blow the wildlife situation is full of surprises for example in 1902 i was astounded by the extent to which bird life had decreased over the 130 miles between miles city montana and the missouri river since 1886 for there was no reason to expect anything of the kind even the jack rabbits and coyotes had almost totally disappeared the duties of the present hour that fairly thrust themselves into our faces and will not be put aside are these firstto save valuable species from extermination secondto preserve a satisfactory representation of our once rich fauna to hand down to posterity thirdto protect the farmer and fruit grower from the enormous losses that the destruction of our insectivorous and rodenteating birds is now inflicting upon both the producer and consumer fourthto protect our forests by protecting the birds that keep down the myriads of insects that are destructive to trees and shrubs fifthto preserve to the future sportsmen of america enough game and fish that they may have at least a taste of the legitimate pursuit of game in the open that has made life so interesting to the sportsmen of today for any civilized nation to exterminate valuable and interesting species of wild mammals birds or fishes is more than a disgrace it is a crime we have no right legal moral or commercial to exterminate any valuable or interesting species because none of them belong to us to exterminate or not as we please for the people of any civilized nation to permit the slaughter of the wild birds that protect its crops its fruits and its forests from the insect hordes is worse than folly it is sheer orneryness and idiocy people who are either so lazy or asinine as to permit the slaughter of their best friends deserve to have their crops destroyed and their forests ravaged they deserve to pay twenty cents a pound for their cotton when the boll weevil has cut down the normal supply it is very desirable that we should now take an inventory of the forces that have been and today are active in the destruction of our wild birds mammals and game fishes during the past ten years a sufficient quantity of facts and figures has become available to enable us to secure a reasonably full and accurate view of the whole situation as we pause on our hilltop and survey the field of carnage we find that we are reviewing the army of destruction it is indeed a motley array we see true sportsmen beside ordinary gunners gamehogs and meat hunters handsome setter dogs are mixed up with coyotes cats foxes and skunks and wellgowned women and ladies maids are jostled by halfnaked poorwhite and blacknegro plume hunters verily the destruction of wild life makes strange companions let us briefly review the several army corps that together make up the army of the destroyers space in this volume forbids an extended notice of each unfortunately it is impossible to segregate some of these classes and number each one for they merge together too closely for that but we can at least describe the several classes that form the great mass of destroyers the gentlemen sportsmenthese men are the very bone and sinew of wild life preservation these are the men who have red blood in their veins who annually hear the red gods calling who love the earth the mountains the woods the waters and the sky these are the men to whom the bag is a matter of small importance and to whom the baglimit has only academic interest because in nine cases out of ten they do not care to kill all that the law allows the tenth and exceptional time is when the bag limit is one a gentleman sportsman is a man who protects game stops shooting when he has enoughwithout reference to the legal baglimit and whenever a species is threatened with extinction he conscientiously refrains from shooting it the true sportsmen of the world are the men who once were keen in the stubble or on the trail but who have been halted by the general slaughter and the awful decrease of game many of them long before a hair has turned gray have hung up their guns forever and turned to the camera these are the men who are willing to hand out checks or to leave their mirth and their employment and go to the firing line at their state capitols to lock horns with the bullheaded killers of wild life who recognize no check or limit save the law these are the men who have done the most to put upon our statute books the laws that thus far have saved some of our american game from total annihilation and who so we firmly believe will be chiefly instrumental in tightening the lines of protection around the remnant these are the men who are making and stocking game preserves public and private great and small illustration the regular army of destruction waiting for the first of october each year 2642274 wellarmed men take the field against the remnant of wild birds and mammals in the united states drawn by dan beard if you wish to know some of these men i will tell you where to find a goodly number of them and when you find them you will also find that they are men you would enjoy camping with look in the membership lists of the boone and crockett club campfire club of america the lewis and clark club of pittsburgh the new york state league the shikar club of london the society for the preservation of the wild fauna of the british empire the massachusetts fish and game protective association the springfield mass sportsmens association the campfire clubs of detroit and chicago and the north american fish and game protective association there are other bodies of sportsmen that i would like to name were space available but to set down here a complete list is quite impossible the best and the most of the gameprotective laws now in force in the united states and canada were brought into existence through the initiative and efforts of the real sportsmen of those two nations but for their activity exerted on the right side the settled portion of north america would today be an utterly gameless land even though the sportsmen have taken their toll of the wilds they have made the laws that have saved a remnant of the game until 1912 for all that however every man who still shoots game is a soldier in the army of destruction there is no blinking that fact such men do not stand on the summit with the men who now protect the game and do not shoot at all the millions of men who do not shoot and who also do nothing to protect or preserve wild life do not count in this warfare they are merely ciphers in front of the real figures the gunners who kill to the limitout of the enormous mass of men who annually take up arms against the remnant of wild life and are called sportsmen i believe that only one out of every 500 conscientiously stops shooting when game becomes scarce and extinction is impending all of the others feel that it is right and proper to kill all the game that they can kill up to the legal bag limit it is the reasoning of shylock justice demands it and the law doth give it especially is this true of the men who pay their one dollar per year for a resident hunting license and feel that in doing so they have done a great big thing this is a very deadly frame of mind ethically it is entirely wrong and at least two million men and boys who shoot american game must be shown that it is wrong this is the spirit of extermination clothed in the robes of law and justice whenever and wherever game birds are so scarce that a good shot who hunts hard during a day in the fields finds only three or four birds he should stop shooting at once and devote his mind and energies to the problem of bringing back the game it is strange that conditions do not make this duty clear to every conscientious citizen the shylock spirit which prompts a man to kill all that the law allows is a terrible scourge to the wild life of america and to the world at large it is the spirit of extermination according to law even the killing of game for the market is not so great a scourge as this for this spirit searches out the game in every nook and cranny of the world and spares not in effect it says if the law is defective it is right for me to take every advantage of it i do not need to have any conscience in the matter outside the letter of the law the extent to which this amazing spirit prevails is positively awful you will find it among pseudo gameprotectors to a paralyzing extent it is the great gunners paradox and it pervades this country from corner to corner no there is no use in trying to educate the mass of the hunters of america out of it as a means of saving the game for positively it can not be done do not waste time in trying it if you rely upon it you will be doing a great wrong to wild life and promoting extermination the only remedy is sweeping laws for long close seasons for a great many species forget the paltry dollarayear license money the license fees never represent more than a tenth part of the value of the game that is killed under licenses the savage desire to kill all that the law allows often is manifested in men in whom we naturally expect to find a very different spirit by way of illumination i offer three cases out of the many that i could state case no 1 the duck breedera gentleman of my acquaintance has spent several years and much money in breeding wild ducks from my relations with him i had acquired the belief that he was a great lover of ducks and at least wished all species well one whizzing cold day in winter he called upon me and stated that he had been duckhunting which surprised me he added i have just spent two days on great south bay and i made a great killing in the two days i got ninetyfour ducks i said how could you do itcaring for wild ducks as you do well i had hunted ducks twice before on great south bay and didnt have very good luck but this time the cold weather drove the ducks in and i got square with them case no 2 the ornithologista short time ago the news was published in forest and stream that a wellknown ornithologist had distinguished himself in one of the midwestern states by the skill he had displayed in bagging thirtyfour ducks in one day greatly to the envy of the natives and if this shoe fits any american naturalist he is welcome to put it on and wear it case no 3 the sportsmana friend of mine in the south is the owner of a game preserve in which wild ducks are at times very numerous once upon a time he was visited by a northern sportsmen who takes a deep and abiding interest in the preservation of game the sportsman was invited to go out duckshooting ducks being then in season there he said yes i will go and i want you to put me in a place where i can kill a hundred ducks in a day i never have done that yet and i would like to do it once all right said my friend i can put you in such a place and if you can shoot well enough you can kill a hundred ducks in a day the effort was made in all earnestness there was much shooting but few were the ducks that fell before it in concluding this story my friend remarked in a tone of disgust all the gamepreserving sportsmen that come to me are just like that they want to kill all they can kill there is a bloodtest by which to separate the conscientious sportsmen from the mere gunners here it is a sportsman stops shooting when game becomes scarce and he does not object to longcloseseason laws but a gunner believes in killing all that the law allows and he objects to long close seasons i warrant that whenever and wherever this test is applied it will separate the sheep from the goats it applies in all america all asia and africa and in greenland with equal force illustration go shields a notable defender of wild life the gamehogthis term was coined by go shields in 1897 when he was editor and owner of recreation magazine and it has come into general use it has been recognized by a judge on the bench as being an appropriate term to apply to all men who selfishly slaughter wild game beyond the limits of decency although it is a harsh term and was mercilessly used by mr shields in his fierce war on the men who slaughtered game for sport it has jarred at least a hundred thousand men into their first realization of the fact that today there is a difference between decency and indecency in the pursuit of game the use of the term has done very great good but strange to say it has made for mr shields a great many enemies outside the ranks of the gamehogs themselves from this one might fairly suppose that there is such a thing as a sympathetic gamehog one thing at least is certain during a period of about six years while his war with the gamehogs was on from maine to california mr shieldss name became a genuine terror to excessive killers of game and it is reasonably certain that his war saved a great number of game birds from the slaughter that otherwise would have overtaken them the number of armed men and boys who annually take the field in the united states in the pursuit of birds and quadrupeds is enormous people who do not shoot have no conception of it and neither do they comprehend the mechanical perfection and fearful deadliness of the weapons used this feature of the situation can hardly be realized until some aspect of it is actually seen i have been at some pains to collect the latest figures showing the number of hunting licenses issued in 1911 but the total is incomplete in some states the figures are not obtainable and in some states there are no hunters license laws the figures of hunting licenses issued in 1911 that i have obtained from official sources are set forth below the united states army of destruction hunting licenses issued in 1911 alabama 5090 montana

total number of regularly licensed gunners 1486228 the average for the twentyseven states that issued licenses as shown above is 55046 for each state now the twentyone states issuing no licenses or not reporting produced in 1911 fully as many gunners per capita as did the other twentyseven states computed fairly on existing averages they must have turned out a total of 1155966 gunners making for

population 376053 had in 1911 an army of 59291 wellarmed men warring chiefly upon the big game and swiftly exterminating it how long can any of the big game stand before the army of two and onehalf million wellarmed men eager and keen to kill and out to get an equivalent for their annual expenditure in guns ammunition and other expenses in addition to the hunters themselves they are assisted by thousands of expert guides thousands of horses thousands of dogs hundreds of automobiles and hundreds of thousands of tents each biggame hunter has an experienced guide who knows the haunts and habits of the game the best feeding grounds the best trails and everything else that will aid the hunter in taking the game at a disadvantage and destroying it the biggame rifles are of the highest power the longest range the greatest accuracy and the best repeating mechanism that modern inventive genius can produce it is said that in wyoming the maxim silencer is now being used england has produced a weapon of a new type called the scatter rifle which is intended for use on ducks the best binoculars are used in searching out the game and horses carry the hunters and guides as near as possible to the game for bears baits are freely used and in the pursuit of pumas dogs are employed to the limit of the available supply the deadliness of the automobile in hunting already is so apparent that north dakota has wisely and justly forbidden their use by law 1911 the swift machine enables city gunmen to penetrate game regions they could not reach with horses and hunt through from four to six localities per day instead of one only as formerly the use of automobiles in hunting should be everywhere prohibited every appliance and assistance that money can buy the modern sportsman secures to help him against the game the game is beset during its breeding season by various wild enemiesfoxes cats wolves pumas lynxes eagles and many other predatory species the only help that it receives is in the form of an annual close seasonwhich thus far has saved in america only a few local moose whitetailed deer and a few game birds from steady and sure extermination the bag limits on which vast reliance is placed to preserve the wild game are a fraud a delusion and a snare the few local exceptions only prove the generality of the rule in every state without one single exception the bag limits are far too high and the laws are of deadly liberality in many states the bag limit laws on birds are an absolute dead letter fancy the 125 wardens of new york enforcing the baglimit laws on 150000 gunners it is this horrible condition that is enabling the licensed army of destruction to get in its deadly work on the game all over the world in america the overliberality of the laws are to blame for twothirds of the carnival of slaughter and the successful evasions of the law are responsible for the other third illustration two gunners of kansas city who believe in killing all that the law allows they are not so much to blame as the system that permits such slaughter note the pump guns illustration why the sandhill crane is becoming extinct nineteen of them killed as game by three

is tenyear close seasons on all the species threatened with extinction and immensely reduced open seasons and bag limits on all the others will the people who still have wild game take heed now and clamp down the brakes hard and fast before it is too late or will they have their game exterminated shall we have fiveyear close seasons or close seasons of 500 years we must take our choice shall we hand down to our children a gameless continent with all the shame that such a calamity will entail we have got to answer these questions like men or they will soon be answered for us by the extermination of the wild life for twentyfive years we have been smarting under the disgrace of the extermination of our bison millions let us not repeat the dose through the destruction of other species chapter vii the guerrillas of destruction we have now to deal with the guerrillas of destruction in warfare a guerrilla or bushwhacker is an armed man who recognizes none of the rules of civilized warfare and very often has no commander in france he is called a franctireur or freeshooter the guerrilla goes out to live on the country to skulk to war on the weak and never attack save from ambush or when the odds clearly are on his side his military status is barely one remove from that of the spy the meatshooters who harry the game and other wild life in order to use it as a staple food supply the italians negroes and others who shoot songbirds as food the plumehunters and the hideandtusk hunters all over the world are the guerrillas of the army of destruction let us consider some of these grand divisions in detail here is an inexorable law of nature to which there are no exceptions no wild species of bird mammal reptile or fish can withstand exploitation for commercial purposes the men who pursue wild creatures for the money or other value there is in them never give up they work at slaughter when other men are enjoying life or are asleep if they are persistent no species on which they fix the evil eye escapes extermination at their hands does anyone question this statement if so let him turn backward and look at the lists of dead and dying species the division of meatshooters contains all men who sordidly shoot for the fryingpanto save bacon and beef at the expense of the public or for the markets there are a few wilderness regions so remote and so difficult of access that the transportation of meat into them is a matter of much difficulty and expense there are a very few men in north america who are justified in living off the country for short periods the genuine prospectors always have been counted in this class but all miners who are fully located all lumbermen and railwaybuilders certainly are not in the prospectors class they are abundantly able to maintain continuous lines of communication for the transit of beef and mutton of all the meatshooters the marketgunners who prey on wild fowl and ground game birds for the bigcity markets are the most deadly to wild life enough geese ducks brant quail ruffed grouse prairie chickens heath hens and wild pigeons have been butchered by gunners and netters for the market to have stocked the whole world no section containing a good supply of game has escaped in the united states the great slaughteringgrounds have been cape cod great south bay new york currituck sound north carolina marsh island louisiana the southwest corner of louisiana the sunk lands of arkansas the lake regions of minnesota the prairies of the whole middle west great salt lake the klamath lake region oregon and southern california illustration a market gunner at work on marsh island killing mallards for the new orleans market the purchase of this island by mrs russell sage has now converted it into a bird sanctuary the output of this systematic bird slaughter has supplied the greedy game markets of boston new york philadelphia washington baltimore chicago new orleans st louis salt lake city san francisco portland and seattle the history of this industry its methods its carnage its profits and its losses would make a volume but we can not enter upon it here beyond reasonable doubt this awful traffic in dead game is responsible for at least threefourths of the slaughter that has reduced our game birds to a mere remnant of their former abundance there is no influence so deadly to wild life as that of the market gunner who works six days a week from sunrise until sunset hunting down and killing every game bird that he can reach with a chokebore gun during the past five years several of the oncegreat killing grounds have been so thoroughly shot out that they have ceased to hold their former rank this is the case with the minnesota lakes the sunk lands of arkansas the klamath lakes of oregon and i think it is also true of southern california the klamath lakes have been taken over by the government as a bird refuge currituck sound at the northeastern corner of north carolina has been so bottled up by the bayne law of new york state that curritucks greatest market has been cut off last year only onehalf the usual number of ducks and geese were killed and already many professional duck and brant shooters have abandoned the business because the commission merchants no longer will buy dead birds illustration ruffed grouse a common victim of illegal slaughter very many enormous bags of game have been made in a day by market gunners but rarely have they published any of their records the greatest kill of which i ever have heard occurred under the auspices of the glenn county club in southern california on february 5 1906 two men armed with automatic shotguns fired five shots apiece and got ten geese out of one flock in one hour they killed two hundred and eighteen geese and their bag for the day was four hundred and fifty geese the shooter who wrote the story for publication on february 12 at willows glenn county california said it being warm weather the birds had to be shipped at once in order to keep them from spoiling a photograph was made of the one hours slaughter of two hundred and eighteen geese and it was published in a western magazine with chbs story nearly all of which will be found in chapter xv the reasons why market shooting is so deadly destructive to wild life are not obscure the true sportsman hunts during a very few days only each year the market gunners shoot early and late six days a week month after month when game is abundant the price is low and a great quantity must be killed in order to make it pay well when game is scarce the market prices are high and the shooter makes the utmost exertions to find the last of the game in order to secure the big money when game is protected by law thousands of people with money desire it for their tables just the same and are willing to pay fabulous prices for what they want when they want it many a dealer is quite willing to run the risk of fines because fines dont really hurt they are only annoying the dealer wishes to make the big profit and retain his customers and besides he reasons if i dont supply him some one else will so what is the difference when game is scarce prices high and the consumers money ready there are a hundred tricks to which shooters and dealers willingly resort to ship and receive unlawful game without detection it takes the very best kind of game wardensgenuine detectives in factto ferret out these cunning illegal practices and catch lawbreakers with the goods on them so that they can be punished mind you convictions can not be secured at both ends of the line save by the most extraordinary good fortune and usually the shooter and shipper escape even when the dealer is apprehended and fined illustration a perfectly lawful bag of 58 ruffed grouse for two men from rod and gun in canada here are some of the methods that have been practiced in the past in getting illegal game into the new york market ruffed grouse and quail have both been shipped in butter firkins marked butter and latterly butter has actually been packed solidly on top of the birds ruffed grouse and quail very often have been shipped in egg crates marked eggs they have been shipped in trunks and suit casesa very common method for illegal game birds all over the united states in oklahoma when a man refuses to open his trunk for a game warden the warden joyously gets out his brace and bitt and bores an inch hole into the lower story of the trunk if dead birds are there the telltale auger quickly reveals them three years ago i was told that certain milkwagons on long island made daily collections of dead ducks intended for the new york market and the drivers kindly shipped them by express from the end of the route once upon a time a new york man gave notice that on a certain date he would be in a certain town in st lawrence county new york with a palace horsecar to buy horses car and man appeared there as advertised very ostentatiously he bought one horse and had it taken aboard the car before the gaze of the admiring populace at night when the ap had gone to bed many men appeared and into the horseless end of that car they loaded thousands of ruffed grouse the game warden who described the incident to me said that man pulled out for new york with one horse and half a car load of ruffed grouse whenever a good market exists for the sale of game as sure as the world that market will be supplied twentysix states forbid by law the sale of their own protected game but twenty of them do not expressly prohibit the sale of game stolen from neighboring states that is a very very weak point in the laws of all those states a child can see how it works take pittsburgh as a case in point in the winter and spring of 1912 the state game commission of pennsylvania found that quail and ruffed grouse were being sold in pittsburgh in large quantities the state laws were well enforced and it was believed that the birds were not being killed in pennsylvania some other state was being robbed the game commission went to work and in a very short time certain gamedealers of pittsburgh were arrested at first they tried to bluff their way out of their difficulty and even went as far as to bring charges against the gamewarden whom the commission had instructed to buy some of their illegal game and pay for it but the net of the law tightened upon them so quickly and so tightly that they threw up their hands and begged for mercy it was found that those pittsburgh gamedealers were selling quail and grouse that had been stolen in thousands from the state of kentucky between the state game laws working in lovely harmony with the lacey federal law that prohibits the shipment of game illegally killed or sold the whole bad business was laid bare and signed confessions were promptly obtained from the shippers in kentucky at that very time a good bill for the better protection of her game was before the kentucky legislature and a certain member was vigorously opposing it as he had successfully done in previous years he was told that the state was being robbed but refused to believe it then a signed confession was laid before him bearing the name of the man who was instigating his oppositionhis friendwho confessed that he had illegally bought and shipped to pittsburgh over 5000 birds the objector literally threw up his hands and said i have been wrong let the bill go through and it went illustration snow bunting a great game bird of these 8058 were found in 1902 in one new york coldstorage warehouse before the passage of the bayne law new york city was a fence for the sale of grouse illegally killed in massachusetts connecticut pennsylvania new jersey and i know not how many other states the bayne law stopped all that business abruptly and forever and if the ruffed grouse quail and ducks of the eastern states are offered for sale in chicago cincinnati baltimore and washington the people of new york and massachusetts can at least be assured that they are not to blame those two states now maintain no fences for the sale of game that has been stolen from other states they have both set their houses in order and set two examples for forty other states to follow the remedy for all this miserable gamestealing lawbreaking business is simple and easily obtained let each state of the united states and each province and canada enact a bayne law absolutely prohibiting the sale of all wild native game and the thing is done but nothing short of that will be really effective it will not do at all to let state laws rest with merely forbidding the sale of game protected by the state for that law is full of loopholes it does much good service yes but what earthly objection can there be in any state to the enactment of a law that is sweepingly effective and which can not be evaded save through the criminal connivance of officers of the law by way of illustration to show what the sale of wild game means to the remnant of our game and the wicked slaughter of nongame birds to which it leads consider these figures dead birds found in one cold storage house in new york in 1902 snow buntings 8058 grouse 7560 sandpipers 7607 quail 4385 plover 5218 ducks 1756 snipe 7003 bobolinks 288 yellowlegs 788 woodcock 96 the fines for this lot if imposed would have amounted to 1168315 shortly after that seizure american quail became so scarce that in effect they totally disappeared from the banquet tables of new york i can not recall having been served with one since 1903 but the little egyptian quail can be legally imported and sold when officially tagged few persons away from the firing line realize the farreaching effects of the sale of wild game here are a few flashes from the searchlight at hangkow china mr c william beebe found that during his visit in 1911 over 46000 pheasants of various species were shipped from that port on one coldstorage steamer to the london market and this when english pheasants were selling in the covent garden market at from two to three shillings each for fresh birds in 1910 1200 ptarmigan from norway bound for the chicago market passed through the port of new yorknot by any means the first or the last shipment of the kind the epicures of chicago are being permitted to comb the game out of norway in 1910 70000 dozen egyptian quail were shipped to europe from alexandria egypt just why that species has not already been exterminated is a zoological mystery but extermination surely will come some day and i think it will be in the near future the coast of china has been raked and scraped for wild ducks to ship to new yorkprior to the passage of the bayne law i have forgotten the figures that once were given me but they were an astonishing number of thousands for the year the division of negroes and poor whites who kill song and other birds indiscriminately will be found in a separate chapter the division of resident gamebutchersthis refers to the men who live in the haunts of big game where wardens are the most of the time totally absent and where bucks does and fawns of hoofed big game may be killed in season and out of season with impunity it includes guides ranchmen sheepherders cowboys miners lumbermen and floaters generally in times past certain taxidermists of montana promoted the slaughter of wild bison in the yellowstone park and it was a pair of rascally taxidermists who killed or caused to be killed in lost park in 1897 the very last bison of colorado it seems to be natural for the minds of men who live in america in the haunts of big game to drift into the idea that the wild game around them is all theirs very few of them recognize the fact that every other man woman and child in a given state or province has vested rights in its wild game it is natural for a frontiersman to feel that because he is in the wilds he has a godgiven right to live off the country but today that idea is totally wrong if some way can not be found to curb that allpervading propensity among our frontiersmen then we may as well bid all our openfield big game a long farewell for the deadly residents surely will exterminate it outside the game preserves the residents are in my opinion about ten times more destructive than the sportsmen a sportsman in quest of large game is in the field only from ten to thirty days all his movements are known and all his trophies are seen and counted his killing is limited by law and upon him the law is actually enforced often a resident hunts the whole twelve months of the yearfor food for amusement and for trophies to sell rarely does a game warden reach his cabin because the wardens are few the distances great and the frontier cabins are widely scattered mr carl pickhardt told me of a guide in newfoundland who had a shed in the woods hanging full of bodies of caribou and who admitted to him that while the law allowed him five caribou each year he killed each year about twentyfive mr jm phillips knows of a mountain in british columbia once well stocked with goats on which the goats have been completely exterminated by one man who lives within easy striking distance of them and who finds goat meat to his liking i have been reliably informed that in 1911 at haha lake near grande bay saguenay district pq one family of six persons killed thirtyfour woodland caribou and six moose this meant the waste of about 14000 pounds of good meat and the death of several female animals in 1886 i knew a man named owens who lived on the head of sunday creek montana who told me that in 18845 he killed thirtyfive mule deer for himself and family the family ate as much as possible the dogs ate all they could and in the spring the remainder spoiled now there is not a deer an antelope or a sage grouse within fifty miles of that lifeless waste here is a montana object lesson on the frame of mind of the resident hunter copied from outdoor life magazine denver for february 1912 it is from a letter to the editor written by cb davis november 27 28 29 and 30 1911 will remain a red letter day with a half thousand men for years to come these half thousand men gathered along the border of the yellowstone national park near gardiner montana at a point known as buffalo flats to exterminate elk the snow had driven the elk down to the foothills and buffalo flats is on the border of the park and outside the park the elk entered this little valley for food like hungry wolves shooters not hunters gathered along the border waiting to catch an elk off the reservation and kill it on november 27th about 1500 elk crossed the line and the slaughter began i have not the data of the number killed this day but it was hundreds on the 28th twentytwo stepped over and were promptly executed like custers band not one escaped on the evening of the 28th 600 were sighted just over the line and the army of 125 brave men entrenched themselves for the battle which was expected to open next morning before daylight of the 29th the battle began the elk were over the line feeding on buffalo flats one hundred and twentyfive men poured bullets into this band of 600 elk till the ground was red with blood and strewn with carcasses and in their madness they shot each other one man was shot through the eara close call another received a bullet through his coat sleeve and another was shot through the bowels and cant live my informer told me he participated in the slaughter and while he would not take fifty dollars for what he saw and the experience he went through yet he would not go through it again for 1000 when my informer got back to gardiner that day there were four sleigh loads of elk each load containing from twenty to thirtyfive elk besides thirtytwo mules and horses carrying one to two each this was only a part of the slaughter hundreds more were carried to other points and this was only one days work hundreds of wounded elk wandered back into the park to die and others died outside the park the station at livingston montana for a week looked like a packing house carcasses were piled up on the trucks and depot platform the baggage cars were loaded with elk going to points east and west of livingston maybe this is all right maybe the government cant stop the elk from crossing the line maybe the elk were helped over but it strikes me there is something wrong somewhere the division of hired laborersthe scourge of lumbercamps in biggame territory the mining camps and the railroadbuilders is a long story and if told in detail it would make several chapters their awful destructiveness is well known it is a common thing for the boss to hire a hunter to kill big game to supply the hungry outfit and save beef and pork the abuses arising from this source easily could be checked and finally suppressed a tenline law would do the businessforbidding any person employed in any camp of sheep men cattle men lumbermen miners railway laborers or excavators to own or use a rifle in hunting wild game and forbidding any employer of labor to feed those laborers or permit them to be fed on the flesh of wild game mammals or birds camp laborers are not pioneers not by a long shot they are soldiers of commerce and makers of money a mountain sheep case in coloradothe state of colorado sincerely desires to protect and perpetuate its slender remnant of mountain sheep but as usual the lawless miscreant is abroad to thwart the efforts of the guardians of the game every state that strives to protect its big game has such doings as this to contend with in the winter of 191112 a resident poacher brought into grant colorado a lot of mountain sheep meat for sale and he actually sold it to residents of that town the price was six cents per pound a lot of it was purchased by the railway stationagent i have no doubt that the same man who did that job which was made possible only by the cooperation of the citizens of grant will try the same poachingandselling game next winter unless the state game commissioner is able to bring him to book a wyoming case in pointas a fair sample of what game wardens and the general public are sometimes compelled to endure through the improper decisions of judges i will cite this case in the shoshone mountains of northern wyoming about fifty miles or so from the town of cody in the winter of 191112 a man was engaged in trapping coyotes it was currently reported that he had been driven out of montana and idaho he had scores of traps he baited his traps with the flesh of deer elk calves and grouse all illegally killed and illegally used for that purpose a man of my acquaintance saw some of this game meat actually used as described the man was a notorious character and cruel in the extreme finally a game warden caught him redhanded arrested him and took him to cody for trial it happened that the judge on the bench had once trapped with him and therefore he set the gamekiller free while the gamewarden was roasted that wolftrapper once took into the mountains a horse to kill and use as bearbait the animal was blind in one eye and because it would not graze precisely where the wolfer desired it to remain he deliberately destroyed the sight of its good eye and left it for days without the ability to find water think of the fate of any wild animal that unkind fate places at the mercy of such a man chapter viii unseen foes of wild life quite unintentionally on his part man the arch destroyer and the most predatory and merciless of all animal species except the wolves has rendered a great service to all the birds that live or nest upon the ground his relentless pursuit and destruction of the savagetempered strongjawed furbearing animals is in part the salvation of the ground birds of today and yesterday if the teeth and claws had been permitted to multiply unchecked down to the present time with mans warfare on the upland game proceeding as it has done scores upon scores of species long ere this would have been exterminated but the slaughter of the millions of north american foxes wolves weasels skunks and mink has so overwhelmingly reduced the fourfooted enemies of the birds that the balance of wild nature has been preserved as a rule the few predatory wild animals that remain are not slaughtering the birds to a serious extent and for this we may well be thankful the domestic catin such thickly settled communities as our northern states from the atlantic coast to the sandhills of kansas and nebraska the domestic cat is probably the greatest fourfooted scourge of bird life thousands of persons who never have seen a hunting cat in action will doubt this statement but the proof of its truthfulness is only too painfully abundant unhappily it is the way of the hunting cat to stalk unseen and to kill the very birds that are most friendly with man and most helpful to him in his farming and fruitgrowing business the quail is about the only game bird that the cat affects seriously and to it the cat is very destructive it is the robin catbird thrush bluebird dove woodpecker chickadee phoebe tanager and other birds of the lawn the garden and orchard that afford good hunting for sly and savage old thomas when i was a boy in my teens i had a lasting series of object lessons on the cat as a predatory animal our betty was the most ambitious and successful domesticcat hunter of wild mammals of which i ever have heard to her rats and mice were mere childsplay and after a time their pursuit offered such tame sport that she sought fresh fields for her prowess then she brought in young rabbits chipmunks and thirteenlined spermophiles and once she came in quite exhausted half dragging and half carrying a big fat pocket gopher with her it seemed to be a point of honor that she should bring in her game and display it little did we realize then that in course of time the wild birds would become so scarce that their slaughter by house cats would demand legislative action in the states in considering the hunting cat let us call in a credible witness of the effects of domestic cats on the bob white the following is an eyewitness report by ernest b beardsley in outdoor life for april 1912 the locality was wellington sumner county kansas in the meantime old queen was having a high old time up ahead some hundred feet by then running up the bank and back down in the draw we had hardly caught up when up goes mr savages gun and he gives both barrels i had seen nothing up to date but i didnt have long to wait for by the time i got up to him and the dog they were both in the high grass and had a great big common gray maltese housecat and queen had a halfeaten quail that mr cat was busy with when disturbed well we followed the draw across the field and got nine of a covey of sixteen that had been ahead of mr cat and about four oclock that evening we killed another whiteandgray cat while driving home that night mr savage told me that he had killed fifty or more in three or four years they will get in a draw full of tumblegrass on a cold day when quail dont like to fly and stay right with them and even after feeding on two or three they will lie and watch and when the covey moves they move when eating time comes around they are at it again and to a covey of young birds they are sure death to the whole covey well will told me never to overlook a housecat that i found as far as a quarter of a mile from a farm or ranch for if they have not already turned wild they are learning how easy it is to hunt and live on game and are almost as bad we found mr blackandwhite hunter had eaten two quail just before we killed him that evening i would rather not write what mr savage said when we found the remains of a partlyeaten bird my advice is dont let tame cats get away when found out hunting for the chances are they have not seen a home in months and maybe yearsand say but they do get big and bad when you meet one give it to him good and dont let your dog run up to him until he is out for keeps i learned afterwards that was how will knew it was a cat queen had learned to back off and call for help on cats some years before in the new york zoological park we have had troubles of our own with marauding cats they establish themselves in a day and quickly learn where to seek easy game and good cover in the daytime they lie close in the thick brush exactly as tigers do in india but if not molested for a period of days they become bold and attack game in open view one birdkilling cat was so shy of man that it was only after two weeks of hard hunting mornings and evenings that it was killed we have seen cats catch and kill gray squirrels chipmunks robins and thrushes and have found the feathers of slaughtered quail once we had gray rabbits breeding in the park and their number reached between eighty and ninety for a time they fearlessly hopped about in sight from our windows and they were of great interest to visitors and to all of us then the cats began upon them and in one year there was not a rabbit to be seen save at rare intervals at the same time the chipmunks of the park were almost exterminated that was the last straw and we began a vigorous war upon those wild and predatory cats the cats came off second best we killed every cat that was found hunting in the park and we certainly got some that were big and bad we eliminated that pest and we are keeping it eliminated and with what result in 1911 a covey of eleven quail came and settled in our grounds and have remained there twenty times at least during the past eight months winter and spring i have seen the flock on the granite ledge not more than forty feet from the rear window of my office last spring when i left the administration building at six oclock after the visitors had gone i found two halfgrown rabbits calmly roosting on the doormat the rabbits are slowly coming back and the chipmunks are visibly increasing in number the gray squirrels now chase over the walks without fear of any living thing and our ducklings and young guineas and peacocks are safe once more that cats destroy annually in the united states several millions of very valuable birds seems fairly beyond question i believe that in settled regions they are worse than weasels foxes skunks and mink combined because there are about one hundred times as many of them and those that hunt are not afraid to hunt in the daytime of course i am not saying that all cats hunt wild game but in the country i believe that fully onehalf of them do i am personally acquainted with a cat in indiana on the farm of relatives which is notorious for its hunting propensities and its remarkable ability in capturing game even the lady who is joint owner of the cat feels very badly about its destructiveness and has said over and over again that it ought to be killed but the cat is such a family pet that no one in the family has the heart to destroy it and as yet no stranger has come forward to play the part of executioner the lady in question assured me that to her certain knowledge that particular cat would watch a nestful of young robins week after week until they had grown up to such a size that they were almost ready to fly then he would kill them and devour them old tommy was too wise to kill the robins when they were unduly small in a great book entitled useful birds and their protection by eh forbush state ornithologist of massachusetts and published by the massachusetts state board of agriculture in 1905 there appears on page 362 many interesting facts on this subject for example mr william brewster tells of an acquaintance in maine who said that his cat killed about fifty birds a year mr ac dike wrote to mr forbush of a cat owned by a family and well cared for they watched it through one season and found that it killed fiftyeight birds including the young in five nests nearly a hundred correspondents scattered through all the counties of the state report the cat as one of the greatest enemies of birds the reports that have come in of the torturing and killing of birds by cats are absolutely sickening the number of birds killed by them in this state is appalling some cat lovers believe that each cat kills on the average not more than ten birds a year but i have learned of two instances where more than that number were killed in a single day and another where seven were killed if we assume however that the average cat on the farm kills but ten birds per year and that there is one cat to each farm in massachusetts we have in round numbers seventy thousand cats killing seven hundred thousand birds annually illustration a hunting cat and its victim this cat had fed so bountifully on the rabbits and squirrels of the zoological park that it ate only the brain of this gray rabbit in mr forbushs book there is an illustration of the cat which killed fiftyeight birds in one year and the animal was photographed with a dead robin in its mouth the portrait is reproduced in this chapter last year a strong effort was made in massachusetts to enact a law requiring cats to be licensed on account of the amount of work necessary in passing the nosaleofgame bill that measure was not pressed and so it did not become a law but another year it will undoubtedly be passed for it is a good bill and extremely necessary at this time such a law is needed in every state there is a mark by which you may instantly and infallibly know the worst of the wild catsby their presence away from home hunting in the open kill all such wherever found the harmless cats are domestic in their tastes and stay close to the family fireside and the kitchen being properly fed they have no temptation to become hunters there are cats and cats just as there are men and men some tolerable many utterly intolerable no sweeping sentiment for all cats should be allowed to stand in the way of the abatement of the huntingcat nuisances of all men the farmer cannot afford the luxury of their existence it is too expensive with him it is a matter of dollars and cash out of pocket for every hunting cat that he tolerates in his neighborhood there are two places in which to strike the hunting cats in the open and in the state legislature while this chapter was in the hands of the compositors the hunting cat and gray rabbit shown in the accompanying illustration were brought in by a keeper dogs as destroyers of birdsi have received many letters from protectors of wild life informing me that the destruction of groundnesting birds and especially of upland game birds by roaming dogs has in some localities become a great curse to bird life complaints of this kind have come from new york massachusetts connecticut pennsylvania and elsewhere usually the culprits are hunting dogssetters pointers and hounds now surely it is not necessary to set forth here any argument on this subject it is not open to argument or academic treatment of any kind the cold fact is in the breeding season of birds and while the young birds are incapable of quick and strong flight all dogs of every description should be restrained from free hunting and all dogs found hunting in the woods during the season referred to should be arrested and their owners should be fined twenty dollars for each offense incidentally onehalf the fine should go to the citizen who arrests the dog the method of restraining hunting dogs should devolve upon dog owners and the law need only prohibit or punish the act beyond a doubt in states that still possess quail and ruffed grouse free hunting by hunting dogs leads to great destruction of nests and broods during the breeding season telegraph and telephone wiresmr daniel c beard has strongly called my attention to the slaughter of birds by telegraph wires that has come under his personal observation his country home at redding connecticut is near the main line of the new york new haven and hartford railway along which a line of very large poles carries a great number of wires the wires are so numerous that they form a barrier through which it is difficult for any bird to fly and come out alive and unhurt mr beard says that among the birds killed or crippled by flying against those wires near redding he has seen the following species olivebacked thrush whitethroated sparrow and other sparrows oriole blue jay rail ruffed grouse and woodcock it is a common practice for employees of the railway and others living along the line to follow the line and pick up on one excursion enough birds for a potpie beyond question the telegraph and telephone wires of the united states annually exact a heavy toll in bird life and claim countless thousands of victims they may well be set down as one of the unseen forces destructive to birds naturally we ask what can be done about it i am told that in scotland such slaughter is prevented by the attachment of small tags or discs to the telephone wires at intervals of a few rods sufficiently near that they attract the attention of flying birds and reveal the line of an obstruction this system should be adopted in all regions where the conditions are such that birds kill themselves against telegraph wires and an excellent place to begin would be along the line of the ny nh h railway wild animalsbeyond question it is both desirable and necessary that any excess of wild animals that prey upon our grouse quail pheasants woodcock snipe mallard duck shore birds and other species that nest on the ground should be killed since we must choose between the two the birds have it weasels and foxes and skunks are interesting and they do much to promote the hilarity of life in rural districts but they do not destroy insects and are of comparatively little value as destroyers of the noxious rodents that prey upon farm crops while a few persons may dispute the second half of this proposition the burden of proof that my view is wrong will rest upon them and having spent eighteen years on the farm i think i am right if there is any positive evidence tending to prove that the small carnivores that we class as vermin are industrious and persistent destroyers of noxious rodentspocket gophers moles fieldmice and ratsor that they do not kill wild birds numerously now is the time to produce it because the tide of public sentiment is strongly setting against the weasels mink foxes and skunks once upon a time a shrewd young man in the zoological park discovered a weasel hiding behind a stone while devouring a sparrow that it had just caught and killed he stalked it successfully seized it in his bare hand and even though bitten made good the capture the state of pennsylvania is extensively wooded with forests and with brush which affords excellent home quarters and breeding grounds for mammalian vermin the small predatory mammals are so seriously destructive to ruffed grouse and other ground birds that the state game commission is greatly concerned when the hunters license law is enacted as it very surely will be at the next session of the legislature 1913 a portion of the 70000 that it will produce each year will be used by the commission in paying bounties on the destruction of the surplus of vermin through the pursuit of vermin any farmer can easily win enough bounties to more than pay the cost of his annual hunting license one dollar and the farmers boys will find a new interest in life in some portions of the rocky mountain region the assaults of the large predatory mammals and birds on the young of the biggame species occasionally demand special treatment in the yellowstone park the pumas multiplied to such an extent and killed so many young elk that their number had to be systematically reduced to that end buffalo jones was sent out by the government to find and destroy the intolerable surplus of pumas in the course of his campaign he killed about forty much to the benefit of the elk herds around the entrance to the den of a big old male puma mr jones found the skulls and other remains of nine elk calves that the old tom had killed and carried there pumas and lynxes attack and kill mountain sheep and the golden eagle is very partial to mountain sheep lambs and mountain goat kids it will not answer to permit birds of that bold and predatory species to become too numerous in mountains inhabited by goats and sheep and the fewer the mountain lions the better for they like the lynx and eagle have nothing to live upon save the game the wolves and coyotes have learned to seek the ranges of cattle horses and sheep where they still do immense damage chiefly in killing young stock in spite of the great sums that have been paid out by western states in bounties for the destruction of wolves in many many places the gray wolf still persists and can not be exterminated to the stockmen of the west the wolf question is a serious matter the stockmen of montana say that a government expert once told them how to get rid of the gray wolves his instructions were locate the dens and kill the young in the dens soon after they are born all very easy to say but a trifle difficult to do said my informant and the ranchman seem to think they are yet a long way from a solution of the wolf question during the past year the destruction of noxious predatory animals in the national forest reserves has seriously occupied the attention of the united states bureau of forestry by the foresters of that bureau the following animals were destroyed in fifteen western states 6487 coyotes 870 wildcats 72 lynxes 213 bears 88 mountain lions 172 gray wolves 69 wolf pups 7971 in 1910 the total was 9103 illustration the eastern red squirrel a great destroyer of birds the red squirrelonce in a great while conditions change in subtle ways wild creatures unexpectedly increase in number and a community awakens to the fact that some wild species has become a public nuisance in a small city park even gray squirrels may breed and become so fearfully numerous that in their restless quest for food they may ravage the nests of the wild birds kill and devour the young and become a pest in the zoological park in 1903 we found that the red squirrels had increased to such a horde that they were driving out all our nesting wild birds driving out the gray squirrels and making themselves intolerably obnoxious we shot sixty of them and brought the total down to a reasonable number wherever he is or whatever his numerical strength the red squirrel is a bad citizen and while we do not by any means favor his extermination he should resolutely be kept within bounds by the rifle when a crow nested in our woods near the beaver pond we were greatly pleased but with the feeding of the first brood the crows began to carry off ducklings from the wildfowl pond after one crow had been seen to seize and carry away five young ducks in one forenoon we decided that the constitutional limit had been reached for we did not propose that all our young mallards should be swept into the awful vortex of that crow nest we took those young crows and reared them by hand but the old one had acquired a bad habit and she persisted in carrying off young ducks until we had to end her existence with a gun it was a painful operation but there was no other way illustration coopers hawk a species to be destroyed birddestroying birdsthere are several species of birds that may at once be put under sentence of death for their destructiveness of useful birds without any extenuating circumstances worth mentioning four of these are coopers hawk the sharpshinned hawk pigeon hawk and duck hawk fortunately these species are not so numerous that we need lose any sleep over them indeed i think that today it would be a mighty good collector who could find one specimen in seven days hunting like all other species these too are being shot out of our bird fauna several species of birdeating birds are trembling in the balance and under grave suspicion some of them are the great horned owl screech owl butcher bird or great northern shrike the only circumstance that saves these birds from instant condemnation is the delightful amount of rats mice moles gophers and noxious insects that they annually consume in view of the awful destructiveness of the accursed bubonicplaguecarrying rat we are impelled to think long before placing in our killing list even the great horned owl who really does levy a heavy tax on our upland game birds as to the butcher bird we feel that we ought to kill him but in view of his record on wild mice and rats we hesitate and finally decline illustration sharpshinned hawk a species to be destroyed snakesmr thomas m upp a close and long observer of wild things wishes it distinctly understood that while the common blacksnakes and racers are practically harmless to birds the pilot blacksnake long thick and truculentis a great scourge to nesting birds it seems to be deserving of death mr upp speaks from personal knowledge and his condemnation of the species referred to is quite sweeping at the same time mr raymond l ditmars points out the fact that this serpent feeds during 6 months of the year on mice and in doing so renders good service in the south it is called the mouse snake illustration the cat that killed 58 birds in one year from mr forbushs book photo by ac dyke chapter ix the destruction of wild life by diseases every cause that has the effect of reducing the total of wildlife population is now a matter of importance to mankind the violent and universal disturbance of the balance of nature that already has taken place throughout the temperate and frigid zone offers not only food for thought but it calls for vigorous action there are vast sections in the populous centres of western civilization where the destruction of species even to the point of extermination is fairly inevitable it is the way of christian man to destroy all wild life that comes within the sphere of influence of his iron heel with the exception of the big game this destruction is largely a temperamental result peculiar to the highest civilization in india where the same fields have been plowed for wheat and dahl and raggi for at least 2000 years the indian antelope or black buck the saras crane and the adjutant stalk through the crops and the nilgai and gazelle inhabit the eroded ravines in an agricultural land that averages 1200 people to the square mile we have seen that even in farming country where mud villages are as thick as farm houses in nebraska wild animals and even hoofed game can live and hold their own through hundreds of years of close association with man the explanation is that the hindus regard wild animals as creatures entitled to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness and they are not anxious to shoot every wild animal that shows its head in the united states nearly every gameinhabited community is animated by a feeling that every wild animal must necessarily be killed as soon as seen and this sentiment often leads to disgraceful things for instance in some parts of new england a deer straying into a town is at once beset by the hue and cry and it is chased and assaulted until it is dead by violent and disgraceful means new york state however seems to have outgrown that spirit during the past ten years at least a dozen deer in distress have been rescued from the hudson river or in inland towns or in barnyards in the suburbs of yonkers and new york and carefully cared for until the zoo people could be communicated with last winter about 13 exhausted grebes and one loon were picked up cared for and finally shipped with tender care to the zoological park one distressed dovekie was picked up but failed to survive the sentiment for the conservation of wild life has changed the mental attitude of very many people the old chinesemalay spirit which cries kill kill and at once runs amuck among suddenly discovered wild animals is slowly being replaced by a more humane and intelligent sentiment this is one of the hopeful and encouraging signs of the times the destruction of wild animals by natural causes is an interesting subject even though painful we need to know how much destruction is wrought by influences wholly beyond the control of man and a few cases must be cited rinderpest in africaprobably the greatest slaughter ever wrought upon wild animals by diseases during historic times was by rinderpest a cattle plague which afflicted africa in the last decade of the previous century originally the disease reached africa by way of egypt and came as an importation from europe from egypt it steadily traveled southward reaching somaliland in 1889 in 1896 it reached the zambesi river and entered rhodesia from thence it went on southward almost to the cape not only did it sweep away ninety percent of the native cattle but it also destroyed more than seventyfive per cent of the buffalos antelopes and other hoofed game of rhodesia it was feared that many species would be completely exterminated but happily that fear was not realized the buffalo and antelope herds were fifteen years in breeding up again to a reasonable number but thanks to the respite from hunters which they enjoyed for several years finally they did recover throughout british east africa the supply of big game in 1905 was very great but since that time it has been very greatly diminished by shooting caribou diseasefrom time to time reports have come from the province of quebec and i think from maine and new brunswick also of many caribou having died of disease the nature of that disease has remained a mystery because it seems that no pathologist ever has had an opportunity to investigate it fortunately however the alleged disease never has been sufficiently widespread or continuous to make appreciable inroads on the total number of caribou and apparently the trouble has been local scab in mountain sheepscab is a contagious and persistent skin disease that affects sheep and is destructive when not controlled fifteen years ago it prevailed in some portions of the west in colorado it has several times been reported that many bighorn mountain sheep were killed by scab which was contracted on wild mountain pastures that had been gone over by domestic sheep carrying that disease from the reports current at that time we inferred that about 200 mountain sheep had been affected it was feared that the disease would spread through the wild flocks and become general but this did not occur it seems that the remnant flocks had become so isolated from one another that the isolation of the affected flocks saved the others lumpyjaw in antelope and sheepit is a lamentable fact that some at least of the united states herds of pronghorned antelope are afflicted with a very deadly chronic infective disease known as actinomycosis or lumpyjaw it has been brought into the zoological park five times by specimens shipped from colorado texas wyoming and montana i think our first cases came to us in 1902 in its early stage this disease is so subtle and slow that it is months in developing and this feature renders it all the more deadly through the spread of infection long before the ailment can be discovered one of our antelope arrivals apparently in perfect health when received was on general principles kept isolated in rigid quarantine for two months at the expiration of that period no disease of any kind having become manifest the animal was placed on exhibition with two others that had been in the park for more than a year in perfect health in one more week the late arrival developed a swelling on its jaw drooled at the corner of the mouth and became feverishsure symptoms of the dread disease at once it was removed and isolated but in about 10 days it died the other two antelopes were promptly attacked and eventually died the course of the disease is very intense and thus far it has proven incurable in our wild animals we have lost about 10 antelopes from it and one deer usually in each case within ten days or two weeks from the discovery of the first outward signthe well known swelling on the jaw one case that was detected immediately upon arrival was very persistently treated by dr blair and the animal actually survived for four months but finally it succumbed from first to last not a single case was cured in 1912 the future of the pronghorned antelope in real captivity seems hopeless we have decided not to bring any more specimens to our institution partly because all available candidates seem reasonably certain to be affected with lumpyjaw and partly because we are unwilling to run further risks of having other hoofed animals inoculated by them today we are anxiously wondering whether the jaw disease of the pronghorn is destined to exterminate the species such a catastrophe is much to be feared this is probably one of the reasons why the antelope is steadily disappearing despite protection in 1906 we discovered the existence of actinomycosis among the black mountain sheep of northern british columbia two specimens out of six were badly affected the bones of the jaws being greatly enlarged and perforated by deep pits the black sheep of the stickine and iskoot regions are so seldom seen by white men save when a sportsman kills his allotment of three specimens we really do not know anything about the extent to which actinomycosis prevails in those herds or how deadly are its effects one thing seems quite certain from the appearance of the diseased skulls found by the writer in the taxidermic laboratory of frederick sauter in new york the enormous swelling of the diseased jaw bones clearly indicates a disease that in some cases affects its victim throughout many months such a condition as we found in those sheep could not have been reached in a few days after the disease became apparent now in our antelopes the collapse and death of the victim usually occurred in about 10 days from the time that the first swelling was observed which means a very virulent disease and rapid progress at the climax the jaw of one of our antelopes which was figured in dr blairs paper in the eleventh annual report of the new york zoological society 1906 shows only a very slight lesion in comparison with those of the mountain sheep the conclusion is that among the sheep this disease does not carry off its victims in any short period like 10 days the animal must survive for some months after it becomes apparent at least two parties of american sportsmen have shot rams afflicted with this disease but i have no reports of any sheep having been found dead from this cause this disease is well known among domestic cattle but so far as we are aware it never before has been found among wild animals the black sheep herds wherein it was found in british columbia are absolutely isolated from domestic cattle and all their influences and therefore it seems quite certain that the disease developed among the sheep spontaneouslya remarkable episode to say the least whether it will exterminate the black mountain sheep species and in time spread to the white sheep of the northwest is of course a matter of conjecture but there is nothing in the world to prevent a calamity of that kind the white sheep of yukon territory range southward until in the sheslay mountains they touch the sphere of influence of the black sheep where the disease could easily be transmitted it would be a good thing if there existed between the two species a sheepless zone about 200 miles wide i greatly fear that actinomycosis is destined to play an important part in the final extinction that seems to be the impending fate of the beautiful and valuable pronghorned antelope in view of our hard experiences extending through ten years 19021912 i think this fear is justified all persons who live in country still inhabited by antelope are urged to watch for this disease if any antelopes are found dead see if the lower jaw is badly swollen and discharging pus if it is bury the body quickly burn the ground over and advise the writer regarding the case the rabbit plagueone of the strangest freaks of nature of which we know as effecting the wholesale destruction of wild animals by disease is the rabbit plague in the northern wilderness and particularly central canada where rabbits exist in great numbers and supply the wants of a large carnivorous population this plague is well known and among trappers and woodsmen is a common topic of conversation the best treatment of the subject is to be found in ernest t setons life histories of northern animals vol i p 640 et seq from this i quote invariably the year of greatest numbers of rabbits is followed by a year of plague which sweeps them away leaving few or no rabbits in the land the denser the rabbit population the more drastically is it ravaged by the plague they are wiped out in a single spring by epidemic diseases usually characterized by swellings of the throat sores under the armpits and groins and by diarrhea the year 1885 was for the country around carberry a rabbit year the greatest ever known in that country the number of rabbits was incredible wr hine killed 75 in two hours and estimated that he could have killed 500 in a day the farmers were stricken with fear that the rabbit pest of australia was to be repeated in manitoba but the years 18867 changed all that the rabbits died until their bodies dotted the country in thousands the plague seemed to kill all the members of the vast host of 1885 the strangest item of mr setons story is yet to be told in 1890 mr seton stocked his park at cos cob conn with hares and rabbits from several widely separated localities in 1903 the plague came and swept them all away mr seton sent specimens to the zoological park for examination by the park veterinary surgeon dr w reid blair they were found to be infested by great numbers of a dangerous bloodsucking parasite known as strongylus strigosus which produces death by anemia and emaciation there were hundreds of those parasites in each animal i assisted in the examination and was shown by dr blair under the microscope that strongylus puts forth eggs literally by hundreds of thousands the life history of that parasite is not well known but it may easily develop that the cycle of its maximum destructiveness is seven years and therefore it may be accountable for the sevenyear plague among the hares and rabbits of the northern united states and canada possibly strongylus strigosus is all that stands between canada and a pest of rabbits like that of australia just why this parasite is inoperative in australia or why it has not been introduced there to lessen the rabbit evil we do not know mr seton declares that the rabbits of his park were subject to all the ills of the flesh except possibly writers paralysis and housemaids knee parasitic infection of wild ducksthe diseases of wild game especially waterfowl grouse and quail have caused heavy losses in america as well as in european countries and scientists have been carefully investigating the cause and the general nature of the maladies as well as probable methods of prevention and cure mr geo atkinson a wellknown practical naturalist of portage la prairie manitoba writes as follows to a local paper on this subject which i find quoted in the national sportsman the question which has developed these important proportions during the past year is that of the extent of the parasitic infection of our wild ducks and other game and the possibilities of the extended transmission of these parasites to domestic stock or even humanity by eating the parasites in question are contained in small elliptical cases found underlying the surface muscles of the breast and in advanced cases extending deeper into the flesh and the muscular tissues of the legs and wings they are not noticeable in the ordinary process of plucking the bird for the table and are not found internally so that the only method of discovering their presence is by slitting the skin of the breast and paring it back a few inches when the wormlike sacs will be seen buried in the flesh these parasites have come to my notice periodically during the process of skinning birds for mounting during the past number of years but it was only when they appeared in unusual numbers last fall that i made inquiries of the biological bureaus of washington and ottawa for information of their life history and the possibilities of their transmission to other hosts replies from these sources surprised me with the information that very little was known of the life history of any of the sarcosporidia of which group this was a species nothing was known of the method of infection or the transference from host to host or species to species and both departments asked for specimens for examination authorities are a unit in opinion that the question is one of great importance to game conservation and although opinions of the dangers from eating differ somewhat a record is given of a hog fed upon affected flesh developing parasites in the muscles in six weeks time while a case of a mans death from dropsy was found to be the result of development of these parasites in the valves of the heart the ability of these low forms of life to withstand extremes of heat makes it necessary for more than ordinary cooking to be assured of killing them and since their presence is unnoted in the ordinary course of dressing the birds for the table there is little doubt that very considerable numbers of these parasites are consumed at our tables every season with results at present unknown to us the species i have found most particularly infected have been mallards shovellers teal gadwall and pintails and the birds outwardly in the best condition have frequently been found loaded with sacs of these parasites and only the turning back of the breast skin can disclose their presence the greatest slaughter of wild ducks by disease occurred on great salt lake utah until the duck disease intestinal coccidiosis broke out there in the summer of 1910 the annual market slaughter of ducks at the mouth of bear river had been enormous when at salt lake city in 1888 i made an effort to arouse the sportsmen whom i met to the necessity of a reform but my exhortations fell on deaf ears naturally the sweeping away of the remaining ducks by disease would suggest a heavensent judgment upon the slaughterers were it not for the fact that the last state of the unfortunate ducks is if anything worse than the first on oct 17 1911 the annual report of the chief of the biological survey contained the following information on this subject epidemic among wild ducks on great salt lakefollowing a long dry season which favored the rearing of a large number of wild ducks but materially reduced the area of the feeding ponds resulting in great overcrowding a severe epidemic broke out about august 1 1910 among the wild ducks about great salt lake utah dead ducks could be counted by thousands along the shores and the disease raged unabated until late fall shooting clubs found it necessary to declare a closed season some of the dead ducks were forwarded to the biological survey and were turned over for examination to the bureau of animal industry by the experts of which the disease was diagnosed as intestinal coccidiosis various plans of relieving the situation were tried the irrigation ditches were closed thus providing the sloughs and ponds with fresh water and lime was sprinkled on the mud flats and duck trails great improvement followed this treatment and experiments proved that ducks provided with abundant fresh water and clean food began to recover immediately these methods promised success but later it was proposed that the marshes be drained and exposed to the suns raysa course which cannot be recommended that coccidia are not always killed by exposure to the sun is shown by their survival on the sites of old chicken yards an added disadvantage of the plan is that draining and drying the marshes would have a bad effect on the natural duck food and upon the birds themselves chapter x destruction of wild life by the elements it is a fixed condition of nature that whenever and wherever a wild species exists in a state of nature free from the trammels and limitations that contact with man always imposes the species is fitted to survive all ordinary climatic influences freedom of action and the exercise of several options in the line of individual maintenance under stress is essential to the welfare of every wild species a pronghorned antelope herd that is free can drift before a blizzard can keep from freezing by the exercise and eventually come to shelter let that same herd drift against a barbedwire fence five miles long and its whole scheme of selfpreservation is upset the herd perishes then and there cut out the undergrowth of a given section drain the swamps and mow down all the weeds and tall grass and the next particularly hard winter starves and freezes the quail naturally the cutting of forests clearing of brush and drainage of marshes is more or less calamitous to all the species of birds that inhabit such places and find there winter food and shelter redwinged blackbirds and real estate booms can not inhabit the same swamps contemporaneously before the relentless march of civilization the wild indian the bison and many of the wild birds must inevitably disappear we cannot change conditions that are as inexorable as death itself the wild life must either adjust itself to the conditions that civilized man imposes upon it or perish i say civilized man for the reason that the primitive races of man are not deadly exterminators of species as we are i know of not one species of wild life that has been exterminated by savage man without the aid of his civilized peers as civilization marches ever onward over the prairies into the bad lands and the forests over the mountains and even into the farthest corner of death valley the desert of deserts the struggle of the wild birds mammals and fishes is daily and hourly intensified man must help them to maintain themselves or accept a lifeless continent the best help consists in letting the wild creatures throughly alone so that they can help themselves but quail often need to be fed in critical periods the best food is wheat screenings placed under little tents of straw bringing food and shelter together in the well settled portions of the united states such species as quail ruffed grouse wild turkey pinnated grouse and sage grouse hang to life by slender threads a winter of exceptionally deep snows much sleet and a late spring always causes grave anxiety among the state game wardens in pennsylvania a very earnest movement is in progress to educate and persuade farmers to feed the quail in winter and much good is being done in that direction mr erasmus wilson of the pittsburgh gazettetimes is the apostle of that movement quail should be fed every winter in every northern state the methods to be pursued will be mentioned elsewhere by way of illustration here is a sample game report from las animas colorado feb 22 1912 after the most severe winter weather experienced for twenty years we are able to compute approximately our loss of feathered life it is seventyfive per cent of the quail throughout the irrigated district and about twenty per cent of meadowlarks in the rough cedarcovered sections south of the arkansas river the loss among the quail was much lighter the ground sparrows suffered severely while the english sparrow seems to have come through in good shape many cottontail rabbits starved to death while the deep light snow of january made them easy prey for hawks and coyotes ft webber it would be possible to record many instances similar to the above but why multiply them and now behold the cruel corollary at least twentyfive times during the past two years i have heard and read arguments by sportsmen against my proposal for a 5year close season for quail taking the ground that the sportsmen are not wholly to blame for the scarcity of quail it is the cold winters that kill them off so then because the fierce winters murder the bob white wholesale they should not have a chance to recover themselves could human beings possibly assume a more absurd attitude yes it is coldly and incontestably true that even after such winter slaughter as mr webber has reported above the very next season will find the quail hunter joyously taking the field his face beaming with health and good living to hunt down and shoot to death as many as possible of the pitiful 25 per cent remnant that managed to survive the pitiless winter how many quail hunters think you ever stayed their hands because of a hard winter on the quail i warrant not one out of every hundred how many states in this union ever put on a close season because of a hard winter ill warrant that not one ever did and i think there is only one state whose game commissioners have the power to act in that way without recourse to the legislature this situation is intolerable thanks to the splendid codified game laws enacted in new york state in 1912 our conservation commission can declare a close season in any locality for any length of time when the state of the game demands an emergency measure this act is as follows and it is a model law which every other state should speedily enact the new york closeseason law 152 petition for additional protection notice of hearings power to grant additional protection notice of prohibition or regulation penalties 1 petition for additional protection any citizen of the state may file with the commission a petition in writing requesting it to give any species of fish other than migratory food fish of the sea or game protected by law additional or other protection than that afforded by the provisions of this article such petition shall state the grounds upon which such protection is considered necessary and shall be signed by the petitioner with his address 2 notice of hearings the commission shall hold a public hearing in the locality or county to be affected upon the allegations of such petition within twenty days from the filing thereof at least ten days prior to such hearing notice thereof stating the time and place at which such hearing shall be held shall be advertised in a newspaper published in the county to be affected by such additional or other protection such notice shall state the name and the address of the petitioner together with a brief statement of the grounds upon which such application is made and a copy thereof shall be mailed to the petitioner at the address given in such petition at least ten days before such hearing 3 power to grant additional protection if upon such hearing the commission shall determine that such species of fish or game by reason of disease danger of extermination or from any other cause or reason requires such additional or other protection in any locality or throughout the state the commission shall have power to prohibit or regulate during the open season therefor the taking of such species of fish or game such prohibition or regulation may be made general throughout the state or confined to a particular part or district thereof 4 notice of prohibition or regulation any order made by the commission under the provisions of this section shall be signed by it and entered in its minute book at least thirty days before such prohibition or regulation shall take effect copies of the same shall be filed in the office of the clerk issuing hunting and trapping licenses for the district to which the prohibition or regulation applies it shall be the duty of said clerks to issue a copy of said prohibition or regulation to each person to whom a hunting or trapping license is issued by them to mail a copy of such prohibition or regulation to each holder of a hunting and trapping license theretofore issued by them and at that time in effect and to post a copy thereof in a conspicuous place in their office at least thirty days before such prohibition or regulation shall take effect the commission shall cause a notice thereof to be advertised in a newspaper published in the county wherein such prohibition or regulation shall take effect 5 penalties any person violating the provisions of such prohibition rule or regulation shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall upon conviction be subject to a fine of not to exceed one hundred dollars or shall be imprisoned for not more than thirty days or both for each offense in addition to the penalties hereinafter provided for taking fish birds or quadrupeds in the close season i want all sensible honest sportsmen to stop citing the killing of game birds by severe winters as a reason why long close seasons are not necessary and why automatic guns dont matter and i want sportsmen to consider their duty and not go out hunting any game species that has been slaughtered by a hard winter until it has had at least five years in which to recover any other course is cruel selfish and shortsighted and a word to the humane should be sufficient the worst exhibitions ever made of the wolfish instinct to slay that springs eternal in some human breasts are those brought about through the distress or errors of wild animals by way of illustration consider the slaughter of halfstarved elk that took place in the edge of idaho in the winter of 1909 and 1910 when about seven hundred elk that were driven out of the yellowstone park at its northwestern corner by the deep snow fled into idaho in the hope of finding food the inhabitants met the starving herds with repeating rifles and as the unfortunate animals struggled westward through the snow and storm they were slaughtered without mercy bulls and cows old and young all of the seven hundred went down and stoney indians could not have acted any worse than did those settlers on another occasion it is recorded that the pronghorned antelope herd of the mammoth hot springs wandered across the line into gardiner and quickly met a savage attack of gunners with rifles a number of those rare and valuable animals were killed and others fled back into the park with broken legs dangling in the air in the interest of public decency and for the protection of the reputation of american citizenship one of two things should be done the northern boundary of the park should be extended northward beyond gardiner or else the deathtrap should be moved elsewhere the case of the town of gardiner is referred to the legislature of montana for treatment beyond question the highest sentiments of humanity are those that are stirred by the misfortunes of killable game during the past thirty years i have noticed some interesting manifestations of the increased sympathy for wild creatures that steadily is growing in a large section of the public mind thirty years ago the appearance of a deer or moose in the streets of any eastern village nearly always was in itself a signal for a grand chase of the unfortunate creature and its speedy slaughter today in the eastern states the general feeling is quite different the appearance of a deer in the hudson river itself or a moose in a maine village is a signal not for a wild chase and cruel slaughter but for a general effort to save the animal from being hurt or killed i know this through ocular proof at least half a dozen lost and bewildered deer having been carefully driven into yards or barns and humanely kept and cared for until they could be shipped to us several have been caught while swimming in the hudson bewildered and panicstricken the latest capture occurred in new york city itself a puma that escaped about 1902 from the zoological park instead of being shot was captured by sensible people in the hamlet of bronxdale alive and unhurt and safely returned to us in some portions of the east though not all the day of the hue and cry over a wild animal in town seems to be about over on long island some humane persons found an injured turkey vulture and took it in and cared for itonly to be persecuted by illadvised game wardens because they had a forbidden wild bird in their possession there are times when it is the highest moral duty of a game warden to follow the advice of private mulvaney to the orficer boy and shut yer oye to the rigulations sorr such occurrences as these are becoming more and more common the desire of the great silent majority is to save the wild creatures and it is in response to that sentiment that thousands of people are today in the field against the army of destruction it is the duty of every sportsman to assist in promoting the passage of a law like our new york law which empowers the state game commission to throw extra protection around any species that has been slaughtered too much by snow or by firearms by closing the open season as long as may be necessary can there be in all america even one thinking reasoning being who can not see the justice and also the imperative necessity of this measure it seems impossible give the game the benefit of every doubt if it becomes too thick your gun can quickly thin it out but if it is once exterminated it will be impossible to bring it back be wise and take thought for the morrow remember the heath hen slaughter of bluebirdsin the late winter and early spring of 1896 the wave of bluebirds was caught on its northward migration by a period of unseasonably cold and fearfully tempestuous weather involving much icycold rain and sleet now there is no other climatic condition that is so hard for a wild bird or mammal to withstand as rain at the freezing point and a mantle of ice or frozen snow over all supplies of food the bluebirds perished by thousands the loss occurred practically all along their eastandwest line of migration from arkansas to the atlantic coast in places the species seemed almost exterminated and it was several years ere it recovered to a point even faintly approximating its original population i am quite certain that the species never has recovered more than 50 per cent of the number that existed previous to the calamity duck cholera in the bronx riverin 1911 some unknown but new and particularly deadly element probably introduced in sewage contaminated the waters of bronx river where it flows through new york city with results very fatal in the zoological park the large flock of mallard ducks canada geese and snow geese on lake agassiz was completely wiped out in all about 125 waterfowl died in rapid succession from causes commonly classed under the popular name of duck cholera the disease was carried to other bodies of water in the park that were fed from other sources but made no headway elsewhere than on lakes fed by the polluted bronx river fortunately the work of the bronx river parkway commission soon will terminate the present very unsanitary condition of that stream wild ducks in distressin the winter of 191112 many flocks of wild ducks decided to winter in the north many persons believe that this was largely due to the prevention of late winter and spring shooting which seems reasonable unfortunately the winter referred to proved exceptionally severe and formed vast sheets of thick ice over the feedinggrounds where the ducks had expected to obtain their food on cayuga seneca and other lakes in central new york and on the island of marthas vineyard the flocks of ducks suffered very severely and many perished of hunger and cold but for the laws prohibiting late winter shooting undoubtedly all of them would have been shot and eaten regardless of their distress game wardens and humane citizens made numerous efforts to feed the starving flocks and many ducks were saved in that way an illustrated article on the distressed ducks of keuka lake by c william beebe and verdi burtch appeared in the zoological society bulletin for may 1912 fortunately there is every reason to believe that such occurrences will be rare wild swans swept over niagara fallsduring the past ten years several winter tragedies to birds have occurred on a large scale at niagara falls whole flocks of whistling swans of from 20 up to 70 individuals alighting in the niagara river above the rapids have permitted themselves to float down into the rapids and be swept over the falls en masse on each occasion the great majority of the birds were drowned or killed on the rocks of the very few that survived few if any were able to rise and fly out of the gorge below the falls to safety it is my impression that about 200 swans recently have perished in this strange way chapter xi slaughter of songbirds by italians in these days of wildlife slaughter we hear much of death and destruction before our eyes there continually arise photographs of hanging masses of waterfowl grouse pheasants deer and fish usually supported in true heraldic fashion by the men who slew them and the implements of slaughter the world has become somewhat hardened to these things because the victims are classed as game and in the destruction of game one gamebag more or less will not count in the news of the battle the slaughter of song insectivorous and all other birds by italians and other aliens from southern europe has become a scourge to the bird life of this country the devilish work of the negroes and poor whites of the south will be considered in the next chapter in italy linnets and sparrows are game and so is everything else that wears feathers italy is a continuous slaughteringground for the migratory birds of europe and as such it is an international nuisance and a pest the way passerine birds are killed and eaten in that country is a disgrace to the government of italy and a standing reproach to the throne even kings and parliaments have no right in moral or international law to permit year after year the wholesale slaughter of birds of passage of species that no civilized man has a right to kill there are some tales of slaughter from which every properlybalanced christian mind is bound to recoil with horror one such tale has recently been given to us in the pages of the avicultural magazine of london for january 1912 by mr hubert d astley fzs whose word no man will dispute in condensing it let us call it the italian slaughter of the innocents this story does not concern game birds of any kind quite the contrary that it should be published in america a land now rapidly filling up with italians is a painful necessity in order that the people of america may be enabled accurately to measure the fatherland traditions and the fixed mental attitude of italians generally toward our song birds i shall now hold a mirror up to italian nature if the image is either hideous or grotesque the fault will not be mine i specially commend the picture to the notice of american game wardens and judges on the bench the american reader must be reminded that the italian peninsula reaches out a long arm of land into the mediterranean sea for several hundred miles toward the sunny barbary coast of north africa this great southward highway has been chosen by the birds of central europe as their favorite migration route especially is this true of the small songbirds with weak wings and a minimum of power for longsustained flight naturally they follow the peninsula down to the italian lands end before they launch forth to dare the passage of the mediterranean illustration an italian roccolo on lake como a deathtrap for songbirds from the avicultural magazine italy is the narrow end of a great continental funnel into the wide northern end of which germany austria france and switzerland annually pour their volume of migratory bird life and what is the result for answer let us take the testimony of two reliable witnesses and file it for use on the day when tony macchewin gun in hand and pockets bulging with cartridges goes afield in our country and opens fire on our birds the linnet is one of the sweet singers of europe it is a small delicately formed weakwinged little bird about the size of our phoebebird it weighs only a trifle more than a girls loveletter where it breeds and rears its young in germany for example a true sportsman would no more think of shooting a linnet than he would of killing and eating his daughters dearest canary to the migrating bird the approach to northern italy either going or returning is not through a land of plenty the sheltering forests have mostly been swept away and safe shelters for small birds are very rare in the open there are owls and hawks and the only refuge from either is the thickleafed grove into which linnets and pipits can dive at the approach of danger and quickly hide a linnet from the north after days of dangerous travel finally reached lake como southward bound the country was much too open for safety and its first impulse was to look about for safe shelter the low bushes that sparsely covered the steep hillsides were too thin for refuge in times of sudden danger ah upon a hilltop is a little grove of trees green and inviting in the grove a bird is calling calling insistently the trees are very small but they seem to stand thickly together and their foliage should afford a haven from both hawk and gunner to it joyously flits the tired linnet as it perches aloft upon a convenient whiplike wand it notices for the first time a queer square brick tower of small dimensions rising in the center of a courtyard surrounded by trees the tower is like an old and dingy turret that has been shorn from a castle and set on the hilltop without apparent reason it is two stories in height with one window dingy and uninviting a door opens into its base several birds that seem very near but are invisible frequently call and chirp as if seeking answering calls and companionship surely the grove must be a safe place for birds or they would not be here hark a whirring whistling sound fills the air like the air tone of a flying hawks wings a hawk a hawk down plunges the scared linnet blindly frantically into the space sheltered by the grove horrors what is this threads invisible interlacing threads tangled and full of pockets treacherously spanning the open space it is a fowlers net the linnet is entangled it flutters frantically but helplessly and hangs there caught its alarm cry is frantically answered by the two strange invisible bird voices that come from the top of the tower the grove and the tower are a roccolo a huge permanent merciless deadly trap for the wholesale capture of songbirds the tower is the hiding place of the fowler and the calling birds are decoy birds whose eyes have been totally blinded by redhot wires in order that they will call more frantically than birds with eyes would do the whistling wings that seemed a hawk were a sham made by a racquet thrown through the air by the fowler through a slot in his tower he keeps by him many such racquets the door of the tower opens and out comes the fowler he is lowbrowed swarthy ill kept and wears rings in his ears a soiled hand seizes the struggling linnet and drags it violently from the threads that entangled it a sharppointed twig is thrust straight through the head of the helpless victim at the eyes and after one wild fluttering agonyit is dead the fowler sighs contentedly reenters his dirty and foulsmelling tower tosses the feathered atom upon the pile of dead birds that lies upon the dirty floor in a dirty cornerand is ready for the next one ask him as did mr astley and he will tell you frankly that there are about 150 dead birds in the pilestarlings sparrows linnets greenfinches chaffinches goldfinches hawfinches redstarts blackcaps robins song thrushes blackbirds blue and coal tits fieldfares and redwings he will tell you also that there are seven other roccolos within sight and twelve within easy walking distance he will tell you as he did mr astley that during that week he had taken about 500 birds and that that number was a fair average for each of the 12 other roccolos this means the destruction of about 5000 songbirds per week in that neighborhood alone another keeper of a roccolo told mr astley that during the previous autumn he took about 10000 birds at his small and comparatively insignificant roccolo and above that awful roccolo of slaughtered innocents rose a wooden cross in memory of christ the merciful the compassionate around the interior of the entwined sapling tops that formed the fatal bower of death there hung a semicircle of tiny cages containing live decoyschaffinches hawfinches titmice and several other species the older and staider ones call repeatedly says mr astley and the chaffinches break into song it is the only song to be heard in italy at the time of the autum migration and the king of italy the queen of italy the parliament of italy and his holiness the pope permit these things year in and year out it is now said however that through the efforts of a recently organized birdlovers society in italy the blinding of decoy birds for roccolos is to be stopped in germany austria and switzerland the protection of these birds during their breeding season must be very effective for otherwise the supply for the italian slaughter of the innocents would long ago have fallen to nothing the germans love birds and all wild life i wonder how they like the italian roccolo i wonder how france regards it and whether the nations of europe north of italy will endure this situation forever to the american and english reader comment on the practices recorded above is quite unnecessary except the observation that they betoken a callousness of feeling and a depth of cruelty and destructiveness to which so far as known no savages ever yet have sunk as an exhibit of the groveling pusillanimity of the human soul the roccolo of northern italy reveals minus qualities which can not be expressed either in words or in figures and what is the final exhibit of the gallant knight of the roccolo the feudal lord of the modern castle and its retainers the answer is given by dr louis b bishop in an article on birds in the markets of southern europe in venice which was visited in october and november during the fall migration he found on sale in the markets as food thousands of songbirds birds were there in profusion from ducks to kites in the early morning hung in great bunches above the stalls but by 9 am most of them had been sold ducks and shorebirds occurred in some numbers but the vast majority were small sparrows larks and thrushes these were there during my visit by the thousands if not ten thousands to the market they were brought in large sacks strung in fours on twigs which had been passed through the eyes and then tied most of these small birds had been trapped and on skinning them i often could find no injury except at their eyesc one of these sacks which i examined on november 3 contained hundreds of birds largely siskins skylarks and bramblings as a rule the small birds that were not sold in the early morning were skinned or picked and their tiny bodies packed in regular order breasts up in shadow tin boxes and exposed for sale footnote c it is probable that these birds were killed by piercing the head through the eyes during these visits to the venetian markets i identified 60 species and procured specimens of most as nearly as i can remember small birds cost from two to five cents apiece for example i paid 215 on nov 8 for 1 woodcock 1 skylark 1 jay 1 greenfinch 2 starlings 1 bullfinch 2 spotted crakes 1 redpoll 1 song thrush 3 linnets 1 goldcrest 2 goldfinches 1 longtailed titmouse 6 siskins 1 great titmouse 3 reed buntings 1 pipit 3 bramblings 1 redstart and 5 chaffinches on november 10 i paid 325 for 2 coots 1 european curlew 1 water rail 2 kingfishers 1 spotted crake 2 greenfinches 1 sparrow hawk 2 wrens 2 woodcock 2 great titmouse 1 common redshank 2 blue titmouse 1 dusky redshank 1 redbreast and 2 dunlins of course there were various species of upland game birds shorebirds and waterfowleverything in fact that could be found and killed in addition to the passerine birds listed above dr bishop noted the following all in venice alone skylark in great numbers crested lark crossbill calandra house sparrow tree sparrow stonechat hawfinch coal yellowhammer goldcrest blackbird rock pipit fieldfare white wagtail song thrush redwing in florence says dr bishop i visited the central market on november 26 28 29 30 december 1 2 3 5 6 7 8 and 9 and found birds even more plentiful than in venice besides a variety of game birds he found quantities of the species mentioned above seen in venice and also the following green sandpiper brown creeper dotterel nuthatch magpie blackcap warbler corn bunting blackheaded warbler migratory quail fantail warbler green woodpecker missel thrush spotted woodpecker ring ouzel wood lark rock sparrow and gray wagtail here too at florence we saw often bunches and baskets of small birds chiefly redbreasts hawked through the streets every sunday that we went into the country we met numbers of italians out shooting and their bags seemed to consist wholly of small birds at genoa san remo monte carlo and nice between december 13 and 29 i did not visit the central markets if such exist but saw frequently bunches of small birds hanging outside stores a gentleman who spent the fall on an automobile trip through the west of france from brittany to the pyrenees tells me he noticed these bunches of small birds on sale in every town he visited that killing songbirds for food continues dr bishop is not confined to the poor italians i learned on october 27 when one of the most prominent and wealthy italian ornithologistsa delightful mantold me he had shot 180 skylarks and pipits the day before and that his family liked them far better than other game our prejudice against selling game does not exist in europe and this same ornithologist told me he often shot 200 ducks in a day at his shootingbox sending to the market what he could not use himself on november 1 1910 he shot 82 ducks and on november 8 103 chiefly widgeon and teal an ornithologist indeed a sportsman also is he not he belongs with his brother ornithologists of the roccolos who net their game with the aid of blind birds brave men gallant sportsmen are these men of italyand western france also if the tale is true if the people of europe can stand the wholesale systematic slaughter of their song and insectivorous birds we can if they are too meanspirited to rise up make a row about it and stop it then let them pay the price but by the eternal antonio shall not come to this country with the songbird tastes of the roccolo and indulge them here the above facts have been cited not at all for the benefit of europe but for our own good the american people are now confronted by the italian and austrian and hungarian laborer and saloonkeeper and mechanic and all americans should have an exact measure of the sentiments of southern europe toward our wild life generally especially the birds that we do not shoot at all and therefore are easy to kill when a warden or a citizen arrests an alien for killing any of our nongame birds show the judge these records of how they do things in italy and ask for the extreme penalty i have taken pains to publish the above facts from eyewitnesses in order that every game commissioner game warden and state legislator who reads these pages may know exactly what he is up against in the alien population of our country from southern europe for unnumbered generations the people of italy have been taught to believe that it is perfectly right to shoot and devour every songbird that flies the venetian is no respecter of species and when an italian ornithologist can go out and murder 180 linnets and pipits in one day for the pot it is time for americans to think hard we sincerely hope that it will not require blows and kicks and fines to remove from antonios head the idea that america is not italy and that the slaughter of song birds dont go in this country i strongly recommend to every state the enactment of a law that will do these things 1prohibit the owning carrying or use of firearms by aliens and 2prohibit the use of firearms in hunting by any naturalized alien from southern europe until after a 10years residence in america from reports that have come to me at first hand regarding italians in the east hungarians in pennsylvania and austrians in minnesota it seems absolutely certain that all members of the lower classes of southern europe are a dangerous menace to our wild life on account of the nowaccursed landofliberty idea every foreigner who sails past the statue on bedloes island and lands on our libertyridden shore is firmly convinced that now at last he can do as he pleases and as one of his first ways in which to show his newlyacquired personal liberty and independence in the land of easy marks he buys a gun and goes out to shoot free game if we as a people are so indolent and so somnolent that antonio gets away with all our wild birds then do we deserve to be robbed italians are pouring into america in a steady stream they are strong prolific persistent and of tireless energy new york city now contains 340000 of them they work while the native americans sleep wherever they settle their tendency is to root out the native american and take his place and his income toward wild life the italian laborer is a human mongoose give him power to act and he will quickly exterminate every wild thing that wears feathers or hair to our songbirds he is literally a pestilence that walketh at noonday as we have shown the italian is a born pothunter and he has grown up in the fixed belief that killing songbirds for food is right to him all is game that goes into the bag the moment he sets foot in the open he provides himself with a shotgun and he looks about for things to kill it is a free country therefore he may kill anything he can find cook it and eat it if anybody attempts to check himsapristi beware his gun he cheerfully invades your fields and even your lawn and he shoots robins bluebirds thrushes catbirds grosbeaks tanagers orioles woodpeckers quail snipe ducks crows and herons down in virginia near charlottesville an italian who was working on a new railroad once killed a turkey buzzard and he selfishly cooked it and ate it all alone a pothunting compatriot of his heard of it and reproached him for havingdined on game in camera in the quarrel that ensued one of the sportsmen stabbed the other to death when the new york zoological society began work on its park in 1899 the northern half of the borough of the bronx was a regular daily huntingground for the slaughter of songbirds and all other birds that could be found every sunday it was bangetty bang from pelham bay to van cortlandt the police force paid not the slightest attention to these open flagrant shameless violations of the city ordinances and the state bird laws in those days i never but once heard of a policeman on his own initiative arresting a birdshooter even on sunday but whenever meddlesome special wardens from the zoological park have pointedly called upon the local police force for help it has always been given with cheerful alacrity in the fall of 1912 an appeal to the police commissioner resulted in a general order to stop all hunting and shooting in the borough of the bronx and a reform is now on the war on the birdkillers in new york city began in 1900 it seemed that if the zoological society did not take up the matter the slaughter would continue indefinitely the white mans burden was taken up and the story of the war is rather illuminating mr go shields president of the league of american sportsmen quickly became interested in the matter and entered actively into the campaign for months unnumbered he spent every sunday patroling the woods and thickets of northern new york and westchester county usually accompanied by john j rose and rudolph bell of the zoological park force for whom appointments as deputy game wardens had been secured from the state the adventures of that redoubtable trio of manhunters would make an interesting chapter they were shot at by poachers but more frequently they shot at the other fellows just why it was that no one was killed no one seems to know many italians and several americans were arrested while hunting haled to court prosecuted and fined finally a reign of terror set in and that was the beginning of the end it became known that those three men could not be stopped by threats and that they always got their manunless he got into a human rabbitwarren of the italian boardinghouse species that was the only escape that was possible the largest haul of dead birds was 43 robins orioles thrushes and woodpeckers captured along with the five italians who committed the indiscretion of sitting down in the woods to divide their dead birds we saved all the birds in alcohol and showed them in court the judge fined two of the italians 50 each and the other three were sent to the penitentiary for two months each even yet however at long intervals an occasional son of sunny italy tries his luck at sunday bird shooting but if anyone yells at him to halt he throws away his gun and stampedes through the brush like a frightened deer the birds of upper new york are now fairly secure but it has taken ten years of fighting to bring it about throughout new york state pennsylvania new jersey connecticut massachusetts and even minnesota wherever there are large settlements of italians and hungarians the reports are the same they swarm through the country every sunday and shoot every wild thing they see wherever there are large construction worksrailroads canals or aqueductslook for bird slaughter and you are sure to find it the exception to this rule so far as i know is along the line of the new catskill aqueduct coming to new york city the contractors have elected not to permit bird slaughter and the rule has been made that any man who goes out hunting will instantly be discharged that is the best rule that ever was made for the protection of birds and game against gangworking aliens let every state and province in america look out sharply for the birdkilling foreigner for sooner or later he will surely attack your wild life the italians are spreading spreading spreading if you are without them today tomorrow they will be around you meet them at the threshold with drastic laws throughly enforced for no half way measures will answer pennsylvania has had the worst experience of alien slaughterers of any state thus far six of her game wardens have been killed and eight or ten have been wounded by shooting finally her legislature arose in wrath and passed a law prohibiting the ownership or possession of guns of any kind by aliens the law gives the right of domiciliary search and it surely is enforced of course the foreign population kicked against the law but the peoples steam roller went over them just the same in new york we require from an alien a license costing 20 and it has saved a million perhaps of our birds but the pennsylvania law is the best it may be taken as a model for every state and province in america its text is as follows section i be it enacted c that from and after the passage of this act it shall be unlawful for any unnaturalized foreignborn resident to hunt for or capture or kill in this commonwealth any wild bird or animal either game or otherwise of any description excepting in defense of person or property and to that end it shall be unlawful for any unnaturalized foreignborn resident within this commonwealth to either own or be possessed of a shotgun or rifle of any make each and every person violating any provision of this section shall upon conviction thereof be sentenced to pay a penalty of twentyfive dollars for each offense or undergo imprisonment in the common jail of the county for the period of one day for each dollar of penalty imposed provided that in addition to the beforenamed penalty all guns of the beforementioned kinds found in possession or under control of an unnaturalized foreignborn resident shall upon conviction of such person or upon his signing a declaration of guilt as prescribed by this act be declared forfeited to the commonwealth of pennsylvania and shall be sold by the board of game commissioners as hereinafter directed section 2 for the purpose of this act any unnaturalized foreignborn person who shall reside or live within the boundaries of the commonwealth of pennsylvania for ten consecutive days shall be considered a resident and shall be liable to the penalties imposed for violation of the provisions of this act section 3 that the possession of a shotgun or rifle at any place outside of a building within this commonwealth by an unnaturalized foreignborn resident shall be conclusive proof of a violation of the provisions of section one of this act and shall render any person convicted thereof liable to the penalty as fixed by said section section 4 that the presence of a shotgun or rifle in a room or house or building or tent or camp of any description within this commonwealth occupied by or controlled by an unnaturalized foreignborn resident shall be prima facie evidence that such gun is owned or controlled by the person occupying or controlling the property in which such gun is found and shall render such person liable to the penalty imposed by section one of this act other sections provide for the full enforcement of this law it is now high time and an imperative public necessity that every state should act in this matter before its bird life is suddenly attacked and serious inroads made upon it do it now the enemy is headed your way dont wait for him to strike the first blow duty of the italian press and clergynow what is the best remedy for the troubles that will arise for italians in america because of wrong principles established in italy it is not in the law the police the court and the punishment it is in educating the italian into a knowledge of the duties of the good citizen the italian press and clergy can do this and no one else can do it so easily so quickly and so well those two powerful forces should enter seriously upon this task in every other respect the naturalized italian tries to become a good citizen and adjust himself to the laws and the customs of his new country why should he not do this in regard to bird life it is not too much to ask nor is it too much to exact does the italian workman or storekeeper who makes his living by honest toil enjoy breaking our bird laws enjoy irritating and injuring those with whom he has come to live does he enjoy being watched and searched and chased and arrestedall for a few small birds that he does not need for food he earns good wages he has plenty of good food and he must be educated into protecting our birds instead of destroying them the italian newspapers and clergy have a serious duty to perform in this matter and we hope they will diligently discharge it illustration dead songbirds these jars contain the dead bodies of 43 valuable insectivorous birds that were taken from two italians in october 1905 in the suburbs of new york city by game wardens of the new york zoological society chapter xii destruction of song birds by southern negroes and poor whites before going farther there is one point that i wish to make quite clear whenever the people of a particular race make a specialty of some particular type of wrongdoing anyone who pointedly rebukes the faulty members of that race is immediately accused of race prejudice on account of the facts i am now setting forth about the doings of italian and negro birdkillers i expect to be accused along that line if i am i shall strenuously deny the charge the facts speak for themselves zoologically however i am strongly prejudiced against the people of any race creed club state or nation who make a specialty of any particularly offensive type of bird or wild animal slaughter and i do not care who knows it the time was and i remember it very well when even the poorest gunner scorned to kill birds that were not considered game in days lang syne many a zoological collector has been jeered because the specimens he had killed for preservation were not game but times have changed in the wearing of furs we have bumped down steps both high and steep in 1880 american women wore sealskin marten otter beaver and mink today nothing that wears hair is too humble to be skinned and worn today they are wearing skins of muskrats foxes rabbits skunks domestic cats squirrels and even rats and see how the taste for gameof some sections of our populationalso has gone down in the north the italians are fighting for the privilege of eating everything that wears feathers but we allow no birds to be shot for food save game birds and cranes in the south the negroes and poor whites are killing songbirds woodpeckers and doves for food and in several states some of it is done under the authority of the laws look at these awful lists in these states robins are legally shot and eaten louisiana north carolina tennessee texas mississippi south carolina maryland florida in these states blackbirds are legally shot and eaten louisiana pennsylvania tennessee district of columbia south carolina cranes are shot and eaten in these states colorado north dakota nevada oklahoma nebraska in mississippi the cedar bird is legally shot and eaten in north carolina the meadow lark is shot and eaten in the following states doves are considered game and are shot in an open season alabama georgia minnesota ohio arkansas idaho mississippi oregon california illinois missouri pennsylvania connecticut kentucky nebraska south carolina delaware louisiana new mexico tennessee dist of columbia maryland north carolina texas utah virginia the killing of doves represents a great and widespread decline in the ethics of sportsmanship in the twentysix states named a great many men who call themselves sportsmen indulge in the cheap and ignoble pastime of potting weak and confiding doves it is on a par with the sport of hunting english sparrows in a city street of course this is to a certain extent a matter of taste but there is at least one club of sportsmen into which no dovekiller can enter provided his standard of ethics is known in advance with the killing of robins larks blackbirds and cedar birds for food the case is quite different no white man calling himself a sportsman ever indulges in such low pastimes as the killing of such birds for food that burden of disgrace rests upon the negroes and poor whites of the south but at the same time it is a shame that respectable white men sitting in state legislatures should deliberately enact laws permitting such disgraceful practices or permit such disgraceful and ungentlemanly laws to remain in force here is a case by way of illustration copied very recently from the atlanta journal editor journali located a robin roost up the trinity river six miles from dallas and prevailed on six dallas sportsmen to go with me on a torchlight bird hunt this style of hunting was of course new to the texans but they finally consented to go and i had the pleasure of showing them how it was done equipped with torch lights and shot guns we proceeded after reaching the hunting grounds the sport began in reality and continued for two hours and ten minutes with a total slaughter of 10157 birds an average of 1451 birds killed by each man but the texans give me credit for killing at least 2000 of the entire number i was called the king of bird hunters by the sportsmen of dallas texas and have been invited to commandinchief the next party of hunters which go from dallas to the indian territory in search of large gamefl crow dallas texas former atlantan dallas texas papers and oklahoma papers please copy as a further illustration of the spirit manifested in the south toward robins i quote the following story from dr pp claxton of the university of tennessee as related in audubon educational leaflet no 46 by mr t gilbert pearson the roost to which i refer says professor claxton was situated in what is locally known as a cedar glade near porestville bedford co tennessee this is a great cedar country and robins used to come in immense numbers during the winter months to feed on the berries illustration the robin of the north our bestbeloved song bird now being legally shot as game in the south in the north there is now only one robin for every ten formerly there the spot which the roost occupied was not unlike numerous others that might have been selected the trees grew to a height of from five to thirty feet and for a mile square were literally loaded at night with robins hunting them while they roosted was a favorite sport a man would climb a cedar tree with a torch while his companions with poles and clubs would disturb the sleeping birds on the adjacent trees blinded by the light the suddenly awakened birds flew to the torchbearer who as he seized each bird would quickly pull off its head and drop it into a sack suspended from his shoulders illustration the mockingbird of the south this sweet singer of the south is not being shot in the north for food no northern lawmaker ever will permit such barbarity the capture of three of four hundred birds was an ordinary nights work men and boys would come in wagons from all the adjoining counties and camp near the roost for the purpose of killing robins many times 100 or more hunters with torches and clubs would be at work in a single night for three years this tremendous slaughter continued in winterand then the survivors deserted the roost illustration northern robins ready for southern slaughter 195 birds at avery island la in january 1912 photographed daring the annual slaughter by ea mcilhenny no these people were not apache indians led by a geronimo who knew no mercy no compassion we imagine that they were mostly poor white trash of tennessee one small hamlet sent to market annually enough dead robins to return 500 at five cents per dozen which means 120000 birds last winter mr edward a mcilhenny of avery island la south of new iberia informed me that every winter during the two weeks that the holly berries are ripe thousands of robins come to his vicinity to feed upon them then every negro man and boy who can raise a gun is after them about 10000 robins are slaughtered each day while they remain their dead bodies are sold in new iberia at 10 cents each the accompanying illustrations taken by mr mcilhenny shows 195 robins on one tree and explains how such great slaughter is possible an officer of the louisiana audubon society states that a conservative estimate of the number of robins annually killed in louisiana for food purposes when they are usually plentiful is a quarter of a million the food of the robin is as follows insects 40 per cent wild fruit 43 per cent cultivated fruit 8 per cent miscellaneous vegetable food 5 per cent special work of the southern negroesin 1912 a female colored servant who recently had arrived from country life in virginia chanced to remark to me at our country home in the middle of august i wish i could find some birds nests what for i asked rather puzzled why to get the aigs and eat em she responded with a bright smile and flashing teeth do you eat the eggs of wild birds yes indeed its fine to get a pattridge nest from them we nearly always git a whole dozen of aigs at onceback where i live in virginia do the colored people of virginia make a practice of hunting for the eggs of wild birds and eating them yes indeed we do in the spring and summer when the birds are around we used to get out every sunday and hunt all day some days wed come back with a whole bucket full of aigs and then wed set up half the night cookin and eatin em they was awful good her face fairly beamed at the memory of it a few days later this story of the doings of virginia negroes was fully corroborated by a colored man who came from another section of that state three months later after special inquiries made at my request a gentleman of richmond obtained further corroboration from negroes he was himself much surprised by the state of fact that was revealed to him in the north the economic value of our song birds and other destroyers of insects and weed seeds is understood by a majority of the people and as far as possible those birds are protected from all human enemies but in the south a new division of the army of destruction has risen into deadly prominence in recreation magazine for may 1909 mr charles askins published a most startling and illuminating article entitled the souths problem in game protection it brought together in concrete form and with eyewitness reliability the impressions that for months previous had been gaining ground in the north in order to give the testimony of a man who has seen what he describes i shall now give numerous quotations from mr askins article which certainly bears the stamp of truthfulness without any race prejudice whatever it is a calm judicial unemotional analysis of a very bad situation and i particularly commend it alike to the farmers of the north and all the true sportsmen of the south in his opening paragraphs mr askins describes game and hunting conditions in the south as they were down to twenty years ago when the negroes were too poor to own guns and shooting was not for them special work of the southern negroes it is all different now says mr askins and the old days will only come back with the water that has gone down the stream the master is with his fathers or he is whiling away his last days on the courthouse steps of the town perhaps a chimney or two remain of what was once the big house on the hill possibly it is still standing but as forlorn and lifeless as a dead tree the muscadine grapes still grow in the swale and the persimmons in the pasture field but neither possum nor coon is left to eat them the last deer vanished years ago the rabbits died in their baby coats and the quail were killed in june old uncle ike has gone across the great river with his master and his grandson glances at you askance nods sullenly whistles to his half breed bird dog shoulders his three dollar gun and leaves you he is typical of the change and has caused it this grandson of dear old uncle ike in the same way the white man is telling the black to abide upon the plantation raising cotton and corn and further than this nothing will be required of him he can cheat a white man or a black steal in a petty way anything that comes handy live in marriage or out of it to please himself kill another negro if he likes and lastly shoot every wild thing that can be eaten if only he raises the cotton and the corn but the white sportsmen of the south have never willingly granted the shooting privilege in its entirety and hence this story they have told him to trap the rabbits pot the robins slaughter the doves kill the song birds but to spare the white sportsmans game the aristocratic little bobwhite quail in the beginning not so much damage to southern game interests could be accomplished by our colored man and brother however decided his inclinations he had no money no ammunition and no gun his weapons were an ax a club a trap and a hound dog possibly he might own an old war musket bored out for shot such an outfit was not adapted to quail shooting and especially to wing shooting with which knowledge dixies sportsmen were content let the negro ramble about with his hound dog and his war musket he couldnt possibly kill the quail and so uncle ikes grandson loafed and pottered about in the fields with his ax and his hound dogs not doing so much harm to the quail but acquiring knowledge of the habits of the birds and skill as a stillhunting pothunter that would serve him well later on the negro belongs to a primitive race of people and all such races have keener eyes than white men whose fathers have pored over lines of black and white he learned to see the rabbit in its form the squirrels in the leafy trees and the quails huddled in the grass the least shade of gray in the shadow of the creek bank he distinguished at once as a rabbit a glinting flash from a tree top he knew instantly as being caused by the slight movement of a hidden squirrel and the quiver of a single stem of sedge grass told him of a bevy of birds hiding in the depths the pothunting negro has all the skill of the indian has more industry in his loafing and kills without pity and without restraint this grandson of uncle ike was growing sulky too with the knowledge that the white man was bribing him with half a loaf to raise cotton and corn when he might as well exact it all and this he shortly did as we shall see the time came when cotton went up to sixteen cents a pound and single breechloading guns went down to five dollars apiece the negro had money now and the merchantsthese men who had said let the nigger alone so long as he raises cotton and cornsold him the guns a gun for every black idler man and boy in all the south then shortly a wail went up from the sportsmen the niggers are killing our quail they not only were killing them but most of the birds were already dead on the grounds of the southern field club where sixty bevies were raised by the dogs in one day within two years but three bevies could be found in a day by the hardest kind of hunting and this story was repeated all over the south now the negro began to raise bird dogs in place of hounds and he carried his new gun to church if services happened to be held on a week day finally the negro had grown up and had compassed his ambition he could shoot partridges flying just the same as a white man was a white man except for a trifling difference in color and he could kill more birds too three times as many it was merely a change from the old order to the new in which a darkskinned sportsman had taken the place in plantation life of the dear old colonel of loved memory the negro had exacted his price for raising cotton and corn illustration the southernnegro method of combing out the wild life our colored sportsman is gregarious at all times but especially so in the matter of recreation he may slouch about alone and pot a bevy or two of quail when in actual need of something to eat or when he has a sale for the birds but when it comes to shooting for fun he wants to be with the gangcharles askins reproduced from recreation magazine by permission of the outdoor world our colored sportsman is gregarious at all times but especially so in the matter of recreation he may slouch about alone and pot a bevy or two of quail when in actual need of something to eat or when he has a sale for the birds but when it comes to shooting for fun he wants to be with the gang i have seen the darkies at christmas time collect fifty in a drove with every man his dog and spread out over the fields such a glorious time as he has then a single cottontail will draw a halfdozen shots and perhaps a couple of young bucks will pour loads into a bunny after he is dead out of pure deviltry and high spirits i once witnessed the accidental killing of a young negro on this kind of a foray his companions loaded him into a wagon stuck a cigar in his mouth and tried to pour whiskey down him every time they took a drink themselves as they rode back to town this army of black hunters and their dogs cross field after field combing the country with fine teeth that leave neither wild animal nor bird life behind there comes a time toward the spring of the year after the quail season is over when the average rural darky is between hay and grass the merchants on whom he has depended for supplies make it a practice to refuse credit between january first and crop time the black has spent his cotton money his sweet potato pile has vanished the sorghum barrel is empty he has eaten the last of his winters pork and all that remains is a bit of meal and the meat his gun can secure he is hunting in grim earnest now using all the cunning and skill acquired by years of practice he eats woodpeckers jaybirds hawks and skunks drawing the line only at crows and buzzards at this season of the year i have carried chicken hawks up to the cabins for the sake of watching the delight of the piccaninnies who with glowing eyes would declare thems mos as good as chicken what happens to the robins doves larks red birds mocking birds and all songsters in this hungry season needs hardly to be stated it is also a time between hay and grass for the rabbits and the quail the corn fields are bare and the weed seeds are exhausted a spring cold spell pinches they lose their vitality become thin and quite lack their ordinary wariness then the figurefour trap springs up in the hedgerow and the sedge while the work of decimation goes more rapidly along the rabbits can no longer escape the halfstarved dogs the thinning cover fails to hide the quail and the song birds betray themselves by singing of the coming spring with the growing scarcity of the game now comes the season of sedge and field burning this is done ostensibly to prepare the land for spring plowing but really to destroy the last refuge of the quail and rabbits so that they can be bagged with certainty all the negroes of a neighborhood collect for one of these burnings all their dogs and of course all the boys from six years old up they surround the field and set it on fire in many places leaving small openings for the game to dash out among the motley assembly i have seen quail fly out of the burning grass with flaming particles still attached to them they alight on the burnt ground too bewildered to fly again and the boys and dogs pick them up crazed rabbits try the gauntlet amidst the barking curs shouting negroes and popping guns but death is sure and quick the few quail that may escape have no refuge from the hawks and nothing to eat so every battue of this kind marks the absolute end of the birds in one vicinity and the next day the darkies repeat the performance elsewhere at this season of the year the first of may the blacks are putting in some of their one hundred working days while the single breechloader rusts in the chimney corner surely the few birds that have escaped the foray of the gang lived through the hungry days and survived their burned homes can now call bob white and mate in peace but school is out and the summer sun is putting new life into the bare feet of the halfgrown boys and the halfbreed bird dogs are busier than they were even in winter the young rabbits are killed before they get out of the nest and the quail eggs must be hidden rarely well that escape both the eyes of the boys and the noses of the dogs after all it is not surprising that but three bevies remained of the sixty doubtless they would not except that nature is very kind to her own in the sunny south not every white man in the south is a sportsman or even a shooter many are purely business men who have said let the nigger do as he likes so long as he raises cotton and buys our goods but dixie has her full share of true men of the outofdoors and they have sworn in downright southern fashion that this thing has got to end nevertheless their problem is deep and puzzling in alabama they made an effort and a beginning they asked for a law requiring every man to obtain written permission before entering the lands of another to hunt and shoot they asked for a resident license law taxing every gun not less than five dollars a year for a shortened season a bag limit and a complete system of state wardens unfortunately a lot of white farmers were in the same range as the blacks and being hit too they raised a great outcry the result was that the alabama sportsmen got everything they asked for except the foundation of the structure they were trying to build the high resident license or gun tax which alone could have shut out three dollar guns and saved the remnant of the game under the new law the sale of game was forbidden neither could it be shipped out of the state alive or dead the ever popular nonresident license was provided for the season was shortened and the bag limited the office of state game warden was created with deputies to be paid from fines hunting upon the lands of another without written permission became a misdemeanor and then the whole thing was nullified by reducing the resident license to nothing where a man shot upon his own land one dollar in his own county and two dollars outside of it in its practical workings the new law amounts to this a few northern gunners have paid the nonresident license fee and enough resident licenses have been taken out by the city sportsmen to make up the handsome salary of the state warden the negro still hunts upon his own land or upon the land of the man who wants corn and cotton raised with perfect indifference to the whole thing who was to enforce the law against him not the one disgusted deputy with three big counties to patrol who depended for his salary upon the fines collected from the negroes it would take one man to every three miles square to protect the game in the south the one effective way of dealing with the situation in alabama was to have legislated three dollar guns out of existence with a five dollar tax adding to this nearly a like amount on dogs hardly a sportsman in the south will disagree with this conclusion but sportsmen never had a majority vote either in the south or in the north and the souths grave problem is yet unsolved i do not favor depriving the black man of his natural human right to hunt and shoot if he is the owner of land or if he leases or rents it or if he does not he should have exactly the same privilege of hunting that the white man has that is not the question now however but how to restrict him to legal shooting to make him amenable to the law that governs the white man to deprive him of the absolute license he now enjoys to kill throughout the year without mercy without discrimination without restraint if only for selfish reasons we of the north should reach to southern sportsmen a helping hand for by and by the last of our migratory song birds will go down into dixie and never return mr askins has fairly stated a profoundly disturbing case the remedy must contain at least three ingredients the sportsmen of the south must stop the unjustifiable slaughter of their nonmigratory game birds as a matter of comity between states the gentlemen of the south must pass laws to stop the killing of northern songbirds and all cropprotecting birds for food finally all men north and south east and west must unite in the work that is necessary to secure the immediate enactment by congress of a law for the federal protection of all migratory birds chapter xiii extermination of birds for womens hatsd footnote d in the preparation of this chapter and its illustrations i have had much valuable assistance from mr c william beebe who recently has probed the london feather trade almost to the bottom it is high time for the whole civilized world to know that many of the most beautiful and remarkable birds of the world are now being exterminated to furnish millinery ornaments for womens wear the mass of new information that we have recently secured on this traffic from the headquarters of the feather trade is appalling previously i had not dreamed that conditions are half as bad as they are it is entirely fitting that on this subject new york should send a message to london new york is almost a spotless town in plumefree millinery and london and paris are the worst places in the world we have cleaned house with but extremely slight exceptions the blood of the slaughtered innocents is no longer upon our skirts and on the subject of plumage millinery we have a right to be just as pharisaical as we choose here in new york and also in new jersey no man may sell own for sale or offer for sale the plumage of any wild american bird other than a game bird more than that the plumage of no foreign bird belonging to any bird family represented in the fauna of north america can be sold here there are only a few kinds of improper millinery feathers that it is possible to sell here under the law thanks to the long and arduous campaign of the national association of audubon societies founded and for ten years directed by gallant william dutcher you now see on the streets of new york very very little wildbird plumage save that from game birds it is true that a few servant girls are now wearing the castoff aigrettes of their mistresses but they are only as one in a thousand at atlantic city there is said to be a fine display of servantgirl and ladiesmaid aigrettes in new york and new jersey in pennsylvania for everything save the sale of heron and egret plumes a privilege obtained by a bunko game in massachusetts and in many other of our states the wildbirdsplumage millinery business is dead two years ago when the new york legislature refused to repeal the dutcher law the millinery association asserted and brought a cloud of witnesses to albany to prove that the enforcement of the law would throw thousands of operatives out of employment illustration beautiful and curious birds now being destroyed for the feather tradei belted kingfisher victoria crowned pigeon superb calliste greater bird of paradise common tern cock of the rock the law is in effect and the aigrette business is dead in this state have any operatives starved or been thrown out of employment we have heard of none they are now at work making very pretty hat ornaments of silk and ribbons and gauze and lace and they are wearing them illustration 1600 hummingbird skins at 2 cents each part of lot purchased by the zoological society at the regular quarterly london millinery feather sale august 1912 but even while these words are being written there is one large fly in the ointment the storewindow of e s meyers 688 broadway new york contains about six hundred plumes and skins of birds of paradise for sale for millinery purposes no wonder the great bird of paradise is now almost extinct their sale here is possible because the dutcher law protects from the feather dealers only the birds that belong to avian families represented in the united states with fiendish cunning and enterprise the shameless feather dealers are ferreting out the birds whose skins and plumes may legally be imported into this country and sold but we will meet that with a law that will protect all foreign birds so far as we are concerned now it is time for the universal enactment of a law which will prohibit the sale and use as ornaments of the plumage feathers or skins of any wild bird that is not a legitimate game bird london is now the head of the giant octopus of the feather trade that has reached out its deadly tentacles into the most remote wildernesses of the earth and steadily is drawing in the skins and plumes and quills of the most beautiful and most interesting unprotected birds of the world the extent of this coldblooded industry supported by vain and hardhearted women will presently be shown in detail paris is the great manufacturing center of feather trimming and ornaments and the french people obstinately refuse to protect the birds from extermination because their slaughter affords employment to a certain numbers of french factory operatives all over the world where they have real estate possessions the men of england know how to protect game from extermination the english are good at protecting gamewhen they decide to set about it why should london be the mecca of the featherkillers of the world it is easily explained 1 london has the greatest feather market in the world 2 the feather industry wants the money and 3 the london feather industry is willing to spend money in fighting to retain its stranglehold on the unprotected birds of the world let us run through a small portion of the mass of fresh evidence before us it will be easier for the friends of birds to read these details here than to procure them at first hand as we have done the first thing that strikes one is the fact that the featherhunters are scattered all over the world where bird life is plentiful and there are no laws to hinder their work i commend to every friend of birds this list of the species whose plumage is today being bought and sold in large quantities every year in london to the birds of the world this list is of deadly import for it spells extermination the reader will notice that it is the way of the millinery octopus to reach out to the uttermost ends of the earth and take everything that it can use from the trackless jungles of new guinea round the world both ways to the snowcapped peaks of the andes no unprotected bird is safe the hummingbirds of brazil the egrets of the world at large the rare birds of paradise the toucan the eagle the condor and the emu all are being exterminated to swell the annual profits of the millinery trade the case is far more serious than the world at large knows or even suspects but for the profits the birds would be safe and no unprotected wild species can long escape the hounds of commerce but behold the list of rare curious and beautiful birds that

regions in order to throw a spotlight on the most recent transactions in the london wildbirdsplumage market and to furnish a clear idea of what is today going on in london paris berlin and amsterdam i will set out in some detail the report of an agent whom i engaged to ascertain the london dealings in the plumage of wild birds that were killed especially to furnish that plumage as one item let us take the sales in london in february may and october 1911 because they bring the subject well down to date my agents explanatory note is as follows these three sales represent six months very nearly double this quantity is sold by these four firms in a year we must also take into consideration that all the feathers are not brought to the london market and that very large shipments are also made direct to the rawfeather dealers and manufacturers of paris and berlin and that amsterdam also gets large quantities from the west indies for your purpose i report upon three sales at different periods of the year 1911 and as those sales do not vary much you will be able to judge the consumption of birds in a year the aigrettes of the feather trade come from egrets and being very light it requires the death of several birds to yield one ounce in many catalogues the word albatross stands for the jabiru a nearlyexterminated species of giant stork inhabiting south america rhea often stands for vulture plumage if the feather dealers had deliberately attempted to form an educational list of the most beautiful and the most interesting birds of the world they could hardly have done better than they have done in the above list if it were in my power to show the reader a colored plate of each species now being exterminated by the feather trade he would be startled by the exhibit that the very choicest birds of the whole avian world should be thus blotted out at the behest of vain and heartless women is a shame a disgrace and worldwide loss london feather sale of february 1911

skins if i am correctly informed the london feather trade admits that it requires six egrets to yield one ounce of aigrette plumes this being the case the 21528 ounces sold as above stand for 129168 egrets killed for nine months supply of egret plumes for london alone the total number of bird corpses auctioned during these three sales is as follows aigrettes 21528 ounces 129168 egrets herons 2683 13598 herons 20698 birds of paradise 41090 hummingbirds 9464 eagles condors etc 9472 other birds total number of birds 223490 it is to be remembered that the sales listed above cover the transactions of four firms only and do not in any manner take into account the direct importations from paris berlin and amsterdam of manufacturers and other dealers the defenders of the feather trade are at great pains to assure the world that in the monthly bimonthly and quarterly sales feathers often appear in the market twice in the same year and this statement is made for them in order to be absolutely fair recent examinations of the plume catalogues for an entire year marked with the price paid for each item reveals very few which are blank indicating no sale the subtractions of the duplicated items would alter the result only very slightly the full extent of englands annual consumption of the plumage of wild birds slaughtered especially for the trade never has been determined i doubt whether it is possible to ascertain it the information that we have is so fragmentary that in all probability it reflects only a small portion of the whole truth but for all that it is sufficient to prove the case of the defenders of the birds vs the london chamber of commerce imports of feathers and down ornamental for the year 1910 pounds value venezuela 8398 191058 brazil 787 5999 japan 2284

disappeared from the feather market and from womens hats the reason is that there are no longer enough birds of that group to hold a place in the london market few indeed are the americans who know that from 1900 to 1908 the lake region of southern oregon was the scene of the slaughter of uncountable thousands of those birds which continued until the grebes were almost exterminated when the wonderful lyrebird of australia had been almost exterminated for its tail feathers its open slaughter was stopped by law and a heavy fine was imposed on exportation amounting i have been told to 250 for each offense my latest news of the lyrebird was of the surreptitious exportation of 200 skins to the london feather market in india the smuggling outward of the skins of protected birds is constantly going on occasionally an exporter is caught and fined but that does not stop the traffic birdlovers must now bid farewell forever to all the birds of paradise nothing but the legal closing of the worlds markets against their plumes and skins can save any of them they never were numerous nor does any species range over a wide area they are strictly insular and the island homes of some of them are very small take the great bird of paradise paradisea apoda as an illustration on oct 2 1912 at indianapolis indiana a city near the center of the united states in three showwindows within 100 feet of the headquarters of the fourth national conservation congress i counted 11 stuffed heads and 11 complete sets of plumes of this bird displayed for sale the prices ranged from 30 to 4750 each and while i looked a large lady approached pointed her finger at the remains of a greater bird of paradise and with grim determination said to her shopping companion there i want one o them an im agoin to have it too says mr james buckland in pros and cons of the plumage bill mr goodfellow has returned within the last few weeks from a second expedition to new guinea one can now walk he states miles and miles through the former haunts of these birds of paradise without seeing or hearing even the commonest species when i reflect on this sacrilege i am lost in wonder at the apathy of the british public mr carl hagenbeck wrote me only three months ago that the condors of the andes are all being exterminated for their feathers and these birds are now very difficult to obtain the egret and heron plumes known under the trade name of osprey etc feathers form by far the most important item in each feather sale there are fifteen grades they are sold by the ounce and the prices range all the way from twentyeight cents per ounce for mixed heron to two hundred and twentyfive shillings 4560 per ounce for the best brazilian short selected on february 7 1912 is it any wonder that in philadelphia the prices of finished aigrettes ready to be worn runs from 20 to 125 the plumes that run up into the big figures are the short selected coming from the following localities and quoted at the prices set down here in shillings and pence count the shilling at twentyfour cents united states money prices of short selected egret and heron plumes in london on february 7 1912 lewis peats list

1911 was 689 ounces and in february 1912 it was 230 ounces now with these enormous prices prevailing is it any wonder that the egrets and herons are being relentlessly pursued to the uttermost ends of the earth i think that any man who really knows the habits of egrets and herons and the total impossibility of any quantity of their shed feathers being picked up in a marketable state must know in his heart that if the london and continental feather markets keep open a few years longer every species that furnishes short selected plumes will be utterly exterminated from off the face of the earth let the english people make no mistake about this nor be fooled by any fairy tales of the feather trade about venezuelan garceros and vast quantities of valuable plumes picked off the bushes and out of the mud those carefully concocted egretfarm stories make lovely reading but the reader who examines the evidence will soon decide the extent of their truthfulness i think that they contain not even ten per cent of truth and i shall not rest until the stories of leon laglaize and mayeul grisol have been put to the test in the regions where they originated a few plumes may be picked out of the jungle yes but as for any commercial quantity it is at present beyond belief besides we have direct eyewitness testimony to the contrary it must not be inferred that the friends of birds in england have been idle or silent in the presence of the london feather trade on the contrary the royal society for the protection of wild birds and mr james buckland have so strongly attacked the feather industry that the london chamber of commerce has felt called upon to come to its rescue mr buckland on his own individual account has done yeoman service to the cause and his devotion to the birds and his tireless energy are both almost beyond the reach of praise in words at the last moment before going to press i learn that the birdsplumage bill has achieved the triumph of a first reading in parliament which looks as if success is at last in sight the powerful pamphlet that he has written published and circulated at his own expense entitled pros and cons of the plumage bill is a splendid effort what a pity it is that more individuals are not similarly inspired to make independent effort in the protection cause but strange to say few indeed are the men who have either the nerve or the ability to go it alone on the introduction in parliament of the bill to save the birds from the feather trade it was opposed through the efforts of the chamber of commerce on the ground that if any bill against the sale of plumes should pass and plumes could not be sold the london business in wildbird skins and feathers would immediately be transferred to the continent in the face of that devastating and altogether horrible prospect and because the london feather dealers need the money the bill was at first defeatedto the great joy of the chamber of commerce and mr downham but the cause of birds will win in the end because it is right the feather dealers have been shrewdly active in the defense of their trade and the methods they have employed for influencing public opinion have quite outshone those put forth by their brethren in america i have before me a copy of a booklet bearing the name of mr cf downham as the author and the london chamber of commerce has loaned its good name as publisher altogether it is a very shrewd piece of work even though its arguments in justification of bird slaughter for the feather market are too absurd and weak for serious consideration the chief burden of the defender of bird slaughter for millinery purposes is on account of the destruction of egrets and herons but particularly the former to offset as far as possible the absolutely true charge that egrets bear their best plumes in their breeding season when the helpless young are in the nest and the parent birds must be killed to obtain the plumes the feather trade has obtained from three frenchmenleon laglaize mayeul grisol and f geaya beautiful and plausible story to the effect that in venezuela the enormous output of egret plumes has been obtained by picking up off the bushes and out of the water and mud the shed feathers of those birds according to the story venezuela is full of egret farms called garceroswhere the birds breed and moult under strict supervision and kindly drop their feathers in such places that it is possible to find them and to pick them up in a high state of preservation and we are asked to believe that it is these very venezuelan pickedup feathers that command in london the high price of 44 per ounce illustration the fight in england against the use of wild birds plumage in the millinery trade sandwichmen employed by the royal society for the protection of birds that patroled london streets in july 1911 mr laglaize is especially exploited by mr downham as a french traveler of high standing and well known in the zoological museums of france but sad to say when prof henry fairfield osborn cabled to the museum of natural history in paris inquiring about mr laglaize the cable flashed back the one sad word inconnu unknown i think it entirely possible that enough shed feathers have been picked up in the reeking swamps of venezuela on the upper tributaries of the orinoco to afford an excuse for the beautiful story of mr laglaize any shrewd individual with money and the influence that money secures could put up just such a plant as i firmly believe has been put up by some one in venezuela i will guarantee that i could accomplish such a job in venezuela or brazil in four months time at an expense not exceeding one thousand dollars that the great supply of immaculately perfect egret plumes that annually come out of venezuela could by any possibility be picked up in the swamps where they were shed and dropped by the egrets is entirely preposterous and incredible the whole proportion is denounced by several men of standing and experience none of whom are inconnu as a sweeping refutation of the fantastic statements regarding garceros published by mr downham as coming from messrs laglaize grisol and geay i offer the written testimony of an american gentleman who at this moment owns and maintains within a few yards of his residence a large preserve of snowy egrets and herons the former representing the species which furnishes egret plumes exactly similar to those shipped from venezuela and brazil if the testimony of mr mcilhenny is not sufficient to stamp the statements of the three frenchmen quoted by mr downham as absolute and thoroughly misleading falsehoods then there is no such thing in this world as evidence i suggest a perusal of the statements of the three frenchmen who are quoted with such confidence by mr downham and published by the hon chamber of commerce at london and then a careful reading of the following letter avery island la june 17 1912 dear mr hornaday i have before me your letter of june 8th asking for information as to whether or no egrets shed their plumes at their nesting places in sufficient quantities to enable them to be gathered commercially i most emphatically wish to state that it is impossible to gather at the nesting places of these birds any quantity of their plumes i have nesting within 50 yards of where i am now sitting dictating this letter not less than 20000 pairs of the various species of herons and egrets and there are fully 2500 pairs of snowy herons nesting within my preserve during the nesting season which covers the months of april may and june i am through this heronry in a small canoe almost every day and often twice a day i have had these herons under my close inspection for the past 17 years and i have not in any one season picked up or seen more than half a dozen discarded plumes such plumes as i have picked up i have kept on my desk and given to the people who were interested i remember that last year i picked up four plumes of the snowy heron that were in one bunch i think these must have been plucked out by the birds fighting this year i have found only one plume so far i enclose it herewith you will notice that it is one of the shorter plumes and is badly worn at the end as have been all the plumes which i have picked up in my heronry i am positive that it is not possible for natural shed plumes to be gathered commercially i have a number of times talked with plume hunters from venezuela and other south american countries and i have never heard of any egret feathers being gathered by their being picked up after the birds have shed them i have heard of a number of heronries in south america that are protected by the land owners for the purpose of gathering a yearly crop of egret plumes but this crop is gathered always by shooting a certain percentage of the birds this shooting is done by experts with 22calibre rifles and does not materially disturb the nesting colony i have known of two men who have been engaged in killing the birds on large estates in south america who were paid regular salaries for their services as egret hunters very truly yours ea mcilhenny i am more than willing to set the above against the fairy tale of mr laglaize here is the testimony of ah meyer an explumehunter who for nine years worked in venezuela his sworn testimony was laid before the legislature of the state of new york in 1911 when the new york milliners association was frantically endeavoring to secure the repeal of the splendid dutcher law this witness was produced by the national association of audubon societies my attention has been called to the fact that certain commercial interests in this city are circulating stories in the newspapers and elsewhere to the effect that the aigrettes used in the millinery trade come chiefly from venezuela where they are gathered from the ground in the large garceros or breedingcolonies of white herons i wish to state that i have personally engaged in the work of collecting the plumes of these birds in venezuela this was my business for the years 1896 to 1905 inclusive i am thoroughly conversant with the methods employed in gathering egret and snowy heron plumes in venezuela and i wish to give the following statement regarding the practices employed in procuring these feathers the birds gather in large colonies to rear their young they have the plumes only during the mating and nesting season after the period when they are employed in caring for their young it is found that the plumes are virtually of no commercial value because of the worn and frayed condition to which they have been reduced it is the custom in venezuela to shoot the birds while the young are in the nests a few feathers of the large white heron american egret known as the garza blanca can be picked up of a morning about their breeding places but these are of small value and are known as dead feathers they are worth locally not over three dollars an ounce while the feathers taken from the bird known as live feathers are worth fifteen dollars an ounce my work led me into every part of venezuela and colombia where these birds are to be found and i have never yet found or heard of any garceros that were guarded for the purpose of simply gathering the feathers from the ground no such condition exists in venezuela the story is absolutely without foundation in my opinion and has simply been put forward for commercial purposes the natives of the country who do virtually all of the hunting for feathers are not provident in their nature and their practices are of a most cruel and brutal nature i have seen them frequently pull the plumes from wounded birds leaving the crippled birds to die of starvation unable to respond to the cries of their young in the nests above which were calling for food i have known these people to tie and prop up wounded egrets on the marsh where they would attract the attention of other birds flying by these decoys they keep in this position until they die of their wounds or from the attacks of insects i have seen the terrible red ants of that country actually eating out the eyes of these wounded helpless birds that were tied up by the plumehunters i could write you many pages of the horrors practiced in gathering aigrette feathers in venezuela by the natives for the millinery trade of paris and new york to illustrate the comparatively small number of dead feathers which are collected i will mention that in one year i and my associates shipped to new york eighty pounds of the plumes of the large heron and twelve pounds of the little recurved plumes of the snowy heron in this whole lot there were not over five pounds of plumes that had been gathered from the groundand these were of little value the plumebirds have been nearly exterminated in the united states and mexico and the same condition of affairs will soon exist in tropical america this extermination will come about because of the fact that the young are left to starve in the nest when the old birds are killed any other statement made by interested parties to the contrary notwithstanding i am so incensed at the ridiculously absurd and misleading stories that are being published on this question that i want to give you this letter and before delivering it to you shall take oath to its truthfulness here is the testimony of mr caspar whitney of new york formerly editor of outing magazine and outdoor america during extended travel throughout south america from 1903 to 1907 inclusive i journeyed on three separate occasions by canoe 19041907 on the lower orinoco and apure rivers and their tributaries this is the region so far as venezuela is concerned in which is the greatest slaughter of white herons for their plumage or more specifically for the marital plumes which are carried only in the mating and breeding season and are known in the millinery trade as aigrettes there is literally no room for question the snowy herons are killed exactly as i describe it is the custom of all those who hunt for the millinery trade and is recognized by the natives as the usual method here is the testimony of mr julian a dimock of peekamose ny the famous outdoor photographer and illustrator of florida enchantments i know a goodly number of the plumehunters of florida i have camped with them and talked to them i have heard their tales and even full accounts of the shootingup of an egret rookery never has a man in florida suggested to me that plumes could be obtained without killing the birds i have known the wardens and have visited rookeries after they had been shotup and the evidence all pointed to the everlasting use of the gun it is certainly not true that the plumes can be obtained without killing the birds bearing them nineteen years ago i visited the cuthbert rookery with one of the men who discovered the birds nesting in that lake he and his partner had sold the plumes gathered there for more than a thousand dollars he showed me how they hid in the bushes and shot the birds he even gave me a chance to watch him kill two or three birds i know personally the man chiefly responsible for the slaughter of the birds at alligator bay he laughed at the idea of getting plumes without killing the birds i well know the man who shot the birds up rogers river and even saw some of the empty shells left on the ground by him illustration young egrets unable to fly starving the parent birds had been killed by plume hunters illustration snowy egret dead on her nest wounded in the feedinggrounds and came home to die photographed in a florida rookery protected by the national association of audubon societies i have camped with seminoles whites blacks outlaws and those within the pale connected with plumehunting and all tell the same story the birds are shot to get the plumes the evidence of my own eyes and the action of the birds themselves convinces me that there is not a shadow of doubt concerning this point this sworn testimony from mr tj ashe of key west florida is very direct and to the point i have seen many moulted and dropped feathers from wild plumed birds i have never seen a moulted or dropped feather that was fit for anything it is the exception when a plumed bird drops feathers of any value while in flight whatever feathers are so dropped are those that are frayed worn out and forced out by the process of moulting the moulting season is not during the hatching season but is after the hatching season the shedding or moulting takes place once a year and during this moulting season the feathers after having the hard usage of the year from wind rain and other causes when dropped are of absolutely no commercial value mr arthur t wayne of mount pleasant sc relates in sworn testimony his experience in attempting to secure egret plumes without killing the birds it is utterly impossible to get fifty egret plumes from any colony of breeding birds without shooting the birds last spring i went twice a week to a breeding colony of american and snowy egrets from early in april until june 8 despite the fact that i covered miles of territory in a boat i picked up but two american egret plumes which i now have but not a single snowy egret plume did i see nor did my companion who accompanied me on every trip i saw an american egret plume on the water and left it purposely to see whether it would sink or not upon visiting the place a few days afterwards the plume was not in evidence undoubtedly having sunk the plumes are chiefly shed in the air while the birds are going to or coming from their breeding grounds if that millinery plume law is repealed the fate of the american and snowy egrets is sealed for the few birds that remain will be shot to the very last one any man who ever has been in an egret rookery and i have knows that the above testimony is true the french story of the beautiful and smoothlyrunning egret farms in venezuela is preposterous save for a mere shadow of truth i do not say that no egret plumes could be picked up but i do assert that the total quantity obtainable in one year in that way would be utterly trivial no the ospreys of the british feather market come from slaughtered egrets and herons killed in the breeding season let the british public and the british parliament make no mistake about that if they wish the trade to continue let it be based on the impregnable ground that the merchants want the money and not on a fantastic dream that is too silly to deceive even a child that knows birds the use or disuse of wild birds plumage as millinery ornaments is another of those wildlife subjects regarding which there is no room for argument to assert that the featherdealers want the business for the money it brings them is not argument we have seen many a steam roller go over truth and right and justice by main strength and redhot power but truth and right refuse to stay flat down there is on this earth not one wildanimal speciesmammal bird or reptilethat can long withstand exploitation for commercial purposes even the whales of the deep sea the walrus of the arctic regions the condors of the andes and alligators of the everglade morasses are no exception to the universal rule in mr downhams book there is much fallacious reasoning and many conclusions that are not borne out by the facts for example he says that no species of bird of paradise has been diminished in number by slaughter for the feather trade that florida still contains a supply of egrets that the decrease in bird life should be charged to the spread of cities towns and farms and not to the trade that the trade was in no way responsible for the slaughter of three hundred thousand gulls and albatrosses on laysan island i have space to notice one other important erroneous conclusion that mr downham publishes in his book on page 105 he says the destruction of birds in foreign countries is something that no trade can direct or control this is an amazing declaration and absolutely contrary to experience let me prove what i say by a fresh and incontestable illustration prior to april 1911 when governor dix signed the bayne law against the sale of wild native game in the state of new york currituck county nc was a vast slaughterpen for wild fowl no power or persuasion had availed to induce the people of north carolina to check or regulate or in any manner mitigate that slaughter of geese ducks and swans it was estimated that two hundred thousand wild fowl were annually slaughtered there we who advocated the bayne law said close the new york markets against currituck birds and you will stop a great deal of the slaughter we cleaned our augean stable the greatest game market in america was absolutely closed last winter 1911 the annual killing of wild fowl was fully fifty per cent less than during previous years in one small town twenty professional duck shooters went entirely out of businessbecause they couldnt sell their ducks the dealers refused to buy them the result was exactly what we predicted it would be and this year it is reported over and over that ducks are more plentiful in new england than they have been in twenty years previously the result is wonderful because so quick beyond all question the feather merchants of london paris and berlin absolutely control the birdkillers of venezuela china new guinea mexico and south america let the word go forth that the trade is no longer permitted to buy and sell egret and heron plumes skins of birds of paradise and condor feathers and presto the killing industry falls dead the next moment illustration miscellaneous bird skins 8 cents each purchased by the new york zoological society from the quarterly sale in london august 1912 yes indeed members of the british parliament it is easily within your power to wipe out at a single stroke fully onehalf of the bird slaughter for fancy feathers it can be done just as we wiped out onehalf the annual duck slaughter in wickedlywasteful north carolina the feather trade absolutely does control the killing situation now will the people of england clean house by controlling the feather trade if a hundred species of the most beautiful birds of the world must be exterminated for the feather trade let the odium rest elsewhere than on the people of england the birdlovers of america may rest assured that the birdlovers of englanda mighty hostare neither careless nor indifferent regarding the wildbirds plumage business on the contrary several bills have been brought before parliament intended to regulate or prohibit the traffic and a measure of vast importance to the birds of the world is now before the house of commons it is backed by mr percy alden mp by the royal society for the protection of birds by the selbourne society and by mr james bucklanda host in himself for years past that splendidlyequipped and wellmanaged royal society has waged ceaseless warfare for the birds its activity has been tremendous and its membership list contains many of the finest names in england the address of the honorary secretary frank e lemon esq is 23 queen annes gate london sw naturally these influences are opposed by the textile trade section of the london chamber of commerce and their only argument consists of the plea that if london doesnt get the money out of the feather trade the continent will get it a reasonable logical magnificent and convincing excuse for wholesale bird slaughter truly mr buckland has been informed from the continent that the people of france germany the netherlands and belgium are waiting and watching to see what england is going to do with the question to slaughter or not to slaughter for england has no monopoly of the birds plumage trade not by any means says mr buckland pros and cons of the plumage bill page 17 as regards the vast majority of fancy feathers used in millinery the continent receives its own supplies the feathers of the hundreds of thousands of albatrosses which are killed in the north pacific all go to paris of the untold thousands of magpies owls and other species which come from peru not one skin or feather crosses the channel the white herons of the upper senegal and the niger are being rapidly exterminated at the instigation of the feather merchants but not one of the plumes reaches london paris receives direct a large supply of aigrettes from south america and elsewhere the millions of swallows and other migratory birds which are killed annually as they pass through italy france and spain on their way north supply the millinery trade of europe with an incredible quantity of wings and other plumage but none of it is distributed from london london as a distributing center has no monopoly of the trade in raw feathers mr bucklands greencovered pamphlet is a powerful document and both his facts and his conclusions seem to be unassailable the authors address is royal colonial institute northumberland ave london wc the duty of the civilized nations of europe is perfectly plain the savage and bloody business in feathers torn from wild birds should be stopped completely and forever if the commons will not arise and reform the odious business out of existence then the kings and queens and presidents should do their plain duty in the suppression of a world crime like this it is clearly a case of noblesse oblige chapter xiv the bird tragedy on laysan island this chapter is a curtaindropper to the preceding chapter as a clearlycut concrete case the reader will find it unique and unsurpassed it should be of lively interest to every american because the tragedy occurred on american territory in the faraway north pacific ocean about seven hundred miles from honolulu westbnorth lies the small island of laysan it is level sandy poorly planted by nature and barren of all things likely to enlist the attention of predatory man to the harassed birds of midocean it seemed like a secure haven and for ages past it has been inhabited only by them there several species of sea birds large and small have found homes and breeding places until 1909 the inhabitants consisted of the laysan albatross blackfooted albatross sooty tern graybacked tern noddy tern hawaiian tern white tern bonin petrel two shearwaters the redtailed tropic bird two boobies and the manofwar bird laysan island is two miles long by one and onehalf miles broad and at times it has been literally covered with birds its bird life was first brought prominently to notice in 1891 by henry palmer the agent of hon walter rothschild and in 1902 and 1903 walter k fisher and wa bryan made further observations ever since 1891 the bird life on laysan has been regarded as one of the wonders of the bird world one of the photographs taken prior to 1909 shows a vast plain apparently a square mile in area covered and crowded with laysan albatrosses they stand there on the level sand serene bulky and immaculate thousands of birds appear in one viewa very remarkable sight naturally man the evergreedy began to cast about for ways by which to convert some product of that feathered host into money at first guano and eggs were collected a tramway was laid down and small boxcars were introduced in which the collected material was piled and pushed down to the packing place for several years this went on and the birds themselves were not molested at last however a tentacle of the feathertrade octopus reached out to laysan in an evil moment in the spring of 1909 a predatory individual of honolulu and elsewhere named max schlemmer decided that the wings of those albatross gulls and terns should be torn off and sent to japan whence they would undoubtedly be shipped to paris the special market for the wings of seabirds slaughtered in the north pacific illustration laysan albatrosses before the great slaughter by the courtesy of hon walter rothschild illustration laysan albatross rookery after the great slaughter the same ground as shown in the preceding picture photographed in 1911 by prof homer r dill schlemmer the slaughterer bought a cheap vessel hired twentythree phlegmatic and coldblooded japanese laborers and organized a raid on laysan with the utmost secrecy he sailed from honolulu landed his birdkillers upon the seabird wonderland and turned them loose upon the birds for several months they slaughtered diligently and without mercy apparently it was the ambition of schlemmer to kill every bird on the island by the time the birdbutchers had accumulated between three and four carloads of wings and the carnage was half finished william a bryan professor of zoology in the college of honolulu heard of it and promptly wired the united states government without the loss of a moment the secretary of the navy despatched the revenue cutter thetis to the shambles of laysan when captain jacobs arrived he found that in round numbers about three hundred thousand birds had been destroyed and all that remained of them were several acres of bones and dead bodies and about three carloads of wings feathers and skins it was evident that schlemmers intention was to kill all the birds on the island and only the timely arrival of the thetis frustrated that bloody plan the twentythree japanese poachers were arrested and taken to honolulu for trial and the thetis also brought away all the stolen wings and plumage with the exception of one shedful of wings that had to be left behind on account of lack of carrying space that old shed with one end torn out and supposed to contain nearly fifty thousand pairs of wings was photographed by prof dill in 1911 as shown herewith illustration acres of gull and albatross bones photographed on laysan island by hr dill 1911 three hundred thousand albatrosses gulls terns and other birds were butchered to make a schlemmer holiday had the arrival of the thetis been delayed it is reasonably certain that every bird on laysan would have been killed to satisfy the wolfish rapacity of one moneygrubbing white man in 1911 the iowa state university despatched to laysan a scientific expedition in charge of prof homer r dill the party landed on the island on april 24 and remained until june 5 and the report of professor dill us department of agriculture is consumedly interesting to the friends of birds here is what he has said regarding the evidences of birdslaughter our first impression of laysan was that the poachers had stripped the place of bird life an area of over 300 acres on each side of the buildings was apparently abandoned only the shearwaters moaning in their burrows the little wingless rail skulking from one grass tussock to another and the saucy finch remained it is an excellent example of what prof nutting calls the survival of the inconspicuous here on every side are bones bleaching in the sun showing where the poachers had piled the bodies of the birds as they stripped them of wings and feathers in the old open guano shed were seen the remains of hundreds and possibly thousands of wings which were placed there but never cured for shipping as the marauders were interrupted in their work illustration shed pilled with wings of slaughtered birds on laysan island an old cistern back of one of the buildings tells a story of cruelty that surpasses anything else done by these heartless sanguinary pirates not excepting the practice of cutting wings from living birds and leaving them to die of hemorrhage in this dry cistern the living birds were kept by hundreds to slowly starve to death in this way the fatty tissue lying next to the skin was used up and the skin was left quite free from grease so that it required little or no cleaning during preparation many other revolting sights such as the remains of young birds that had been left to starve and birds with broken legs and deformed beaks were to be seen killing clubs nets and other implements used by these marauders were lying all about hundreds of boxes to be used in shipping the bird skins were packed in an old building it was very evident they intended to carry on their slaughter as long as the birds lasted not only did they kill and skin the larger species but they caught and caged the finch honey eater and miller bird cages and material for making them were foundreport of an expedition to laysan island in 1911 by homer r dill page 12 the report of professor bryan contains the following pertinent paragraphs this wholesale killing has had an appalling effect on the colony it is conservative to say that fully onehalf the number of birds of both species of albatross that were so abundant everywhere in 1903 have been killed the colonies that remain are in a sadly decimated condition over a large part of the island in some sections a hundred acres in a place that ten years ago were thickly inhabited by albatrosses not a single bird remains while heaps of the slain lie as mute testimony of the awful slaughter of these beautiful harmless and without doubt beneficial inhabitants of the high seas while the main activity of the plumehunters was directed against the albatrosses they were by no means averse to killing anything in the bird line that came in their way fortunately serious as were the depredations of the poachers their operations were interrupted before any of the species had been completely exterminated but the work of the evil genius of laysan did not stop with the slaughter of three hundred thousand birds mr schlemmer introduced rabbits and guineapigs and these rapidly multiplying rodents now are threatening to consume every plant on the island if the plants disappear many of the insects will go with them and this will mean the disappearance of the small insectivorous birds in february 1909 president roosevelt issued an executive order creating the hawaiian islands reservation for birds in this are included laysan and twelve other islands and reefs some of which are inhabited by birds that are well worth preserving by this act we may feel that for the future the birds of laysan and neighboring islets are secure from further attacks by the bloodyhanded agents of the vain women who still insist upon wearing the wings and feathers of wild birds chapter xv unfair firearms and shooting ethics for considerably more than a century the states of the american union have enacted gameprotective laws based on the principle that the wild game belongs to the people and the peoples senators representatives and legislators generally may therefore enact laws for its protection prescribing the manner in which it may and may not be taken and possessed the soundness of this principle has been fully confirmed by the supreme court of the united states in the case of geer vs connecticut on march 2 1896 the tendency of predatory man to kill and capture wild game of all kinds by wholesale methods is as old as the human race the days of the club the stone axe the bow and arrow and the flintlock gun were contemporaneous with the days of great abundance of game now that the advent of breechloaders repeaters automatics and fixed ammunition has rendered game scarce in all localities save a very few the thoughtful man is driven to consider measures for the checking of destruction and the suppression of wholesale slaughter first of all the deadly floating batteries and sailboats were prohibited today a punt gun is justly regarded as a relic of barbarism and any man who uses one places himself beyond the pale of decent sportsmanship or even of modern pothunting strange to say although the unwritten code of ethics of english sportsmen is very strict the english to this day permit wildfowl hunting with guns of huge calibre some of which are more like shotcannons than shotguns and they say well there are still wild duck on our coast beyond question it is now high time for the english people to take up the shotgun question and consider what today is fair and unfair in the killing of waterfowl the supply of british ducks and geese can not forever withstand the market gunners and their shotcannons has not the british wildfowl supply greatly decreased during the past fifteen years i strongly suspect that a careful investigation would reveal the fact that it has diminished the society for the preservation of the fauna of the empire should look into the matter and obtain a series of reports on the condition of the waterfowl today as compared with what it was twenty years ago in the united states we have eliminated the swivel guns the punt guns and the verybigbore guns among the real sportsmen the tendency is steadily toward shotguns of small calibre especially under 12gauge but outside the ranks of sportsmen we are now face to face with two automatic and five pump shotguns of deadly efficiency of these more than one hundred thousand are being made and sold annually by the five companies that produce them recently the annual output has been carefully estimated from known facts to be about as follows winchester arms co new haven conn 1 automatic and 1 pumpgun 50000 guns remington arms co ilion ny 1 automatic and 1 pumpgun 25000 marlin fire arms co new haven conn 1 pumpgun 12000

6 shots in 6 seconds remington automatic 5 shots in 4 seconds loaded and cocked by its own recoil winchester autoloading 5 shots in 4 seconds loaded and cocked by its own recoil the ethics of shooting and shotgunsare the american people willing that their wild birds shall be shot by machinery in the ethics of sportsmanship the anglers of america are miles ahead of the men who handle the rifle and shotgun in the hunting field will the hunters ever catch up the anglers have steadily diminished the weight of the rod and the size of the line and they have prohibited the use of gang hooks and nets in this respect the initiative of the tuna club of santa catalina is worthy of the highest admiration even though the leaping tuna the jewfish and the swordfish are big and powerful the club has elected to raise the standard of sportsmanship by making captures more difficult than ever before a higher degree of skill and nerve and judgment is required in the angler who would make good on a big fish and incidentally the fish has about double the show that it had fifteen years ago that is sportsmanship but how is it with the men who handle the shotgun by them the tuna clubs highclass principle has been exactly reversed in the making of fishingrods commercialism plays small part but in about forty cases out of every fifty the making of guns is solely a matter of dollars and profits excepting the condemnation of automatic and pump guns i think that few clubs of sportsmen have laid down laws designed to make shooting more difficult and to give the game more of a show to escape thousands of gentlemen sportsmen have their own separate unwritten codes of honor but so far as i know few of them have been written out and adopted as binding rules of action i know that among expert wing shots it is an unwritten law that quail and grouse must not be shot on the ground nor ducks on the water but among the three million gunners who annually shoot in the united states how many think you are there who in actual practice observe any sentimental principles when in the presence of killable game i should say about one man and boy out of every five hundred up to this time the great mass of men who handle guns have left it to the gunmakers to make their codes of ethics and hand them out with the loaded cartridges all ready for use for fifty years the makers of shotguns and rifles have taxed their ingenuity and resources to make killing easier especially for amateur sportsmenand take still greater advantages of the game look at this scale of progression fifty years increase in

1911 ten american manufacturing concerns turned out the following 391875 shotguns 666643 rifles and 580042 revolvers there are 66 factories producing firearms and ammunition employing 39377000 of invested capital and 15000 employees the sole and dominant thought of many gunmakers is to make the very deadliest guns that human skill can invent sell them as fast as possible and declare dividends on their stock the remington winchester marlin stevens and union companies are engaged in a mad race to see who can turn out the deadliest guns and the most of them on the market today there are five pumpguns that fire six shots each in about six seconds without removal from the shoulder by the quick sliding of a sleeve under the barrel that ejects the empty shell and inserts a loaded one there are two automatics that fire five shots each in five seconds or less by five pulls on the trigger the autoloading gun is reloaded and cocked again wholly by its own recoil now if these are not machine guns what are they in view of the great scarcity of feathered game and the number of deadly machine guns already on the market the production of the last and deadliest automatic gun by the winchester arms company already in great demand is a crime against wild life no less every human action is a matter of taste and individual honor it is natural for the duckbutchers of currituck to love the automatic shotguns as they do because they kill the most ducks per flock with two of them in his boat holding ten shots one expert duckkiller canand sometimes actually does so it is saidget every duck out of a flock up to seven or eight it is natural for an awkward and blundering wingshot to love the deadliest gun in order that he may make as good a bag as an expert shot can make with a doublebarreled gun it is natural for the hunter who does not care a rap about the extermination of species to love the gun that will enable him to kill up to the bag limit every time he takes the field it is natural for men who dont think or who think in circles to say so long as i observe the lawful bag limit what difference does it make what kind of a gun i use it is natural for the remington and winchester and marlin gunmakers to say as they do enforce the laws shorten the open seasons reduce the bag limit and then it wont matter what guns are used butdont touch autoloading guns dont hamper inventive genius is it not high time for american sportsmen to cease taking their moral principles and their codes of ethics from the gunmakers here is a question that i would like to put before every hunter of game in america in view of the alarming scarcity of game in view of the impending extermination of species by legal hunting can any highminded sportsman can any good citizen either sell a machine shotgun or use one in hunting a gentleman is incapable of taking an unfair advantage of any wild creature therefore a gentleman cannot use punt guns for ducks dynamite for game fish or automatic or pump guns in birdshooting the machine guns and silencers are grossly unfair and like ganghooks nets and dynamite for trout and bass their use in hunting must everywhere be prohibited by law times have changed and the lines for protection must be more tightly drawn illustration the champion game slaughter case one hours slaughter 218 geese with two automatic shotguns the supreme court of pennsylvania judge orlady has decided that the pennsylvania law against the use of automatic guns in hunting is entirely constitutional because every state has a right to say how its game may and may not be killed it is up to the american people to say now whether their wild life shall be slaughtered by machinery or not if they are willing that it should be then let us be consistent and sayaway with all conservation the game conservators can endure a gameless and birdless continent quite as well as the average citizen can how they workthere are a few apologists for the automatic and pump guns who cheerfully say so long as the bag limit is observed what difference does it make how the birds are killed it is strange that a conscientious man should ask such a question when the answer is apparent we reply the difference is that an automatic or pump gun will kill fully twice as many waterfowl as a doublebarrel if not more and it is highly undesirable that every gunner should get the bag limit of birds or any number near it the birds can not stand it moreover the best states for ducks and geese have no bag limits on those birds today on currituck sound for example the market hunters are killing all the waterfowl they can sell on marsh island louisiana one man has killed 369 ducks in one day and another market gunner killed 430 in one day the automatic and the pump shotguns are the favorite weapons of the gamehog who makes a specialty of geese and ducks it is no uncommon thing for a gunner who shoots a machine gun to get with one gun as high as eight birds out of one flock a man who has himself done this has told me so the champion gameslaughter casehere is a story from california that is no fairy tale it was published most innocently in a western magazine with the illustration that appears herewith and in which please notice the automatic shotgun february 5th i and a friend were at one of the glenn county clubs camps neither of us having ever had the pleasure of shooting over live decoys we were anxious and could hardly wait for the sport to commence on arriving at the scene we noticed holes which had been dug in the ground just large enough for a man to crawl into these holes were used for hiding places and were deep enough so the sportsmen would be entirely out of sight of the game the birds are so wild that to move a finger will frighten them the decoys are wild geese which had been crippled and tamed for this purpose they are placed inside of silk net fences which are located on each side of the holes dug for hiding places these nets are the color of the ground and it is impossible for the wild geese flying overhead to detect the difference after we had investigated everything the expert caller and owner of the outfit exclaimed into your holes we noticed in the distance a flock of geese coming our caller in a few seconds had their attention and they headed towards our decoys soon they were directly over us but out of easy range of our guns we were anxious to shoot but in obedience to our boss had to keep still and soon noticed that the birds were soaring around and in a short time were within fifteen or twenty feet of us at that moment we heard the command punch em and the bombardment that followed was beyond imagining we had fired five shots apiece and found we had bagged ten geese from this one flock at the end of one hours shooting we had 218 birds to our credit and were out of ammunition on finding that no more shells were in our pits we took our dead geese to the camp and returned with a new supply of ammunition we remained in the pits during the entire day when the sun had gone behind the mountains we summed up our kill and it amounted to 450 geese the picture shown with this article gives a view of the first hours shoot a photograph would have been taken of the remainder of the shoot but it being warm weather the birds had to be shipped at once in order to keep them from spoiling illustration slaughtered according to law a result of a faulty system such pictures as this are very common in sportsmens magazines note the automatic gun supper was then eaten after which we were driven back to willows both agreeing that it was one of the greatest days of sport we ever had and wishing that we might through the courtesy of the glenn county goose club have another such day chb another picture was published in a canadian magazine illustrating a story from which i quote i fixed the decoys hid my boat and took my position in the blind my man started his work with a will and hustled the ducks out of every cove inlet or piece of marsh for two miles around i had barely time to slip the cartridges into my gunsone a double and the other a five shot automaticwhen i saw a brace of birds coming toward me they sailed in over my decoys i rose to the occasion and the leader upended and tumbled in among the decoys the other bird unable to stop quick enough came directly over me he closed his wings and struck the ground in the rear of the blind more and more followed sometimes they came singly and then in twos and threes i kept busy and attended to each bird as quickly as possible whenever there was a lull in the flight i went out in the boat and picked up the dead leaving the wounded to take chances with any gunner lucky enough to catch them in open and smooth water a bird handy in the air is worth two wounded ones in the water twice i took six dead birds out of the water for seven shots and both guns empty the ball thus opened the birds commenced to move in all directions until the mornings flight was over i was kept busy pumping lead first with the 10 then with the automatic reloading picking up the dead etc and the reader will observe that the harmless innocent inoffensive automatic shot gun that dont matter if you enforce the bag limit figures prominently in both stories and both photographs a story of two pump guns and geeseit comes from aberdeen sd sand lake in the spring of 1911 mr jj humphrey tells it in outdoor life magazine for july 1911 smith and i were about a hundred yards from them the flock of canada geese when murphy scared them they rose in a dense mass and came directly between smith and me we were about gunshot distance apart and they were not over thirty feet in the air when we opened up on them with our pump guns and no 5 shot when the smoke cleared away and we had rounded up the cripples we found we had twentyone geese i have heard of bigger killings out in this country but never positively knew of them so then those two gunners averaged 1012 wild geese per pump gun out of one flock and yet there are wise and reflective sportsmen who say what difference does the kind of gun make so long as you live up to the law i think that the pump and automatic guns make about 75 percent of difference against the game that is all the number of shotguns now in use in the united states is almost beyond belief about six years ago a gentleman interested in the manufacture of such weapons informed me and his statement has never been disputed that every year about 500000 new shotguns were sold in the united states the number of shot cartridges annually produced by our four great cartridge companies has been reliably estimated as follows winchester arms co 300000000 union metallic cartridge co 250000000 peters cartridge co 150000000 western cartridge co 75000000 775000000 we must stop all the holes in the barrel or eventually lose all the water no group of birdslaughterers is entitled to immunity we will not limit the bag and enforce the laws while we permit the makers and users of autoloading and pump guns to kill at will as they demand illustration copy of letter national

is a sportsman with a fine game preserve of his own should be of general interest it was written to go shields march 21 1906 dear sir regarding the use of the automatic shotgun would say that i am a member of two southern ducking clubs where these guns are used very extensively i have seen a flock of ducks come into a blind where one two or even three of these guns were in use and have seen as many as eleven shots poured into a single flock we have considerable poaching on one of these clubs the territory being so extensive that it is impossible to prevent it we own 60000 acres and these poachers i am told nearly all use the automatic guns they frequently kill six or eight ducks out of one flockfirst taking a raking shot on the water and then getting in the balance of the magazine before the flock is out of range in fact some of them carry two guns and are able to discharge a part of the second magazine into the same flock as i told you the other evening i am not so much against the gun when in the hands of gentlemen and real sportsmen but on account of its terrible possibilities for market hunters i believe that the only safe way is to abolish it entirely and that the better class should be willing to give up this weapon as being the only means of putting a stop to this willful game slaughter very truly yours arthur robinson how gentlemen sportsmen regard

one hundred dollars for each offence and the carrying or possession in the woods or in any field or upon any water of any gun or other weapon the use of which is prohibited as aforesaid shall be prima facie evidence of the violation of this act the english 3barrel scatter rifle for ducksall gunners who find machine guns good enough for them will be delighted by the news that an englishman whose identity is concealed under the initials fmm has invented and manufactured a 3barreled rifle specially intended to kill ducks that are beyond the reach of a chokebore shotgun the weapon discharges all three barrels simultaneously in the london field of dec 9 1911 it is described by a writer who also thoughtfully conceals his identity under a nomdeplume after a trial of 48 shots the writer declares that the 3barreled is a really practicable weapon and that with it one could bag wildfowl that were quite out of reach of any shotgun just why a gatling gun or a maxim should not be employed for the same purpose the writer fails to state the use of either would be quite as sportsmanlike and as fair to the game there are great possibilities in ducking mortars also the sunday guna new weapon of peculiar form and great deadliness to song birds has recently come into use because of the manner of its use it is known as the sunday gun it is specially adapted to concealment on the person a man could go through a reception with one of these deadly weapons absolutely concealed under his dress coat it is a weapon with two barrels rifle and shot and it enables the user to kill anything from a hummingbird up to a deer what the shotbarrel can not kill the rifle will it is not a gun that any sportsman would own save as a curiosity or for target use the state ornithologist of massachusetts mr eh forbush informs me that already the sunday gun has become a scourge to the bird life of that state thousands of them are used by men and boys who live in cities and towns and are able to get into the country only on sundays they conceal them under their coats on sunday mornings go out into the country and spend the day in shooting small birds and mammals the dead birds are concealed in various pockets the sunday gun goes under the coat and at nightfall the guerrilla rides back to the city with an innocent smile on his face as if he had spent a day in harmless enjoyment of the beauties of nature the sunday gun is on sale everywhere and it is said to be in use both by american and italian killers of songbirds it weighs only two pounds eight ounces and its cost is so trifling that any guerrilla who wishes one can easily find the money for its purchase there are in the united states at least a million men and boys quite mean enough to use this weapon on songbirds swallows woodpeckers nuthatches rabbits and squirrels and like other criminals hide both weapon and loot in their clothing so long as this gun is in circulation no small bird is safe at any season near any city or town now what are the people going to do about it my recommendation is that each state enact a law in the following terms be it enacted etcthat from and after the passage of this act it shall be unlawful for any person to use in hunting or to carry concealed on the person any shotgun or rifle or combination of shotgun and rifle with a barrel or barrels less than twentyeight inches in length or with a skeleton stock fixed on a hinge the carrying of any rifle or shotgun concealed on the person shall constitute a felony the penalties for hunting with any gun specially adapted to concealment should be not less than 50 fine or two months imprisonment at hard labor and the carrying of such weapons concealed should be 100 or four months at hard labor incidentally we wonder what will be the next devilish device for the destruction of wild life that american inventive genius will produce illustration the sunday gun a deadly combination of concealable rifleandshotgun illustration the wilderness of north america shaded and the arctic prairies well stocked with big game chapter xvi the present and future of north american big game the subject of this chapter opens up a vast field of facts and conclusions quite broad enough to fill a whole volume in the space at our disposal here it is possible to offer only a summary of the subject without attempting to prove our statements by the production of detailed evidence to say that all over the world the large land mammals are being destroyed more rapidly than they are breeding would not be literally true for the reason that there are yet many areas that are almost untouched by the destroying hand of civilized man it is true however that all the unspoiled areas rapidly are growing fewer and smaller it is also true that in all the regions of the earth that are easily penetrable by civilized man the wild life is being killed faster than it breeds and of necessity it is disappearing this is why the british are now so urgently bestirring themselves to create game preserves in all the countries that they own it is one of the inexorable laws of nature to which i know of not one exception that large hoofed animals which live on open plains on open mountains or in regions that are thinly forested always are easily found and easily exterminated all such animals have a weak hold on life this is because it is so difficult for them to hide and so very easy for man to creep up within the killing range of modern highpower longrange rifles is it not pitiful to think of animals like the caribou moose white sheep and bear trying to survive on the naked ridges and bald mountains of yukon territory and alaska with a modern rifle the greatest duffer on earth can creep up within killing distance of any of the big game of the north the gray wolf is practically the only large animal that is able to hide successfully and survive in the treeless regions of the north but his room is always preferable to his company because he too is a destroyer of big game i am tempted to try to map out roughly what are today the unopened and undestroyed wild haunts of big game in north america in doing this however i warn the reader not to be deceived into thinking that because game still exists in those regions those areas therefore constitute a permanent preserve and safe breedingground for large mammals that is very very far from being the case the further opening up of the wilderness areas as i shall call them for convenience can and surely will quickly wipe out their big game for throughout ninetenths of those areas it holds to life by very slender threads today the unopened and undestroyed wilderness areas of north america wherein large mammals still live in a normal wild state are in general as follows the arctic barren grounds or arctic prairies north of the limit of trees embracing the barren grounds of northern canada the great arctic archipelago ellesmere melville and grant lands and greenland this region is the home of the muskox and three species of arctic caribou the alaskayukon region inhabited by the moose white mountain sheep mountain goat four species of caribou and half a dozen species of alaska brown grizzly and black bears northern ontario quebec labrador and newfoundland inhabited by moose woodland caribou whitetailed deer and black bear british columbia inhabited by a magnificent biggame fauna embracing the moose elk caribou of two species white sheep black sheep bighorn sheep mule deer whitetailed deer mountain goat grizzly black and inland white bears the sierra madre of mexico containing jaguar puma grizzly and black bears mule deer whitetailed deer antelope mountain sheep and peccaries i have necessarily omitted all those regions of the united states and canada that still contain a remnant of big game but have been literally shot to pieces by gunners in the united states and southern canada there are about fifteen localities which contain a supply of big game sufficient that a conscientious sportsman might therein hunt and kill one head per year with a clear conscience all others should be closed for five years here is the list of availables and regarding it there will be about as many opinions as there are biggame sportsmen hunting grounds in and near the united states and southern canada wherein it is right to hunt big game the maine woods well stocked with whitetailed deer new brunswick well stocked with moose a few caribou deer and black bear white mountains of new hampshire and vermont for deer the adirondacks new york well stocked with whitetailed deer only pennsylvania mountains contain many deer and black bears and soon will contain more northern minnesota deer and moose northern michigan and wisconsin whitetailed deer northwestern wyoming thousands of elk in fall and winter a few deer grizzly and black bears but no sheep that it would be right to kill western and southwestern montana elk in season mule and whitetail deer no sheep that it would be right to kill northwestern montana mule and whitetailed deer only no sheep bear moose elk or antelope to kill wyoming east of yellowstone park a few elk by migration from the park a few deer and bear of two species northern woods of ontario and quebec moose deer southern british columbia goat a few sheep and deer grizzly bear moose caribou and elk should not be killed northern british columbia six fine species of big game northwestern alberta grizzly bear bighorn and mountain goat under existing conditions i regard the abovenamed hunting grounds as nearly all in which it is right or fair for biggame hunting now to be permitted even on a strict basis nearly all others should immediately be closed for large game for ten years of course such a proceeding if carried into effect would provoke loud protests from sportsmen gunners gamehogs pothunters and others but i only wish to high heaven that we had the power to carry such a program as that into effect then we would see some game in ten years and our grandchildren would thank us for some real biggame protection at a critical period except in the few localities abovementioned i regard the biggame situation in the united states and southern canada as particularly desperate unless there is an immediate and complete revolution in this country from an era of slaughter to an era of preservation as sure as the sun rises on the morrow outside of the hard and fast game preserves and places like maine and the adirondacks this generation of americans and nearamericans will live to see our country swept clean of big game two years ago i did not believe this but i do now it is impossible to exaggerate the wide extent or the seriousness of this situation in a country where any and every individual can rise and bluster imjustasgoodasyouare and bellow for his rights as a taxpayer there is no stopping the millions who kill whenever there is an open season and to many americans no right is dearer than the right to kill the game which by even the commonest law of equity belongs not to the shooter exclusively but partly to two thousand other persons who dont shoot at all unless we come to an about face in quick time all our big game outside the preserves is doomed to sure and quick extermination this is not an individual opinion merely it is a fact and a hundred thousand men know it to be such last winter 191112 because the deer of montana were driven by cold and hunger out of the mountains and far down into the ranchmens valleys eleven thousand of them were ruthlessly slaughtered state game warden avare says that often heads of families took out as many licenses as there were persons in the family and the whole quota was killed such people deserve to go deerless into the future but we can not allow them to rob innocent people our species of big game the pronghorned antelope unique and wonderful will be one of the first species of north american big game to become totally extinct we may see this come to pass within twenty years they can not be bred in protection save in very large fenced ranges they are delicate capricious and easily upset they die literally at the drop of a hat they are quite subject to actinomycosis lumpyjaw which in wild animals is incurable already all the states that possess wild antelope except nevada have passed laws giving that species long close seasons which is highly creditable to the states that have done their duty nevada must get in line at the next session of her legislature in 1908 dr ts palmer published in his annual report of progress in game protection the following in regard to the pronghorned antelope antelope are still found in diminished numbers in fourteen western states a considerable number were killed during the year in montana where the species seems to have suffered more than elsewhere since the season was opened in 1907 a striking illustration of the decrease of the antelope is afforded by colorado in 1898 the state warden estimated that there were 25000 in the state whereas in 1908 the game commissioner places the number at only 2000 the total number of antelope now in the united states probably does not exceed 17000 distributed approximately as follows colorado 2000 yellowstone park 2000 idaho 200 other states 2000 montana 4000 new mexico 1300 saskatchewan 2000 oregon 1500 wyoming 4000 19000 today 1912 dr palmer says the total number of antelope is less than it was in 1908 and in spite of protection the number is steadily diminishing this is indeed serious news the existing bands already small are steadily growing smaller the antelope are killed lawlessly and the crimes of such slaughter are in nearly every instance successfully concealed previously we have based strong hopes for the preservation of the antelope species on the herd in the yellowstone park but those animals are vanishing fearfully fast in 1906 dr palmer reported that about fifteen hundred antelope came down to the feeding grounds near the haystacks in the vicinity of gardiner in 1908 the yellowstone park was credited with two thousand head today the number alive by actual count is only five hundred head and this after twentyfive years of protection where have the others gone this shows alas that perpetual close seasons can not always bring back the vanished thousands of game illustration pronghorned antelope here is a reliable report june 29 1912 regarding the pronghorned antelope in lower california from ew nelson antelope formerly ranged over nearly the entire length of lower california but are now gone from a large part of their ancient range and their steadily decreasing numbers indicate their early extinction throughout the peninsula in captivity the antelope is exasperatingly delicate and shortlived it has about as much stamina as a pet monkey as an exhibition animal in zoological gardens and parks it is a failure for it always looks faded spiritless and dead like a stuffed animal ready to be thrown into the discard zoologists can not save the pronghorn species save at long range in preserves so huge that the sensitive little beast will not even suspect that it is confined two serious attempts have been made to transplant and acclimatize the antelopein the wichita national bison range in oklahoma and in the montana bison range at ravalli in 1911 the boone and crockett club provided a fund which defrayed the expenses of shipping from the yellowstone park a small nucleus herd to each of those ranges eight were sent to the wichita range of which five arrived alive of the seven sent to the montana range four arrived alive and were duly set free while it seems a pity to take specimens from the yellowstone park herd the disagreeable fact is that there is no other source on which to draw for breeding stock the provinces of alberta and saskatchewan in canada still permit the hunting and killing of antelope which is wholly and entirely wrong the bighorn sheepof north american big game the bighorn of the rockies will be after the antelope the next species to become extinct outside of protected areas in the united states that event is fast approaching it is far nearer than even the biggame sportsmen realize there are today only two localities in the four states that still think they have killable sheep in which it is worth while to go sheephunting one is in montana and the other is in wyoming in the united states a really big creditable ram may now be regarded as an impossibility there are now perhaps half a dozen guides who can find killable sheep in our country but the game is nearly always young rams under five years of age that wyoming montana idaho and washington still continue to permit sheep slaughter is outrageous their answer is that the sportsmen wont stand for stopping it altogether i will addand the great mass of people are too criminally indifferent to take a hand in the matter and do their duty regardless of the men of blood the seed stock of bighorn sheep now alive in the united states aggregates a pitifully small number after twentyfive years of unbroken protection in colorado dillon wallace estimates after an investigation on the ground that the state possesses perhaps thirtyfive hundred head he credits montana and wyoming with five hundred eachwhich i think is far too liberal a number i do not believe that either of those states contains more than one hundred unprotected sheep at the very utmost limit if there are more where are they in the yellowstone park there are 210 head safe and sound and slowly increasing i can not understand why they have not increased more rapidly than they have in glacier park now under permanent protection three guides on lake mcdonald in 1910 estimated the number of sheep at seven hundred idaho has in her rugged bitter root and clearwater mountains and elsewhere a remnant of possibly two hundred sheep and washington has only what chemists call a trace it has recently been discovered that california still contains a few sheep and in southwestern nevada there are a few more in utah the bighorn species is probably quite extinct in arizona there are a few very small bands very widely scattered they are in the santa catalina mountains the grand canyon country the gila range and the quitovaquita mountains near sonoyta but who can protect from slaughter those arizona sheep absolutely no one they are too few and too widely scattered for the game wardens to keep in touch with them the prospectors have them entirely at their mercy and the world well knows what prospectors mercy to edible big game looks like on the ground it leads straight to the fryingpan the coyotes and the vultures the lower california peninsula contains about five hundred mountain sheep without the slightest protection save low desert mountains heat and thirst but that is no real protection whatever those sheep are too fine to be butchered the way they have been and now are being butchered in 1908 i strongly called the attention of the mexican government to the situation and the departmento de fomento secured the issue of an executive order forbidding the hunting of any big game in lower california without the written authority of the government i am sure however that owing to the political and military upheaval it never stopped the slaughter of sheep in such easy mountains as those of lower california it is a simple matter to exterminate quickly all the mountain sheep that they possess the time for president madero and his cabinet to inaugurate serious protective measures has fully arrived both british columbia and alberta have even yet fine herds of bighorn and we can count three large game preserves in which they are protected they are goat mountain park east kootenay district between the elk and bull rivers the rocky mountains park near banff and waterton lakes park in the southwestern corner of alberta in view of the number of men who desire to hunt them the bag limit on bighorn rams in british columbia and alberta still is too liberal by half one ram per year for one man is quite enough quite as much so as one moose is the limit everywhere today a big old ram is regarded by sportsmen as a much more desirable and creditable trophy than a moose because moosekilling is easy and the bagging of an old mountain ram in real mountains requires five times as much effort and skill the splendid high and rugged mountains of british columbia and alberta form an ideal home for the bighorn and mountain goat and it would be an international calamity for that region to be denuded of its splendid big game with resolute intent and judicial treatment that region can remain a rich and valuable hunting ground for five hundred years to come under falsely liberal laws it can be shot into a state of complete desolation within ten years or even less other mountain sheepin northern british columbia north of iskoot lake there lies a tremendous region extending to the arctic ocean and comprehending the whole area between the rocky mountain continental divide and the waters of the pacific over the southern end of this great wilderness ranges the black mountain sheep and throughout the remainder with many sheepless intervals is scattered the white mountain sheep owing to the immensity of this wilderness the wellnigh total lack of railroads and also of navigable waters excepting the yukon it will not be thoroughly opened up for a quarter of a century the few resolute and pneumoniaproof sportsmen who can wade into the country pulling boats through icycold mountain streams are not going to devastate those millions of mountains of their big game the few head of game which sportsmen can and will take out of the great northwestern wilderness during the next twentyfive years will hardly be missed from the grand total even though a few easilyaccessible localities are shot out it is the deadly resident trappers hunters and prospectors who must be feared and againwho can control them can any wilderness government on earth make it possible therefore in time even the great wilderness will be denuded of big game this is absolutely fixed and certain for within much less than another century every square rod of it will have been gone over by prospectors lumbermen trappers and skinhunters and raked again and again with finetoothed combs a railway line to dawson the copper river and cook inlet is today merely the next thing to expect after canadas present railway program has been wrought out yes indeed in time the wilderness will be opened up and the big game will all be shot out save from the protected areas the mountain goateven yet this species is not wholly extinct in the united states it survives in glacier park montana and the number estimated in that region by three guide friends is too astoundingly large to mention this animal is much more easily killed than the bighorn its white coat renders it fatally conspicuous at long range during the best hunting season it is almost devoid of fear and it takes altogether too many chances on man thanks to the rage for sheep horns the average sportsmans viewpoint regarding wild life ranks a goat head about six contours below old ram heads in desirability furthermore most guides regard the flesh of the goat as almost unfit for use as food and far inferior to that of the bighorn these reasons taken together render the goats much less persecuted by the sportsmen ranchmen and prospectors who enter the home of the two species it was because of this indifference toward goats that in 1905 mr john m phillips and his party saw 243 goats in thirty days in goat mountain park and only fourteen sheep unless the preferences of western sportsmen and gunners change very considerably the coast mountains of the great northwestern wilderness will remain stocked with wild mountain goats until long after the last bighorn has been shot to death fortunately the skin of the mountain goat has no commercial value i think it was in 1887 that i purchased in denver 150 nicely tanned skins of our wild white goat at fifty cents each they were wanted for the first exhibit ever made to illustrate the extermination of american large mammals and they were shown at the louisville exposition it must have cost the price of those skins to tan them and i was pleased to know that some one lost money on the venture illustration map of the former and existing ranges of the american elk from life history of northern animals copyright 1909 by et seton at present the mountain goat extends from northwestern montana to the head of cook inlet but it is not found in the interior or in the yukon valley whenever man decides that the species has lived long enough he can quickly and easily exterminate it it is one of the most picturesque and interesting wild animals on this continent and there is not the slightest excuse for shooting it save as a specimen of natural history like the antelope it is so unique as a natural curiosity that it deserves to be taken out of the ranks of animals that are regularly pursued as game the elkthe story of the progressive extermination of the american elk or wapiti covers practically the same territory as the tragedy of the american bisononethird of the mainland of north america the former range of the elk covered absolutely the garden ground of our continent omitting the arid region its boundary extended from central massachusetts to northern georgia southern illinois northern texas and central new mexico central arizona the whole rocky mountain region up to the peace river and manitoba it skipped the arid country west of the rockies but it embraced practically the whole pacific slope from central california to the north end of vancouver island mr seton roughly calculated the former range of canadensis at two and a half million square miles and adds we are safe therefore in believing that in those days there may have been ten million head the range of the elk covered a magnificent domain the map prepared by mr ernest t seton after twenty years of research is the last word on the subject it appears on page 43 vol i of his great work life histories of northern animals and i have the permission of author and publisher to reproduce it here as an object lesson in wildanimal extermination mr seton recognizes for convenience only four forms of american elk two of which c nannodes and occidentalis still exist on the pacific coast the fourth cervus merriami was undoubtedly a valid species it lived in arizona and new mexico but became totally extinct near the beginning of the present century in 1909 mr seton published in the work referred to above a remarkably close estimate of the number of elk then alive in north america recently a rough countthe first ever madeof the elk in and around the yellowstone park revealed the real number of that largest contingent by taking those results and mr setons figures for elk outside the united states we obtain the following very close approximation of the wild elk alive in north america in 1912 locality number authority

america 54850 in 1905 a herd of twenty of the socalled dwarf elk of the san joaquin valley california were taken to the sequoia national park and placed in a fenced range that had been established for it on the kaweah river the extermination of the wapiti began with the settlement of the american colonies naturally the largest animals were the ones most eagerly sought by the meathungry pioneers and the elk and bison were the first game species to disappear the colonists believed in the survival of the fittest and we are glad that they did the one thing that a hungry pioneer cannot withstand istemptationin a form that embraces five hundred pounds of succulent flesh and let it not be supposed that in the eastern states there were only a few elk the pennsylvania salt licks were crowded with them and the early writers describe them as existing in immense bands and great numbers of course it is impossible for wild animals of great size to exist in countries that are covered with farms villages and people under such conditions the wild and the tame cannot harmonize it is a fact however that elk could exist and thrive in every national forest and national park in our country and also on uncountable hundreds of thousands of rough wild timbered hills and mountains such as exist in probably twentyfive different states there is no reason except mans shortsighted greed and foolishness why there are not today one hundred thousand elk living in the allegheny mountains furnishing each year fifty thousand threeyearold males as free food for the people the trouble isthe greedy habitants could not be induced to kill only the threeyearoldmales in the fall and let the cows calves and breeding bulls alone by sensible management the rocky mountains the sierra nevadas and the coast range would support enough wild elk to feed a million people but we americans seem utterly incapable of maintaining anywhere from decade to decade a large and really valuable supply of wild game outside the yellowstone park and northwestern wyoming the american elk exists only in small bandsmere remnants and samples of the millions we could and should have if they could be protected and the surplus presently killed according to some rational working system then every national forest in the united states should be stocked with elk in view of the awful cost of beef today 1012 cents per pound in chicago on the hoof it is high time that we should consider the raising of game on the public domain on such lines that it would form a valuable food supply without diminishing the value of the forests just now 1912 the american people are sorely puzzled by a remarkable elk problem that each winter is presented for solution in the jackson hole country wyoming driven southward by the deep snows of winter the elk thousands that in summer graze and grow fat in the yellowstone park march down into jackson hole to find in those valleys less snow and more food now it happens that the best and most of the former winter grazing grounds of the elk are covered by fenced ranches as a result the elk that strive to winter there about fifteen thousand head are each winter threatened with starvation and during three or four winters of recent date an aggregate of several thousand calves weak yearlings and weakened cows perished of hunger the winters of 1908 1909 and 1910 were progressively more and more severe and 1911 saw about 2500 deaths sn leek in 190910 the state of wyoming spent 7000 for hay and fed it to the starving elk in 1911 wyoming spent 5000 more and appealed to congress for help thanks to the efforts of senator lodge and others congress instantly responded with a splendid emergency appropriation of 20000 partly for the purpose of feeding the elk and also to meet the cost of transporting elsewhere as many of the elk as it might seem best to move the starving of the elk ceased with 1911 outdoor life magazine denver colo for august 1912 contains an excellent article by dr wb shore entitled trapping and shipping elk i wish i could reprint it entire for the solid information that it contains it gives a clear and comprehensive account of last springs operations by the government and by the state of montana in capturing and shipping elk from the yellowstone park herd for the double purpose of diminishing the elk surplus in the park and stocking vacant ranges elsewhere the operations were conducted on the same basis as the shipping of cattlethe corral the chute the open car and the carload in bulk dr shore states that the undertaking was really no more difficult than the shipping of range cattle but the presence of a considerable proportion of young and tender calves such as are never handled with beef cattle led to 88 per cent of deaths in transit the deaths and the percentage are nothing at which to be surprised when it is remembered that the animals had just come through a hard winter and their natural vitality was at the lowest point of the year the following is a condensed summary of the results of the work number of hours on killed or died after destination elk road died in car unloading 1 car startup washington 60

by the state of montana in order to provide adequate winter grazing grounds for the yellowstonewyoming elk it seems imperative that the national government should expend between 30000 and 40000 in buying back from ranchmen certain areas in the jackson valley particularly a tract known as the swamp and others on the surrounding foothills where the herds annually go to graze in winter a measure to render this possible was presented to congress in the winter of 1912 and without opposition an appropriation of 45000 was made the splendid photographs of the elk herds that recently have been made by sn leek of jackson hole clearly reveal the fact that the herds now consist chiefly of cows calves yearlings and young bulls with small antlers in one photograph showing about twentyfive hundred elk there are not visible even half a dozen pairs of antlers that belong to adult bulls there should be a hundred this condition means that the best bulls with the finest heads are constantly being selected and killed by sportsmen and others who want their heads and the young immature bulls are left to do the breeding that alone will sustain the species illustration hungry elk in jackson hole wyoming part of a herd of about 2500 head being fed on hay in the winter of 191011 note the absence of adult bulls copyright 1911 by sn leek it is a wellknown principle in stockbreeding that sires should be fully adult of maximum strength and in the prime of life no stockbreeder in his senses ever thinks of breeding from a youthful immature sire the result would be weak offspring not up to the standard this inexorable law of inheritance and transmission is just as much a law for the elk moose and deer of north america as it is for domestic cattle and horses if the present conditions in the wyoming elk herds continue to prevail for several generations as sure as time goes on we shall see a marked deterioration in the size and antlers of the elk if the foundation principles of stockbreeding are correct then it is impossible to maintain any largemammal species at its zenith of size strength and virility by continuous breeding of the young and immature males by some sportsmen it is believed that through longcontinued killing of the finest and largest males the red deer of europe have been growing smaller but on that point i am not prepared to offer evidence in regard to the inbreeding of the elk herds in large open parks and preserves throughout north america there are positively no ill effects to fear wild animals that are closely confined generation after generation are bound to deteriorate physically but with healthy wild animals living in large open ranges feeding and breeding naturally the inbreeding that occurs produces no deterioration in the twin certainties of overpopulation and deterioration from excessive killing of the good sires we have to face two new problems of very decided importance nothing short of very radical measures will provide a remedy for the immediate future i can offer a solution while it seems almost impossible deliberately to kill females i think that the present is a very exceptional case and one that compels us to apply the painful remedy that i now propose premises 1there are at present too many breeding cows in the yellowstone herds 2there are far too few good breeding bulls conclusionfor five years entirely prohibit the killing of adult male elk and kill only females and young males this would gradually diminish the number of calves born each year by about 2500 and by the end of five years it would reduce the number and the annual birth of females to a figure sufficiently limited that the herds could be maintained on existing ranges corollaryat the end of five years stop killing females and kill only young males this plan would permit a large number of bull elk to mature and then the largest and strongest animals would do the breedingjust as nature always intends shall be done south america of all the biggame regions of the earth south america is the poorest of hoofed game she possesses only a dozen species that are worth the attention of sportsmen and like all other animal life in that land of little game they are desperately hard to find in south america you must work your heart out in order to get either game or specimens that will be worth showing at present we need not worry about the marsh deer the pampas deer the guemal or the venado nor the tapir jaguar ocelot and bears all these species are abundantly able to take care of themselves and to find and kill any one of them is a mans task in patagonia the natives do wastefully slaughter the guanacos and there are times also when great numbers of guanacos come down in winter to certain mountain lakes presumably in search of food and perish by hundreds through starvation h hesketh prichard mexico about ten years more will see the extinction of the mountain sheep of lower californiain the wake of the recently exterminated mexican sheep of the santa maria lakes region in 1908 i solemnly warned the government of president diaz and at that time the mexican government expressed much concern it is a great pity that just now political conditions are completely estopping wildlife protection in mexico but it is true if the code of proposed laws that i drew up by request in 1908 and submitted to minister molina were adopted it would have a good effect on the fauna of mexico in mexico there is little hoofed game to killdeer of the whitetail groups seven or eight species the desert mule deer the brocket the pronghorned antelope the mountain sheep and the peccary the deer will not so easily be exterminated but the antelope and sheep will be utterly destroyed they will be the first to go and i think they can not by any possibility last longer than ten years is it not too bad that mexico should permit her finest species of hoofed and horned game to be obliterated before she awakens to the desirability of conservation the mexicans could protect their small stock of big game if they would but in lower california they are leasing huge tracts of land to cattle companies and they permit the lessees to kill all the wild game they please on their leased lands even with the aid of dogs this is a vicious and fatal system and contrary to all the laws of nations chapter xvii present and future of north american big game concluded the whitetailed deerfive hundred years hence when the greed and rapacity of civilized man has completed the loot and ruin of the continent of north america the whitetailed deer will be the last species of our big game to be exterminated its mental traits its size its color and its habits all combine to render it the most persistent of our large animals and the best fitted to survive it neither bawls nor bugles to attract its enemies it can not be called to a sportsman like the moose and it sticks to its timber with rare and commendable closeness when it sees a strange living thing walking erect it does not stop to stare and catch softnosed bullets but dashes away in quest of solitude the worst shooting that i ever did or saw done at game was at running whitetailed deer in the montana river bottoms for the reasons given the whitetail exists and persists in a hundred united states localities from which all other big game save the black bear have been exterminated for example in our adirondacks the moose were exterminated years and years ago but the beloved wilderness called the north woods still is populated by about 20000 deer and about 8000 are killed annually the deer of maine are sufficiently numerous that in 1909 a total of 15879 were killed with some assistance from the thin sprinkling of moose and caribou the deer of maine annually draw into that state for permanent dedication a huge sum of money variously estimated at from 1000000 to 2000000 in spite of heavy slaughter and vigorous attempts at extermination by overshooting the deer of northern michigan obstinately refuse to be wiped out there is however a large group of states in which this species has been exterminated the states comprising it are ohio indiana illinois iowa and adjacent portions of seven other states as if to shame the people of iowa a curious deer episode is recorded in 1885 wb cuppy of avoca iowa purchased five deer and placed them in a paddock on his 600acre farm by 1900 they had increased to 32 head and then one night some one kindly opened the gate of their enclosure and gave them the freedom of the city mr cuppy made no effort to capture them possibly because they decided to annex his farm as their habitat when a neighbor led them with a bait of corn to their owners door he declined to impound them on the ground that it was unnecessary by 1912 those deer had increased to 400 and the portion of this story that no one will believe is this they spread all through the suburbs and hinterland farms of avoca and the people not only failed to assassinate all of them and eat them but they actually killed only a few protected the rest and made pets of many queer people those men and boys of avoca nearly everywhere else in the world that i know that history would have been ended differently here in the east 90 per cent of our people are like the avocans but the other 10 per cent think only of slaying and eating sans mercy sans decency sans law now the state of iowa has taken hold to capture some of those deer and set them free in other portions of the state elsewhere i shall note the quick and thorough success with which the whitetailed deer has been brought back in vermont massachusetts connecticut and southern new york no state having waste lands covered with brush or timber need be without the ubiquitous whitetailed deer give them a semblance of a fair show and they will live and breed with surprising fecundity and persistence if you start a park herd with ten does soon you will have more deer than you will know how to dispose of unless you market them under a bayne law duly tagged by the state in close confinement this species fares rather poorly in large preserves it does well but during the rutting season the bucks are to be dreaded and those that develop aggressive traits should be shot and marketed this is the only way in which the deer parks of england are kept safe for unarmed people dr ts palmer has taken much pains to ascertain the number of deer killed in the eastern united states his records as published in may 1910 are as follows state 1908 1909 1910 maine 15000 15879 15000 new hampshire

massachusetts 1281 total 59878 57494 60150 a no statistics available at this date deer hunting is not permitted at any time in indiana illinois iowa nebraska and kansaswhere there are no wild deer nor in rhode island connecticut delaware tennessee or kentucky the long close seasons in massachusetts connecticut and southern new york have caused a great migration of deer into those oncedepopulated regionsin fact right down to tidewater the mule deerthis will be the first member of the deer family to become extinct in north america outside of the protected portions of its haunts its fatal preference for open ground and its habit of pausing to stare at the hunter have been and to the end will be its undoing possibly there are now two of these deer in the united states and british columbia for every 98 that existed forty years ago but no more it is a deer of the bad lands and foothills and its curiosity is fatal the number of sportsmen who have hunted and killed this fine animal in its own wild and picturesque badlands is indeed quite small it has been fourfifths exterminated by the resident hunter and ranchman and today is found in the rocky mountain region most sparingly ten years ago it seemed right to hunt the socalled rocky mountain blacktail in northwestern montana because so many deer were there it did not seem to spell extermination now conditions have changed since last winters great slaughter in northwestern montana of 11000 hungry deer the species has been so reduced that it is no longer right to kill mule deer anywhere in our country and a universal close season for five years is the duty of every state which contains that species the real blacktailed deer of the pacific coast odocoileus columbianus is to most sportsmen of the rocky mountains and the east actually less known than the okapi not one out of every hundred of them can recognize a mounted head of it at sight it is a small delicatelyformed delicatelyantlered understudy of the big mule deer and now painfully limited in its distribution it is the deer of california and western oregon and it has been so ruthlessly slaughtered that today it is going fast as conditions stand today and without a radical change on the part of the people of the pacific coast this very interesting species is bound to disappear it will not be persistent like the whitetailed deer but in the heavy forests it will last much longer than the mule deer my information regarding this deer is like the stock of specimens of it in museum collectionsmeager and unsatisfactory we need to know in detail how that species is faring today and what its prospects are for the immediate future in 1900 i saw great piles of skins from it in the fur houses of seattle and the sight gave me much concern the caribou generallyi think it is not very difficult to forecast the future of the genus rangifer in north america from the logic of the conditions of today thanks to the splendid mass of information that has been accumulated regarding this group we are able to draw certain conclusions i think that the caribou of the canadian barren grounds and northeastern alaska will survive in great numbers for at least another century that the caribou herds of newfoundland will last nearly as long and that in fifty years or less all the caribou of the great northwestern wilderness will be swept away the reasons for these conclusions are by no means obscure or farfetched in the first place the barrenground caribou are today enormously numerousundoubtedly running up into millions it can not be possible that they are being killed faster than they are breeding and so they must be increasing their food supply is unlimited they are protected by two redoubtable championsjack frost and the mosquito their country never will contain a great human population the natives are so few in number and so lazy that even though they should become supplied with modern firearms it is unlikely that they ever will make a serious impression on the caribou millions the only thing to fear for the barrenground caribou throngs is diseasea factor that is beyond human prediction it is reasonably certain that the barren grounds never will be netted by railwaysunless gold is discovered over a wide area the fierce cold and hunger and the billions of mosquitoes of the barren grounds will protect the caribou from the wholesale slaughter that civilized man joyously would inflictif he had the chance the caribou thousands of newfoundland are fairly accessible to sportsmen and pothunters but at the same time the colonial government can protect them from extermination if it will already much has been done to check the reckless and wicked slaughter that once prevailed a bag limit of three bull caribou per annum has been fixed which is enforced as to nonresidents and sportsmen but in a way that is much too american it is often ignored by residents in touch with the game for instance the guide of a new york gentleman whom i know admitted to my friend that each year he killed about 25 caribou for himself and his family of four other persons he explained thus when the inspector comes around i show him two caribou hanging in my woodshed but back in the woods i have a little shack where i keep the others until i want them the real sportsmen of the world never will make the slightest perceptible impression on the caribou of newfoundland for one thing the hunting is much too tame to be interesting if the caribou of that island ever are exterminated it will be strictly by the people of newfoundland themselves if the government will tighten its grip on the herds they need never be exterminated the caribou of new brunswick quebec and ontario are few and widely scattered unless carefully conserved they are not likely to last long for their country is annually penetrated in every direction by armed men white and red there is no means by which it can be proven but from the number of armed men in those regions i feel sure that the typical woodland caribou species is being shot faster than it is breeding the sportsmen and naturalists of canada and new brunswick would render good service by making a close and careful investigation of that question the caribou of the northwestern wilderness are in a situation peculiarly their own they inhabit a region of naked mountains and thin forests wherein they are conspicuous easily stalked and easily killed nowhere do they exist in large herds of thousands or even of many hundreds they live in small bands of from ten to twenty head and even those are far apart the region in which they live is certain to be thoroughly opened up by railways and exploited fifty years from now we will find every portion of the nowwild northwest fairly accessible by rail the building of the railways will be to the caribouand to other big gamethe day of doom in that wild rough region no power on earthsave that which might be able to deprive all the inhabitants and all visitors of firearmscan possibly save the game outside of a few preserves that are diligently patroled the big game of the northwest region in which i include the interior of alaska will go it is only a question of time already the building of the city of fairbanks and the exploitation of the mining districts surrounding it have led to such harassment and slaughter of the migrating caribou that the great herd which formerly traversed the tanana country once a year has completely changed its migration route and now keeps much farther north the crossing of the yukon near eagle city has been abandoned a hundred years hence the northwestern wilderness will be dotted with towns and crisscrossed with railways but the big game of it will be gone except in the preserves that are yet to be made this will particularly involve the caribou moose and mountain sheep of all species which will be the first to go the mountain goat and the forest bears will hold out longer than their more exposed neighbors of the treeless mountains the moosein the united states the moose is found in five statesmaine minnesota montana wyoming and idaho there are 550 in the yellowstone park in maine and minnesota only may moose be hunted and killed in the season of 1909 184 moose were killed in mainea large number considering the small moose population of that state in northern minnesota we now possess a great national moose preserve of 909743 acres and in 1908 mr fullerton after a personal inspection in which he saw 189 moose in nine days estimated the total moose population of the present day at 10000 head this is a moose preserve worth while outside of protected areas the moose is the animal that is most easily exterminated its trail is easily followed and its habits are thoroughly known down to three decimal places as a hunters reward it is great strange to say new brunswick has found that the moose is an animal that it is possible and even easy to protect the death of a moose is an event that is not easily concealed wherever it is thoroughly understood that the moose law will be enforced the wouldbe poacher pauses to consider the net results to him of a jail sentence in new brunswick we have seen two strange things happen during our own times we have seen the moose migrate into and permanently occupy an extensive area that previously was destitute of that species at the same time we have seen a reasonable number of bull moose killed by sportsmen without disturbing in the least the general equanimity of the general moose population and at this moment the moose population of new brunswick is almost incredible every moose hunter who goes there sees from 20 to 40 moose and two of my friends last year saw in round numbers about 100 up to date the size of adult antlers seem to be maintaining a high standard in summer the photographing of moose in the rivers lakes and ponds of maine and new brunswick amounts to an industry i am uneasy about the constant picking off of the largest and best breeding bulls of the mirimachi country lest it finally reduce the size and antlers of the moose of that region but only the future can tell us just how that prospect stands today in alaska our ever thoughtful and forehanded biological survey of the department of agriculture has by legal proclamation at one stroke converted the whole of the kenai peninsula into a magnificent moose preserve this will save alces gigas the giant moose of alaska from extermination and new brunswick and the minnesota preserve will save alces americanus but in the northwest we can positively depend upon it that eventually wherever the moose may legally be hunted and killed by any tom dick or harry who can afford a twentydollar rifle and a license the moose surely will disappear the moose laws of alaska are stricttoward sportsmen only the miners prospectors and indians may kill as many as they please for food purposes this opens the door to a great amount of unfair slaughter any coffeecooler can put a pan and pick into his hunting outfit go out after moose and call himself a prospector i grant that the real prospector who is looking for ores and minerals with an intelligent eye and knows what he is doing should have special privileges on game to keep him from starving the settled miner however is in a different class no miner should ask the privilege of living on wild game any more than should the farmer the steamboat man the railway laborer or the soldier in an army post the indian should have no game advantages whatever over a white man he does not own the game of a region any more than he owns its minerals or its waterpower he should obey the general game laws just the same as white men in africa as far as possible the white population wisely prohibits the natives from owning or using firearms and a good idea it is too i am glad there is one continent on which the imjustasgoodasyouare nightmare does not curse the whole land the muskoxnow that the north pole has been safely discovered and the south pole has become the stormcenter of polar exploration the harried muskox herds of the farthest north are having a rest i think that most american sportsmen have learned that as a sporting proposition there is about as much fun and glory in harrying a muskox herd with dogs and picking off the members of it at parade rest as there is in shooting range cattle in a roundup the habits of the animal positively eliminate the real essence of sportdifficulty and danger when a muskox band is chased by dogs or by wolves the fullgrown members of it bulls and cows alike instantly form a close circle around the calves facing outward shoulder to shoulder and stand at bay without the aid of a gunner and a rifle such a formation is invincible mr paul raineys moving pictures tell a wonderful story of animal intelligence bravery and devotion to the parental instinct for some reason the muskox herds do not seem to have perceptibly increased since man first encountered them the number alive today appears to be no greater than it was fifty years ago and this leads to the conclusion that the present delicate balance could easily be disturbed the wrong way fortunately it seems reasonably certain that the indians of the canadian barren grounds the eskimo of the far north and the stray explorers all live outside the haunts of the species and come in touch only with the edge of the muskox population as a whole this leads us to hope and believe that through the difficulties involved in reaching them the main bodies of muskox of both species are safe from extermination at the same time the time has come for canada the united states and denmark to join in formulating a stiff law for the prevention of wholesale slaughter of muskox for sport it should be rendered impossible for another sportsman to kill twentythree head in one day as once occurred give the sportsman a bag of three bulls and no more to this no true sportsman will object and the objections of gamehogs only serve to confirm the justice of the thing they oppose the grizzly bearto many persons it may seem strange that anyone should feel disposed to accord protection to such fierce predatory animals as grizzly bears lions and tigers but the spirit of fair play springs eternal in some human breasts the sportsmen of the world do not stick at using longrange highpower repeating rifles on big game but they draw the line this side of traps poisons and extermination the sportsmen of india once thoughtfor about a year and a daythat it was permissible to kill troublesome and expensive tigers by poison mr gp sanderson tried it and when his strychnine operations promptly developed three bloated and disgusting tiger carcasses even his native followers revolted at the principle that was the alpha and omega of sandersons poisoning activities i am quite sure that if the extermination of the tiger from the whole of india were possible and the tobe or nottobe were put to a vote of the sportsmen of india the answer would be a thundering no says major j stevensonhamilton in his animal life in africa it is impossible to contemplate the use against the lion of any other weapon than the rifle the real sportsmen and naturalists of america are decidedly opposed to the extermination of the grizzly bear they feel that the wilds of north america are wide enough for the accommodation of many grizzlies without crowding the proletariat a rocky mountain without a grizzly upon it or at least a bear of some kind is only half a mountaincommonplace and tame put one twoyearold grizzly cub upon it and presto every cubic yard of its local atmosphere reeks with romantic uncertainty and fearsome thrills a few persons have done considerable talking and writing about the damage to stock inflicted by bears but i think there is little justification for such charges certainly there is not onetenth enough real damage done by bears to justify their extermination at the present time we hear that the farmers of kadiak island alaska are being seriously harassed and damaged by the big kadiak bearan animal so rare and shy that it is very difficult for a sportsman to kill one i think the charges against the bearsif the kadiak islanders ever really have made anyneed to be proven by the production of real evidence in the united states outside of our game preserves i know of not one locality in which grizzly bears are sufficiently numerous to justify a sportsman in going out to hunt them the california grizzly once represented by monarch in golden gate park is almost if not wholly extinct in montana outside of glacier park it is useless to apply for wild grizzlies in the bitter root mountains and clearwater mountains of idaho there are grizzlies but they hide so effectually under the snowbent willows on the slides that it is almost impossible to get a shot northwestern wyoming still contains a few grizzlies but there are so many square miles of mountains around each animal it is now almost useless to go hunting for them british columbia western alberta and the coast mountains at least as far as skaguay and yukon territory generally all contain grizzlies and the sportsman who goes out for sheep caribou and moose is reasonably certain to see half a dozen bears and kill at least one or two in those countries the grizzly species will hold forth long after all killable grizzlies have vanished from the united states i think that it is now time for california montana washington oregon idaho and wyoming to give grizzly bears protection of some sort possibly the situation in those states calls for a fiveyear close season even british columbia should now place a bag limit on this species this has seemed clear to me ever since two of my friends killed in the spring of 1912 six grizzlies in one week but provincial game warden a bryan williams says that at present it would be impossible to impose a bag limit of one per year on the grizzlies of british columbia and mr williams is a sincere gameprotector the brown bears of alaskathese magnificent monsters present a perplexing problem which i am inclined to believe can be satisfactorily solved by the biological survey only in short periods say of three or four years each naturally the skin hunters of alaska ardently desire the skins of those bears for the money they represent that side of the bear problem does not in the least appeal to the ninety odd millions of people who live this side of alaska the skins of the alaskan brown bears have little value save as curiosities nailed upon the wall where they can not be stepped upon and injured the hunting of those bears however is a business for men and it is partly for that reason they should be preserved a bearhunt on the alaska peninsula admiralty or montagu islands is an event of a lifetime and with a bag limit of one brown bear the species would be quite safe from extermination illustration the wichita national bison herd presented by the new york zoological society in alaska there is some dissatisfaction over the protection accorded the big brown bears but those rules are right as far as they go a governor of alaska once said to me the preservation of the game of alaska should be left to the people of alaska it is their game and they will preserve it all right the answer not by a long shot only three things were wrong with the exgovernors view 1the game of alaska does not belong to the people who live in alaskawith the intent to get out tomorrow it belongs to the 93000000 people of the nation 2the preservation of the alaskan fauna on the public domain should not be left unreservedly to the people of alaska because 3as sure as shooting they will not preserve it congress is right in appropriating 15000 for game protection in alaska it is very necessary that the regulations for conserving the wild life should be fixed by the secretary of agriculture with the advice of the biological survey the black bear is an interesting citizen he harms nobody nor anything he affords good sport he objects to being exterminated and wherever in north america he is threatened with extermination he should at once be given protection a black bear in the wilds is harmless in captivity posed as a household pet he is decidedly dangerous and had best be given the middle of the road in big forests he is a grand stayer and will not be exterminated from the fauna of the united states until washington is wrecked by anarchists the american bisoni regard the american bison species as now reasonably secure against extermination this is due to the fact that it breeds persistently and successfully in captivity and to the great efforts that have been put forth by the united states government the canadian government the american bison society the new york zoological society and several private individuals the species reached its lowest ebb in 1889 when there were only 256 head in captivity and 835 running wild the increase has been as follows 1888wt hornadays census 1300 1902sp langleys census 1394 1905frank bakers census 1697 1908wt hornadays

and widely scattered bands the efforts of man to atone for the great bison slaughter by preserving the species from extinction have been crowned with success two governments and two thousand individuals have shared this tasksolely for sentimental reasons in these facts we find reason to hope and believe that other efforts now being made to save other species from annihilation will be equally successful chapter xviii the present and future of african game thanks to the diligence with which sportsmen and field naturalists have recorded their observations in the haunts of big game it is not at all difficult to forecast the immediate future of the big game of the world we may safely assume that all lands well suited to agriculture mining and grazing will become populated by riflebearing men with the usual result to the wild mammals and birds at the same time the game of the open mountains everywhere is thinly distributed and easily exterminated on the other hand the unconquerable forest jungles of certain portions of the tropics will hold their own and shelter their fourfooted inhabitants for centuries to come on the open mountains of the world and on the grazing lands most big game is now being killed much faster than it breeds this is due to the attacks of five times too many hunters open seasons that are too long and bag limits that are far too liberal as an example consider africa viewed in any way it may be taken the bag limit in british east africa is appallingly high notice this astounding array of wild creatures that each hunter may kill under a

sable antelope kudu hunters antelope bongo and sitatunga are already rare and therefore they are all the more eagerly sought into the fine grasslands of british east africa suitable for crops and stock grazing settlers are steadily going each one is armed and at once becomes a killer of big game and all the time the visiting sportsmen are increasing in number going farther from the uganda railway and persistently seeking out the rarest and finest of the game the buffalo has recovered from the slaughter by rinderpest only in time to meet the onset of oversea sportsmen mr arthur jordan has seen much of the big game of british east africa and its killing him i asked to tell me how long in his opinion the big game of that territory will last outside of the game preserves as it is now being killed he said oh it will last a long time i think it will last fifteen years fifteen years and this for the richest biggame fauna of any one spot in the whole world which nature has been several million years in developing and placing there at present the marvelous herds of big game of british east africa and uganda constitute the grandest zoological spectacle that the world ever has seen in historic times for such an area the number of species is incredible and until they are seen the thronging masses of individuals are beyond conception it is easy to say a herd of 3000 zebras but no mere words can give an adequate impression of the actual army of stripes and bars and hoofs thundering in review over a grassy plain but the settlers say the zebras must go they break through our best wire fences ruin our crops despoil us of the fruits of long and toilsome efforts and much expenditure we simply can not live in a country inhabited by herds of wild zebras and really their contention is well founded when it is necessary to choose between wild animals and peaceful agriculture for millions of men the animals must give way in those portions of the great east african plateau region that are suited to modern agriculture stretching from buluwayo to northern uganda the wild herds are doomed to be crowded out by the farmer and the fruitgrower this is the inevitable result of civilization and progress in wild lands marauding battalions of zebras bellicose rhinoceroses and murderous buffaloes do not fit in with ranches and crops and children going to school except in the great game preserves the swamps and the dense jungles it is certain that the big game of the whole of eastern africa is foredoomed to disappearthe largest and most valuable species first five hundred years from now when north america is worn out and wasted to a skeleton of what it now is the great plateau region of east africa between cape town and lake rudolph will be a mighty empire teeming with white population giraffes and rhinoceroses now are trampling over the sites of the cities and universities of the future then the herds of grand game that now make africa a sportsmans wonderland will exist only in closed territory in books and in memory illustration map showing the disappearance of the lion incidentally it is also an index of the disappearance of african big game generally from an article in the review of reviews for august 1912 by cyrus c adams and based largely upon the exhaustive studies of dr cm engel of copenhagen from what has befallen in south africa we can easily and correctly forecast the future of the big game of british east africa and uganda less than fifty years ago cape colony natal zululand and every country up to the zambesi was teeming with herds of big wild animals just as the northern provinces now are as late as 1890 when rhodesia was taken over by the chartered company and the capital city of salisbury was staked out an american boy in the pioneer corps now honorable william harvey brown of salisbury wrote thus of the gwibi flats near salisbury that evening i beheld on those flats a sight which probably will never again be seen there to the end of the world the variety deploying before me was almost incredible there within the range of my vision were groups of roan sable and tsessebi antelopes burchell zebras now totally extinct elands reedbucks steinbucks and ostriches it was like africa in the days of livingstone as i sat on my horse viewing with amazement this wonderful panorama of wild life i was startled by a herd that came galloping around a small hill just behind meon the south african frontier p 114 that was in 1890 and how is it today salisbury is a modern city endorsed by two lines of railway the gwibi flats are farms there is some big game yet in rhodesia south of the zambesi but to find it you must go at least a weeks journey from the capital to the remote corners that have not yet been converted into farms or mining settlements north of the zambesi rhodesia yet contains plenty of big game the victoria falls station is a popular starting point for hunting expeditions headed northeast and northwest in the northwest the game is yet quite in a state of nature unfortunately the barotse natives of that region can procure from the portuguese traders all the firearms and ammunition that they can pay for and by treaty they retain their hunting rights the final result will beextermination of the game elsewhere throughout rhodesia the natives are not permitted to have guns and gunpowdera very wise regulation in alaska our indians are privileged to kill game all the year round and they have modern firearms with which to do it and how is it with the game of that day the true burchells zebra is now regarded as extinct in cape colony and natal that once teemed with big game in the oldfashioned african way they are counting the individual wild animals that remain also they are making game preserves literally everywhere now that the best remaining game districts of africa are rapidly coming under british control it is a satisfaction to observe that the governing bodies and executive officers are alive to the necessity of preserving the big game from actual extinction excepting german east africa from uganda to cape colony the game preserves form an almost continuous chain it is quite impossible to enumerate all of them but the two in british east africa are of enormous size and are well stocked with game south africa contains a great many smaller preserves and a few specimen herds of big game but that is about all except in a few localities the hunting of big game in that region is done forever the western districts game and trout protective association of south africa recently 1911 has made careful counts and estimates of the number of individual game animals remaining in cape colony with the following result big game in the cape province from information kindly placed at the disposal of the association by the government it was found that the following varieties of big game are still found in the province the numbers however are only approximate blesbok about 400 in steynsburg and 35 in queens town divisions bontebok about 30 in bredasdorp and 45 in swellendam divisions buffalo about 340 in uitenhage 120 in alexandria and 75 in bathurst divisions elephants about 130 in alexandria 160 in uitenhage 40 in bathurst and 20 in knysna divisions gemsbok about 2450 in namaqualand 4500 in vryburg 4000 in gordonia and 670 in the kenhardt mafeking and barkly west divisions koodoo about 10000 found chiefly in the divisions of albany barkly west fort beaufort hay herbert jansenville kuruman ladismith mafeking mossel bay oudtshoorn riversdale steytlerville uitenhage victoria east and vryburg oribi about 120 in the divisions of albany and alexandria rietbok about 170 in the komgha division zebra about 560 most of which are to be found in the divisions of cradock george and oudtshoorn a few are to be found in the divisions of uniondale and uitenhage springbok being migratory it is difficult to estimate their number in some years they are compelled by drought to invade the province in large numbers they are then seen as far south as calvinia and fraserburg large numbers are however fenced in on private estates in various parts of the province klipspringers about 11200 in the following divisions viz namaqualand 6559 kuruman 2100 steytlerville 1530 oudtshoorn 275 hay 250 ladismith 220 graaffreinet 119 kenhardt 66 and cradock 56 hartebeest about 9700 principally in the divisions of vryburg gordonia kuruman mafeking kimberley hay and beaufort west wildebeest about 3450 in vryburg 80 each in gordonia and kuruman 65 in mafeking 20 in queens town and a few in the bredasdorp divisions eland about 12 in the graaffreinet division privately bred the above showing of the pitifully small numbers of the specimens that constitute the remnant of the biggame of the cape suggest just one thinga universal close season throughout cape colony and no hunting whatever for ten years and yet what do we see the report from which the above census was taken contains half a column of solid matter in small type giving a list of the open seasons all over cape colony during which killing may be done so it seems that the spirit of slaughter is the same in africa that it is in americakill as long as there is anything alive to kill this list is of startling interest because it shows how closely the small remnants of big game are now marked down in south africa in view of the success with which englishmen protect their game when once they have made up their minds to do so it is fair to expect that the herds now under protection as listed above will save their respective species from extinction it is alarming however to note the wide territory covered by the deadly open seasons and to wonder when the bars really will be put up today mashonaland is a verymuchsettled colony the cape to cairo railway and trains de luxe long ago attained the palls of the zambesi and now the curator of the salisbury museum will have to search diligently in far off nyassaland and beyond the zambesi river to find enough specimens to fill his cases with representatives of the vanished rhodesian fauna once 1892 the white rhinoceros was found in northern rhodesia but never again in salisbury elands and zebras are nearly as great a curiosity as they are in st louis but for the discovery of white rhinoceroses in the lado district on the western bank of the nile below gondokoro we would now be saying that rhinoceros simus is within about ten specimens of total extinction from south africa as far up as salisbury in central rhodesia at least 99 per cent of the big game has disappeared before the white mans rifle let him who doubts this scan the census of wild animals still living in cape colony from all the other regions of africa that are easily accessible to gunners the animal life is vigorously being shot out and no man in his senses will now say that the big game is breeding faster than it is being killed the reverse is painfully true mr carl akeley in his quest for a really large male elephant for the american museum found and looked over a thousand males without finding one that was really fine and typical all the photographs of elephant herds that were taken by kermit roosevelt and akeley show a striking absence of adult males and of females with long tusks there are only young males and young females with small short tusks the answer isthe white ivory hunters have killed nearly all the elephants bearing good ivory the slaughter of big game is going on furiously in british east africa because the uganda railway opens up the entire territory to hunters anyone man or woman who can raise 5000 in cash can go there and make a huge bag of big game with a license costing only 250 he can kill enough big game to sink a ship the bag limit in british east africa is ruinously extravagant if the government desires the extermination of the game such a bag limit surely will promote that end it is awful to think that for a petty sum any man may buy the right to kill 300 head of hoofed and horned animals of 44 species not counting the carnivorous animals that also may be killed that bag limit should immediately be reduced 75 per cent as matters stand today in british east africa the big game of the country outside the three preserves is absolutely certain to disappear in about onefourth of the time that it took south africa to accomplish the same result the reasons are obvioussuperior accessibility more deadly rifles expert professional guides and a widespread craze for killing big game with care and economy british east africa should furnish good hunting for two centuries but as things are going on today twenty years will see a tremendous change for the worse and a disappearance of game that will literally astonish the natives german east africa and uganda will not exterminate their quotas of big game quite so soon the absence of railways is a great factor in gameexistence the congo free state contains game and sporting possibilitieson the unexplored uplands between the riversthat are as yet totally unknown to sportsmen at large we are accustomed to thinking of the whole basin of the congo as a vast gloomy and impenetrable forest there is today in africa a vast reserve supply of grand game it inhabits regions that are either unknown or most difficult to penetrate as a species in point consider the okapi only the boldest and most persistent explorers ever have set foot in its tangled and miasmatic haunts it may be twenty years before a living specimen can be brought out the gorilla and the chimpanzee are so well protected by the density of their jungles that they never can be exterminateduntil the natives are permitted to have all the firearms that they desire when that day arrives it is goodnight to all the wild life that is large enough to eat or to wear the quagga and the blaubok became extinct before the world learned that their existence was threatened the giant eland the sable antelope the greater kudu the bontebok blessbok the mountain and burchell zebras all the giraffes save that of nigeria the big waterbucks the nyala the sitatunga the bongo and the gerenukall will go in the same way everywhere outside the game preserves the buffalo zebra and rhinoceros are especially marked for destruction as annoyances to colonists you who read of the killing of these species today will read of their total disappearance tomorrow so long as the hunting of them is permitted their ultimate disappearance is fixed and certain it is not the way of rifleshooting english colonists to permit herds of big game to run about merely to be looked at naturally the open plains of africa and the thin forests of the plateau regions will be the first to lose their big game in the gloomy fastnesses of the great equatorial forests and other really dense forests wherever found the elephants the derby eland the bongo the okapi the buffaloes of three species the bushpigs the bushbucks and the forestloving antelopes generally will live for possibly one hundred yearsor until the natives secure plenty of modern firearms and ammunition whenever and wherever savages become supplied with rifles then it is time to measure each biggame animal for its coffin the elephants of the great equatorial forest westward of the lake region will survive long after the last eastern elephant has bitten the dust the pygmy elephant of the lower congo region elephas pumilio will be the last african elephant species to disappearbecause it inhabits dense miasmatic jungles its tusks are of the smallest size and it has the least commercial value chapter xix the present and future of the game of asia after a successful survival of mans influence through two thousand years at last the big game of india has made a good start on the road to vanishment up to 1870 it had held its own with a tenacity that was astonishing in 1877 i found the gangesjumna dooab the animallai hills the wynaad forest and ceylon literally teeming with herds of game the animallais in particular were a hunters paradise in each day of hunting large game of some kind was a certainty the nilgiri hills had been quite well shot out but in view of the very small area and open golflinks character of the whole top of that wonderful sky plateau that was no cause for wonderment in those days no native shikaree owned and operated a gunor at the most very very few of them did if a rogue elephant a maneating tiger or a nasty leopard became a public nuisance it was a case for a sahib to come and doctor it with a 577 doublebarreled express rifle worth 150 or more and the sahibs had shooting galore i think that no such great wildlife sights as those of the plateau regions of africa ever were seen in southern asia conditions there are different and usually the game is widely scattered the sambar deer and muntjac of the dense forests the axis of the bamboo glades the thameng deer of the burmese jungles the sladang or gaur of the awful malay tangle and the big cats and canines will last long and well the ibexes markhors tahr and all the wild sheep eventually will be shot out by sportsmen who are sheep crazy the sheep and goats of asia will disappear soon after the plains animals of africa because no big game that lives in the open can much longer endure the modern inexpensive longrange rifles of deadly accuracy and limitless repetition of fire eventually i fear that by some unlucky turn of fortunes wheel all the native hunters of asia will obtain rifles and when they do we soon will see the end of the big game even today we find that the primitive conditions of 1877 have been greatly changed in the first place about every native shikaree hunter owns a rifle at a cost of about 25 and many other natives possess guns and assume to hunt with them the logical conclusion of this is more hunting and less game the development of the country has reduced the cover for game new roads and railways have made the game districts easily accessible and real sportsmen are now three or four times as numerous as they were in 1877 at toonacadavoo in the animallai hills where thirtyfive years ago there modestly nestled on the ridge beside the river only forest ranger theobolds bungalow built of mud and covered with grass thatch and bamboo rats there is now a regular hill station lighted by electricity a modern sanatorium high up on the bluff a club golf links and other modern improvements in my day there were exactly four guns on the animallais now there are probably one hundred and it is easy to guess how much big game remains on the delectable mountains in comparison with the golden days of 1877 i should say that there is now only one game animal for every twentyfive that were there in my day i am told that it is like that all over india beyond question the gunsellers and gunusers have been busy there as everywhere else the game of india is on the toboggan slide and the old days of abundance have gone forever the first fact that strikes us in the face is the impending fate of the great indian rhinoceros an animal as wonderful as the titanothere or the megatherium it is like a gift handed down to us straight out of the pleistocene age a million years back the british paleontologists today marvel at elephas ganesa and by great labor dig his bones out of the sewalik rocks but what one of them all has yet made a move to save rhinoceros indicus from the quick extermination that soon will be his portion unless he is accorded perpetual and real protection from the assaults of man let the mammalogists of the world face this fact the available cover of the indian rhinoceros is alarmingly decreasing throughout assam and bengal where the behemoth of the jungle has a right to live it is believed that the few remaining rhinos are being shot much faster then they are breeding and what will be the effect of this upon an animal that requires fourteen years to reach full maturity today the most wonderful hoofed mammal of all asia is booked for extermination and unless very radical measures for its preservation are at once carried into effect it is probable that twenty years more will see the last indian rhino go down to rise no more one remedy would be a good ample rhinoceros preserve and another the most absolute and permanent protection for the species all along the line halfway measures will not suffice it is time to ring in a general alarm during the past eighteen years only three specimens of that species have come out of india for the zoological gardens and parks of the world and i think there are only five in captivity all told we are told that in india now the natives are permitted to have about all the firearms they can pay for naturally in a country containing over 300000000 people this is a deadly thing of course there are shooting regulations many of them but their enforcement is so imperfect that it is said that the natives are attacking the big game on all sides with deadly effect i fear it is utterly impossible for the indian government to put enough wardens into the field to watch the doings of the grand army of native poachers fortunately the indian nativeunlike the western frontiersmandoes not contend that he owns the big game or that all men are born free and equal at the same time he means to have his full share of it to eat and to sell in various forms for cash even in india the saleofgame dragon has reared its head and is today in need of being scotched with an iron hand when i received direct from a friend in the native state of kashmir a long printed circular setting forth the hunting laws and gameprotective measures of that very interesting principality it gave me a shock it was disquieting to be thus assured that the big game of kashmir has disappeared to such an extent that strong protective measures are necessary it was as if the chief eskimo of etah had issued a strong proclamation for the saving of the muskox in kashmir the destruction of game has become so serious that a game preservation department has been created with the official staff that such an organization requires the game laws are printed annually and any variations from them may be made only by the authority of the maharajah himself up to date eight game preserves have been created having a total area of about thee hundred square miles in addition to these there are twelve small preserves each having an area of from twentyfive to fifty square miles by their locations these seem to provide for all the species of big game that are found in kashmirthe ibex two forms of markhor the tahr himalayan bighorn sheep burrhel and goral in our country we have several states that are very large very diversified in surface and still inhabited by large game has any one of those states created a series of game preserves even half way comparable with those of kashmir i think not montana has made a beginning with two preservessnow creek and the pryor mountainsbut beside the splendid series of kashmir they are not worthy of serious mention and then following closely in the wake of that document came a lengthy article in the proceedings of the zoological society of london by ec stebbing in which a correspondent of the indian field clearly sets forth the fact that the big game of the himalayas now is menaced by a peril new to our consideration but of a most deadly character hear him in this inventory of game destroyers in india the gurkha soldier does not find a place for he belongs to a class which he amply fills by himself with his small but very important personality he deserves separate notice from the banks of the sarda on the frontier of nepal to the banks of the indus the battalions of these gallant little men are scattered in cantonments all along the outer spurs of the himalayan range in seven or eight of these locations there are at least 14000 of these disciplined warriors who in the absence of opportunities for spilling human blood legitimately are given a free hand for slaughtering wild animals along fivehundred miles of the best hunting grounds of upper india now since those facts must be true as reported do they not in themselves constitute a severe arraignment of the indian government why should that state of game slaughter endure when a single executive order to the co of each post would effectually stop it in the making of game preserves or sanctuaries as they are called out there the government of india has shown rare and commendable diligence the total number is too great for enumeration here the native state of mysore has seven and the nilgiri hills have sanctuaries aggregating about 100000 acres in area in the wynaad forest my old huntinggrounds at mudumallay have been closed to bison shooting because of the alarming decrease of bison gaur through shooting and disease the kundah forest reserve has been made a partial game preserve but the door might as well have been left wide open as so widely ajar in eastern bengal and assam several game preserves have been created on the whole by the diligence and thoroughness with which sanctuaries as they are termed have been created quite generally throughout india it is quite evident that the government and the sportsmen of india have become thoroughly alarmed by the great decrease of the game and the danger of the extermination of species in the past india has been the finest and beststocked huntingground of all asia quite beyond compare and the destruction of her oncesplendid fauna of big game would be a zoological calamity tibetas yet tibet offers free hunting without legal let or hindrance to every sportsman who can climb up to her lofty windswept and whizzingcold plateau the man who hunts the ovis poli superb creature though it be pays in full for his trophies the ibex of the south help out the compensatory damages but even with that the list of species available in southern tibet is painfully small the mitchell takin can be reached from china via chungking after a long hard journey over consul mason mitchells trail but the takin is about the only large hoofed game available the altai mountains of western china contain the magnificent siberian argali the grandfather of all sheep species whose horns must be seen to be believed through a quest for that species the russian military authorities played upon mr george l harrison and his comrade a very grim and unsportsmanlike joke at the frontier military post on the russochinese border the two americans were courteously halted hospitably entertained and prevented from going into the argaliinfested mountains that loomed up before them only a few miles away the russian officers said sheep why if you really want sheep we will send out some of our brave soldiers to shoot some for you but there is no need for you to take the trouble to go after them after mr harrison and his comrade had spent 5000 and traveled half way around the world for those sheep that is in brief the story of how the cup of tantalus was given them by the russians actually at their goal as spoilsports those russian officers were the champions of the world seven hundred miles southeastward of the altai mountains of western china guarded by the dangerous hostility of savage native tribes there exists and awaits the scientific explorer according to report an undiscovered wild horse the bicolored wild horse is black and white and joy awaits the zoologist or sportsman who sees it first evidently it will not soon be exterminated by modern rifles the impenetrable forestsalthough the mountains of central asia will in time be cleared of their big gamewhen by hook and by crook the natives secure plenty of modern firearmsthere are places in the far east that we know will contain big game forever and a day take the malay peninsula borneo and sumatra as examples mr c william beebe who recently has visited the far east has described how the state of selangor between malacca and penang has taken on many airs of improvement since 1878 and sections of sarawak territory are being cut down and burned for the growing of rubber despite this i am trying to think that those developments menace the total volume of the wild life of those regions but little i wonder if those tangled illimitable everrenewing jungles yet know that their faces have been scratched white men never will exterminate the big game of the really dense jungles of the eastern tropics but with enough axes snares guns and cartridges the natives may be able to accomplish it in malayana there are some jungles so dense so tangled with lianas and so thorny with livistonias and rattan that nothing larger than a cat can make way through them there are thousands of square miles so boggy so swampy so dark gloomy and mosquitoridden that all men fear them and avoid them and in them rubber culture must be impossible in those silent places the gaur the rhino the malay sambar the clouded leopard and the orangutan surely are measurably safe from the gamebags and market gunners of the shooting world it is good to think that there is an equatorial belt of jungle clear around the world in central and south america as well as in the old world in which there will be little extermination in our day except of birds for the feather market but the open plains open mountains and open forests of asia and australasia are in different case eventually they will be shot out china all save yunnan and western mongolia is now horribly barren of wild life can it ever be brought back we think it can not the millions of population are too many and except in the great forest tracts the spread of modern firearms will make an end of the game already the pheasants are being swept out of china for the london market and extinction is staring several species in the face on the whole the pheasants of the old world are being hit hard by the rubberplanting craze mr beebe declares that owing to the inrush of aggressive capital the haunts of many species of pheasants are being denuded of all their natural cover and some mountain species that are limited to small areas are practically certain to be exterminated at an early date destruction of animals for furin the far north only the interior of kamchatka seems to be safe from the iron heel of the skinhunter a glance at the list of furs sold in london last year reveals one or two things that are disquieting the total catch of furs for the year 1911 is enormousconsidering the great scarcity of wild life on two continents incidentally it must be remembered that every trapper carries a gun and in studying the fur list one needs no help in trying to imagine the havoc wrought with firearms on the edible wild life of the regions that contributed all that fur i have been told by trappers that as a class trappers are great killers of game in order that the reader may know by means of definite figures the extent to which the world is being raked and combed for furbearing animals we append below a statement copied from the fur news magazine for november 1912 of the sales of the largest london fur house during the past two years with varying

valuable chapter were made by mr beebe in 1911 while conducting an expedition in southern asia borneo and java for the purpose of studying in life and nature all the members of the pheasant family inhabiting that region the results of these studies and collections will shortly appear in a very complete monograph of the phasianidaewth in chapter xiii treating of the extermination of birds for womens hats dr hornaday has dealt fully with the feather and plumage traffic after it enters the brokers hands and has proved conclusively that the plumes of egrets are gathered from the freshly killed birds we may trace the course of the plumes and feathers backward through the tightlypacked bales and boxes in the holds of the vessels to the ports of the savage lands whence they were shipped then to the skilful dark hands of mexican peon venezuelan indian african negro or asiatic chinaman or malay who stripped the skin from the flesh and finally to the jungle or mountain side or terai where the bird gave up its life to blowpipe crossbow blunderbuss or carefully set snare in various trips to mexico venezuela and other countries in the tropics of the new world i have seen many such scenes but not until i had completed a seventeen months expedition in search of pheasants through some twenty wild countries of asia and the east indies did i realize the havoc which is being wrought week by week everywhere on the globe while we were absent even these few months from the great centers of civilization tremendous advances had been made in airships and the thousand and one other modern phases of human development but evolution in the world of nature as we observed it was only destructivea worldwide katabolisma retrogression often discernible from month to month we could scarcely repeat the trip and make the same observations upon pheasants so rapidly is this group of birds approaching extinction the causes of this destruction of wild life are many and diverse and resemble one another only in that they all emanate from mankind to the casual traveller the shooting and trapping of birds for millinery purposes at first seems to hold an insignificant place among the causes but this is only because in many of the larger ports the protective laws are more or less operative and the occupation of the plume hunter is carried on in secret ways but it is as farreaching and insidious as any and when we add to the actual number of birds slain the compound interest of eggs grown cold of young birds perishing slowly from hunger of the thousands upon thousands of birds which fall wounded or dead among the thick tropical jungle foliage and are lost the total is one of ghastly proportions not to weaken my argument with too many general statements let me take at once some concrete cases first that of the himalayan pheasants and gamebirds in a recent interesting article by ep stebbingh the past present and hopedfor future of game birds and animals in india is reviewed unfortunately however most of the finest creatures in asia live beyond the border of the british sphere of influence and though within sight are absolutely beyond reach of civilized law the heart of the himalayasthe haunts of some of the most beautiful birds in the world the tragopans the blood and impeyan pheasantslies within the limits of nepal a little country which time and time again has bade defiance to british attacks and still maintains its independence from its northern border mt everest looks down from its most exalted of all earthly summits and sees valley after valley depleted of first one bird and then another i have seen and lived with nepalese shepherds who have nothing to do month after month but watch their flocks in the lofty solitudes time hangs heavy on their hands and with true oriental patience they weave loop after loop of yakhair snares and then set them not in dozens or scores but in hundreds and thousands up and down the valleys footnote h game sanctuaries and game protection in india proc zool soc london 1912 pp 2335 in one locality seven great valleys had been completely cleared of pheasants only a single pair of tragopans remaining and from one of these little brown men i took two hundred nooses which had been prepared for these lone survivors in these cases the birds were either cooked and eaten at once or sold to some passing shepherd or lama for a few annas but in other parts of this unknown land systematic collecting of skins goes on for bale after bale of impeyan and red argus tragopan pheasant skins goes down to the calcutta wharves where its infamous contents though known are safe from seizure under the nepal rajas seal thus it is that the london feather sales still list these among the most splendid of all living birds and shame upon shame when we read of 80 impeyan skins dull or slightly defective we know that these are female birds then if ever we realize that the time of the bird and the beast is passing the acme of evolution for these wonderful beings is reached and at most we can preserve only a small fragment of them to the millinery hunter what the egret is to america and the bird of paradise to new guinea the impeyan pheasant is to indiathe most coveted of all plumages there is a great tendency to blame the native hunter for the decrease of this and other pheasants and from what i have personally seen in many parts of the himalayas there is no question that the garwhalese and nepalese hillmen have wrought havoc among the birds but these men are by no means the sole cause as long ago as 1879 we read that the great demand for the brilliant skins of the moonal that has existed for many years has led to their almost total extermination in some parts of the hills as the native shikaris shoot and snare for the pot as well as for skins and kill as many females as males on the other hand though for nearly thirty years my friend mr wilson has yearly sent home from 1000 to 1500 skins of this species and the tragopan there are still in the woods whence they were obtained as many as if not more than when he first entered them simply because he has rigidly preserved females and nests and as amongst english pheasants one cock suffices for several hens illustration pheasant snares made of yak hair taken from a shepherd in nepal by mr beebe ignoring the uncertainty of the last statement it is rather absurd to think of a single man preserving females and nests in the himalayas from 1850 to 1880 when the british government despite most efficient laws and worthy efforts is unable to protect the birds of these wild regions today the statement that after thirty to fortyfive thousand cock impeyans were shot or snared as many or more than the original quota remained could only emanate from the mind of a professional featherhunter and hume should not be blamed for more than the mere repetition of such figures let it be said to the credit of wilson the slaughterer of something near fortyfive thousand impeyans that he was a careful observer of the birds habits and has given us an excellent account somewhat coloured by natives but on the whole the best we have had in the past but it is not pleasant to read of his waiting until twenty or thirty have got up and alighted in the surrounding trees and have then walked up to the different trees and fired at those i wished to procure without alarming the rest only those very close to the one fired at being disturbed at each report humes opinion that in 1879 there were scores of places where one might secure from ten to eighteen birds in a day is certainly not true today indeed as early as 1858 we read that this splendid bird once so abundant on the western himalayas is now far from being so in consequence of the numbers killed by sportsmen on account of its beauty whole tracts of mountain forest once frequented by the moonal are now almost without a single specimen the same author goes on naively to tell the reader that among the most pleasant reminiscences of bygone days is a period of eleven days spent by the author and a friend on the choor mountain near simia when among other trophies were numbered sixtyeight moonal pheasants etc illustration silver pheasant skins seized at rangoon british burma about 600 skins out of several thousand confiscated in the custom house on their way to the london feather market photographed by mr beebe for some unaccountable reason there is or was for many years a very prevalent idea that the enormous number of skins which have poured into the london market were from birds bred in the vicinity of calcutta when we remember the intense heat of that lowlying city and learn from the records of the calcutta zoological garden that impeyans and tragopans are even shorterlived than in europe the absurdity of the idea is apparent in spite of numberless inquiries throughout india i failed to learn of a single captive young bird ever hatched and reared even in the high cool hillstations the commercial value of an impeyan skin has varied from five dollars to twenty dollars according to the number received annually in 1876 an estimate placed the monthly average of impeyans received in london at from two to eight hundred in such a case as nepal direct protective laws are of no avail all humane arguments are useless but if the markets at the other end can be closed the slaughter will cease instantly and automatically illustration deadfall traps in burma a long series set across a valley by the kachins of the burmachinese border a wholesale method of wildlife slaughter photographed by c william beebe 1910 as a contrast to the millinery hunter of fifty years ago it is refreshing to find that at last sincere efforts are being made in british possessions to stop this traffic i happened to be at rangoon when six large bales of pheasant skins were seized by the custom officials a chinaman had brought them from yunnan via bhamo and was preparing to ship them as ducks feathers two of the bales were opened for my inspection the first contained about five hundred lady amherst pheasant skins falling to pieces and lacking heads and legs the second held over four hundred silver pheasants in almost perfect condition the chief collector had put the absolutely prohibitive fine of 200 pounds on them and was waiting for the expiration of the legal number of days before burning the entire lot they must have represented years of work in decimating the pheasant fauna of western china far up in the wilderness of northern burma and over the yunnan border we often came upon some of the most ingenious examples of native trapping a system which we found repeated in the malay states borneo china and other parts of the far east a low bamboo fence is built directly across a steep valley or series of valleys about half way from the summit to the lower end and about every fifteen feet a narrow opening is left over which a heavy log is suspended any creature attempting to make its way through treads upon several small sticks and by so doing springs the trap and the deadfall claims a victim when a country is systematically strung with traps such as these sooner or later all but a pitiful remnant of the smaller mammals birds and reptiles are certain to be wiped out morning after morning i have visited such a runway and found dead along its path what must have been all the walking running or crawling creatures which the night before had sought the water at the bottom pheasants cobras mousedeer rodents civets and members of many other groups in some countries nooses instead of deadfalls guard the openings but the result is equally deadly i have described this method of trapping because of its future importance in the destruction of wild life in the far east the chinaman in all his many millions is undergoing a remarkably swift and radical evolution both of character and dress in many ways if only from the viewpoint of the patient thrifty storekeeper he is a most powerful factor in the east and is becoming more so in many cases he imitates the white nations by cutting off his queue and altering his dress in some mysterious correlated way his diet seems simultaneously affected and while for untold generations rice and fish has satisfied all his gastronomic desires a new craving that for meat has come to him the result is apparent in many parts of the east the chinaman is willing and able to pay for meat and the native finds a new market for the creatures about him again and again when i wished a few specimens of some certain pheasant i had but to hail passing canoes and bid a few annas or cash or ringits higher than the prospective chinese purchaser would give and the pheasants were mine in the catalogues of the brokers sales of feathers we read of many thousands of the wonderful ocellated wing feathers of the argus pheasant but no less horrible is the sight of a canoe crammed with the bedraggled bodies of these magnificent birds on their way to some chinese hamlet where they will be sold for a pittance the flesh eaten to the last tendon and the feathers given to the children and puppies to play with the newlyaroused appetite of the mongolian will soon be an important factor in the extermination of animals and birds few species being exempt for the chinaman lives up to his reputation and is not squeamish as to the nature of his meat before we leave the subject of chinamen let us consider another recent factor in the destruction of wild life which is at present widely operative in china itself this is the cold storage warehouse of which six or eight enormous ones have gone up in different parts of the east to speak in detail only of the one at hankow six hundred miles up the yangtze we found it to be the largest structure in the city surrounded by a high wall with each entrance and exit guarded by armed sikhs it seemed like the feudal castle of some medieval baron why such secrecy is necessary i could not learn as there are no laws against its business but so carefully guarded is its premises that until a short time ago even the british consulgeneral of hankow had not been allowed to enter he however at last refused to sign the papers for any more outgoing shipments until he should be allowed to see what was going on within the warehouse i hoped to be able to look over some of the frozen pheasants for interesting scientific material but of course was not allowed to do so although here in the heart of china outside changes are not felt so strongly and the newlyacquired meat diet of the border and emigrant chinese is hardly apparent these warehouses have opened up a new source of revenue which has met with instant response thousands and tens of thousands of wild shot or trapped pheasants and other birds are now brought to these establishments by the natives from far and near the birds are frozen and twice a year shipped on specially refrigerated p and o steamships to england and the continent of europe where they seem to find a ready sale pigs and chickens also figure in the shipments now the pheasants have for centuries existed in enormous numbers in the endless ricefields of china without doing any damage to the crops in fact they could not be present in such numbers without being an important factor in keeping down insect and other enemies of the grain when their numbers are decimated as they are being at present there must eventually result a serious upsetting of the balance of nature let us hope that in some way this may be avoided and that the present famine deaths of thirty thousand or more in some provinces will not be increased many fold when i started on this search for pheasants i was repeatedly told by old explorers in the east that my task would be very different from theirs of thirty years ago that i would find steamers railroads and automobiles where formerly were only canoes and jungle i indeed found this as reported but while my task was different it was made no easier formerly to be sure one had from the start to paddle slowly or push along the trails made by natives or game animals but then the wild life was encountered at once while i found it always far from the end of the steamers route or the railroads terminal and still to be reached only by the most primitive modes of travel i cite this to give point to my next great cause of destruction the burning and clearing of vast stretches of country for the planting of rubber trees the east seems rubber mad and whether the enormous output which will result from the millions of trees set out month after month will be profitable i cannot say i can think only of the vanishing of the entire fauna and flora of many districts which i have seen as a direct result of this commercial activity one leaves port swettenham on the west coast of selangor and for the hours run to kuala lumpur sees hardly anything but vast radiating lines of spindling rubber trees all underbrush cleared all native growths vanished from kuala lumpur to kuala kubu at the very foot of the mountain backbone of the malay peninsula the same holds true and where some area appears not under cultivation the climbing fern and a coarse useless lalang grass covers every inch of ground one can hardly imagine a more complete blotting out of the native fauna and flora of any one limited region and everextending roads for the increasing motor cars are widening the cleared zone mile after mile to the north and south in this region as we pushed on over the mountains into the wilderness of pahang we saw little of the actual destruction of the primeval native growth but elsewhere it became a common sight once for many days we studied the wonderful life of a jungle which stretched up to our very camp troops of rollicking wawas or gibbons frequented the forest squirrels tupaias birds and insects in myriads were everywhere during the day great fruitbats flying lemurs owls and other nocturnal creatures made the evenings and nights full of interest and then one day without warning came the sound of an ax and another and another from that moment the songs cries chirps and roars of the jungle were seldom heard from our camp every day saw new phalanxes of splendid primeval trees fallen or half suspended in their rigging of lianas the leaves withered the flower petals fell and we heard no more the crackling of bamboos in the wind then the pitiful survivors of the destruction were brought to us now a baby flying lemur flung from its hole by the falling of some tree young tupaias nestling birds a few out of the thousands of creatures from insects to mammals which were slain so that a chinaman or malay might eke a few dollars four or five years hence from a grove of rubber trees i do not say it is wrong man has won out and might is right as since the dawn of creation but to the onlooker to the lover of nature and the animal world it is a terrible a hopeless thing one cannot at present leave the tourist line of travel in the east without at once encountering evidence of the wholesale direct slaughter of wild life or its no less certain extermination by the elimination of the haunts and the food plants of the various beasts and birds chapter xxi the savage viewpoint of the gunner the mental attitude of the men who shoot constitutes a deadly factor in the destruction of wild life and the extermination of species fully ninetyfive per cent of the sportsmen gunners and other men and boys who kill game all over the world and in all nations regard game birds and mammals only as things to be killed and eaten and not as creatures worth preserving for their beauty or their interest to mankind this is precisely the viewpoint of the caveman and the savage and it has come down from the manwithaclub to the manwithagun absolutely unchanged save for one thing the latter sometimes is prompted to save today in order to slaughter tomorrow the above statement of an existing fact may seem harsh and some persons may be startled by it but it is based on an acquaintance with thousands of men who shoot all kinds of game all over the world my critics surely will admit that my opportunities to meet the sportsmen and gunners of the world are and for thirtyfive years have been rather favorable as a matter of fact i think the efforts of the hunters of my personal acquaintance have covered about seventenths of the hunting grounds of the world if the estimate that i have formed of the average hunters viewpoint is wrong or even partially so i will be glad to have it proven in order that i may reform my judgment and apologize in working with large bodies of birdshooting sportsmen i have steadilyand also painfullybeen impressed by their intentness on killing and by the fact that they seek to preserve game only to kill it who ever saw a birdshooter rise in a convention and advocate the preservation of any species of game bird on account of its beauty or its esthetic interest alive i never did and i have sat in many conventions of sportsmen all the talk is of open seasons bag limits and killing rights the man who has the hardihood to stand up and propose a fiveyear close season has a hard row to hoe men rise and say its all nonsense theres plenty of quail shooting on long island yet throughout the length and breadth of america the ruling passion is to kill as long as anything killable remains the man who will openly advocate the stopping of quailshooting because the quails are of such great value to the farmers or because they are so beautiful and companionable to man receives no sympathy from ninety per cent of the birdkilling sportsmen the remaining ten per cent think seriously about the matter and favor long close seasons it is my impression that of the men who shoot it is only among the biggame hunters that we find much genuine admiration for game animals or any feeling remotely resembling regard for it the moment that a majority of american gunners concede the fact that game birds are worth preserving for their beauty and their value as living neighbors to man from that moment there is hope for the saving of the remnant that will indeed be the beginning of a new era of a millennium in fact in the preservation of wild life it will then be easy to enact laws for tenyear close seasons on whole groups of species think what it would mean for such a close season to be enacted for all the grouse of the united states all the shorebirds of the united states or the wild turkey wherever found today the greatindeed the onlyopponents of long close seasons on game birds are the gunners whenever and wherever you introduce a bill to provide such a season you will find that this is true the gun clubs and the downtrodden hunters and anglers protective associations will be quick to go after their representatives and oppose the bill and state senators and assemblymen will think very hard and with strong courage before they deliberately resolve to do their duty regardless of the opposition of a large body of sportsmenmen who have votes and who know how to take revenge on lawmakers who deprive them of their right to kill the greatest speech ever made in the mexican congress was uttered by the member who solemnly said i rise to sacrifice ambition to honor unfortunately the men who shoot have become possessed of the idea that they have certain inherent godgiven rights to kill game now as a matter of fact a sportsman with a onehundreddollar fox gun in his hands a twohundreddollar dog at his heels and five onehundreddollar bills in his pocket has no more right to kill a covey of quail on long island than my milkman has to elect that it shall be let alone for the pleasure of his children the time has come when the people who dont shoot must do one of two things 1 they must demonstrate the fact that they have rights in the wild creatures and demand their recognition or 2 see the killable game all swept off the continent by the army of destruction really it is to me very strange that gunners never care to save game birds on account of their beauty one living bob white on a fence is better than a score in a bloody gamebag a live squirrel in a tree is poetry in motion but on the table a squirrel is a rodent that tastes as a rat smells beside the ocean a flock of sandpipers is needed to complete the beautiful picture but on the table a sandpiper is beneath contempt a live deer trotting over a green meadow waving a triangular white flag is a sight to thrill any human ganglion but a deer lying deadunless it has an exceptionally fine headis only so much butchers meat one of the finest sights i ever saw in montana was a big flock of sage grouse slowly stalking over a grassy flat thinly sprinkled with sagebrush it was far more inspiring than any pile of dead birds that i ever saw i remember scores of beautiful game birds that i have seen and not killed but of all the game birds that i have eaten or tried to eat in new york i remember with sincere pleasure only one some of the ancient coldstorage candidates i remember for cause as the lawyers say illustration one mornings catch of trout near spokane another line of extermination according to law three times too many fish for one rod in those cold mountain streams fish grow slowly and a stream is quickly fished out sportsmen and gunners for gods sake elevate your viewpoint of the game of the world get out of the groove in which man has run ever since the days of adam there is something in a game bird over and above its pound of flesh you dont need the meat any longer for you dont know what hunger is save by reading of it try the fieldglass and the camera instead of the everlasting gun any fool can take a fivedollar gun and kill a bird but it takes a genius to photograph one wild bird and get a good one as hunters the camera men have the best of it one good livebird photograph is more of a trophy and a triumph than a bushel of dead birds the birds and mammals now are literally dying for your help in the making of long close seasons and in the real stoppage of slaughter can you not hear the call of the wild remnant it is time for the people who dont shoot to call a halt on those who do and if this be treason then let my enemies make the most of it since the above was written i have read in the outdoor world for april 1912 the views of a veteran sportsman and writer mr emerson hough on the wildlife situation as it seems to him today it is a strong utterance even though it reaches a pessimistic and gloomy conclusion which i do not share altogether however its breadth of view its general accuracy and its incisiveness entitle it to a full hearing the following is only an extract from a lengthy article entitled gods acre emerson houghs view of the situation the truth is none the less the truth because it is unpleasant to face there is no well posted sportsman in america no manufacturer of sporting goods in america no man well versed in american outdoor matters who does not know that we are at the evening of the day of open sport in america our old ways have failed all of them have failed the declining fortunes of the best sportsmans journals of america would prove that if proof were asked our sportsmanship has failed our game laws have failed and we know they have failed our game is almost gone and we know it is almost gone america has changed and we know that it has changed although we have not changed with it the old america is done and it is gone and we know that to be the truth the old order passeth and we know that the new order must come soon if it is to work any salvation for our wild game and our life in the open in pursuit of it there are many reasons for this fact these facts perhaps the greatest lies in the steady advance of civilization into the wilderness the usurpation for agricultural or industrial use of many of the ancient breeding and feeding places of the wild game all over the west and now all over canada the plow advances that one engine which cannot be gainsaid which never turns a backward furrow another great agency is the rapid perfection of transportation all over the world take the late influx of east african literature if there really were not access to that country we would not have this literature would not have so many pictures from that country and if even africa will soon be overrun if even africa soon will be shot out what hope is there for the game of the wholly accessible north american continent it is all too easy now for the slaughterer to get to his work all too easy for him to transport the fruits of the slaughter at the hands of the ignorant the unscrupulous and the unsparing our game has steadily disappeared until it is almost gone we have handled it in a wholly greedy unscrupulous and selfish fashion this has been our policy as a nation if there is to be success for any plan to remedy this it must come from a few largeminded men able to think and plan and able to do more than thatto follow their plans with deeds i have seen the whole story of modern american sportsmanship so called it has been class legislation and organized selfishnessthat is what it has been and nothing else i do not blame country legislators game dealers farmers for calling the sportsmen of america selfish and thoughtless i do not blame them for saying that the socalled protective measures advanced by sportsmen have been selfish measures and looking to destruction rather than to protection at least that has been their actual result i have no more reverence for a sportsman than for anyone else and no reverence for him at all because he is or calls himself a sportsman he has got to be a man he has got to be a citizen i have seen millions of acres of breeding and feeding grounds pass under the drain and under the plow in my own time so that the passing whisper of the wild fowls wing has been forgotten there now for many years i have seen a half dozen species of fine game birds become extinct in my own time and lost forever to the american people and you and i have seen one protective society after another languidly organized paying in a languid dollar or so per capita each year and so swiftly passing also to be forgotten we have seen one code and the other of conflicting and wholly selfish game laws passed and seen them mocked at and forgotten seen them all fail as we all know we have seen even the nations powerunder that ark of the covenant known as the interstate commerce actfail to stop wholly the lessening of our wild game so rapidly disappearing for so many reasons we have seen both selfish and unselfish sportsmens journals attempt to solve this problem and fail to do so some of them were great and broadminded journals their record has not been one of disgrace although it has been one of defeat for some of them really desired success more than they desired dividends these all of them bore their share of a great experiment an experiment in a new land under a new theory of government a theory which says a man should be able to restrain himself and to govern himself only by following their theory through to the end of that experiment could they know that it was to fail in one of its most vitally interesting and vitally important phases but now as we know all of these agencies selfish or unselfish have failed to effect the salvation of american wild game not by any scheme device or theory not by any panacea can the old days of america be brought back to us mr houghs views are entitled to respectful consideration but on one vital point i do not follow him i believe most sincerelyin fact i knowthat it is possible to make a few new laws which in addition to the many many good protective laws we already have will bring back the game just as fast and as far as mans settlements towns railroads mines and schemes in general ever can permit it to come back if the american people as a whole elect that our wild life shall be saved and to a reasonable extent brought back then by the eternal it will be saved and brought back the road lies straight before us and the going is easyif the mass makes up its mind to act but on one vital point mr hough is right the sportsman alone never will save the game the people who do not kill must act independently part iipreservation chapter xxii our annual losses by insects you take my life when you do take the means whereby i live in no country in the world says mr cl marlatt of the us department of agriculture do insects impose a heavier tax on farm products than in the united states these attacks are based upon an enormous and varied annual output of cereals and fruits and a great variety and number of trees for every vegetableeating insect native and foreign we seem to have crops trees and plant food galore and their ravages rob the marketbasket and the dinnerpail in 1912 there were riots in the streets of new york over the high cost of food in 1903 this state of fact was made the subject of a special inquiry by the department of agriculture and in the yearbook for 1904 the reader will find on page 461 an article entitled the annual loss occasioned by destructive insects in the united states the article is not of the sensational type it was not written in an alarmist spirit but from beginning to end it is a calm coldblooded analysis of existing facts and the conclusions that fairly may be drawn from them the opinions of several experts have been considered and quoted and often their independent figures are stated with the disappearance of our birds generally and especially the slaughter of song and other insecteating birds both in the south and north the destruction of the national wealth by insects forges to the front as a subject of vital importance the logic of the situation is so simple a child can see it short crops mean higher prices if ten per cent of our vegetable food supply is destroyed by insects as certain as fate we will feel it in the increased cost of living i would like to place mr marlatts report in the hands of every man boy and schoolteacher in america but i have not at my disposal the means to accomplish such a task i cannot even print it here in full but the vital facts can be stated briefly and in plain figures crops and insects cornthe principal insect enemies of corn are the chinch bug cornroot worm diabrotica longicornis bill bug wire worm bollworm or earworm cutworm army worm stalk worm grasshopper and plant lice in all a total of about fifty important species several of these pests work secretly at husking time the wretched earworm that ruins the terminal quarter or fifth of an immense number of ears is painfully in evidence the rootworms work insidiously and the moles and shrews are supposed to attack them and destroy them the cornroot worm is charged with causing an annual loss of two per cent of the corn crop or 20000000 the chinch bug another two per cent the boll or earworm two per cent more the remaining insect pests are charged with two per cent which makes eight per cent in all or a total of 80000000 lost each year to the american farmer through the ravages of insects this is not evenly distributed but some areas suffer more than others illustration the cutworm peridroma sancia very destructive to crops wheatof all our cereal crops wheat is the one that suffers most from insects there are three insects that cause to the wheat industry an annual loss of about ten per cent the chinch bug is the worst and it is charged with five per cent 20000000 of the total loss the hessian fly comes next in order and occasionally rolls up enormous losses in the year 1900 that insect caused to indiana and ohio alone the loss of 2577000 acres of wheat and the total cost to us of that insect in that year undoubtedly approached 100000000 did that affect the price of wheat or not if not then there is no such thing as a law of supply and demand wheat plantlice form collectively the third insect pest destructive to wheat of which it is reported that the annual loss occasioned by wheat plantlice probably does not fall short of two or three per cent of the crop hay and forage cropsthese are attacked by locusts grasshoppers army worms cutworms web worms small grass worms and leaf hoppers some of these pests are so small and work so insidiously that even the farmer is prone to overlook their existence a ten per cent shrinkage from these and other pests in grasses and forage plants is a minimum estimate cottonthe great enemies of the cottonplanter are the cotton boll weevil the bollworm and the leaf worm but other insects inflict serious damage in 1904 the loss occasioned by the boll weevil chiefly in texas was conservatively estimated by an expert mr wd hunter at 20000000 the boll worm of the southwestern cotton states has sometimes caused an annual loss of 12000000 or four per cent of the crops in the states affected before the use of arsenical poisons the leaf worm caused an annual loss of from twenty to thirty million dollars but of late years that total has been greatly reduced fruitsthe insects that reduce our annual fruit crop attack every portion of the tree and its product the woolly aphis attacks the roots of the fruit tree the trunk and limbs are preyed upon by millions of scale insects and borers the leaves are devastated by the alldevouring leaf worms canker worms and tent caterpillars while the fruit itself is attacked by the codling moth curculio and apple maggot to destroy fruit is to take money out of the farmers pocket and to attack and injure the tree is like undermining his house itself by an annual expenditure of about 8250000 in cash for spraying apple trees the destructiveness of the codling moth and curculio have been greatly reduced but that money is itself a cash loss add to this the 12000000 of actual shrinkage in the apple crop and the total annual loss to our applegrowers due to the codling moth and curculio is about 20000000 in the high price of apples a part of this loss falls upon the consumer in 1889 professor forbes calculated that the annual loss to the fruitgrowers of illinois from insect ravages was 2375000 in 1892 insects caused to nebraska applegrowers a loss computed at 2000000 and in 1897 new york farmers lost 2500000 from that cause in many sections of the pacific northwest the loss was from fifty to seventyfive per cent yearbook page 470 foreststhe annual losses occasioned by insect pests to forests and forest products in the united states have been estimated by dr ad hopkins special agent in charge of forest insect investigations at not less than 100000000 it covers both the loss from insect damages to standing timber and to the crude and manufactured forest products the annual loss to growing timber is conservatively placed at 70000000 illustration the gypsy moth portheria dispar very destructive to the finest shade trees there are other insect damages that we will not pause to enumerate here they relate to cattle horses sheep and stored grain products of many kinds even cured tobacco has its pest a minute insect known as the cigarette beetle now widespread in america and

they require absolutely nothing at our hands save the privilege of being let alone while they work for us in fighting the insects our only allies in nature are the songbirds woodpeckers shorebirds swallows and martins certain hawks moles shrews bats and a few other living creatures all these wage war at their own expense the farmers might just as well lose 8250000 through a short apple crop as to pay out that sum in labor and materials in spraying operations and yet fools that we are we go on slaughtering our friends and allowing others to slaughter them under the same brand of fatuous folly that leads the people of italy to build anew on the smoking sides of vesuvius after a dozen generations have been swept away by fire and ashes in the next chapter we will consider the work of our friends the birds chapter xxiii the economic value of birds today from halifax to los angeles and from key west to victoria a deadly contest is being waged the fruitgrowers farmers forest owners and park people are engaged in a struggle with the insect hordes for the possession of the trees shrubs and crops go out into the open with your eyes open and you will see it for yourself millions of dollars are being expended in it look at this exhibit of what is going on around me at this very momentjuly 19 1912 the bag insects in thousands are devouring the leaves of locust and maple trees the elm beetles are trying to devour the elms and spraying is in progress the hickorybark borers are slaughtering the hickories and even some park people are neglecting to take the measures necessary to stop it the tent caterpillars are being burned the aphis scale insects are devouring the tops of the white potatoes in the new york university school garden just as the potato beetle does the codling moth larvae are already at work on the apples the leaves affected by the witch hazel gall fly are being cut off and burned these are merely the most conspicuous of the insect pests that i now see daily i am not counting those of second or thirdrate importance some of these hordes are being fought with poisonous sprays some are being killed by hand and some are being ignored in view of the known value of the remaining trees of our country each woodpecker in the united states is worth twenty dollars in cash each nuthatch creeper and chickadee is worth from five to ten dollars according to local circumstances you might just as well cut down four twentyinch trees and let them lie and decay as to permit one woodpecker to be killed and eaten by an italian in the north or a negro in the south the downy woodpecker is the relentless enemy of the codling moth an insect that annually inflicts upon our apple crop damages estimated by the experts of the us department of agriculture at twelve million dollars now is a federal strongarm migratory bird law needed for such birds or not let the owners of orchards and forests make answer the case of the codling moth and curculiothe codling moth and curculio are twin terrors to applegrowers partly because of their deadly destructiveness and partly because man is so weak in resisting them the annual cost of the fight made against them in sprays and labor and apparatus has been estimated at 8250000 and what do the birds do to the codling mothwhen there are any birds left alive to operate the testimony comes from all over the united states and it is worth while to cite it briefly as a fair sample of the work of the birds upon this particularly deadly pest these facts and quotations are from the yearbook of the department of agriculture for 1911 illustration downy woodpecker the downy woodpecker is the champion treeprotector and also one of the greatest enemies of the codling moth when man is quite unable to find the hidden larvae downy locates it every time and digs it out it extracts worms from young apples so skillfully that often the fruit is not permanently injured mr fm webster reports that the labors of this bird afford actual and immediate relief to the infected fruit testimony in favor of the downy woodpecker has come from new york new jersey texas and california and no fewer than twenty larvae have been taken from a single stomach take the redshafted flicker vs the codling moth mr ap martin of petaluma cal states that during the early spring months of 1890 they were seen by hundreds in his orchard industriously examining the trunks and larger limbs of the fruit trees and he also found great numbers of them around sheds where he stored his winter apples and pears as the result of several hours search mr martin found only one worm and this one escaped only by accident for several of the birds had been within a quarter of an inch of it so eager are woodpeckers in search of codling moths that they have often been known to riddle the shingle traps and paper bands which are placed to attract the larvae about to spin cocoons behold the array of birds that devour the larvae of the codling

mcatee thirtysix species of birds of thirteen families help man in his irrepressible conflict against his deadly enemy the codling moth in some places they destroy from sixtysix to eightyfive per cent of the hibernating larvae now are the farmers of this country content to let the italians of the north and the negroes of the south shoot those birds for food and devour them what is the great american farmer going to do about this matter what he should do is to write and urge his members of congress to work for and vote for the federal migratory bird bill the cotton boll weevillet us take one other concrete case the cotton boll weevil invaded the united states from mexico in 1894 ten years later it was costing the cotton planters an annual loss estimated at fifteen million dollars per year later on that loss was estimated at twenty million dollars the cotton boll weevil strikes at the heart of the industry by destroying the boll of the cotton plant while the total loss never can be definitely ascertained we know that it has amounted to many millions of dollars the figure given above has been widely quoted and so far as i am aware never disputed fortunately we have at hand a government publication on this subject which gives some pertinent facts regarding the bird enemies of the cotton boll weevil it is circular no 57 of the biological survey department of agriculture any one can obtain it by addressing that department i quote the most important portions of this valuable document birds useful in the war against the cotton boll weevil by hw henshaw chief of the biological survey the main purpose of this circular is to direct the attention of cotton growers and others in the cotton growing states to the importance of birds in the boll weevil war to emphasize the need of protection for them and to suggest means to increase the numbers and extend the range of certain of the more important kinds investigations by the biological survey show that thirtyeight species of birds eat boll weevils while some eat them only sparingly others eat them freely and no fewer than fortyseven adult weevils have been found in the stomach of a single cliff swallow of the birds known at the present time to feed on the weevil among the most important are the orioles nighthawks and foremost of all the swallows including the purple martin oriolessix kinds of orioles live in texas though but two inhabit the southern states generally orioles are among the few birds that evince a decided preference for weevils and as they persistently hunt for the insects on the bolls they fill a place occupied by no other birds they are protected by law in nearly every state in the union but their bright plumage renders them among the most salable of birds for millinery purposes and despite protective laws considerable numbers are still killed for the hat trade it is hardly necessary to point out that their importance as insect eaters everywhere demands their protection but more especially in the cotton belt nighthawkthe nighthawk or bullbat also renders important service in the destruction of weevils and catches them on the wing in considerable numbers especially during its migration unfortunately the nighthawk is eaten for food in some sections of the south and considerable numbers are shot for this purpose the birds value for food however is infinitesimal as compared with the service it renders the cotton grower and other agriculturists and every effort should be made to spread broadcast a knowledge of its usefulness as a weevil destroyer with a view to its complete protection swallowsof all the birds now known to destroy weevils swallows are the most important six species occur in texas and the southern states the martin the barn swallow the bank swallow the roughwing and the cliff swallow breed locally in texas and all of them except the cliff swallow breed in the other cotton states the whitebellied or tree swallow nests only in the north and by far the greater number of cliff swallows nest in the north and west illustration the baltimore oriole the deadly enemy of the cottonboll weevil from the american natural history as showing how a colony of martins thrives when provided with sufficient room to multiply an experiment by mr j warren jacobs of waynesburg pa may be cited the first year five pairs were induced to occupy the single box provided and raised eleven young the fourth year three large boxes divided into ninetynine rooms contained fiftythree pairs and they raised about 175 young the colony was thus nearly three hundred strong at the close of the fourth season the effect of this number of hungry martins on the insects infesting the neighborhood may be imagined from the standpoint of the farmer and the cotton grower swallows are among the most useful birds especially designed by nature to capture insects in midair their powers of flight and endurance are unexcelled and in their own field they have no competitors their peculiar value to the cotton grower consists in the fact that like the nighthawk they capture boll weevils when flying over the fields which no other birds do flycatchers snap up the weevils near trees and shrubbery wrens hunt them out when concealed under bark or rubbish blackbirds catch them on the ground as do the killdeer titlark meadow lark and others while orioles hunt for them on the bolls but it is the peculiar function of swallows to catch the weevils as they are making long flights leaving the cotton fields in search of hiding places in which to winter or entering them to continue their work of devastation means have been taken to inform residents of the northern states of the value of the swallow tribe to agriculturists generally and particularly to cotton planters in the belief that the number of swallows breeding in the north can be substantially increased the cooperation of the northern states is important since birds bred in the north migrate directly through the southern states in the fall on their way to the distant tropics and also in the spring on their return illustration the nighthawk a goatsucker not a songbird but it feeds exclusively upon insects important as it is to increase the number of northern breeding swallows it is still more important to increase the number nesting in the south and to induce the birds there to extend their range over as much of the cotton area as possible nesting birds spend much more time in the south than migrants and during the weeks when the old birds are feeding young they are almost incessantly engaged in the pursuit of insects it is not of course claimed that birds alone can stay the ravages of the cotton boll weevil in texas but they materially aid in checking the advance of the pest into the other cotton states important auxiliaries in destroying these insects birds aid in reducing their numbers within safe limits and once within safe limits in keeping them there hence it is for the interests of the cotton states that special efforts be made to protect and care for the weevileating species and to increase their numbers in every way possibleend of the circular condensed notes on the food habits of certain north american birds millions of americans and nearamericans both old and young now need to be shown the actual figures that represent the value of our birds as destroyers of the insects weeds and the small rodents that are swarming to overrun and devour our fields orchards and forests will our people never learn that in fighting pests the birds are worth ten times more to men than all the poisons sprays and traps that ever were invented or used we cannot spray our forests and if the wild birds do not protect them from insects nothing will if you will watch a warbler collecting the insects out of the top of a seventyfoot forest oak busy as a bee hour after hour it will convince you that the birds do for the forests that which man with all his resources cannot accomplish you will then realize that to this country every woodpecker chickadee titmouse creeper and warbler is easily worth its weight in gold the killing of any member of those groups of birds should be punished by a fine of twentyfive dollars illustration the purple martin a representative of the swallow family a great insecteater one of the most valuable of all birds to the southern cotton planter and northern farmer shot for food in the south driven out of the north by the english sparrow pest the bobwhiteand take the bob white quail for example and the weeds of the farm to kill weeds costs moneyhard cash that the farmer earns by toil does the farmer put forth strenuous efforts to protect the bird of all birds that does most to help him keep down the weeds far from it all that the average farmer thinks about the quail is of killing it for a few ounces of meat on the table it is fairly beyond question that of all birds that influence the fortunes of the farmers and fruitgrowers of north america the common quail or bob white is one of the most valuable it stays on the farm all the year round when insects are most numerous and busy bob white devotes to them his entire time he cheerfully fights them from sixteen to eighteen hours per day when the insects are gone he turns his attention to the weeds that are striving to seed down the fields for another year occasionally he gets a few grains of wheat that have been left on the ground by the reapers but he does no damage in california where the valley quail once were very numerous they sometimes consumed altogether too much wheat for the good of the farmers but outside of california i believe such occurrences are unknown let us glance over the bob whites bill of fare weed seedsone hundred and twentynine different weeds have been found to contribute to the quails bill of fare crops and stomachs have been found crowded with ragweed seeds to the number of one thousand while others had eaten as many seeds of crabgrass a bird shot at pine brook nj in october 1902 had eaten five thousand seeds of green foxtail grass and one killed on christmas day at kinsale va had taken about ten thousand seeds of the pigweed elizabeth a reed in bulletin no 21 biological survey it is calculated that if in virginia and north carolina there are four bob whites to every square mile and each bird consumes one ounce of seed per day the total destruction to weed seeds from september 1st to april 30th in those states alone will be 1341 tons in 1910 mrs margaret morse nice of clark university worcester mass finished and contributed to the journal of economic entomology vol iii no 3 a masterful investigation of the food of the bobwhite it should be in every library in this land mrs nice publishes the

of quail and an entire absence of weevils texas and georgia papers please copy and yet because of its few pitiful ounces of flesh two million gunners and ten thousand lawmakers think of the quail only as a bird that can be shot and eaten throughout a great portion of its former range including new york and new jersey the species is surely and certainly on the verge of total extinction and yet sportsmen gravely discuss the bag limit and enforcement of the baglimit law as a means of bringing back this almost vanished species such folly in grown men is very trying to my friend the epicurethe

beautiful and true and his small life was blameless and here he lies dead snatched away from his field of labor and destroyed in order that i may be tempted to dine three minutes longer after i have already eaten to satiety then go on and finish bob white the case of the robinfor a long time this bird has been slaughtered in the south for food regardless of the agricultural interests of the north no southern gentleman ever shoots robins or song birds of any kind but the negroes and poor whites do it the worst case of recent occurrence was the slaughter in the town of pittsboro north carolina it was in january 1912 the mayor of the town hon bennet nooe was away from home and during a heavy fall of snow the robins came into the town in great numbers to feed upon the berries of the cedar trees in order that the birds might be killed without restriction the board of aldermen suspended the ordinance against the firing of guns in the town and permitted the inhabitants to kill the robins a disgraceful carnival of slaughter immediately followed in which about all the male population participated regarding this mayor nooe later on wrote to the editor of bird lore as follows hearing of this on my return i went to the aldermen all of whom were guilty and told them that they and all others who were guilty would have to be fined three out of the five submitted and paid up but they insisted that the ordinance be changed to read exactly as it is written here with the exception that all could shoot robins in the town until the first of march whereupon i resigned as was statedbird

history the sparrowsall our sparrows are great consumers of weed seeds professor beal has calculated the total quantity consumed in iowa in one yearin the days when sparrows were normally numerousat 1750000 pounds the american goldfinch as a weed destroyer has few equals it makes a specialty of the seeds of the members of the order compositae and is especially fond of the seeds of ragweed thistles wild lettuce and wild sunflower but small and beautiful as this bird is there are hundreds of thousands of grown men in america who would shoot it and eat it if they dared the hawks and owlslet no other state repeat the error that once was made in pennsylvania when that state enacted in 1885 her now famous hawkandowl bounty law in order to accomplish the wholesale destruction of her birds of prey a law was passed providing for the payment of a bounty of fifty cents each for the scalps of hawks and owls immediately the slaughter began in two years 180000 scalps were brought in and 90000 were paid out for them it was estimated that the saving to the farmers in poultry amounted to one dollar for each 1205 paid out in bounties the awakening came even more swiftly than the ornithologists expected by the end of two years from the passage of the hawk law the farmers found their fields and orchards thoroughly overrun by destructive rats mice and insects and they appealed to the legislature for the quick repeal of the law with all possible haste this was brought about but it was estimated by competent judges that in damages to their crops the hawk law cost the people of pennsylvania nothing less than two million dollars moral dont make any laws providing for the destruction of hawks and owls until you have exact knowledge and know in advance what the results will be in the space at my disposal for this subject it is impossible to treat our species of hawks and owls separately the reader can find in the american natural history fifteen pages of text numerous illustrations and many figures elucidating this subject unfortunately dr fishers admirable work on the hawks and owls has long been out of print and unobtainable there are however a few observations that must be recorded here each bird of prey is a balanced equation each one i think without a single exception does some damage chiefly in the destruction of valuable wild birds the value of the poultry destroyed by hawks and owls is very small in comparison with their killing of wild prey many of the species do not touch domestic poultry at the same time when a hawk of any kind or an owl sets to work deliberately and persistently to clean out a farmers poultry yard and is actually doing it that farmer is justified in killing that bird but the occasional loss of a broiler is not to be regarded as justification for a war of extermination on all the hawks that fly individual wildanimal nuisances can occasionally become so exasperating as to justify the use of the gunwhen scarecrows fail but in all such circumstances the greatest judgment and much forbearance also is desirable and necessary the value of hawks and owls rests upon their perpetual warfare on the millions of destructive rats mice moles shrews weasels rabbits and english sparrows that constantly prey upon what the farmer produces on this point a few illustrations must be given one of the most famous comes via dr fisher from one of the towers of the smithsonian buildings and relates to the barn owl strix flammeatwo hundred pellets consisting of bones hair and feathers from one nesting pair of these birds were collected and found to contain 454 skulls of which 225 were of meadow mice 179 of house mice 2 of pine mice 20 were of rats 6 of jumping mice 20 were from shrews 1 was of a mole and 1 a vesper sparrow one bird and 453 noxious mammals compare this with the record of any cat on earth anything that the barn owl wants from me or from any farmer should at once be offered to it on a silver tray this bird is often called the monkeyfaced owl and it should be called the farmersfriend owl the longeared owl asio wilsonianus has practically the same kind of a record as the barn owlscores of mice rats and shrews destroyed and only an occasional small bird its nearest relative the shorteared owl a accipitrinus may be described in the same words illustration the barn owl wonderfully destructive of rats and mice and almost never touches birds the great horned owl fills us with conflicting passions for the long list of dead rats and mice pocket gophers skunks and weasels to his credit we think well of him and wish his prosperity for the songbirds ruffed grouse quail other game birds domestic poultry squirrels chipmunks and hares that he kills we hate him and would cheerfully wring his neck wearing gauntlets he does an unusual amount of good and a terrible amount of harm it is impossible to strike a balance for him and determine with mathematical accuracy whether he should be shot or permitted to live at all events whenever bubo comes up for trial we must give the feathered devil his due the names chicken hawk or hen hawk as applied usually refer to the redshouldered or redtailed species neither of these is really very destructive to poultry but both are very destructive to mice rats and other pestiferous creatures both are large showy birds not so very swift in flight and rather easy to approach neither of them should be destroyednot even though they do once in a great while take a chicken or wild bird they pay for them four times over by ratkilling mr j alden loring states that he once knew a pair of redshouldered hawks to nest within fifty rods of a poultry farm on which there were 800 young chickens and 400 ducks not one of which was taken see the american natural history pages 22930 hawks that should be destroyedthere are two small fierce daring swiftwinged hawks both of which are so very destructive that they deserve to be shot whenever possible they are coopers hawk accipiter cooperi and the sharpshinned hawk a velox they are closely related and look much alike but the former has a rounded tail and the latter a square one in killing them please do not kill any other hawk by mistake and if you do not positively recognize the bird dont shoot the goshawk is a bad one and so is the peregrine falcon or duck hawk both deserve death but they are so rare that we need not take them into account some of the hawks and owls are very destructive to songbirds and members of the grouse family in 159 stomachs of sharpshinned hawks 99 contained songbirds and woodpeckers in 133 stomachs of coopers hawks 34 contained poultry or game birds and 52 contained other birds the game birds included 8 quail 1 ruffed grouse and 5 pigeons the woodpeckersithese birds are the natural guardians of the trees if we had enough of them our forests would be fairly safe from insect pests of the six or seven north american species that are of the most importance to our forests the downy woodpecker dryobates pubescens is accorded first rank it is one of the smallest species the contents of 140 stomachs consisted of 74 per cent insects 25 per cent vegetable matter and 1 per cent sand the insects were ants beetles bugs flies caterpillars grasshoppers and a few spiders footnote i the reader is advised to consult prof fel beales admirable report on the food of woodpeckers bulletin no 7 us department of agriculture the hairy woodpecker dryobates villosus a very close relation of the preceding species is also small and his food supply is as follows insects 68 per cent vegetable matter 31 mineral 1 the goldenwinged woodpecker colaptes auratus is the largest and handsomest of all the woodpeckers that we really see in evidence the pileated is one of the largest but we never see it this bird makes a specialty of ants of which it devours immense numbers its food is 56 per cent animal matter threefourths of which is ants 39 per cent is vegetable matter and 5 per cent mineral matter the redheaded woodpecker is a serious fruiteater and many complaints have been lodged against him exactly onehalf his food supply consists of vegetable matter chiefly wild berries acorns beechnuts and the seeds of wild shrubs and weeds we may infer that about onetenth of his food in summer and fall consists of cultivated fruit and berries his proportion of cultivated foods is entirely too small to justify any one in destroying this species in view of the prevalence of insect pests in the state of new york i have spent hours in trying to devise a practical plan for making woodpeckers about ten times more numerous than they now are contributions to this problem will be thankfully received yes we do put out pork fat and suet in winter quantities of it but i grieve to say that today in the zoological park there is not more than one woodpecker for every ten that were there twelve years ago where have they gone only one answer is possible they have been shot and eaten by the guerrillas of destruction illustration goldenwinged woodpecker a bird of great value to orchards and forests now rapidly disappearing undoubtedly through slaughter as food surely no man of intelligence needs to be told to protect woodpeckers to the utmost and to feed them in winter nail up fat pork or large chunks of suet on the south sides of conspicuous trees and encourage the woodpeckers nuthatches chickadees and titmice to remain in your woods through the long and dreary winter the english sparrow is a nuisance and a pest because it drives away from the house and the orchard the house wren bluebird phoebe purple martin and swallow any one of which is more valuable to man than a thousand english sparrows i never yet have seen one of the pest sparrows catch an insect but chief forester merkel says that he has seen one catching and eating small moths there is one place in the country where english sparrows have not yet come and whenever they do appear there they will meet a hostile reception i shall kill every one that comesfor the sake of retaining the wrens catbirds phoebes and thrushes that now literally make home happy for my family a good way to discourage sparrows is to shoot them en masse when they are feeding on road refuse such as the whitethroated whitecrowned and other sparrows never touch persistent destruction of their nests will check the nuisance the shore birdswho is there who thinks of the shorebirds as being directly beneficial to man by reason of their food habits i warrant not more than one man in every ten thousand we think of them only as possible food the amount of actual cash value benefit that the shorebirds confer upon man through the destruction of bad things is in comparison with the number of birds enormous the department of agriculture never publishes and circulates anything that has already been published no matter how valuable to the public at large our rules are different because i know that many of the people of our country need the information i am going to reprint here as an object lesson and a warning the whole of the biological surveys valuable and timely circular no 79 issued april 11 1911 and written by prof wl mcatee it should open the eyes of the american people to two things the economic value of these birds and the fact that they are everywhere far on the road toward extermination our vanishing shorebirds by prof wl mcatee the term shorebird is applied to a group of longlegged slenderbilled and usually plainly colored birds belonging to the order limicolae more than sixty species of them occur in north america true to their name they frequent the shores of all bodies of water large and small but many of them are equally at home on plains and prairies throughout the eastern united states shorebirds are fast vanishing while formerly numerous species swarmed along the atlantic coast and in the prairie regions many of them have been so reduced that extermination seems imminent the blackbellied plover or beetlehead which occurred along the atlantic seaboard in great numbers years ago is now seen only as a straggler the golden plover once exceedingly abundant east of the great plains is now rare vast hordes of longbilled dowitchers formerly wintered in louisiana now they occur only in infrequent flocks of a half dozen or less the eskimo curlew within the last decade has probably been exterminated and the other curlews greatly reduced in fact all the larger species of shorebirds have suffered severely so adverse to shorebirds are present conditions that the wonder is that any escape in both fall and spring they are shot along the whole route of their migration north and south their habit of decoying readily and persistently coming back in flocks to the decoys again and again in spite of murderous volleys greatly lessens their chances of escape the breeding grounds of some of the species in the united states and canada have become greatly restricted by the extension of agriculture and their winter ranges in south america have probably been restricted in the same way unfortunately shorebirds lay fewer eggs than any of the other species generally termed game birds they deposit only three or four eggs and hatch only one brood yearly nor are they in any wise immune from the great mortality known to prevail among the smaller birds their eggs and young are constantly preyed upon during the breeding season by crows gulls and jaegers and the far northern country to which so many of them resort to nest is subject to sudden cold storms which kill many of the young in the more temperate climate of the united states small birds in general do not bring up more than one young bird for every two eggs laid sometimes the proportion of loss is much greater actual count revealing a destruction of 70 to 80 per cent of nests and eggs shorebirds with sets of three or four eggs probably do not on the average rear more than two young for each breeding pair it is not surprising therefore that birds of this family with their limited powers of reproduction melt away under the relentless warfare waged upon them until recent years shorebirds have had almost no protection thus the species most in need of stringent protection have really had the least no useful birds which lay only three or four eggs should be retained on the list of game birds the shorebirds should be relieved from persecution and if we desire to save from extermination a majority of the species action must be prompt the protection of shorebirds need not be based solely on esthetic or sentimental grounds for few groups of birds more thoroughly deserve protection from an economic standpoint shorebirds perform an important service by their inroads upon mosquitoes some of which play so conspicuous a part in the dissemination of diseases thus nine species are known to feed upon mosquitoes and hundreds of the larvae or wigglers were found in several stomachs fiftythree per cent of the food of twentyeight northern phalaropes from one locality consisted of mosquito larvae the insects eaten include the saltmarsh mosquito aedes sollicitans for the suppression of which the state of new jersey has gone to great expense the nine species of shorebirds known to eat mosquitoes are northern phalarope lobipes lobatus semipalmated sandpiper ereunetes pusillus wilson phalarope steganopus tricolor stilt sandpiper micropalama himantopus killdeer oxyechus vociferus pectoral sandpiper pisobia maculata semipalmated plover aegialitis semipalmata baird sandpiper pisobia bairdi least sandpiper pisobia minutilla cattle and other live stock also are seriously molested by mosquitoes as well as by another set of pests the horseflies adults and larvae of these flies have been found in the stomachs of the dowitcher the pectoral sandpiper the hudsonian godwit and the killdeer two species of shorebirds the killdeer and upland plover still further befriend cattle by devouring the north american fever tick among other fly larvae consumed are those of the crane flies leatherjackets devoured by the following species northern phalarope lobipes lobatus pectoral sandpiper pisobia maculata wilson phalarope steganopus tricolor baird sandpiper pisobia bairdi woodcock philohela minor upland plover bartramia longicauda jacksnipe gallinago delicata killdeer oxyechus vociferus cranefly larvae are frequently seriously destructive locally in grass and wheat fields among their numerous bird enemies shorebirds rank high another group of insects of which the shorebirds are very fond is grasshoppers severe local infestations of grasshoppers frequently involving the destruction of many acres of corn cotton and other crops are by no means exceptional aughey found twentythree species of shorebirds feeding on rocky mountain locusts in nebraska some of them consuming large numbers as shown below 9

armyworms cutworms cottonworms bollweevils curculios wireworms and cloverleaf weevils it is insane folly to shoot any birds that do such work many species of the shorebirds are rapidly being exterminated even under ordinary conditions grasshoppers are a staple food of many members of the shorebird family and the following species are known to feed on them northern phalarope lobipes lobatus avocet recurvirostra americana blacknecked stilt himantopus mexicanus woodcock philohela minor jacksnipe gallinago delicata dowitcher macrorhamphus griseus robin snipe tringa canutus

longicauda shorebirds are fond of other insect pests of forage and grain crops including the army worm which is known to be eaten by the killdeer and spotted sandpiper also cutworms among whose enemies are the avocet woodcock pectoral and baird sandpipers upland plover and killdeer two caterpillar enemies of cotton the cotton worm and the cotton cutworm are eaten by the upland plover and killdeer the latter bird feeds also on caterpillars of the genus phlegethontius which includes the tobacco and tomato worms the principal farm crops have many destructive beetle enemies also and some of these are eagerly eaten by shorebirds the boll weevil and cloverleaf weevil are eaten by the upland plover and killdeer the rice weevil by the killdeer the cowpea weevil by the upland plover and the cloverroot curculio by the following species of shorebirds northern phalarope lobipes lobatus whiterumped sandpiper pisobia fuscicollis pectoral sandpiper pisobia maculata upland plover bartramia longicauda baird sandpiper pisobia bairdi killdeer oxyechus vociferus the last two eat also other weevils which attack cotton grapes and sugar beets billbugs which often do considerable damage to corn seem to be favorite food of some of the shorebirds they are eaten by the wilson phalarope avocet blacknecked stilt pectoral sandpiper killdeer and upland plover they are an important element of the latter birds diet and no fewer than eight species of them have been found in its food wireworms and their adult forms click beetles are devoured by the northern phalarope woodcock jacksnipe pectoral sandpiper killdeer and upland plover the last three feed also on the southern corn leafbeetle and the last two upon the grapevine colaspis other shorebirds that eat leafbeetles are the wilson phalarope and dowitcher crayfishes which are a pest in rice and corn fields in the south and which injure levees are favorite food of the blacknecked stilt and several other shorebirds feed upon them notably the jacksnipe robin snipe spotted sandpiper upland plover and killdeer thus it is evident that shorebirds render important aid by devouring the enemies of farm crops and in other ways and their services are appreciated by those who have observed the birds in the field thus wa clark of corpus christi tex reports that upland plovers are industrious in following the plow and in eating the grubs that destroy garden stuff corn and cotton crops hw tinkham of fall river mass says of the spotted sandpiper three pairs nested in a young orchard behind my house and adjacent to my garden i did not see them once go to the shore for food shore about 1500 feet away but i did see them many times make faithful search of my garden for cutworms spotted squash bugs and green flies cutworms and cabbage worms were their special prey after the young could fly they still kept at work in my garden and showed no inclination to go to the shore until about august 15th they and a flock of quails just over the wall helped me wonderfully in the uncultivated parts of their range also shorebirds search out and destroy many creatures that are detrimental to mans interest several species prey upon the predaceous diving beetles dytiscidae which are a nuisance in fish hatcheries and which destroy many insects the natural food of fishes the birds now known to take these beetles are northern phalarope lobipes lobatus dowitcher macrorhamphus griseus wilson phalarope steganopus tricolor robin snipe tringa canutus avocet recurvirostra americana pectoral sandpiper pisobia maculata blacknecked stilt himantopus mexicanus redbacked sandpiper pelidna alpina sakhalina jacksnipe gallinago delicata kill deer oxyechus vociferus large numbers of marine worms of the genus nereis which prey upon oysters are eaten by shorebirds these worms are common on both the atlantic and gulf coasts and are eaten by shorebirds wherever they occur it is not uncommon to find that from 100 to 250 of them have been eaten at one meal the birds known to feed upon them are northern phalarope lobipes lobatus whiterumped sandpiper pisobia fuscicollis dowitcher macrorhamphus griseus stilt sandpiper micropalama himantopus redbacked sandpiper pelidna alpina sakhalina robin snipe tringa canutus purple sandpiper arquatella maritima killdeer oxyechus vociferus the economic record of the shorebirds deserves nothing but praise these birds injure no crop but on the contrary feed upon many of the worst enemies of agriculture it is worth recalling that their diet includes such pests as the rocky mountain locust and other injurious grasshoppers the army worm cutworms cabbage worms cotton worm cotton cutworm boll weevil clover leaf weevil clover root curculio rice weevil corn billbugs wireworms corn leafbeetles cucumber beetles white grubs and such foes of stock as the texas fever tick horseflies and mosquitoes their warfare on crayfishes must not be overlooked nor must we forget the more personal debt of gratitude we owe them for preying upon mosquitoes they are the most important bird enemies of these pests known to us shorebirds have been hunted until only a remnant of their once vast numbers is left their limited powers of reproduction coupled with the natural vicissitudes of the breeding period make their increase slow and peculiarly expose them to danger of extermination in the way of protection a beginning has been made and a continuous close season until 1915 has been established for the following birds the killdeer in massachusetts and louisiana the upland plover in massachusetts and vermont and the piping plover in massachusetts but considering the needs and value of these birds this modicum of protection is small indeed the abovenamed species are not the only ones that should be exempt from persecution for all the shorebirds of the united states are in great need of better protection they should be protected first to save them from the danger of extermination and second because of their economic importance so great indeed is their economic value that their retention on the game list and their destruction by sportsmen is a serious loss to agricultureend of the circular the following appeared in the zoological society bulletin for january 1909 from richard walter tomalin of sydney nsw in the subdistricts of robertson and kangaloon in the illawarra district of new south wales what ten years ago was a waving mass of english cocksfoot and rye grass which had been put in gradually as the dense vine scrub was felled and burnt off is now a barren desert and nine families out of every ten which were renting properties have been compelled to leave the district and take up other lands this is through the grubs having eaten out the grass by the roots ploughing proved to be useless as the grubs ate out the grass just the same whilst there recently i was informed that it took three years from the time the grubs were first seen until today to accomplish this complete devastation in other words three years ago the grubs began work in the beautiful country of green mountains and running streams the birds had all been ruthlessly shot and destroyed in that district and i was amazed at the absence of bird life the two subdistricts i have mentioned have an area of about thirty square miles and form a tableland about 1200 feet above sea level the same kind of common sense that teaches men to go in when it rains and keep out of fiery furnaces teaches us that as a business proposition it is to mans interest to protect the birds make them plentiful and keep them so when we strike the birds we hurt ourselves the protection of our insecteating and seedeating birds is a cash propositionprotect or pay were i a farmer no gun ever should be fired on my premises at any bird save the english sparrow and the three bad hawks any man who would kill my friend bob white i would treat as an enemy the man who would shoot and eat any of the songbirds woodpeckers or shorebirds that worked for me i would surely molest every farmer should post every foot of his lands cultivated and not cultivated the farmer who does not do so is his own enemy and he needs a guardian at this stage of wild life extermination it is impossible to make our birdprotection laws too strict or too farreaching the remnant of our birds should be protected with clubs and guns if necessary all our shore birds should be accorded a tenyear close season dont ask the gunners whether they will agree to it or not of course they will not agree to itnever but our duty is clearto go ahead and do it chapter xxiv game and agriculture and deer as a food supply as a state and county asset the whitetailed deer contains possibilities that as yet seem to be ignored by the american people as a whole it is quite time to consider that persistent prolific and toothsome animal the proposition that large herds of horned game can not becomingly roam at will over farms and vineyards worth one hundred dollars per acre affords little room for argument generally speaking there is but one country in the world that breaks this wellnigh universal rule and that country is india on the plains between and adjacent to the ganges and the jumna for two thousand years herds of blackbuck or sasin antelope have roamed over cultivated fields so thickly garnished with human beings that today the rifleshooting sportsman stands in hourly peril of bagging a fivehundredrupee native every time he fires at an antelope wherever rich agricultural lands exist the big game must give wayfrom those lands today the bison could not survive in iowa eastern nebraska or eastern kansas any longer than a shawnee indian would last on the bowery it was foredoomed that the elk deer bear and wild turkey should vanish from the rich farming regions of the east and the middle west today in british east africa lions are being hunted with dogs and shot wholesale because they are a pest to the settlers and to the surviving herds of big game at the same time the settlers who are striving to wrest the fertile plains of bea from the domain of savagery declare that the african buffalo the zebra the kongoni and the elephant are public nuisances that must be suppressed by the rifle even the most ardent friend of wild life must admit that when a settler has laboriously fenced his fields and plowed and sowed only to have his whole crop ruined in one night by a herd of fencebreaking zebras the event is sufficient to abrade the nerves of the party most in interest while i take no stock in stories of dozens of rogue elephants that require treatment with the rifle and of grown men being imperiled by savage gazelles we admit that there are times when wild animals can make nuisances of themselves let us consider that subject now wild animal nuisancescomplaints have come to me at various times of great destruction of lambs by eagles of trout by blue herons of crops on long island by deer of pears destroyed by birds and of valuable park trees by beavers that chop down trees not wisely but too well i do not however include in this category any cherries eaten by robins or orioles or jays for they are of too small importance to consider in this court illustration a food supply of whitetailed deer the killing of the does was wrong to meet the legitimate demands for the abatement of unbearable wildanimal nuisances i recommend the enactment of a law similar to section 158 of the game laws of new york which provides for the safe and legitimate abatement of unbearable wild creatures as follows section 158 power to take birds and quadrupeds in the event that any species of birds protected by the provisions of section two hundred and nineteen of this article or quadrupeds protected by law shall at any time in any locality become destructive of private or public property the commission shall have power in its discretion to direct any game protector or issue a permit to any citizen of the state to take such species of birds or quadrupeds and dispose of the same in such manner as the commission may provide such permit shall expire within four months after the date of issuance this measure should be adopted by every state that is troubled by too many or too aggressive wild mammals or birds but to return to the subject of big game and farming we do not complain of the disappearance of the bison elk deer and bear from the farms of the united states and canada the passing of the big game from all such regions follows the advance of real civilization just so surely and certainly as night follows day but this vast land of ours is not wholly composed of rich agricultural lands not by any means there are millions of acres of forest lands good bad and indifferent worth from nothing per acre up to one hundred dollars or more there are millions of acres of rocky brushcovered mountains and hills wholly unsuited to agriculture or even horticulture there are other millions of acres of arid plains and arboreal deserts on which nothing but thirstproof animals can live and thrive the south contains vast pine forests and cypress swamps millions of acres of them of which the average northerner knows less than nothing we can not stop long enough to look it up but from the green color on our national map that betokens the forest reserves and from our own personal knowledge of the deserts swamps barrens and rocks that we have seen we make the estimate that fully onethird of the total area of the united states is incapable of supporting the husbandman who depends for his existence upon tillage of the soil people may talk and write about dry farming all they please but i wish to observe that from dryfarming to success is a long shot with many limbs in the way when it rains sufficiently dry farming is a success but otherwise it is not and we heartily wish it were otherwise the logical conclusion of our land that is utterly unfit for agriculture is a great area of land available for occupancy by valuable wild animals every year the people of the united states are wasting uncountable millions of pounds of venison because we are neglecting our opportunities for producing it practically without cost imagine for a moment bestowing upon land owners the ability to stock with whitetailed and indian sambar deer all the wild lands of the united states that are suitable for those species and permitting only bucks over one year of age to be shot with the does even reasonably protected the numerical results in annual pounds of good edible flesh fairly challenges the imagination about six years ago mr cc worthingtons deer in his fenced park at shawneeondelaware pennsylvania became so numerous and so burdensome that he opened his fences and permitted about one thousand head to go free we are losing each year a very large and valuable asset in the intangible form of a million hardy deer that we might have raised but did not our vast domains of wooded mountains hills and valleys lie practically untenanted by big game save in a few exceptional spots we lose because we are lawless we lose because we are too improvident to conserve large forms of wild life unless we are compelled to do so by the stern edict of the law the lawbreakers the gamehogs the conscienceless doeandfawn slayers are everywhere ten per cent of all the grown men now in the united states are today poachers thieves and lawbreakers or else they are liable to become so tomorrow if you doubt it try risking your new umbrella unprotected in the next mixed company of one hundred men that you encounter in such a situation that it will be easy to get away with it we could raise two million deer each year on our empty wild lands but without fences it would take half a million real gamewardens on duty from dawn until dark to protect them from destructive slaughter at present our land of liberty contains only 9354 game wardensj the states that contain the greatest areas of wild lands naturally lack in population and in tax funds and not one such state can afford to put into the field even half enough salaried game wardens to really protect her game from surreptitious slaughter the surplus of personal liberty in this libertycursed land is a curse to the big game the average frontiersman never will admit the divine right of kings but he does ardently believe in the divine right of settlersto reach out and take any of the products of nature that they happen to fancy footnote j of this force there are only 1200 salaried wardens the most of those who serve without salaries naturally render but little continuous or regular service wild meat as a food supplywe hear much these days about the high cost of living but thus far we have made no move to mend the situation with coal going straight up to ten dollars per ton beef going up to fifteen dollars per hundred on the hoof and wheat and hay goingupheaven alone knows where it is time for all americans who are not rich to arouse and take thought for the morrow what are we going to do about it the tariff on the coarser necessities of life is now booked to come down but what about the fresh meat supply i desire to point out that between bangor and san diego and from key west to bellingham our country contains millions of acres of wild practically uninhabited forests rough foothills badlands and mountains that could produce two million deer each year without deducting 50000 a year from the wealth of the country i grant that in the total number of deer that would be necessary to produce two million deer per annum the farms situated on the edges of forests and actually within the forests would suffer somewhat from the depredations of those deer as i will presently show by documentary records every one of those individual damages that exceeds two dollars in value could be compensated in cash and afterward leave on the credit side of the deer account an enormous annual balance stop for a moment you enterprising and restless men and women who travel all over the united states and think of the illimitable miles of unbroken forest that you have looked upon from your pullman windows in the east in the south in the west and in southern canada recall the wooded mountains of the appalachian system the white mountain region the pine forests of the atlantic coast and the gulf states the forests of tennessee arkansas and southern missouri of northern minnesota and every state of the rocky mountain region then think of the silent and untouched forests of the pacific coast and tell me whether you think five million deer scattered through all those forests would make any visible impression upon them that would be only about twentyfive times as many as are there now i think the forests would not be over populated and they would produce two million killable deer each year last year 11000 deer were forced down out of their hiding places in the rocky mountains and were killed in montana even the natives had not dreamed there were so many available and they were slaughtered not wisely but too ill it is not right that six members of one family should hog twelve deer in one season at present no deer supply can stand such slaughter assuming that the people of the united states could be educated into the idea of so conserving deer that they could draw two million head per year from the general stock what would it be worth it is not very difficult to estimate the value of a deer when the whole animal can be utilized in various portions of the united states deer vary in size but i shall take all this into account and try to strike a fair average in some sections where deer are large and heavy a fullgrown buck is easily worth twentyfive dollars let him who doubts it try to replace those generous pounds of flesh with purchased beef and mutton and veal and see how far twentyfive dollars will go toward it every man who is a householder knows full well how little meat one dollar will buy at this time i think that throughout the united states as a whole every fullgrown deer male or female contains on an average ten dollars worth of good meat i know of one large preserve which annually sells its surplus of deer at that price wholesale to dealers and in new york city doubtless in many other cities also venison often has sold in the market at one dollar per pound two million deer at 10 each mean 20000000 the licenses for the killing of two million deer should cost one million men one dollar each and that would pay 1666 new game wardens each fifty dollars per month all the year round the damages that would need to be paid to farmers on account of crops injured by deer would be so small that each county could take care of its own cases from its own treasury as is done in the state of vermont there are certain essentials to the realization of a dream of two million deer per year that are absolutely required they are neither obscure nor impossible each state and each county proposing to stock its vacant woods with deer must resolutely educate its own people in the necessity of playing fair about the killing of deer and giving every man and every deer a square deal this is not impossible not as a general thing even though it may be so in some specially lawless communities if the leading men of the state and the county will take this matter seriously in hand it can be done in two years time the american people are not insensible to appeals to reason when those appeals are made by their own home folks the governors senators assemblymen judges mayors and justices of the peace could if they would make a campaign of education and appeal that would result in the creation of an immense volume of free wild food in every state that possesses wild lands when the shoe of necessity pinches the people hard enough remember the possibilities in deer illustration whitetailed deer if honestly and intelligently conserved this species could be made to produce on our wild lands two million deer per annum as a new food supply from the american natural history the best wild animal to furnish a serious food supply is the whitetailed deer this is because of its persistence and fertility the elk is too large for general use an elk carcass can not be carried on a horse it is impossible to get a sled or a wagon to where it lies and so fully half of it usually is wasted the mule deer is good for the rocky mountains and can live where the whitetail can not but it is too easy to shoot the columbian blacktail is the natural species for the forests of the pacific states but it is a trifle small in size the example of vermontin order to show that all the above is not based on empty theoryregarding the stocking of forests with deer their wonderful powers of increase and the practical handling of the damage questionlet us take the experience and the fine example of vermont in april 1875 a few sportsmen of rutland of whom the late henry w cheney was one procured in the adirondacks thirteen whitetailed deer six bucks and seven does these were liberated in a forest six miles from rutland and beyond being protected from slaughter they were left to shift for themselves they increased slowly at first then rapidly and by 1897 they had become so numerous that it seemed right to have a short annual open season and kill a few from first to last many of those deer have been killed contrary to law in 19045 it was known that 294 head were destroyed in that way and undoubtedly there were others that were not reported account of deer killed in vermont of record since killing began in 1897 from john w titcomb state game commissioner lyndonville vt aug 23 1912 by by by wounded by by average gross year hunters hunters dogs deer railroad various weight weight legally illegally killed trains accidents lbs lbs 1897 103 47 1898 131 30

farmers for damages inflicted upon their crops by deer clearly it is more just that counties should settle these damages than that they should be paid from the state treasury because the counties paying damages have large compensation in the value of the deer killed each year the hunting appears to be open to all persons who hold licenses from the state in order that the public at large may know the cost of the vermont system i offer the following digest compiled from the last biennial report of the state fish and game commissioner damages paid for deer depredations in vermont during two years total damages paid from june 8 1908 to june 22 1910 486598 total number of claims paid 311 total number of claims under 5 80 number between 5 and 10 inclusive 102 number over 25 and under 51 23 number between 50 and 100 11 number in excess of 100 4 number in excess of 200 1 largest claim paid 32650 value of whitetailed deerhaving noted the fact that in two years 19089 the people of vermont paid out 4865 in compensation for damages inflicted by deer it is of interest to determine whether that money was wisely expended in other words did it pay we have seen that in the years 1908 and 9 the people of vermont killed legally and illegally and converted to use 7186 deer this does not include the deer killed by dogs and by accidents regarding the value of a fullgrown deer it must be remembered that much depends upon the locality of the carcass in new york or pittsburg or chicago a whole deer is worth at wholesale at least twentyfive dollars in vermont where deer are plentiful they are worth a less sum i think that fifteen dollars would be a fair figureat least low enough even when computed at fifteen dollars per carcass those deer were worth to the people of vermont 107790 it would seem therefore that the soundness of vermonts policy leaves no room for argument and we hope that other states and also private individuals will profit by vermonts very successful experiment in bringing back the deer to her forests and in increasing the food supply of her people killing female deerto say one word on this subject which might by any possibility be construed as favoring it is like juggling with a lighted torch over a barrel of gunpowder already in pennsylvania at least one gentleman has appeared anxious to represent me as favoring the killing of does which in nine hundred and ninetynine cases out of every thousand i distinctly and emphatically do not the slaughter of female hoofed game animals is necessarily destructive and reprehensible and not one man out of every ten thousand in this country ever will see the place and time wherein the opposite is true at present there are just two places in america and i think only two wherein there exists the slightest exception on this point the state of vermont is becoming overstocked with deer and the females have in some counties not in all become so tame and destructive in orchards gardens and farm crops as to constitute a great annoyance for this reason the experiment is being made of permitting does to be killed under license until their number is somewhat reduced the first returns from this trial have now come in from the county game wardens of vermont to the state game warden mr john w titcomb i will quote the gist of the opinion of each the state commissioner says this law should remain in force at least until there is some indication of a decrease in the number of deer warden wh taft addison county says the killing of does i believe did away with a good many of these tame deer that cause most of the damage to farmers crops harry chase bennington county says the doekilling law is a good law and i sincerely trust it will not be repealed warden hayward of rutland county says the majority of the farmers in this county are in favor of repealing the doe law a great many does and young deer almost fawns were killed in this county during the hunting season of 1909 rw wheeler of rutland county says have the doe law repealed we dont need it hj parcher of washington county finds that the does did more damage to the crops than the bucks and he thinks the doe law is a just one rl frost of windham county judicially concludes that the law allowing does to be killed should remain in force one or two seasons more cs parker of orleans county says his county is not overstocked with deer and he favors a special act for his county to protect females a summary of the testimony of the wardens is easily made when deer are too plentiful and the overtame does become a public nuisance too great to be endured the number should be reduced by regular shooting in the open season but as soon as the proper balance of deer life has been restored protect the does once more the pursuit of this policy is safe and sane provided it can be wrought out without the influence of selfishness and reckless disregard for the rights of the next generation on the whole its handling is like playing with fire and i think there are very very few states on this earth wherein it would be wise or safe to try it as a wise friend once remarked to me give some men a hinch and theyll always try to take a hell in vermont however the situation is kept so well in hand we may be sure that at the right moment the law providing for the decrease of the number of does will be repealed hippopotami and antelopeslast year a bill was introduced in the lower house of congress proposing to provide funds for the introduction into certain southern states of various animals from africa especially hippopotami and african antelopes the former were proposed partly for the purpose of ridding navigation of the water hyacinths that now are choking many of the streams of louisiana and mississippi the antelopes were to be acclimatized as a food supply for the people at large this measure well illustrates the prevailing disposition of the american people todayto ignore and destroy their own valuable natural stock of wild birds and mammals and when they have completed their war of extermination reach out to foreign countries for foreign species instead of preserving the deer of the south the south reaches out for the utterly impossible antelopes of africa and the preposterous hippopotamus the north joyously exterminates her quail and ruffed grouse and goes to europe for the hungarian partridge that partridge is a failure here and i am heartily glad of it on the ground that the exterminators of our native species do not deserve success in their efforts to displace our finest native species with others from abroad the hippoantelope proposition is a climax of absurdity in proposing the replacing of valuable native game with impossible foreign species chapter xxv law and sentiment as factors in preservation there is grave danger that through ignorance of the true character of about 80 per cent of the men and boys who shoot wild creatures a great wrong will be done the latter let us not make a fatal mistake after more than thirty years of observation among all kinds of sportsmen hunters and gunners i am convinced that it is utterly futile and deadly dangerous to rely on humane highclass sentiment to diminish the slaughter of wild things by gamehogs and pothunters in some respects the term gamehog is a rude rough word but it is needed in the english language and it has come to stay it is a disagreeable term but it was brought into use to apply to a class of very disagreeable persons a gamehog is a hunter of game who knows no such thing as sentiment or conscience in the killing of game so long as he keeps within the limit of the law regardless of the scarcity of game or of its hard struggle for existence he will kill right up to the bag limit every day that he goes out provided it is possible to do so he uses the law as a salve for the spot where his conscience should be he will shoot with any machine gun or gun of big calibre in every way that the law allows and he knows no such thing as giving the game a square deal he brags of his big bags of game and he loves to be photographed with a wagonload of dead birds as a background he believes in automatic and pump guns spring shooting longer open seasons and more game he is quite content to shoot half tame ducks in a club preserve as they fly between coop and pond whenever he secures an opportunity he will gladly sell his game whenever he can do so without being found out and sometimes when he is often a true sportsman drifts without realizing it into some one way of the confirmed gamehog but the moment he is made to realize his position he changes his course and his standing the gamehog is impervious to argument you can shame a horse away from his oats more easily than you can shame him from doing what the law allows there are hundreds of thousands of gentlemen and gentlewomen who never once have come in touch with real clovenfooted gamehogs who do not understand the species at all and do not recognize its earmarks thousands of such persons will tell you in my opinion the best way to save the wild life is to educate the people i have heard that many many times for righthearted people a little law is quite sufficient and the best people need none at all but the gamehogs are different for them the strict letter of the law backed up by a strongarm squad is the only controlling influence that they recognize to them it is necessary to say you shall and you shall not only yesterday the latest gamehog case was related to me by a gameprotector from kansas into a certain county of southern kansas from which the prairiechicken had been totally gone for a dozen years or more a pair of those birds entered settled down and nested their coming was to many habitants a joyous event now said the people we will care for these birds and they will multiply and presently the county will be restocked but ahab came two men from another county calling themselves sportsmen but not entitled to that name heard of those birds and resolved to get them they waited until the young were just leaving the nest and they went down and camped near by on the first day they killed the two parent birds and half the flock of young birds and the next day they got all the rest but there is a sequel to this story one of those men was a dealer in guns and ammunition and when his customers heard what he had done they simply put him out of business by refusing to trade with him any more he is now washing dirty dishes in a restaurant but at heart he is a gamehog just the same near bridgeport connecticut a gentleman of my acquaintance owns a fine estate which is adorned with a trout stream and a superfine trout pond once he invited a business man of bridgeport to be his guest and fish for trout in his pond on that guest during a visit of three days all the finest forms of hospitality were bestowed two weeks later my friends gamewarden caught that guest early on a sunday morning poaching on the troutpond and spoiled his carefully arranged getaway in his book saddle and camp in the rockies mr dillon wallace tells a story of a man from new york who in the mountains of colorado deliberately corrupted his guides with money or other influences shot mountain sheep in midsummer and got away with it in northern minnesota george e wood has been having a handtohand fight with the worst community of gamehogs and alienborn poachers of which i have heard there appears to be no game law that they do not systematically violate the killers seem determined to annihilate the last head of game in spite of fines and imprisonments the foreigners are absolutely uncontrollable the latest feature of the war is the discovery of a tannery in the woods where the hides of illegallyslaughtered deer and moose are dressed apparently the only kind of a law that will save the game of northern minnesota is one that will totally disarm the entire population in pennsylvania there exists an association which was formed for the express purpose of fighting the state game commission preventing the enactment of a hunters license law and repealing the law against the killing of female deer and hornless fawns the continued existence of that organization on that basis would be a standing disgrace to the fair name of pennsylvania i think however that that organization was founded on secret selfish purposes and that ere long the general body of members will awaken to a realizing sense of their position and range themselves in support of the excellent policies of the commission a pothunter is a man or boy who kills game as a business for the money that can be derived from its sale or other use such men have the same feelings as butchers from their point of view they can see no reason why all the game in the world should not be killed and marketed like the featherdealers they wish to get out of the wild life all the money there is in it that is all left to themselves with open markets they would soon exterminate the land fauna of the habitable portions of the globe no one can educate such people for the gunners gamehogs and pothunters there is no check save specific laws that sternly and amply safeguard the rights of the wild creatures that can not make laws for themselves nor can anyone educate the heartless woman of fashion who is determined to wear aigrettes as long as her money can buy them the best women of the world have already been educated on the birdmillinery subject and they are already against the use of the gaudy badges of slaughter and extermination but in the great cities of the world there are thousands of women who are at heart as cruel as salome herself and whose vicious tastes can be curbed only by the strong hand of the law sentiment for wild birds is not in them because of the vicious and heartless elements among men and women we say give us farreaching ironbound laws for the protection of wild life and plenty of courageous men to enforce them chapter xxvi the army of the defense it now seems that the friends of wild life who themselves are not on the firingline should be afforded some definite information regarding the army of the defense and its strength and weakness it is an interesting subject but the limitations of space will not permit an extended treatment over the world at large i think the active destroyers outnumber the active defenders of wild life at least in the ratio of 500 to 1 and the money available to the destroyers is to the funds of the defenders as 500 is to 1 the average biggame sportsman cheerfully expends from 500 to 1000 on a hunting trip but resents the suggestion that he should subscribe from 50 to 100 for wild life preservation if he puts down 10 he thinks he has done a big thing worse than this i am forced to believe that at least 75 per cent of the biggame sportsmen of the world never have contributed one dollar in money or one hour of effort to that cause but there are exceptions and i can name at least fifty sportsmen who have subscribed 100 each to campaign funds and some who have given as high as 1000 once i sat down beside a financially rich slaughterer of game and asked him to subscribe a sum of real money in behalf of a very important campaign i needed funds very much and i explained exhorted and besought i pointed out his dutyto give back something in return for all the game slaughter that he had enjoyed for ten long minutes he stood fire without flinching and without once opening his lips to speak he made no answer no argument no defense and finally he never gave up one cent wherever the english language is spoken from tasmania to scotland and from porto rico to the philippines the spirit of wild life protection exists elsewhere there is much more to be said on this point to all cosmopolitan sportsmen the british blue book on game protection the annual reports of the two great protective societies of london and the annual progress report of the us department of agriculture are reassuring and comforting it is good to know that uganda maintains a department of game protection al butler superintendent that so good a man as maj j stevensonhamilton is in control of protection in the transvaal and that even the native state of kashmir officially recognizes the need to protect the remnant there are of course many parts of the world in which game laws and limits to slaughter are quite unknown all of which is entirely wrong and in need of quick correction no state or nation can be accounted wholly civilized that fails to recognize the necessity to protect wild life i am tempted to make a list of the states and nations that were at latest advices destitute of game laws and game protectors but i fear to do injustice through lack of the latest information however the time has come to search out delinquents and hold up to each one a mirror that will reflect its shortcomings naturally we are most interested in our own contingent of the army of the defense the united states governmenttoday the feeling in congress toward the conservation of wild life and forests is admirable both houses are fully awake to the necessity of saving while there is yet something to be saved the people of the united states may be assured that the national government is active and sympathetic in the prosecution of such conservation measures as it might justly be expected to promote for example during the past five years we have seen congress take favorable action on the following important causes nearly every one of which cost money the saving of the american bison in four national ranges the creation of fiftyeight bird refuges the creation of five great game preserves the saving of the elk in jackson hole the protection of the fur seal the protection of the wild life of alaska there are many active friends of wild life who confidently expect to see this fine list gloriously rounded out by the passage in 1913 of an ideal bill for the federal protection of all migratory birds to name the friends of wild life in congress would require the printing of a list of at least two hundred names and a history of the rise and progress of wild life conservation by the national government would fill a volume such a volume would be highly desirable when the story of the national governments part in wildlife protection is finally written it will be found that while he was president theodore roosevelt made a record in that field that is indeed enough to make a reign illustrious he aided every wildlife cause that lay within the bounds of possibility and he gave the vanishing birds and mammals the benefit of every doubt he helped to establish three national bison herds four national game preserves fiftythree federal bird refuges and to enact the alaska game laws of 1902 and 1907 it was in 1904 that the national government elected to accept its share of the white mans burden and enter actively into the practical business of wild life protection this special work originally undertaken and down to the present vigorously carried on by dr theodore s palmer has considerably changed the working policy of the biological survey of the department of agriculture and greatly influenced game protection throughout the states the game protection work of that bureau is alone worth to the people of this country at least twenty times more per annum than the entire annual cost of the bureau next to the splendid services of dr palmer all over the united states one great value of the bureau is found in the factandfigure ammunition that it prepares and distributes for general use in assaults on the citadels of ignorance and greed the publications of the bureau are of great practical value to the people of the united states illustration notable protectors of wild life 1 madison grant secretary and chairman executive committee new york zoological society henry fairfield osborn president new york zoological society john f lacey exmember of congress author of the lacey bird law william dutcher founder and president national association of audubon societies dr palmer is a man of incalculable value to the cause of protection no call for advice is too small to receive his immediate attention no fight is too hot and no dangerpoint too remote to keep him from the fray wherever the army of destruction is making a particularly dangerous fight to repeal good laws and turn back the wheels of progress there will he be found as the warfare grows more intense congress may find it necessary to enlarge the fighting force of the biological survey the work that has been done by the bureau in determining the economic value or lack of value of our most important species of insectivorous birds has been worth millions to the agricultural interests of the united states through it we know where we stand the reasons why we need to strive for protection can be expressed in figures and percentages and it seems to me that they leave the american people no option but to protect state game commissionseach of our states and each province of canada maintains either a state game commission of several persons one commissioner or a state game warden all such officers are officially charged with the duty of looking after the general welfare of the game and other wild life of their respective states theoretically one of the chief duties of a state game commission is to initiate new legislative bills that are necessary and advocate their translation into law the official standing of most game commissioners is such that they can successfully do this in 1909 governor hughes of new york went so far as to let it be known that he would sign no new game bill that did not meet the approval of state game commissioner james s whipple as a general working principle and quite aside from mr whipple that was wrong because even a state game commissioner is not necessarily infallible or always on the right side of every wildlife question as a rule state commissioners and state wardens are keenly alive to the needs of their states in new game protective legislation and a large percentage of the best existing laws are due to their initiative often however their usefulness is limited by the trammels of public office and there are times when such officers can not be too aggressive without the risk of arousing hostile influences and handicapping their own departmental work for this reason it is often advisable that bills which propose great and drastic reforms and which are likely to become stormcenters should originate outside the commissioners office and be pushed by men who are perfectly free to abide the fortunes of open warfare it should be distinctly understood however that lobbying in behalf of wildlife measures is an important part of the legitimate duty of every state game commissioner and is a most honorable calling illustration notable protectors of wild life ii edward howe forbush massachusetts state ornithologist t gilbert pearson secretary national association of audubon societies john b burnham president american game protective and propagation association ernest napier president fish and game commission of new jersey of the many strong and aggressive state game commissions that i would like to mention in detail space permits the naming of only a very few by way of illustration new yorkthanks to the great conservation governor of this state john a dix the year 1911 saw our forest fish and game business established on an ideal business basis realizing the folly of requiring a single man to manage those three great interests and render to each the attention that it deserves and requires by a wellstudied legislative act a state conservation commission was created consisting of three commissioners one for each of the three great natural departments these are salaried officers who devote their entire time to their work and are properly equipped with assistants the state force of game wardens now consists of 125 picked men each on a salary of 900 per year and through a rigid system of daily reports inaugurated by john b burnham the activities and results of each warden promptly become known in detail at headquarters fortunately new york contains a very large number of true sportsmen who are ever ready to come forward in support of every great measure for wildlife protection the spirit of real protection runs throughout the state and in time i predict that it will result in a great recovery of the native game of the commonwealth that will be after we have stopped all shooting of upland game birds and shore birds for about eight years even the pinnated grouse could be successfully introduced over onethird of the state if the people would have it so it was our great body of conscientious sportsmen who made possible the bayneblauvelt law and the new codification of the game laws of the state tennesseeclearly honorable mention belongs to the unsalaried state commissioner of tennessee col jh acklen than whom says dr palmer there is no more active and enthusiastic game protectionist in this country whatever has been accomplished in that state is due to his activity and public spirit col acklen who is now president of the national association of game commissioners is a prominent lawyer and enjoys the distinction of being the only commissioner in the country who not only serves without pay but also defrays a large part of the expenses of game protection out of his own pocket surely the commonwealth of tennessee will not long permit this unsupported condition of such a game commissioner to endure that state has a wild fauna worth preserving for her sons and grandsons and it is inconceivable that the funds vitally necessary to this public service can not be found alabamai cite the case of alabama because in view of its position in a group of states that until recently have cared little about game protection it may be regarded as an unusual case commissioner john h wallace jr has evolved order out of chaosand something approaching a reign of law out of the absence of law today the state of alabama stands as an example of what can be accomplished by and through one clearheaded determined man who is right and knows that he is right new jerseyalabama reminds one of new jersey and of state game commissioner ernest napier i have seen him on the firingline and i know that his strong devotion to the interests of the wild life of his state his determination to protect it at all costs and his resistless confidence in asking for what is right have made him a power for good the state legislature believes in him and enacts the laws that he says are right and necessary he serves without salary and gives to the state time labor and money it is a pleasure to work with such a man in 1912 commissioner napier won a pitched battle with the makers of automatic and pump guns both shotguns and rifles and debarred all those weapons from use in hunting in new jersey unless satisfactorily reduced to two shots massachusettsthe state of massachusetts is fortunate in the possession of a very fine corps of ornithologists nature lovers sportsmen and leading citizens who on all questions affecting wild life occupy high ground and are not afraid to maintain it it would be a pleasure to write an entire chapter on this subject the record of the massachusetts army of the defense is both an example and an inspiration to the people of other states not only is the cause of protection championed by the state game commission but it also receives constant and powerful support from the state board of agriculture which maintains on its staff mr eh forbush as state ornithologist the birdprotection publications of the board are of great economic value and they are also an everlasting credit to the state the very latest is a truly great wildlifeprotection volume of 607 pages by mr forbush entitled game birds wildfowl and shore birds it is a publication most damaging to the cause of the army of destruction and i heartily wish a million copies might be printed and placed in the hands of lawmakers and protectors the fight last winter and spring for a nosaleofgame law was the gettysburg for massachusetts the voice of the people was heard in no uncertain tones and the destroyers were routed all along the line the leaders in that struggle on the protection side were eh forbush william p wharton dr george w field edward n goding lyman e hurd ralph holman rev wm r lord and salem d charles with such leaders and such supporters any wildlife cause can be won anywhere pennsylvaniathe case of pennsylvania is rather peculiar as yet there is no large and resistless organized body of real sportsmen to rally to the support of the state game commission in great causes as is the case in new york as a result with a paltry fund of only 20000 for annual maintenance and much opposition from hunters and farmers the situation is far from satisfactory fortunately dr joseph kalbfus secretary of the commission and chief executive officer is a man of indomitable courage and determination but for this state of mind he would ere this have given up the fight for the hunters license law of one dollar per year which has been bitterly opposed by a very aggressive and noisy group of gunners who do not seem to know that they are grievously misled fortunately commissioner john m phillips of pittsburgh is the ardent supporter of dr kalbfus and a vigorous fighter for justice to wild life he devotes to the cause a great amount of time and effort and in addition to serving without salary he pays all his campaign expenses out of his own pocket his only recompense for all this is the sincere admiration of his friends and the consciousness of having done his full duty toward the wild life and the people of his native state the state audubon societiesit is impossible to estimate the full value of the influence and work of the state audubon societies of the united states thus far these societies exist in thirtynine states from the beginning their efforts have tended especially toward the preservation of the nongame birds and it is well that the song and other insectivorous birds have thus been specially championed unfortunately however if that policy is pursued exclusively it leaves 154 very important species of game birds practically at the mercy of the army of destruction it would seem that the time has come when all audubon societies should take up as a part of their work active cooperation in helping to save the game birds from extermination the national organizations of new york city on january 1 1895 the united states of america contained so far as i am aware not one organization of national scope which was devoting any large amount of its resources and activities to the protection of wild life at that time the former activities of the aou committee on bird protection had lapsed today the city of new york contains six national organizations and it is now a great center of nationwide activities in behalf of preservation furthermore these activities are steadily growing and securing practical results the new york zoological societyin 1895 there was born into the world a scientific organization having for its second declared object the preservation of our native animals it was the first scientific society or corporation ever formed so far as i am aware having a specifically declared object of that kind it owes its existence and its presence in the field of wildlife conservation to the initiative and persistence of mr madison grant and prof henry fairfield osborn for sixteen years these two officers have worked together virtually as one man it is not strange to find a sportsman like mr grant promoting the wildlife cause but it is a fact well worthy of note that of all the zoologists of the world professor osborn is the only one of real renown who has actively and vigorously engaged in this cause and taken a place in the front rank of the defenders mr grants influence on the protection cause has been strong and farreachingfar more so than the majority of his own friends are aware he has promoted important protectionist causes from alaska to louisiana and newfoundland and helped to win many important victories the boone and crockett clubthis organization of big game sportsmen was founded in 1885 and is the oldest of its kind in the united states its members always have supported the cause of protection by law and by the making of game preserves in all this work mr george bird grinnell for twentyfive years editor of forest and stream has been an important factor as stated elsewhere the clubs written and unwritten code of ethics in biggame hunting is very strict in course of time a committee on game protection was formed and it actively entered that field illustration notable protectors of wild life iii joseph kalbfus chief game protector and secretary pennsylvania board of game commissioners john m phillips member pennsylvania board of game commissioners edward a mcilhenny founder of wildfowl preserves in louisiana charles willis ward founder of wildfowl preserves in louisiana the national association of audubon societiesthis organization was founded by william dutcher in 1902 and in 1906 it was endowed to the extent of 322000 by the bequest of albert wilcox subsequent endowments together with the annual contributions of members and friends now give the association an annual income of 60000 it maintains eight widelyseparated field agents and lecturers and forty special game wardens of bird refuges it maintains secretary t gilbert pearson and a number of other good men constantly on the firingline and these forces have achieved many valuable results after years of stress and struggle it now seems almost certain that this organization will save the two white egretsproducers of the white badge of crueltyto the bird fauna of the united states as in a similar manner it has saved the gulls terns and other sea birds of our lakes and coast line this splendid organization is one of the monuments to william dutcher more than two years ago he was stricken with paralysis and now sits in an invalids chair at his home in plainfield new jersey his mind is clear and his interest in wildlife protection is keen but he is unable to speak or to write while he was active he was one of the most resourceful and fearless champions of the cause of the vanishing birds to him the farmers of america owe ten times more than they ever will know and a thousand times more than they ever will repay either to him or to his cause the campfire club of americaalthough founded in 1897 this organization did not as an organization actively enter the field of protection until 1909 since that time its work has covered a wide field and enlisted the activities of many of its members in order to provide a permanent fund for its work each year the club members pay special annual dues that are devoted solely to the wildlife cause the committee on game protective legislation and preserves is a strong hardworking body and it has rendered good service in the lines of activity named in its title the american game protective and propagation associationthis is the youngest protective organization of national scope having been organized in 1911 its activities are directed by john b burnham for five years chief game protector of the state of new york and a man thoroughly conversant with the business of protection the organization is financed chiefly by means of a large annual fund contributed by several of the largest companies engaged in manufacturing firearms and ammunition whose directors feel that the time has come when it is both wise and necessary to take practical measures to preserve the remnant of american game already the activities of this organization cover a wide range and it has been particularly active in enlisting support for the weeks bill for the federal protection of migratory birds the wild life protective association came into existence in 1910 rather suddenly for the purpose of promoting the cause of the bayne nosaleofgame bill and other measures it raised the fund that met the chief expenses of that campaign since that time it has taken an important part in three other hotly contested campaigns in other states two of which were successful at the present moment and throughout the future these new york organizations need large sums of money with which to meet the legitimate expenses of active campaigns for great measures they need some money from outside the state of new york too much of the burden of national campaigning has been and is being left to be borne by the people of new york city this policy is growing monotonous there is every reason why chicago st louis cincinnati pittsburgh cleveland philadelphia baltimore and boston should each year turn 100000 into the hands of these wellequipped and well managed national organizations whose officers know how to get results all over our country such organizations as these do not exist in other cities and this is very unfortunate new orleans should be a center of protectionist activity for the south san francisco for the pacific slope and chicago for the middle west will they not become so two independent workersat the western edge of the delta of the mississippi there have arisen two men who loom up into prominence at an outpost of the army of defense which they themselves have established for what they already have done in the creation of wildfowl preserves in louisiana edward a mcilhenny and charles willis ward deserve the thanks of the american peopleatlarge an account of their splendid activities and the practical results already secured will be found in chapter xxxviii on private game preserves and in the story of marsh island already the home of these gentlemen avery island louisiana has become an important center of activity in wildlife protection chapter xxvii how to make a new game law the line of actionin the face of a calamity the saving of life and property and the check of fire and flood depends upon good judgment and quick action at the critical moment in emergencies the slow and academic method will not serve it is the run the jump the short cut and the violent method that saves life if a woman is drowning the sensible man does not wait for an introduction to her nor does he run to an acquaintance to borrow his boat or stop to put on a collar and necktie he seizes the first boat that he can find and breaks its lock and chain if necessary or failing that he plunges in without one when he reaches the imperiled party he doesnt say will you kindly let me save you he seizes her by the hair and tries to keep her head above water without ceremony that is today the condition and the treatment necessary regarding our remnant of wild life we are compelled to act quickly directly and even violently at times if we save anything worth while there is no time to depend upon the academic education of the public by the seductive illustrated lecture on birds or the article about the habits of mammals those methods are all well enough in their places but we must not depend upon them in emergencies like the present for they do not pass laws or arrest lawbreakers give the public all of that material that you can supply and the more the better but for heavens sake do not depend upon the spread of birdlore education to stop the work of the gamehogs if you do all the wild life will be destroyed while the educational work is going on often you can educate a gunner and make him a protectionist but you never can do it by showing him pictures of birds he needs strong reasoning and exhortation not birdlore today it is necessary to employ the most direct forceful and at times even rude methods where slaughtering cannot be stopped by moral suasion it must be stopped with a hickory club the thing to do is to get results and get them quickly before it is too late if the business section of a town is burning down no one goes into the suburbs to lecture on architecture or exhibit pictures of fire apparatus the rush is for water fireengines redblooded men and dynamite when the birds all around you are being shot to death by poachers who fear not god nor regard man and you need help to stop it on the instant run to your neighbors house and ring his bell if he fails to hear the bell pound on his door until you jar the whole house when he comes down halfdressed blinking and rubbing his eyes shout at him come out your birds are all being shot to pieces are they he will say but what can i do about it i cant help it im no game warden put on your clothes get your shotgun and come out and drive off the killing gang but what good will that do they will come back again not if we do our duty we must have them arrested and appear against them in court but says the sleepy citizen that wont do much good the laws are not strict enough and besides they are not well enforced even as they are then lets make it our business to see that the present laws are enforced and go to our members of the legislature and have them pass some stronger laws and this brings me to a very important subject how to pass a new law we venture to say that the average citizen little realizes how possible it is to secure the passage of a law that is clearly necessary for the better protection of wild life and forests because of this and of the necessity for exact knowledge i shall here set down specific instructions on this subject the personal equationone determined man can secure the passage of a good law provided he is reasonably intelligent and sufficiently determined the man who starts a movement must make up his mind to follow it up direct its fortunes stay with it when the storms of opposition beat upon it and never give up until it is signed by the governor he must be willing to sacrifice his personal convenience many of his pleasures and work when his friends are asleep or pleasuring in working for the protection of wild life there is one mighty and unfailing source of consolation it is this your cause always gains in strength and the cause of the destroyers always loses strength the choice of a causebe broadminded do not rush to the legislature with a demand for a law to permit the taking of bullheads with junebugs in the creeks of your township or to give your county a specially early open season on quail in order that your boy may try his new gun before he goes back to college dont propose any local legislation for in progressive states local game legislation is coming strongly into disfavorjust as it should legislate for your whole state and nothing less do not bother your legislature with a trivial bill choose a cause that is worth while to grown men and it shall be well with you it takes no more time to pass a large bill than a small one and big men prefer to be identified with big measures before you have a bill drawn advise with men whose opinions are worth having if the end you have in mind is a great and good one go ahead whether you secure support in advance or not if the needs of the hour clearly demand the measure go ahead even though you start absolutely alone a good measure never goes far without attracting company drafting a billas a rule the members of a legislative body do not have time to draft bills on subjects that are new or strange to them a short bill is easily prepared by your own representative but a lengthy bill covering a serious reform is a different matter hire a lawyer to draft the bill for you a really good lawyer will not charge much for drafting a bill that is to benefit the public and grind no private axe but if the bill is long and requires long study even the good citizen must charge something your bill must fully recognize existing laws it must be either prohibitory or permissive which means that it can say what shall not be done or else that which may be done according to law all other acts being forbidden your lawyer must decide which form is best for my part i greatly prefer the prohibitive form as being the stronger and more impressive of the two i think it is the province of the law to forbid the destruction of wild life and forests under penalties penaltiesevery law should provide a penalty for its infringement but the penalty should not be out of all proportion to the offense it is just as unwise to impose a fine of one dollar for killing songbirds for food as it is to provide for a fine of three hundred dollars a fine that is too small fails to impress the prisoner and it begets contempt for the law and the courts a fine that is altogether too high is apt to be set aside by the court as excessive in my opinion the best fines for wild life slaughter would be as follows shooting netting or trapping songbirds and other nongame birds each bird 5 to 25 killing game birds out of season each bird 10 to 50 selling game contrary to law each offense 100 to 200 dynamiting fish 100 to 200 seining or netting game fishes 50 to 200 shooting birds with unfair weapons 10 to 100 killing an egret carolina parakeet or whooping crane 100 to 200 killing a mountain sheep or antelope anywhere in the us 500 killing an elk contrary to law 50 killing a female deer or fawn without horns each offense 50 trapping a grizzly bear for its skin 100 for killing a man by mistake the fine should be 500 payable in five annual instalments to the court for the family of the victim whenever fines are not paid the convicted party should be sentenced to imprisonment at hard labor at the rate of onehalf day for each dollar of the fine imposed and a sentence at hard labor should be the first option of the court many a rich and reckless poacher snaps his fingers at fines but a sentence to hard labor would strike terror to the heart of the most brazen of them to all such men labor is the twin terror to death the introduction of a billmuch wisdom is called for in the selection of legislative champions for wildlife bills it is possible to state here only the leading principles involved of course it is best to look for an introducer within the political party that is in the majority a man who has many important bills on his hands is bound to give his best attention to his own pet measures and it is best to choose a man who is not already overloaded if a man has a host of enemies pass him by by all means choose a man whose high character and good name will be a tower of strength to your cause and if necessary wait for him to make up his mind mr lawrence w trowbridge waited three long and anxious weeks in the hope that hon george a blauvelt would finally consent to champion the bayne bill in the new york assembly at last mr blauvelt consented to take it up and the time spent in waiting for his decision was a grand investment he was the man of all men to pilot that bill through the assembly very often the quiet man of a legislative body is a good man to champion a new and drastic measure the quiet man who makes up his mind to take hold of a hard bill to pass often astonishes the natives by his ability to get results representative john f lacey of iowa made his name a household word all over the united states by the quiet steady tireless and finally resistless energy with which for three long years in congress he worked for the lacey bird bill for years his colleagues laughed at him and cheerfully voted down his bill but he persisted his cause steadily gained in strength and his final triumph laid the axe at the root of a thousand crimes against wild life throughout the length and breadth of this land he rendered the people of america a service that entitles him to our everlasting gratitude and remembrance after the introduction of a billas soon as a bill is introduced it is referred to a committee to be examined and reported upon if there is oppositionand to every bill that really does something worth while there always is oppositionthen there is a hearing the committee appoints a day when the friends and foes of the bill assemble and express their views the week preceding a hearing is your busy week you must plan your campaign down to the smallest details pick the men whom you wish to have speak for ten minutes each on the various parts of your bill and divide the topics and the time between them call upon the friends of the bill in various portions of the state to attend and say something go up with a strong body of fine men have as many organizations represented as you possibly can the organizations represent the great mass of people and the voters also when you reach the hearing hand to your bills champion who will be floor manager for your side a clear and concise list of your speakers carefully arranged and stating whos who that being done you have only to fill your own ten minutes and afterward enjoy the occasion the value of accuracyit is unnecessary to say in working for a billalways be sure of your facts never let your opponents catch you tripping in accuracy of statement if you make one serious error your enemies will turn it against you to the utmost better understate facts than overstate them this shrewd old world quickly recognizes the careful conservative man whose testimony is so true and so rockfounded that no assaults can shake it legislators are quick to rely on the words and opinions of the man who can safely be trusted if your enemies try to overwhelm you with extravagant statements that are unfair to your cause the chances are that the men who judge between you will recognize them by their earmarks and discount them accordingly work with memberssometimes a subject that is put before a legislative body is so new and the thing proposed is so drastic it becomes necessary to take measures to place a great many facts before each member of the body under such circumstances the member naturally desires to be shown the cleanest and finest campaigning for a reform measure is that in which both sides deal with facts rather than with personal importunities with a good cause in hand it is a pleasure to prepare concise statements of facts and conditions from which a legislator may draw logical conclusions whenever a bill can be won through in that way game protection work becomes a delight in all important new measures affecting the rights and the property of the whole people of a state the conscientious legislator wishes to know how the people feel about it when you tell him that the wild life belongs to the whole people of the state and this bill is in their interest he needs to know for certain that your proposition is true sometimes there is only one way in which he can be fully convinced and that is by the people of his district then it becomes necessary to send out a general alarm and call upon the people to write to their representatives and express their views give them in printed matter the latest facts in the case forecast the future as you think it should be forecast then demand that the men and women who are interested do write to their senators and assemblyman and express their views in their own way let there be no machine letters sent out all ready for signature for such letters are a waste of effort and belong in the waste baskets to which they are quickly consigned the members of legislative bodies hate them and rightly too they want to hear from men who can think for themselves give reasons of their own and express their desires in their own way the press and the newspapersit is impossible to overestimate the influence of the newspapers and the periodical press in general in the protection of wild life but for their sympathy their support and their independent assaults upon the army of destruction our game species would nearly all of them have been annihilated long ago editors are sympathetic and responsive goodcitizens as keenly sensitive regarding their duties as any of the rest of us are and from the earliest times of protection they have been on the firing line helping to beat back the destroyers it is indeed a rare sight to see an editor giving aid comfort or advice to the enemy i can not recall more than a score of articles that i have seen or heard of during thirty years in this field that opposed the cause of wild life protectionk at this moment for instance i bear in particularly grateful remembrance the active campaign work of the following newspapers footnote k just one hour after the above paragraph was written a long telegram from san francisco advised me that the examiner of that city had begun an active and aggressive campaign for the sale of all kinds of game the new york times the new york tribune the new york herald the new york globe the new york mail and express the new york world the new york sun the springfield mass republican the chicago interocean the san francisco call the rochester union and advertiser the victoria colonist the brooklyn standardunion the new york evening post the new york press the buffalo news the minneapolis journal the pittsburgh indexappeal the st louis globedemocrat the philadelphia north american the utica observer the washington star these magazines have done good service in the cause and some of them have spent many years on the firing line forest and stream the american field field and stream recreation old and new rod and gun in canada in the open sports afield western field outdoor life shields magazine sportsmans review outing colliers weekly the independent country life outdoor world bird lore in campaigning always appeal for the help of the newspapers if there are no private axes to grind they help generously the weekly journals are of value but the monthlies are printed so long in advance of their dates of issue that they seldom move fast enough to keep abreast of the procession their mechanical limitations are many and serious every newspaper likes exclusive news letters and articles on that basis they will print about all the live matter that you can furnish but at the same time the important news of the campaign must be sent to the press broadcast in the form of printed slips all ready for the foreman many of these are never used but the others are and it pays the news in every slip must be vouched for by the sender or it will not be used often it will appear as a letter signed by the sender which is all right only the news is most effective when printed without a signature do not count on the associated press because its peculiar demands render it almost impossible for it to be utilized in game protection work how to meet oppositionthere is no rule for the handling of opposition that is fair and open for opposition that is unfair and underhanded there is one powerful weaponpublicity the american people love fair play and there is nothing so fatal to an unfair fighter as a searchlight turned full on him without fear and without mercy if it is reliably and persistently reported that some citizen who ought to be on the right side has for some dark reason become active on the wrong side print the reports in a large newspaper and ask him publicly if they are true if the reports are false he can quickly come out in a letter and say so and end the matter if they are true the public will soon know it and act accordingly eternal vigilancethe progress of a bill must be watched by some competent person from day to day and finally from hour to hour i know one bill that was saved from defeat only because its promoter dragged it almost by force out of the hands of a tardy clerk and accompanied it in person to the senate where it was passed in the last hour of a session a bill should not be left to a long slumber in the drawer of a committee such delays nearly always are dangerous signing the billthe promoter of a great measure always seeks the sympathy of the chief executive early in the day but he should not make the diplomatic error of trying to exact promises or pledges in advance good judges do not give away their decisions in advance because a chief executive remarks after a bill has been sent to him for signing that he cannot approve it it is no reason to give up in despair many an executive approval has been snatched at the last moment as a brand from the burning ask for a hearing before the bill is acted upon at the hearing and before it and after the people who wish the bill to become a law must express themselvesby letter by telegram and by appeal in person if the governor becomes convinced that an overwhelming majority of his people desire him to sign the bill he will sign it even though personally he is opposed to it the hall mark of a good governor is a spirit of obedience to the will of the great majority not until your bill has been signed by the governor are you ready to go home with a quiet mind take off your armor and put your ear to the telephone while you hear some one say as your only rewardwell done good and faithful servant as to creditdo not count upon receiving any credit for what you do in the cause of game protection outside the narrow circle of your own family and your nearest friends this is a busy world and the human mind flits like a restless bird from one subject to another the men who win campaigns are forgotten by the general public in a few hours there is nothing more fickle or more fleeting than the bubble called popular applause judging by the experiences of great men i should say that it has no substance whatever the most valuable reward of the man who fights in a great cause and helps to win victories is the profound satisfaction that comes to every good citizen who bravely does his whole duty and leaves the world better than he found it without the slightest thought of gallery applause chapter xxviii new laws needed a rollcall of the states the principles of wildlife protection and encouragement are now so firmly established as to leave little room for argument regarding their value when they are set forth before the people of any given state the only question is of willingness to do the right thing of duty or a defiance of duty of good citizenship or the reign of selfishness men who do not wish to do their duty purposely befog great issues by noisy talk and tiresome academic discussions of trivial details and such men are the curse and scourge of reform movements there are a very few persons who foolishly assert that there are too many game laws it is entirely wrong for any person to make such a statement for it tends to promote harmful error the fact that our laws are too lenient or are not fully enforced is no excuse for denouncing their purposes we have all along been too timid too self indulgent and too much afraid of hurting the feelings of the gamehogs give me the power to make the game laws of any state or province and i will guarantee to save the nonmigratory wild life of that region i will not only make adequate laws but i will also provide means men and penalties by which they will be enforced it is easy and simple for men who are not afraid i have been at considerable pains to analyze the game laws of each state ascertain their shortcomings and give a list of the faults that need correction by new legislation it has required no profound wisdom to do this because the principles involved are so plain that any intelligent schoolboy fifteen years old can master them in one hour i have performed this task hopefully in the belief that in many states the real issues have not been plainly put before the people hereafter no state shall destroy its wild life through ignorance of the laws that would preserve it let no man say that it is too late to save the wild life for excepting the deadandgone species that is not true let no man say that we can not save the wild life by law for that is not true either as long as laws are lax even lawabiding people will take advantage of them there are millions of men who think it is right to kill all the game that the law allows there are thousands of women who think it is right to wear aigrettes as long as the law permits their sale and yet if we are resolute and diligent there is plenty of hope for the future during the past three years to go no farther back we have seen the whole state of new york swept clean of the traffic in native wild game by the bayne law and of the traffic in wild birds plumage on womens hats through the dutcher law today in this state we find ninetynine women out of every one hundred wearing flowers and laces and plush and satin on their hats instead of the heads bodies and feathers of wild birds that were the regular thing until three years ago the change has been a powerful commentary on the value of good laws for the protection of wild life the dutcher law has caused the plumage of wild birds almost wholly to disappear from the state of new york we shall here point out the plain duty of each state and then it will be up to them individually to decide whether they can stand the bloodtest or not a state or a nation can be ungentlemanly unfair or mean just the same as an individual no state has a right to maintain shambles for the slaughter of migratory game or song birds that belong in part to sister states every state holds its migratory bird life in trust for the benefit of the people of the nation at large a state is just as responsible for its treatment of wild life as any individual and it is time to open books of account it is robbery as well as murder for any southern state to slaughter the robins of the northern states where no robins may be killed no southern gentleman can permit such doings after the crime has been pointed out to him in the north the men who are caught shooting robins are instantly haled to court and fined or imprisoned if we of the north should kill for food the mockingbirds that visit us the people of the south instantly would brand us as monsters of greed and meanness and they would be perfectly justified in so doing let us at least be honest in agreeing upon a state of fact as the lawyers say whether we act sensibly and mercifully or not just so long as there remains in this land of ours a fauna of game birds and the gunners of onehalf the states are allowed to dictate the laws for the slaughter of it just so long will our present protection remain utterly absurd and criminally inadequate look at these absurdities new york new jersey and many other northern states rigidly prohibit the late winter and spring shooting of waterfowl and shore birds and limit the bag north carolina south carolina florida and other southern states not only slaughter wild fowl and shore birds all winter and spring without limit but several of them kill certain nongame birds besides all the northern states protect the robin for the good that it does but in north carolina tennessee mississippi louisiana and some other southern states thousands of robins are shot for food minnesota has stopped spring shooting but her sister state on the south iowa obstinately refuses to do so the united states at largethere are two great measures that should be carried into effect by the governing body of the united states one is the enactment of a law providing federal protection for all migratory birds and canada and mexico should be induced to join with the united states in an international treaty to that effect the other necessary measure is the passage of a joint resolution of congress declaring every national forest and forest reserve also a game preserve and general sanctuary for wild life in which there shall be no hunting or killing of wild creatures of any kind save predatory animals the tendency of the timesand the universal slaughter of wild life on this continentpoint straight as an arrow flies in that direction soon or late we have got to come to it if congress does not take the initiatory steps the people will such a consummation is necessary it is justified by common sense and the inexorable logic of the situation and when done it will be right the time was when the friends of wild life did not dare speak of this subject in washington save in whispers that was in the days when the appalachian park bill could not be passed and when there were angry mutterings and even curses leveled against gifford pinchot and the forestry bureau because so many national forests were being set aside that was in the days when a few western sheepmen thought that they owned the whole rocky mountains without having bought them today the american people have grown accustomed to the idea of having the resources of the public domain saved and conserved for the benefit of the millions rather than lavished upon a favored few today it is perfectly safe to talk about making every national forest a first class wildlife sanctuary and it is up to the people to request congress to take that action at once the weeks bill the anthony bill and the mclean bill now before congress to provide federal protection for migratory birds are practically identical all three are good bills and it matters not which one finally becomes a law whichever is put forward finally for passage should provide federal protection for all migratory birds that ever enter the united states alaska or porto rico why favor the duck and leave the robin to its fate or vice versa it will be just as easy to do this task by wholes as by halves the time to hesitate to feel timid or to be afraid of the other fellow has gone by today the millions of honest and seriousminded americans are ready to back the most thorough and most drastic policy because that has become the most necessary and the best policy furthermore it is the only policy worthy of serious consideration some of our states have done rather well in wildlife protectionconsidering the absurdity of our national policy as a whole others have done indifferently and some have been and still are very remiss here is where we intend to hew to the line and without fear or favor set forth the standing of each state according to its merits or its lack of merits in a lifeordeath matter such as now confronts us regarding the wild life of our country it is time to speak plainly in the following call of the states the glaring deficiencies in state game laws will be set forth in detail in order that the sore spots may be exposed to the view of the doctors conditions will be represented as they exist at the end of the summer of 1912 and it is to be hoped that these faults soon may be corrected a rollcall of the states alabama it is a satisfaction to be able to open this list with the name of a state that is entitled to a medal of honor for game protection in this particular field of progress and enlightenment the state of alabama is the pioneer state of the south new york now occupies a similar position in the north but new york is an older state and stronger in her general love of nature the attainment of advanced protection in any southern state is a very different matter from what it is in the north five years ago alabama set her house in order the slaughter of song and insectivorous birds has been so far stopped as any southern state can stop it unaided by the federal government and those birds are recognized and treated as the farmers best friends the absurd system of attempted protection through county laws has been abandoned the sale of game has been stopped and since that stoppage quail have increased the trapping and export of game have ceased and wild turkeys and woodcock are now increasing it is unlawful to kill or capture nongame birds bag limits have been imposed but the bag limit laws are all too liberal and should be reduced a hunters license law is in force and the department of game and fish is selfsupporting night hunting is prohibited and female deer may not be killed a comprehensive warden system has been provided as yet however alabama permits the shooting of waterfowl to march 15 which is too late by one and onehalf months the use of automatic and pump guns in hunting should be suppressed there should be a limit of two deer per year and killing should be restricted to deer with horns not less than three inches long the story of game protection in alabama began in 1907 prior to that time the slaughter of wild life was very great it is known that enormous numbers of quail were annually killed by negro farm hands who hunted at least three days each week regardless of work to be done the slaughter of quail wild ducks woodcock doves robins and snipe was described as nauseating the change that has been wrought since 1907 is chiefly due to the efforts of one man alabama owes her standing today to the admirable qualities of john h wallace jr her game and fish commissioner author of the states policy in wildlife conservation his broadmindedness his judgment and his success make him a living object lesson of the power of one determined man in the conservation of wild life commissioner wallace is an ardent supporter of the weeks and anthony bills for federal protection and as a lawyer of the south he believes there is no constitutional inhibition against federal legislation for the protection of birds of passage alaska the sale of game must be absolutely prohibited forever the slaughter of big game by indians miners and prospectors should now be limited and strictly regulated by law on rational lines the slaughter of walrus for ivory and hides both in the alaskan and russian waters of bering sea should be totally prohibited for ten years the gamewarden service should be quadrupled in number of wardens and in general effectiveness the gamewarden service should be supplied with two seagoing vessels independent for patrol work the bag limit on hoofed game is 50 per cent too large to accomplish these ends congress should annually appropriate 50000 for the protection of wild life in alaska the present amount 15000 is very inadequate and the great wildlife interests at stake amply justify the larger amount it is now time for alaska to make substantial advances in the protection of her wild life it is no longer right nor just for indians miners and prospectors to be permitted by law to kill all the big game they please whenever they please the indolent and often extortionate indians of alaskawho now demand big money for every service they performare not so valuable as citizens that they should be permitted to feed riotously upon moose and cow moose at that until that species is exterminated miners and prospectors are valuable citizens but that is no reason why they should forever be allowed to live upon wild game any more than that hungry prospectors in our rocky mountains should be allowed to kill cattle alaska and its resources do not belong to the very few people from the states who have gone there to make their fortunes and get out again as quickly as possible the quicker the public mind north of wrangel is disabused of that idea the better its game belongs to the people of this nation of ninetyodd millions and it is a safe prediction that the ninety millions will not continue to be willing that the miners prospectors and indians shall continue to live on moose meat and caribou tongues in order to save bacon and beef mr frank e kleinschmidt said to me that at sand point alaska he saw eightytwo caribou tongues brought in by an indian and sold at fifty cents each while according to all accounts most of the bodies of the slaughtered animals became a loss governor clark has recommended in his annual report for 1911 that the protection now enjoyed by the giant brown bear ursus middendorffi on kadiak island be removed for the benefit of settlers and their stock it goes without saying that no one proposes that predatory wild animals shall be permitted to retard the development of any wild country that is required by civilized man all we ask in this matter is that as in the case of the onceproposed slaughter of sealions on the pacific coast the necessity of the proposed slaughter shall be fully and adequately proven before the killing begins it is fair to insist that the sealion episode shall not be repeated on kadiak island the big game of alaska can not long endure against a limit of two moose three mountain sheep three caribou and six deer per year per man at that rate the moose and sheep soon will disappear the limit should be one moose two sheep two caribou and four deerunless we are willing to dedicate the alaskan big game to commercialism no sportsman needs a larger bag than the revised schedule and commercialists should not be allowed to kill big game anywhere at any time let us bear in mind the fact that alaska is being throughly opened up to the man with a gun here is the latest evidence from the new circular of an outfitter i will have plenty of good horses and good competent and courteous guides also other camp attendants if desired my intention is to establish permanently at that point as i believe it is the gateway to the finest and about the last of the great game countries of north america the road is open the packtrain is ready the guides are waiting go on and slay the remnant arizona the bandtailed pigeons and all nongame birds should immediately be given protection and a salaried warden system should be established under a commissioner whose term is not less than four years the use of automatic and pump guns in hunting should be prohibited spring shooting should be prohibited arizona has good reason to be proud of her uptodate position in the ranks of the best gameprotecting states no other state or territory of her age ever has made so good a showing of protective laws the enactment of laws to cover the points mentioned above would leave little to be desired in arizona that state has a bird fauna well worth protecting and game wardens are extremely necessary arkansas the enforcement of game laws should be placed in charge of a salaried commissioner spring shooting of wildfowl should be stopped at once a reasonable close season should be provided for water fowl and swans should be protected throughout the year a baglimit law should be enacted a force of game wardens salaried and unsalaried should at once be created the killing of female deer and the hounding of deer should be stopped no buck deer should be shot unless horns three inches long are seen before firing a hunters license law is necessary and the fees should go to the support of the game protection department the local exemptions in favor of market hunters in mississippi county should be repealed it appears that in arkansas the laws for the protection and increase of wild life are by no means up to the mark at this moment arkansas is next to florida the rearmost of all our states in wildlife protection awake arkansas consider the peril that threatens your fauna the sunk lands in your northeastern corner along the st francis river are the greatest wildfowl refuge anywhere in the mississippi valley between the gulf coast of louisiana and the breedinggrounds of minnesota a duty to the nation devolves upon you to protect the migratory waterfowl that visit your great bird refuge from the automatic and pump guns of the pothunters who shoot for northern markets and kill all that they can kill protect those sunken lands confer a boon on all the people of the mississippi valley by making that region a bird refuge in fact as well as in name heretofore you have permitted hired market gunners from outside your borders to slaughter the wildfowl of your sunk lands literally by millions and ship them to northern markets with very little benefit to your people it is time for that slaughter to cease dont maintain a duck and goose shambles in mississippi county year after year as north carolina does do unto other states as you would have other states do unto you do not be afraid to pass nine good laws in one act clear your record in the family of states and save your fauna before it is too late it is not fair for you to permit the slaughter of the insectivorous birds that are like the blood of life to the farmer and fruit grower california the sale of all wild game should be forever prohibited the use of automatic and pump shotguns in hunting should be prohibited the killing of pigeons and doves as game and food should be stopped the sage grouse and every other species of bird threatened with extinction should be given ten year close seasons the mule deer if any remain and the columbian blacktailed deer in the southern counties should be accorded a tenyear close season a large state game preserve should be created immediately on or near mount shasta and abundantly stocked with nucleus herds of antelope blacktailed deer bison and elk a suitable preserve in the southern part of the state should be set aside for the dwarf elk as game laws are generally regarded california has on her books a series that look rather good to the eye but which are capable of considerable improvement all along the line the birds and quadrupeds of the golden state are vanishing under that heading a vigorous chapter could be written but space forbids its development here just fancy laws that permit gunning and hunting with dogs from august until januaryonehalf the entire year think of the nesting birds that are disturbed or killed by dogs and gunners after other birds californias wild ducks and geese have been slaughtered to an extent almost beyond belief the splendid sage grouse and the sharptailed grouse are greatly reduced in numbers of her hundreds of thousands of antelope once the cheapest game in the market scarcely a trace remains her mountain sheep and mule deer are almost extinct her grizzly bears are gone the most terrible slaughter ever recorded for automatic guns occurred in glenn county cal on feb 5 1906 when two men whose story was published in outdoor life xvii p 371 april 1906 killed 450 geese in one day and actually bagged 218 of them in one hour every person who has paid attention to game protection on the pacific coast well knows that during the past eight years or more the work of game protection in california has been in a state of frequent turmoil at times the lack of harmony between the state fish and game commission and the sportsmen of the state has been damaging to the interests of wild life and deplorable in the case of warden welch in santa cruz county pernicious politics came near robbing the state of a splendid warden but the courts finally overthrew the overthrowers of mr welch and reinstated him the fish and game commissioners of any state should be broadminded nonpartisan strictly honest and sincere so long as they possess these qualities they deserve and should have the earnest and aggressive support of all sportsmen and all lovers of wild life the remnant of wild life is entitled to a square deal and harmony in the camp of its friends fortunately california has an excellent force of salaried game wardens 82 in all and 577 volunteer wardens serving without salary colorado the state of colorado should instantly stop the sale of native wild game to be used as food it should stop all late winter and spring shooting of native wild birds it should give the sage grouse pinnated grouse and all shore birds a ten year close season remove the dove from the list of game birds and give it a permanent close season it should remove the crane and the swan from the list of game birds in twentyfive short years we have seen in colorado a waste of wild life and the destruction of a living inheritance that has few parallels in history possibly the people of colorado are satisfied with the residuum but some outsiders regard all rocky mountain shambles with a feeling of horror a brief quartercentury ago colorado was a zoological park of grand scenery and big game the scenery remains but of the great wild herds only samples are left and of some species not even that the last bison of colorado were exterminated in lost park by scoundrels calling themselves taxidermists in 1897 of the 200000 mule deer that inhabited routt county and other portions of colorado not enough now remain to make deer hunting interesting a perpetual close season was put on mountain sheep just in time to save a dozen small flocks as seed stock those flocks have been permitted to live and they have bred until now there are perhaps 3500 sheep in the state of elk only a remnant is left now protected for fifteen years the grizzly bear is so thoroughly gone that one is seen only by a rare accident but black bears and pumas are sufficiently numerous to afford fair sport provided the hunter has a fine outfit of dogs horses and guides of pronghorned antelope several bands remain but it is reported that they are steadily diminishing the herds and herders of domestic sheep are blamed for the decrease and i have no doubt they deserve it the sheep and their champions are the implacable enemies of all wild game and before them the game vanishes everywhere the lawmakers of colorado have tried hard to provide adequate statutes for the protection of the wild life of the state in fact i think that no state has put forth greater or more elaborate efforts in that direction for example in 1899 under the leadership of judge dc beaman of denver colorado initiated the more game movement by enacting a very elaborate law providing for the establishment of private game preserves and farms for the breeding of game under state license and the tagging and sale of preservebred game under state supervision illustration bandtailed pigeon often mistaken for the passenger pigeon the rapid slaughter of this species has alarmed the ornithologists of california who now fear its extinction the history of game destruction in colorado is a repetition of the old old storyplenty of laws but a hundred times too many hunters killing the game both according to law and contrary to it and doing it five times as fast as the game could breed that combination can safely be warranted to wipe out the wild life of any country in the world and accomplish it right swiftly as a biggame country colorado is distinctly out of the running her people are too lawless and her frontiersmen are in the main far too selfish to look upon plenteous game without going after it some of these days a new call of the wild will arise in colorado demanding an open season on mountain sheep those who demand it will say what harm will it do to kill a few surplus bucks it will improve the breed and make the herds increase faster by all means have an open season on the colorado bighorn and the british columbia elk it will do them good the excitement of ram slaughter will be good for the females will it not of course they will breed faster after thatwith all the big rams dead any surplus wild life is a public nuisance and should promptly be shot to pieces in colorado there is some desire that estes park should be acquired as a national park and maintained by the government but the strong reasons for this have not yet appeared as yet we have not heard any reason why the state of colorado should not herself take it and make of it a state park and game preserve if done it could be offered as a partial atonement for her wastefulness in throwing away her inheritance of grand game colorado has work to do in the preservation of her remnant of bird life in several respects she is behind the times the present is no time to hesitate or to ask the gunners what they wish to have done about new laws for the saving of the remnant of game the dictates of common sense are plain and inexorable let the lawmakers do their whole duty by the remnant of wild life whether the game killers like it or not the curse of domestic sheep upon game and cattlemuch has been said in print and out of print regarding the extent to which domestic sheep have destroyed the cattle ranges and incidentally many game ranges of the west but the half hath not been told the american people as a whole do not realize that the domestic sheep has driven the domestic steer from the free grass of the wild west with the same speed and thoroughness with which the buffalohunters of the 70s and 80s swept away the bison i have seen hundreds of thousands of acres of what once were beautiful and fertile cattlegrazing lands in montana that has been left by grazing sheep herds looking precisely as if the ground had been shaven with razors and then sandpapered the sheep have driven out the cattle and the price of beef has gone up accordingly neither cattle horses nor wild game can find food on ground that has been grazed over by sheep the following is the testimony of a reliable eye witness mr dillon wallace and the full text appears in his book saddle and camp in the rockies page 169 domestic sheep and sheep herders are the greatest enemies of the antelope as well as of other game animals and birds in the regions where herders take their flocks the ranges over which domestic sheep pasture are denuded of forage and stripped of all growth and antelope will not remain upon a range where sheep have been thus the sheep sweeping clean all before them and leaving the ranges over which they pass unproductive for several succeeding seasons of pasturage for either wild or domestic animals together with the destructive shepherds are the worst enemies at present of utahs wild game particularly of antelope sage hens and grouse in iron county which has already become an extensive sheep region settlers tell us that before the advent of sheep grass grew so luxuriously that a yearling calf lying in it could not be seen not only has the grass here been eaten but the roots tramped out and killed by the hoofs of thousands upon thousands of sheep and now wide areas where not long since grass was so plentiful are as bare and desolate as sandpiles chapter xxix new laws needed in the states continued connecticut the sale of all native wild game regardless of its source should be prohibited at all times enact at once a fiveyear close season law on the remnant of ruffed grouse quail woodcock snipe and all shore birds even in the home of the newest and deadliest autoloading shotgun those guns and pump guns should be prohibited in hunting the enormous bag limits of 35 rail and 50 each per day of plover snipe and shore birds is a crime they should be replaced by a tenyear close season law for all of those species the terms of the game commissioners should be not less than four years like so many other states connecticut has recklessly wasted her wildlife inheritance during the fifteen years preceding the year 1898 the bird life of that state had decreased 75 per cent on march 6 1912 senator geo p mclean of connecticut stated at the hearing held by his committee on forest reservations and the protection of game this fact we have more cover than there was thirty or forty years ago more brush probably but there is not one partridge ruffed grouse today where there were twenty ten years ago first of all connecticut needs a tenyear close season law to save her remnant of shore birds before it is completely annihilated then she needs a bayne law and needs it badly under such a law and the tagging system that it provides the state game wardens would have so strong a grip on the situation that the present unlawful sale of game would be completely stopped halfway measures in preventing the sale of game will not answer already connecticut has wasted thousands of dollars in fruitless efforts to restock her desolated woodlands and farms with quail and to introduce the hungarian partridge but even yet she will not protect her own native species men of connecticut save the last remnants of your native game birds before they are all utterly exterminated within your borders dont ask the killers of game what they will agree to but make the laws what you know they should be if you want a gameless state let the destruction go on as it now is going with 16000 licensed gunners in the field each year and you will surely have it right soon delaware stop all spring shooting at once stop killing shore birds for ten years and protect swans indefinitely enact baglimit laws in very small figures stop the sale of all native wild game regardless of its use by enacting a bayne law enact a resident license law and provide for a force of paid game wardens stop the use of machine shotguns in killing your birds the state of delaware is nearly twenty years behind the times can it be possible that her governor and her people are really satisfied with that position we think not i dare say they are afflicted with apathy and gamehogs the latter can easily back up general apathy to an extent that spells no game laws in one act and at one bold stroke delaware can step out of her position at the rear of the procession of states and take a place in the front rank will she do it we hope so for her present status is unworthy of any rightminded redblooded state this side of the philippines district of columbia the sale of all native wild game regardless of its source should be stopped immediately by the enactment of a complete bayne law if gameshooting within the district is continued on the marshes of the eastern branch and on the potomac river common decency demands the enactment of baglimit laws and long closeseason laws of the most modern pattern just why it is that gross abuses against wild life have so long been tolerated in the territorial center of the american nation remains to be ascertained but whatever the reason the situation is absurd and intolerable and congress should terminate it immediately as late as 1897 and i think for two or three years thereafter thousands of robins were sold every year in the public markets of washington as food as a spectacle for gods and men behold today the sale of quail ruffed grouse wild turkeys and other american game half way between the capitol and the white house look at center market as a national fence for the sale of game stolen by market gunners from maryland virginia the carolinas and pennsylvania it is time for congress to bring the district of columbia sharply into line for washington must be made to toe the mark beside new york the reputation of the national capital demands it whether the gods of the cafes will consent or not florida shooting shore birds and waterfowl in late winter and spring should be stopped the sale of all native wild game should be prohibited a state game commissioner whose term of office should be not less than four years and a force of salaried game wardens should be appointed a general resident license should be required for hunting the killing of does and fawns should be stopped and no deer should be killed save bucks with horns at least three inches long the bag limit of five deer per year should be two deer of twenty quail and two turkeys per day should be ten quail and one turkey the open season on all game birds should end on february 1 for domestic reasons protection should be accorded doves and robins should be removed from the game list in the destruction of wild life i think the backwoods population of florida is the most lawless and defiant that can be found anywhere in the united states the plumehunters have practically exterminated the plumebearing egrets wholly annihilated the roseate spoonbill the flamingo and also the carolina parrakeet on july 8 1905 one of them killed an audubon association warden guy m bradley whose business it was to enforce the state laws protecting the egret rookeries the people really to blame for the shooting of guy bradley and the extermination of the egrets by lawless and dangerous men are the vain and merciless women who wear the white badges of cruelty as long as they can be purchased they have much to answer for originally florida was alive with bird life for number of species abundance of individuals and general dispersal throughout the whole state i think no other state in america except possibly california ever possessed a bird fauna quite comparable with it once its bird life was one of the wonders of america but the gunners began early to shoot and shoot and shoot during the fifteen years preceding 1898 the general bird life of florida decreased in volume 77 per cent in 1900 it was at a very low point and it has steadily continued to decrease the rapidlygrowing settlement and cultivation of the state has of course had much to do with the disappearance of wild life generally and the draining and exploitation of the everglades will about finish the birds of southern florida the brown pelicans breedingplace on pelican island in indian river has been taken in hand by the national government as a bird refuge and its marvelous spectacle of pelican life is now protected nine other islands on the coast of florida have been taken as national bird refuges and will render posterity good service the great private game and bird preserve of dr ray v pierce at apalachicola known as st vincent island containing twenty square miles of wonderful woods and waters is performing an important function for the state and the nation the florida bag limit on quail is entirely too liberal i know one man who never once exceeded the limit of twenty birds per day but in the season of 19089 he killed 865 quail can the quail of any state long endure such drains as that from a zoological point of view florida is in bad shape a great many of her people who shoot are desperately lawless and uncontrollable and the state is not financially able to support a force of wardens sufficiently strong to enforce the laws even as they are it looks as if the slaughter would go on until nothing of bird life remains at present i can see no hope whatever for saving even a good remnant of the wild life of the state the present status of wildlife protective laws in florida was made the subject of an article in forest and stream of august 10 1912 by john h wallace jr game commissioner of the state of alabama in an article entitled the florida situation in view of his record no one will question either the value or the honest sincerity of mr wallaces opinions the following paragraphs are from that article the enactment of a model and modern game law for the state of florida is absolutely imperative in order to save many of the most valuable species of birds and game of that state from certain depletion and threatened extinction the question of the protection of the birds and game in florida is not a local one but is national in its scope birds know no state lines and while practically all the states lying to the north of florida protect migratory birds and waterfowl yet these are recklessly slaughtered in that state to such an extent as to be appalling to all sportsmen and bird lovers so alarming has become the decrease of the birds and game of florida that unless a halt is called on the campaign of reckless annihilation that has been ceaselessly waged in that state the sport and recreation enjoyed by primeval nimrods will linger only in history and tradition it is the sincerest hope of all lovers of wild life of the american continent that a strong and invincible sentiment relative to the imperative necessity of real conservation legislation be crystallized in the minds of the members elect of the florida legislature to the end that the next legislature will spread upon the statute books of the state of florida a model and modern law for the preservation and protection of the birds and game of that state which when put into practical operation will elicit the thanks of all good citizens and likewise the gratitude of future generations georgia prohibit late winter and spring shooting and provide rational seasons for wild fowl reduce the limit on deer to two bucks a season with horns not less than three inches long protect the meadow lark and stop forever the killing of doves and woodducks prohibit the use of automatic and pump shotguns in hunting extend the term of the game commissioner to four years we are glad to report that georgia has already begun to take up the white mans burden the protection of wild life is now a gentlemans proposition and in it every real man with red blood in his veins has a duty to perform the state of georgia has recently awakened and under the comprehensive law of 1911 has resolutely undertaken to do her whole duty in this matter idaho the imperative duties of idaho are as follows stop all hunting of mountain sheep mountain goat and elk give the sage grouse and sharptail tenyear close seasons at once to forestall their extermination stop the killing of doves as game stop the killing of female deer and of bucks with horns less than three inches long enact the model law to protect nongame birds prohibit the use of machine shotguns in hunting extend the state wardens term to four years like montana wyoming and colorado the state of idaho has wasted her stock of game and it is to be feared that several species are now about to disappear from that state i am told that the sage grouse is almost gone and i think that the antelope caribou and mountain sheep are in the same condition of scarcity if the people of idaho wish to save their wild fauna they must be up and doing the time to temporize theorize be conservative and easygoing has gone by it is that fatal policy that causes men to slumber until it is too late to act and we will watch with keen interest to see whether the real men of idaho are big enough to do their whole duty in time to benefit their state in 1910 dr ts palmer credited idaho with the possession of about five hundred moose and two hundred antelope there is one feature of the idaho game law that may well stand unchanged the open season on ibex of which one per year may be killed may as well be continued one myth per year is not an extravagant bag for any intelligent hunter and it seems that the ibex will not down being officially recognized by idaho its place in our fauna now seems assured illinois enact a bayne law and stop the sale of all native wild game regardless of source and regardless of the gay revelers of chicago in illinois the bag limits on birds are nearly all at least 50 per cent too high they should be as follows no squirrels doves or shore birds six quail five woodcock ten coots ten rail ten ducks three geese and three brant with a total limit of ten waterfowl per day doves should be removed from the game list all tree squirrels and chipmunks should be perpetually protected as companions to man unfit for food the sale of aigrettes should be stopped and chicago placed in the same class as boston new york new orleans and san francisco the use of all machine shotguns in hunting should be prohibited the chief plaguespots for the grinding up of american game are chicago philadelphia baltimore new orleans and san francisco st louis cleared her record in 1909 new york thoroughly cleaned her augean stable in 1911 and massachusetts won her bayne law by a desperate battle in 1912 in 1913 pennsylvania probably will enact a bayne law fancy a city in the center of the united states sending to norway for 1500 ptarmigan to eat as chicago did in 1911 and that was only one order for forty years the marshes prairies farms and streams of the whole upper mississippi valley have been combed year after year by the guns of the market shooters often the migratory game was located by telegraphic reports game birds were slain by the wagonload boatload barrel and carload for the chicago market and the fool farmers of the middle west stolidly plowed their fields and fed their hogs and permitted the slaughter to go on today the sons of those farmers go to the museums and zoological parks of the cities to see specimens of pinnated grouse crane woodcock ducks and other species that the market shooters have wiped out and their fathers wax eloquent in telling of the flocks of pigeons that darkened the sky and the big droves of prairie chickens that used to rise out of the cornfields with a roar like a coming storm today chicago stands halfway reformed her markets are open to only onehalf the game killable in illinois but they are wide open to all legally killed game imported from other states from oct 1 to feb 1 through that hole in her game laws any gamedealer can drive a movingvan of course any game offered in chicago has been legally killed in some other state who can prove otherwise in addition to the imported game illegally killed in other states the starving population of chicago may also buy for cash and consume with their champagne in november and december all the illinois doves that can be combed out by the marketgunners after the awful iroquois theatre fire in chicago in 1903 the game dealers reported a heavy falling off in the consumption of game the tragedy caused the temporary closing of the theaters and the falling off in aftertheater suppers may be said to have taken away the appetites of thousands of erstwhile consumers of game incidentally it showed who consumes purchased game the people of illinois should now enact a fullfledged bayne law without changing a single word and bring chicago up to the level of new york st louis and boston the present bag limits on illinois game birds are fatally high as they stand with 190000 licensed gunners in the field each year what else do they mean than extermination the men of illinois have just two alternatives between which to choose drastic and immediate preservation or a gameless state which shall it be indiana indiana should hasten to stop spring shooting she should enact a law prohibiting the sale for millinery purposes of the plumage of all wild birds save ducks killed in their open season a bayne law absolutely prohibiting the sale of all native wild game should be enacted at once the killing of squirrels should be prohibited because they are not white mens game ruffed grouse and quail should have five year close seasons the use of pump and autoloading guns in hunting should be prohibited in indiana the whitetailed deer is extinct this means very close hunting and a bad outlook for all other game larger than the sparrow on october 2 1912 eleven heads of greater bird of paradise with plumes attached were offered for sale within one hundred feet of the headquarters of the fourth national conservation congress the prices ranged from 35 to 4750 and while we looked two ladies came up one of whom pointed to a birdofparadise corpse and said there i want one o them an im agoin to have it too iowa spring shooting should be stopped at once and forever the killing of all tree squirrels and chipmunks should cease all shore birds that visit iowa deserve a fiveyear close season especially is the shooting of plover sandpiper marsh and beach birds rail duck geese and brant from september 1 to april 15 an outrage iowa should prohibit the use of the machine guns and it is to be hoped that she will awaken sufficiently to do so it is said that the indian word iowa means the drowsy or sleepy ones politically and educationally iowa is all right but in the protection of wild life she is ten years behind the times in almost everything save the prohibition of the sale of game iowa knows better than to pursue the course that she does she boasts about her corn and hogs but she is deaf to the appeals of the states surrounding her on the subject of spring shooting for years minnesota has set her a good example but nothing moves her to step up where she belongs in the phalanx of intelligent gameprotecting states the foregoing may sound harsh but in view of what other states have endured from iowas stubbornness regarding migratory game the time for silent treatment of her case has gone by she is today in the same class as north carolina south carolina and marylandat the tail end of the procession of states she cares everything for corn and hogs but little for wild life kansas spring shooting should be stopped at once with apologies for not having done so long ago the continued shooting of prairie chickens when the species is near extermination is outrageous and should be prohibited for ten years doves should be removed permanently from the game list partly as a measure of self respect kansas should treat herself to a force of salaried game wardens rendering real service she should bar out the machine guns as unfit for use in a wellregulated state kansas has calmly witnessed the extermination of her bison elk deer antelope wild turkeys sage grouse whooping cranes and the beginning of the end of her pinnated grouse without a pang what is wild game in comparison with fat hogs and seventybushelstotheacre draw a line around the hogandcorn area of the united states and within it you will find more spring shooting more sale of game and more extermination of species than in any other area in the united states i refer to nebraska kansas iowa missouri illinois indiana ohio kentucky and tennessee in not one of these states except missouri is there any big game hunting and in the majority of them spring shooting is lawful in the island of mauritius it was swine that exterminated the dodo in the united states hogs and game extermination still go hand in hand since the days of the dodo however a new species of swine has been developed it is now widely known as the gamehog and it has been officially recognized by both bench and bar kentucky nearly everything that a state should maintain in the line of wild life protection kentucky lacks it is easier to tell what she has than to recite what she should have kentucky permits spring shooting she has no bag limits and she has long open seasons on everything save introduced pheasants she protects from sale only quail grouse and wild turkey killed within her own borders this means that her markets are practically wide open until recently the people of kentucky have been very indifferent to the value of her wildlife but with the new law enacted this year providing for a game commission and a game protection fund surely every member of the army of the defense will wish godspeed to her efforts in game conservation and stand ready to lend a helping hand whenever help can be utilized kentucky should at one grand coup stop spring shooting and all sale of wild game accord long close seasons to all species that are verging on extinction protect doves establish moderate bag limits and stop the use of machine guns if she takes up these measures at the rate of only one at each legislative session by the time her laws are perfect all her game will be gone louisiana on more counts than one louisiana is in the list of great delinquents for behold the things that she needs to do protect deer for five years instantly take the robin redwinged blackbird dove grosbeak woodduck and gull off the list of birds that may be killed as game stop all late winter and spring shooting stop the sale of all native game and the possession and transportation of game sold or intended for sale in short enact a bayne law reestablish a game warden system in legally permitting the slaughter of the robin redwinged blackbird dove grosbeak woodduck and gull the state of louisiana is very culpable for good reasons forty states of the american union strictly prohibit the killing of song and insectivorous birds the duty of every state to protect those birds is not a debatable proposition i put this question to the people of louisiana mississippi north carolina tennessee and other states where the robin is treated as a game bird is it fair of you to kill and eat robins when that species is carefully protected by forty other states of our country for grave economic reasons what would you say of the people of the north if they slaughtered your mockingbird to eat remember this proportion the robin the north the mockingbird the south chapter xxx new laws needed in the states continued maine there are reasons for the belief that maine is conserving her large game better than any other state or province in north america one glance over her laws is sufficient to convince anyone that instead of studying the clamor of her shooting population maine has actually been studying the needs of her game and providing for those needs if all other states were doing equally well the task of writing a book of admonition would have been unnecessary the proof of maines alertness is to be found in the number of her extra short or entirely closed seasons on game for example cow and calf moose are permanently protected only bull moose with at least two 3inch prongs on its horns may be killed caribou have had a close season since 1899 on gray and black squirrels doves and quail there is no open season the open season for deer varies from ten weeks to four weeks and in parts of three counties there is no open season at all silencers are prohibited and firearms in forests may be prohibited by the governor during droughts nearly all wildfowl shooting ends january 1 but in two places on december 1 people who have not learned the facts habitually think of maine as a vast killingground for deer and it is well for it to be known that the huntinggrounds have been carefully designated according to the abundance or scarcity of game maine has wisely chosen to regard her huntinggrounds and her deer as a valuable asset and she manages them accordingly to be a guide in that state is to be a good citizen and a protector of game from illegal slaughter no nonresident may hunt without a licensed guide the licenses for the thousands of deer killed in maine each year and the expenses of the visiting sportsmen who hunt them annually bring into the state and leave there a huge sum of money variously estimated at from 2000000 to 3000000 one can only guess at the amount from the number of nonresident licenses issued but certainly the total can not be less than 1000000 although mr lt carleton is no longer chairman of the commission of inland fisheries and game the splendid services that he rendered the state of maine during his thirteen years of service especially in the creation of a good code of game laws constitute an imperishable monument to his name and fame there is very little that maine needs in the line of new legislation or better protection to her game with the enactment of a resident license law and a fiveyear close season for woodcock plover snipe and sandpipers i think her laws for the protection of wild life would be sufficiently perfect for all practical purposes the pinetree state is to be congratulated upon its wise and efficient handling of the wildlife situation maryland how has it come to pass that maryland lacks more good wildlife laws than any other state in the union except north carolina of the really fundamental protective laws embracing the list that to every selfrespecting state seems indispensable maryland has almost none save certain baglimit laws otherwise the state is wide open it is indeed high time that she should abandon her present attitude of hostility to wild life and become a good neighbor she should do what is fair and right about the protection of the migratory game and bird life that annually passes twice through her territory at the last session of the maryland legislature the law preventing the use of power boats in wildfowl shooting was repealed that was a step ten years backward and maryland should be ashamed of it the list of things that maryland must do in order to clear her record is a long one here it is local regulations should be replaced by a uniform state law the sale of all native wild game should be stopped spring and late winter shooting of game should be stopped all nongame birds not already included under the statutes should be protected the exportation of all game should be prohibited unless accompanied by the man who shot it bearing his license and the law should be statewide instead of depending upon a separate enactment for each county there should be a hunters license law for all who hunt the use of machine shotguns in hunting should be stopped at once stop the use of power boats in wildfowl shooting massachusetts in 1912 the state of massachusetts moved up into the foremost rank of states where for one year new york had stood alone she passed a counterpart of the new york law absolutely prohibiting the sale of all wild american game in massachusetts but providing for the sale of game that has been reared in preserves and tagged by state officers this victory was achieved only after three months of hard fighting the coalition of sportsmen zoologists and friends of wild life in general proved irresistible just as a similar union of forces accomplished the bayne law in new york in 1911 the victory is highly instructive as great victories usually are it proves once more that whenever the american people can be aroused from their normal apathy regarding wild life any good conservation legislation can be enacted the prime necessities to success are good measures good management a reasonable campaign fund and tireless energy and persistence massachusetts is to be roundly congratulated on having so thoroughly cleaned up her saleofgame situation incidentally five bills for the repeal of the massachusetts law against spring shooting were introduced and each one went down to the defeat that it deserved the repeal of a springshooting law anywhere is a step backward ten years massachusetts needs a baglimit law more in keeping with her small remnant of wild life and that she will have ere long very soon also her sportsmen will raise the standard of ethics in shotgun shooting by barring out the automatic and pump shotguns so much beloved by the market shooters as matters stand at this date 1912 the old bay state needs the following new laws low bag limits on all game fiveyear close seasons on all shore birds snipe and woodcock expulsion of the automatic and pump shotguns in hunting michigan on the whole the game laws of michigan are in excellent shape and leave little to be desired in the line of betterment except to be simplified all the game protected by the laws of the state is debarred from sale squirrels pinnated grouse doves and wild turkeys enjoy long close seasons the bag limits on deer and game birds are reasonably low spring shooting still is possible on nine species of ducks and this should be stopped without delay only three or four suggestions are in order all spring shooting should be prohibited all shore birds should have a fiveyear close season the use of the machine shotguns in hunting should be stopped the laws should permit the sale under tag of all species of game that can successfully be reared in preserves on a commercial basis two or three state game preserves for deer each at least four miles square should be established without delay minnesota this state should at once enact a baglimit law that will do some good instead of the statutory farce now on the books make it fifteen birds per day of waterfowl all species combined and no grouse or quail there should be fiveyear close seasons enacted for quail grouse plover woodcock snipe and all other shore birds a law should be enacted prohibiting the use of firearms by unnaturalized aliens and a 20 license for all naturalized aliens provision should be made for a large state game refuge in southern minnesota the state should prohibit the use of machine guns in hunting today direct and reliable advices show that the game situation in minnesota is far from encouraging several species are threatened with extinction at an early date in northern minnesota it is reported that much game is surreptitiously trapped and slaughtered the bob white is reported as threatened with total extinction at an early date but i think the prairie chicken will be the first bird species to go moose will soon be extinct everywhere in minnesota except in the game preserves apparently there is now about one duck in minnesota for every ten ducks that were there only ten years ago now what is minnesota going to do about all this is she willing through apathy to become a gameless state her people need to arouse themselves now and pass several strong laws her bag limit of fortyfive birds per day of quail grouse woodcock and plover and fifty per day of the waterbirds is a joke and nothing more but it is no laughing matter it spells extermination mississippi the legalized slaughter of robins cedar birds grosbeaks and doves should cease immediately on the basis of economy of resources and a square deal to all the states lying northward of mississippi the shooting of all waterfowl should cease on january 1 a reasonable limit should be established on deer a hunting license law should be passed at once fixing the fee at 1 and devoting the revenue to the pay of a corps of nonpolitical game wardens selected on a basis of ability and fitness the administration of the game laws should be placed in charge of a salaried game commissioner it is seriously to the discredit of mississippi that her laws actually classify robins cedarbirds grosbeaks and doves as game and make them killable as such from sept 1 to march 1 i should think that if no economic consideration carried weight in mississippi state pride alone would be sufficient to promote a correction of the evil if we of the north were to slaughter mockingbirds for food when they come north to visit us the men of the south would call us greedy barbarians and they would be quite right missouri the missouri bag limits that permit the killing or possession of fifty birds per day are absurd and fatally liberal the utmost should be twentyfive and even that is too high doves should be taken off the list of game birds and protected throughout the year and so should all tree squirrels spring shooting of shore birds and waterfowl should be prohibited without delay a law against automatic and pump guns should be enacted at the next legislative session as a public lesson on the raising of the standard of ethics in shooting the state of missouri is really strong in her position as a gameprotecting state she perpetually protects such vanishing species as the ruffed grouse prairie chicken pinnated grouse woodcock and all her shore birds save snipe and plover she prohibits the sale of native game and the killing of female deer but she wisely permits the sale of preservebred elk and deer under the tags of the state game commission for nearly all the wild game that is accessible her markets are tightly closed we heartily congratulate missouri on her advanced position on the sale of game and we hope that the people of iowa will even yet profit by her good example montana like colorado and wyoming montana is wasting a valuable heritage of wild game while she struggles to maintain the theory that she still is in the list of states that furnish biggame hunting it is a fact that ten years ago most sportsmen began to regard montana as a hasbeen for big game and began to seek better huntinggrounds elsewhere british columbia alberta and alaska have done much for the game of montana by drawing sportsmen away from it mr henry avare the state game warden is optimistic regarding even the big game and believes that it is holding its own this is partially true of whitetailed deer or it was up to the time of great slaughter it is said that in 1911 11000 deer were killed in montana all in the western part of the state seventy per cent of which were whitetails the deep snows and extreme cold of a long and unusually severe winter drove the hungry deer down out of the mountains into the settlements where the ranchmen joyously slaughtered them the destruction around kalispell was described by harry p stanford as sickening mr avare estimates the pronghorned antelope in montana at three thousand head of which about six hundred are under the quasiprotection of four ranches the antelope need three or four small ranges such as the snow creek antelope range where the bad lands are too rough for ranchmen but quite right for antelopes and other big game all the grouse and ptarmigan of montana need a fiveyear close season the splendid sage grouse is now extinct in many parts of its previous range fiftyeight thousand licensed gunners are too many for them the few mountain sheep and mountain goats that survive should have a fiveyear close season at once the killing of female hoofed animals should be prohibited by law montana has not yet adopted the model law for the protection of nongame birds only seven states have failed in that respect the use of automatic and pump shotguns and silencers should immediately be prohibited montanas baglimits are not wholly bad but the grizzly bear has almost been exterminated save in the yellowstone park some of these days if things go on as they are now going the people of montana will be rudely awakened to the fact that they have 50000 licensed hunters but no longer any killable game and then we will hear enthusiastic talk about restocking nebraska no other state has bestowed close seasons upon as many extinct species of game as nebraska behold how she has resolutely locked the doors of her empty cage after all these species have flown elk antelope wild turkey passenger pigeon whooping crane sage grouse ptarmigan and curlew in a short time the pinnated grouse can be added to the list of hasbeens there is little to say regarding the future of the game of nebraska for its future is now history provision should be made for one or more state game preserves spring shooting of shore birds and waterfowl should be prohibited a larger and more effective warden service should be provided doves should be removed from the game list nevada the sage grouse should be given a tenyear close season for recuperation all nongame birds should have perpetual protection the cranes now verging on extinction and the pigeons and doves should at once be taken out of the list of game birds and forever protected all the shore birds need five years of close protection a state game warden whose term of office is not less than four years should be provided for a corps of salaried game protectors should be chosen for active and aggressive game protection nevadas bag limits are among the best of any state the only serious flaw being 10 sage grouse per day which should be 0 nevada still has a few antelope and we beg her to protect them all from being hunted or killed it is my belief that if the antelope is really saved anywhere in the united states outside of national parks and preserves it will be in the wild and remote regions of nevada where it is to be hoped that lumpyjaw has not yet taken hold of the herds new hampshire speaking generally the new hampshire laws regulating the killing and shipment of game are defective for the reason that on birds and in fact all game save deer there appear to be no bag limits on the quantity that may be killed in a day or a season the following bag limits are greatly needed forthwith gray squirrel none per day or per year duck except woodduck ten per day or thirty per season ruffed grouse four per day twelve per season hare and rabbit four per day or twelve per season fiveyear close seasons should immediately be enacted for the following species quail woodcock jacksnipe and all species of shore or beach birds the sale of all native wild game should be prohibited and gamebreeding in preserves and the sale of such game under state supervision should be provided for the use of automatic and pump guns in hunting should be barredthrough state pride if for no other reason new jersey new jersey enjoys the distinction of being the second state to break the stranglehold of the gunmakers of hartford and ilion and cast out the odious automatic and pump guns it was a pitched battlethat of 1912 inaugurated by ernest napier president of the state game and fish commission and his fellow commissioners the longer the contest continued the more did the press and the people of new jersey awaken to the seriousness of the situation finally the gunsuppression bill passed the two houses of the legislature with a total of only fourteen votes against it and after a full hearing had been granted the attorneys of the gunmakers was promptly signed by governor woodrow wilson governor wilson could not be convinced that the act was unconstitutional or confiscatory or class legislation this contest aroused the whole state to the imperative necessity of providing more thorough protection for the remnant of new jersey game and it was chiefly responsible for the enactment of four other excellent new protective laws new jersey always has been sincere in her desire to protect her wild life and always has gone as far as the killers of game would permit her to go but the people have made one great mistakecommon to nearly every stateof permitting the gamekillers to dictate the game laws always and everywhere this is a grievous mistake and fatal to the game for example in 1866 new jersey enacted a fiveyear closeseason law on the prairie fowl pinnated grouse but it was too late to save it now that species is as dead to new jersey as is the mastodon the moral is will the people apply this lesson to the ruffed grouse quail and the shore birds generally before they too are too far gone to be brought back if it is done it must be done against the will of the gunners for they prefer to shootand shoot they will if they can dictate the laws until the last game bird is dead in 1912 new jersey is spending 30000 in trying to restock her birdless covers with foreign game birds and quail in brief here are the imperative duties of new jersey provide eightyear close seasons for quail ruffed grouse woodcock snipe all shore birds and the woodduck prohibit the sale of all native wild game but promote the sale of preservebred game prevent the repeal of the automatic gun law which surely will be attempted each year prohibit all birdshooting after january 10 each year until fall prohibit the killing of squirrels as game new mexico all things considered the game laws of new mexico are surprisingly up to date and the state is to be congratulated on its advanced position for example there are long close seasons on antelope elk now extinct mountain sheep bob white quail pinnated grouse wild pigeon and ptarmiganan admirable list truly it is clear that new mexico is wide awake to the dangers of the wildlife situation on two counts her laws are not quite perfect there is no law prohibiting spring shooting and there is no model law protecting the nongame birds the sale of game will not trouble new mexico because the present laws prevent the sale of all protected game except plover curlew and snipeall of them species by no means common in the arid regions of the southwest a law prohibiting spring shooting of shore birds and waterfowl should be passed at the next session of the legislature the enactment of the model law should be accomplished without delay to put new mexico abreast of the neighboring states of colorado oklahoma and texas the term of the state warden should be extended to four years new york in the year of grace 1912 i think we may justly regard new york as the banner state of all america in the protection of game and wild life in general this proud position has been achieved partly through the influence of a great conservation governor john a dix and the state conservation commission proposed and created by his efforts in these days of game destruction when our country from nome to key west is reeking with the blood of slaughtered wild creatures it is a privilege and a pleasure to be a citizen of a state which has thoroughly cleaned house and done well nigh the utmost that any state can do to clear her bad record and give all her wild creatures a fair chance to survive the people of the empire state literally can point with pride to the list of things accomplished in the discharge of goodcitizenship toward the remnant of wild life and toward the future generations of new yorkers that we of today have borne our share of the burden of bringing about the conditions of 1912 will be a source of satisfaction especially when the sword and shield hang useless upon the walls of old age new york began to protect her deer in 1705 and her heath hens in 1708 in 1912 she stopped the killing of female deer and of bucks having horns less than three inches in length spring shooting was stopped in 1903 a comprehensive law protecting nongame birds was enacted in 1862 new yorks first law against the sale of certain game during close seasons was enacted in 1837 in 1911 new york enacted with only one adverse vote a law prohibiting the sale of all native wild game throughout the state no matter where killed and providing liberally for the encouragement of gamebreeding and the sale of preservebred game in 1912 a new codification of the state game laws went into effect through the initiative of governor dix and conservation commissioners van kennen moore and fleming assisted as special counsel by marshall mclean george a lawyer and john b burnham this code contains many important new provisions one of the most valuable of which is a clause giving the conservation commission power at its discretion to shorten or to close any open season on any species of game in any locality wherein that species seems to be threatened with extermination this very valuable principle should be enacted into law in every state in 1910 william dutcher and t gilbert pearson and the national association of audubon societies won after a struggle lasting five years the passage of the shea plumage bill prohibiting the sale of aigrettes or other plumage of wild birds belonging to the same families as the birds of new york chap 256 this law should be duplicated in every state two things remain to be done in the state of new york all the shore birds quail and gray squirrels of the state should be given fiveyear close seasons by the action of the state conservation commission for the good name of the state and the ethical standing of its sportsmen as an example to other states and the last remaining duty toward our wild life the odious automatic and pump shotguns should be barred from use in hunting unless their capacity is reduced to two shots without reloading chapter xxxi new laws needed in the states concluded north carolina the game laws of north carolina form a droll crazyquilt of local and state measures effective and ineffective in 1909 a total of 77 local game laws were enacted and only two of statewide application during the ten years ending in 1910 a total of 316 game laws were enacted she sedulously endeavors to protect her quail which do not migrate but in currituck county she persistently maintains the bloodiest slaughterpen for waterfowl that exists anywhere on the atlantic coast there is no bag limit on waterfowl and unlimited spring shooting so far as waterfowl are concerned conditions could hardly be worse except by the use of punt guns doves larks and robins are shot and eaten as game from november 1 to march 1 twentyone counties have local restrictions on the sale of game but the state at large has only oneon quail the market gunners of currituck sound are a scourge and a pest to the wildfowl life of the atlantic coast for their own money profit they slaughter by wholesale the birds that annually fly through twentytwo states it is quite useless to suggest anything to north carolina in modern game laws as long as a killable bird remains she will not stop the slaughter her standing reply is it brings a lot of money into currituck county and the people want the money even the members of the sportsmens clubs can shoot wild fowl in currituck county quite without limit and i am told that the privilege often is abused quite recently i heard of a member of one of the clubs who shot 164 ducks and geese in two days apparently any suggestions made to north carolina would not be treated seriously especially if they would tend really to elevate the sport of game shooting or better protect the game there is however a melancholy interest attached to the framing of good game laws whether they ever are likely to be adopted or not here is the duty of north carolina stop the killing of robins doves and larks for food absolutely and forever this measure is necessary to agriculture and to the good name of the state stop the shooting of any game for sale prohibit the possession of game for sale and the sale of wild native game establish bag limits on all waterfowl and on all other game birds and mammals prepare to protect at an early date the wild turkey and quail for soon they will need it moreover enact a law prohibiting the use of automatic and pump guns in hunting covering the entire state provide a residentlicense system and thereby make the game department selfsustaining and render it possible to employ a salaried state game commissioner it is quite wrong for the people of north carolina to hold grudges against northern members of the ducking clubs of currituck for the passage of the bayne law they had nothing whatever to do with it and i can say this because i was in a position which enabled me to know north dakota in 1911 this sovereign state enacted a law prohibiting the use of automobiles in hunting wildfowl also rifles north dakota was the first state to recognize officially the fact that the use of automobiles in hunting is a serious menace to some forms of wild life beyond all question the machines do indeed bring an extra number of birds within reach of the gun they increase the annual slaughter and it is right and necessary to prohibit by law their use in hunting game of any kind in putman county new york i have seen them in action a load of three or four gunners is whirled up to a likely mountainside for ruffed grouse and presently the banging begins after an hour or so spent in combing out the birds the hunters jump in whirl away in a dustcloud to another spot two miles away and bangbangbang again after that a third locality and so on covering six or eight times the territory that a man in a buggy or on foot could possibly shoot over in the same time north dakota has done well in the passage of that act on certain other matters she is not so sound for instance the killing of pinnated grouse should be stopped for ten years and it should be done immediately the killing of cranes as game should stop instantly and forever it is barbarous fifty dead birds in possession at one time is fully thirty too many the game cannot stand such slaughter all shore birds order limicolae should have at least a fiveyear close season before they are exterminated the use of machine guns in hunting should be stopped forever it is to the credit of the state that antelope are absolutely protected until 1920 and an unlimited close season has been accorded the quail dove and swan ohio i think that ohio comes the nearest of all the states to being gameless with but slight exceptions her laws are about as correct as those of most other states but the desire to kill is so strong and the majority of her gunners are so thoroughly selfish about their rights that the game has ruthlessly been swept away according to law ohio is a striking example of the deplorable results of legalized slaughter the spirit of ohio is like that of north carolina her sportsmen will not have an automatic gun law oh no limit the bag shorten the season and the gun wont matter today the visible game supply of ohio does not amount to anything and when the last game bird of that state falls before the greediest shooter we shall say a gameless state is just what you deserve it is useless to make any suggestions to ohio her shooting shylocks want the last pound of flesh from wild life and i think they will get it very soon ohio is in the area of barren states the seed stock has been too thoroughly destroyed to be recuperated i think that ohios last noteworthy exploit in lawmaking for the preservation of her game was in 1904 when she put all her shore birds into the list of killable game and bravely prohibited the shooting of doves on the ground great is ohio in game conservation oklahoma for a state so young the wildlife laws of oklahoma are in admirable shape but it is reasonably certain that there as elsewhere the game is being killed much faster than it is breeding the new commonwealth must arouse and screw up the brakes much tighter recently an observing friend told me that on a trip of 250 miles westward from lawton and back again watching sharply for game all the way he saw only five pinnated grouse and this in a good season for prairie chickens oklahoma must stop all spring shooting the prairie chicken must have a tenyear close season immediately next time her legislature will pass the automatic gun bill that failed last year only because the session closed too soon for its consideration oklahoma is wise in giving long protection to her quail and wild pigeon and such protection should be made equally effective in the case of the dove she is wise in rigidly enforcing her law against the exportation of game the wichita national bison herd near cache now contains forty head of bison all in good condition the nucleus herd consisted of fifteen head presented by the new york zoological society in 1907 oregon the results of the efforts that have been made by oregon to provide special laws for each individual shooter are painful to contemplate like north carolina oregon has attempted the impossible task of pleasing everybody and at the same time protecting her wild life the two propositions can be blended together about as easily as asphalt and water the individual shooter desires laws that will permit him to shootwhen he pleases where he pleases and what he pleases if you meet those conditions all over a great state then it is time to bid farewell to the game for it surely is doomed no decidedly no do not attempt to pass game laws that will please everybody the more the gamehogs are displeased the better for the game the gamehogs form a very small and very insignificant minority of the whole people why please one man at the expense of ninetynine others the game of a state belongs to the people as a whole not to the gunners alone the great patientand sometimes sleepymajority has vested rights in it and it is for it to say how it shall and shall not be killed heretofore the gunning minority has been dictating the game laws of america and the result isprogressive extermination first of all oregon should bury the pernicious idea of individual and local laws she should enact a concise clearly cut and thoroughly effective code of wild life laws just as new york did last winter her game seasons should be uniform in application all over the state every species of bird mammal or fish that is threatened with extermination should be given a close season of from five to ten years it is now time to protect the white goose and brant squirrels bandtailed pigeons and doves should be perpetually protected the state game commission should have power to close the shooting seasons on any species of game in any locality whenever a species is threatened with extinction the sale of native wild game from all sources should be permanently stopped by a bayne law the use of automatic autoloading and pump shot guns in hunting should be perpetually barred pennsylvania as a game protecting state pennsylvania is a close second to new york and massachusetts she protects all native game from sale she has the courage to prohibit aliens from owning guns she bars out automatic shotguns in hunting she makes refuges for deer and feeds her quail in winter and she permits the killing of no female deer or fawns with horns less than three inches in length her splendid state game commission is fighting hard for a hunters license law and will win the fight for it at the next session of the legislature 1913 but there are certain things that pennsylvania should do she should stop all spring shooting she must stop killing doves blackbirds wild turkeys sandpipers and all the squirrels save the red squirrel she should give all her shore birds a rest of at least five years for recuperation she should enact a comprehensive dutcher plumage law stopping the sale of aigrettes she should provide a resident license to furnish her game commission with adequate funds to carry on its work and exterminate gamekilling vermin rhode island little rhody needs some good small bag limits for now 1912 she has none she should enact a bayne law a pennsylvania law against aliens and a new jersey law against the automatic and pump guns she should stop killing the beautiful woodduck and gray squirrel she should stop all spring shooting of waterfowl south carolina she should save her game while she still has some to save first of all stop spring shooting secondly enact a bayne law in the name of mystery who is there in south carolina who desires to kill grackles and why and where is the gentleman sportsman who has come down to killing foolish and tame little doves for sport stop it at once for the credit of the state enact a dollar resident license law and thus provide adequate funds for game protection south carolina bag limits are all 50 per cent too high and they should be reduced it is strange to see one of the oldest of the states lagging in game protection far behind such new states as new mexico and oklahoma but south carolina does lag it is time for her to consider her position and reform south dakota south dakota should stop all spring shooting her gamebag limits are really no limits at all they should be reduced about 66 per cent without a moments unnecessary delay the two year term of the state warden is too short for effective work it should be extended to four years unless south dakota wishes to repeat the folly of such states as indiana iowa illinois missouri and ohio she needs to be up and doing if her people want a gameless state except for migratory waterfowl all they need do is to slumber on and they surely will have it why wait until greedy sportsmen have killed the last game bird of the state before seriously taking the matter in hand in one act all the shortcomings of the present laws can be corrected south dakota needs no bayne law because she prohibits at all times the sale or exportation of all wild game tennessee in wild life protection tennessee has much to do she made her start late in life and what she needs to do is to draft with care and enact with cheerful alacrity certain necessary amendments we notice that there are open seasons for blackbirds robins doves and squirrels it seems incredible but it is true behold the blackbird as a game bird with a lawful open season from september 1 to january 1 consider its stately carriage its rapid flight on the wing its running and hiding powers when attacked as a test of marksmanship as the real thing for the expert wing shot is it not great will not any selfrespecting dog be proud to point or retrieve them and what flesh for the table fancy an ablebodied sportsman going out in a fiftydollar hunting suit carrying a fifteendollar gun behind a sevendollar dog and returning with a glorious bag of twentyfive blackbirds or robins or doves proud indeed would we be to belong which we dont to a club of sportsmen who go out shooting blackbirds and robins and foolish little doves as game game indeed are those birdsfor little lads of seven who do not know better but not for boys of twelve who have in their veins any inheritance of sporting blood i am proud of the fact that at twelve years of ageand ever so keen to go huntingi knew without being told that squirrels and doves were not real game for real boys the killers of doves squirrels blackbirds and robins belong in the same class as the sparrowandlinnetkilling italians of venice milan and turin and in that company we will leave them tennessee needs a resident license system to provide funds for game protection a salaried warden force a law prohibiting spring shooting of shore birds and waterfowl a law protecting robins doves and other nongame birds not covered by the present statute texas i remember well when the great battle was fought in texas by the gallant men and women of the state audubon society to compel the people of texas to learn the economic value to agriculture and cotton of the insectivorous birds the name of the splendid brigadiergeneral who led the army of the defense was capt mb davis that was in 1903 since that great fight was won texas has been a partly reformed state at times quite jealous of her bird life but still she tolerates spring shooting and has not made adequate close seasons for her waterfowl which is wrong today the people of texas do not need to be told that fortythree species of birds feed on the cotton boll weevil for they know it on the whole and for a southern state the wildlife laws of texas are in fairly good shape on account of the absence of gamescourge markets a bayne law is not so imperatively necessary there as in certain other states all the game of the state is protected from sale we do assert however that if robins are slaughtered as fl crow the former atlantan asserts all robin shooting should be forever stopped that the pinnated grouse should be given a sevenyear close season and that doves should be taken off the list of game birds and perpetually protected both for economic and sentimental reasons and also because the too weak and confiding dove is not a game bird for redblooded men texas should enact without delay a law providing close seasons for ducks geese and other waterfowl a law prohibiting spring shooting and a provision reducing the limit on deer to two bucks a season utah the laws of utah are far from being up to the requirements of the present hour one strange thing has happened in utah when i spent a week in salt lake city in 1888 and devoted some time to inquiring into game conditions the laws of the state were very bad at the mouth of bear river ducks were being slaughtered for the markets by the tens of thousands the coldblooded wide open and utterly shameless way in which it was being done right at the doors of salt lake city was appalling at the same time the law permitted the slaughter of spotted fawns i saw a huge drygoods box filled to the top with the flat skins of slaughtered innocents 260 in number that a rascal had collected and was offering at fifty cents each in reply to a question as to their use he said i tink de sportsmen like em for to make vests oud of he lived at rawlins wyo after a long and somnolent period during which hundreds of thousands of ducks geese brant and other birds had been slaughtered for market at the bear river shambles and elsewhere the state awoke sufficiently to abate a portion of the disgrace by passing a baglimit law 1897 and then came natures punishment upon utah for that duck slaughter the ducks of great salt lake became afflicted with a terrible epidemic disease intestinal coccidiosis which swept off thousands and stopped the use of utah ducks as food it was a duck plague no less it has prevailed for three years and has not yet by any means been stamped out it seems to be due to the fact that countless thousands of ducks have been feeding on the exposed alluvial flats at the mouth of the creek that drains off the sewage of salt lake city the conditions are said to be terrible today utah is so nearly destitute of big game that the subject is hardly worthy of mention of her upland game birds only a fraction remains and as her laws stand today she is destined to become in the near future a gameless state in a dry region like this the wild life always hangs on by a slender thread and it is easy to exterminate it utah should instantly stop the sale of game that she now legally provides fortwentyfive shore birds and waterfowl per day to private parties deer should be given a tenyear close season at once all bag limits should instantly be reduced onehalf the sage grouse quail swans woodcock dove and all shore birds should be given a tenyear close seasonand rigidly protectedbefore the stock is all gone the model law for the protection of nongame birds should be enacted at once the absolute protection of elk antelope and sheep until 1913 should be extended for twenty years utah should create a biggame preserve at once if utah proposes to save even a remnant of her wild life for posterity she must be up and doing vermont in view of all conditions it must be stated that the game laws of vermont are with but slight exceptions in good condition it is a pleasure to see that there is no spring shooting that there is no open season of slaughter for the moose caribou woodduck swan upland plover dove or rail that no buck deer with antlers less than three inches long may be killed and that there is a law under which damages by deer to growing crops may be assessed and paid for by the county in which they occur moreover if there is to be any killing of game her bag limits are not extravagant all the game protected by the state is immune from sale for food purposes but preservereared game may legally be sold we recommend the following new measures absolute close seasons of fiveyears duration for ruffed grouse quail woodcock snipe and all shore birds without a single exception the gray squirrel should be perpetually protectedbecause he is too beautiful too companionable and too unfit for food to be killed even the hungry savages of the east indies do not eat squirrels pass an automatic pumpgun law extend the term of the fish and game commissioner to four years vermonts great success in introducing and colonizing deer is both interesting and valuable fifty years ago she had no wild deer because the species had been practically exterminated in 1875 thirteen deer were imported from the adirondacks and set free in the mountains the increase has been enormous in 1909 the number of deer killed for the year was about 5311 which was possible without adversely affecting the herds it is a striking objectlesson in restoring the whitetailed deer to its own and it will be found more fully described in chapter xxiv virginia virginia is far below the position that she should occupy in wildlife conservation to set her house in order and come up to the level of the states that have been born during the past twenty years she must bestir herself in these ways she must provide for a resident hunting license a state game commissioner and a force of salaried wardens she must prohibit spring shooting she must impose small bag limits on gameslaughter she must resolutely stop the sale of all wild game she must stop the killing of female deer and of bucks with horns under three inches long she must stop killing gray squirrels and doves as game she should not permit the beautiful woodduck to be killed as game she should accord a fiveyear close season to grouse and all shore birds she should rule out the machine shotguns which gentlemen can no longer use in hunting she should adopt at once a comprehensive code of game laws and clean her house in one siege instead of fiddling and fussing with all these matters one by one through a series of ten long weary years the time for puttering with game protection has gone by it is now time to make short cuts to comprehensive results and save the game before it is too late washington the state of washington still flatters herself that she has all kinds of big game to killmoose antelope goat sheep caribou and deer evidently this is on the theory that so long as a species is not extinct it is legal and right to pursue it with rifles during a specified open season the people of washington need to be told that conditions have greatly changed and it is now high time to put on the brakes it is time for them to realize that if they wait any longer for the sportsmen to take the initiative in securing the enactment of really adequate preservation laws all their big game will be dead before those laws are born every man shrinks from cutting off his own pet privilege some of the game laws of washington are up to date and her biggame laws look all right to the unaided eye but are not her bird laws are a chaotic jumble of local exceptions and special privileges as a net result of all her shortcomings the remnant of a once fine fauna of big game and feathered game is surely being exterminated according to law a few local exceptions will not disprove the general truthfulness of this assertion ten years ago a few men in seattle resented the idea of outside cooperation in the protection of washington game they said they were abundantly able to take care of it but the march of events has proven that they overestimated their capacity today the wildlife laws of that state are only half baked come what may to me i shall set down without malice the things that the great and admirable state of washington should do to set her house in order it is not good for the resourceful and progressive men of the great northwest to be clear behind the times in these matters stop local game legislation and enact a code of laws covering the entire state uniformly county legislation is twenty years behind the times for ten 10 full years stop the killing of elk mountain sheep mountain goat caribou moose and antelope regarding deer i am in doubt prohibit the sale of all wild game no matter where killed by the enactment of a bayne law complete which will also promote the breeding killing and sale of domestic game for food purposes make a careful investigation of the present status of your sage grouse every other grouse quail and all species of shore birds then give a fiveyear close season all over the state to every species that is becoming scarce this will embrace certainly onehalf of the whole number if not twothirds provide two bird refuges in the eastern portion of the state where they are very greatly needed to supplement the good effects of the state game preserve established on puget sound in 1911 bar the use in hunting of the odious automatic and pump shotguns that are now so generally in use all over the united states to the great detriment of the game and the people west virginia considering the fact that west virginia contains no plaguespot city for the consumption of commercial wild game that the sale of all game is prohibited at all times and the game of the state may not be exported for sale elsewhere the wild life of west virginia is reasonably secure from the market gunnerif an adequate salaried warden force is provided without such a force her game must continue to be destroyed in the future as in the past to supply the markets of pittsburgh philadelphia baltimore and washington the deer law is excellent and the nongame birds and the dove and woodduck are perpetually protected one fly in the ointment isspring shooting which for ducks geese and brant continues from september 1 to april 20 unfortunately the law enacted in 1875 against spring shooting has been repealed and so has the resident hunting license law 1911 in view of the impossibility of imagining a good reason for the repeal of a good law we recommend that the law against spring shooting be reenacted that the resident hunters license law be reenacted and the proceeds specifically devoted to the preservation and increase of game that a force of regular salaried wardens be provided to enforce the laws that the bag limit on quail should be 10 per day or 40 per season instead of 12 and 96 and on ruffed grouse it should be 3 per day as in new york or 12 per season one wild turkey per day or three per season is quite enough for one man the visible supply will not justify the existing limit of two and six wisconsin in spite of the fierce fight made in 191011 by the saloonelement gameshooters of milwaukee for the control of the wildlife situation and the repeal of the best protective laws of the state the army of defense once more defeated the allied destroyers and drove them off the field once more it was proven that when the people are aroused they are abundantly able to send the steam roller over the enemies of wild life alphabetically wisconsin may come near the end of the rollcall but by downright merit in protection she comes mighty close to the head of the list of states her slate of work to be done is particularly clean and she has our most distinguished admiration her force of game wardens is not a politicalmachine force it amounts to something the men who get within it undergo successfully a civil service examination that certainly separates the sheep from the goats for particulars address dr ts palmer department of agriculture washington according to the standards that have been dragging along previous to this moment wisconsin has a good series of game laws but the hour for a reformation of ideas and principles has struck we heard it first in april 1911 the wild life of america must not be exterminated according to law contrary to law or in the absence of law wisconsin must take a fresh grip on her game situation or it will get away from her after all not another prairie chicken or woodcock should be killed in wisconsin between 1912 and 1922 when any small bird becomes so scarce that the bag limit needs to be cut down to five as it now is for the above in wisconsin it is time to stop for ten years before it is too late wisconsin should immediately busy herself about the creation of bird and game preserves for goodness sake wisconsin stop killing squirrels as game you ought to know betterand you do leave that form of barbarism for the benighted states and pass a law shutting out the machine guns they are a disgrace to our country and a scourge to our game continually are they leading good men astray extend the term of your state warden to four years wyoming the state of wyoming once had a magnificent heritage of game it embraced the rocky mountain species and also those of the great plains first and last the state has worked hard to protect her wild life and hold the killing of it down to a decent basis as far back as 1889 i met on the shoshone river a very wideawake warden actually on his job who was maintained by a body of private citizens headed by col pickett and known as the northern wyoming game protective association and even then we saw that the laws were too liberal for the game in one mans coldstorage dugout we saw enough sheep deer and elk meat to subsist a company of hungry dragoons all killed and possessed according to law in the protection of her mountain game wyoming has had a hard task in the yellowstone park between 1889 and 1894 the poachers for the taxidermists of livingston and elsewhere slaughtered 270 bison out of 300 and howell was the only man caught england can protect game in fardistant mountains and wildernesses but america can notor at least we dont with us men living in remote places who find wild game about them say to h with the law they kill on the sly in season and out of season females and males and the average local jury simply will not convict the average settler who is accused of such a trifling indiscretion as killing game out of season when he needs the meat and so with laws in full force protecting females the volume of big game steadily disappears everywhere west of the alleghanies where the law permits biggame hunting an interesting chapter might be written on game exterminated according to law the deadly defects in the protection of western big game are structural weakness in the enforcement of the laws collusion between offenders for the suppression of evidence perjury on the witness stand dishonesty and disloyalty on the part of local jurors when friends are on trial sympathy of judges for the poor man who wants to eat the game to save his cattle and sheep illustration map of states and provinces which require residents to obtain hunting licenses 1912 in connecticut new jersey new york oklahoma and rhode island an additional fee of 10 to 20 cents is charged for issuing the license inclosed names indicate states which permit residents to hunt on their own land without license nova scotia has a 5 resident license and exempts landowners note that many of the states adopt the french method of exempting landowners while some particularly in the west follow the english method of requiring everyone who hunts to obtain a license from farmers bulletin no 510 us dept of agriculture elsewhere there appears a statement regarding the elk of jackson hole and the efforts made and being made to save them at this point we are interested in the game of wyoming as a whole first of all the killing of mountain sheep should absolutely cease for ten years a similar tenyear close season should be accorded moose and pronghorned antelope all grouse should now be classed with doves and swans no open season and kept there for ten years spring shooting is wrong in principle and vicious in practice and it should be stopped in wyoming as elsewhere the automatic and pump shotguns when used in hunting are a disgrace to wyoming as they are to other states and should be suppressed and the silencer for use in hunting is in the black list chapter xxxii need for a federal migratory bird law nosaleofgame law and others we are assuming that the american people sincerely desire the adequate protection and increase of bird life for reasons that are both sentimental and commercial surely every good citizen dislikes to see millions of dollars worth of national wealth foolishly wasted and he dislikes to pay any unnecessary increased cost of living there must be several millions of americans who feel that way and who are disposed to demand a complete revolution in bird protection there are four needs of wild bird life that are fundamental and that can not be ignored any more than a builder can ignore the four cornerstones of his building listed in the order of their importance they are as follows 1the federal protection of all migratory birds 2the total suppression of the sale of native wild game 3the total suppression of spring shooting and of shooting in the breeding season and 4long close seasons for all species that are about to be shot out if the gunners of america wish to have a gameless continent all they need do to secure it is to oppose these principles prevent their translation into law and maintain the status quo if they do this then all our best birds are doomed to swift destruction let no man make a mistake on that point the open seasons and bag limits of the united states today are just as deadly as the 5000000 sporting guns now in use and the 700000000 annual cartridges it is only the ignorant or the vicious who will seriously dispute this statement the federal protection of migratory birdsthe bill now before congress for the protection of all migratory birds by the national government is the most important measure ever placed before that body in behalf of wild life a stranger to this proposition will need to pause for thought in order to grasp its full meaning and appreciate the magnitude of its influence the urgent necessity for a law of this nature is due to the utter inadequacy of the laws that prevail throughout some portions of the united states concerning the slaughter and preservation of birds any law that is not enforced is a poor law there is not one state in the union nor a single province in canada in which the game birds and other birds criminally shot as game are not being killed far faster than they are breeding and thereby being exterminated several states are financially unable to employ a force of salaried game wardens and wherever that is true the door to universal slaughter is wide open let him who questions this take virginia as a case in point a loyal virginian told me only this year that in his state the warden system is an ineffective farce and the game is not protected because the wardens can not afford to patrol the state for nothing this condition prevails in a number of states north and south especially south it is my belief that throughout ninetenths of the south the negroes and poor whites are slaughtering birds exactly as they please it is the permanent residents of the haunts of birds and game that are exterminating the wild life the value of the birds as destroyers of noxious insects has been set forth in chapter xxiii their total value is enormousor it would be if the birds were alive and here in their normal numbers today there are about onetenth as many birds as were alive and working thirty years ago during the past thirty years the destruction of our game birds has been enormous and the insectivorous birds have greatly decreased the damages annually inflicted upon the farm orchard and garden crops of this country are very great when a city is destroyed by earthquake or fire and 100000000 worth of property is swept away we are racked with horror and pity and the cities of america pour out money like water to relieve the resultant distress we are shocked because we can see the flames the smoke and the ruins and yet we annually endure with perfect equanimity because we can not see it a loss of nearly 400000000 worth of value that is destroyed by insects the damage is inflicted silently insidiously without any scare heads or wooden type in the newspapers and so we pay the price without protest we knowwhen we stop to think of itthat not all this loss falls upon the producer we know that every consumer of bread cereals vegetables and fruit pays his share of this loss today millions of people are groaning under the increased cost of living the bill for the federal protection of all migratory birds is directly intended to decrease the cost of living by preventing outrageous waste but of all the persons to whom the needs of that bill are presented how many will take the time to promote its quick passage by direct appeals to their members of congress we shall see the good that would be accomplished annually by the enactment of a law for the federal protection of all migratory birds is beyond computation but it is my belief that within a very few years the increase in bird life would prevent what is now an annual loss of 250000000 it is beyond the power of man to protect his crops and fruit and trees as the bird millions would protect themif they were here as they were in 1870 the migratory bird bill is of vast importance because it would throw the strong arm of federal protection around 610 species of birds the power of uncle sam is respected and feared in many places where the power of the state is ignored the list of migratory birds includes most of the perching birds all the shore birds great destroyers of bad insects all the swifts and swallows the goatsuckers whippoorwill and nighthawk some of the woodpeckers most of the rails pigeons and doves many of the hawks some of the cranes and herons and all the geese ducks and swans a movement for the federal protection of migratory game birds was proposed to congress by george shiras 3rd who as a member of the house in the 58th congress introduced a bill to secure that end an excellent brief on that subject by mr shiras appeared in the printed hearing on the mclean bill held on march 6 1912 page 18 omitting the bills introduced in the 59th 60th and 61st sessions mention need be made only of the measures under consideration in the present congress one of these is a bill introduced by representative jw weeks of massachusetts and another is the bill of representative dr anthony jr of kansas of the same purport finally on april 24 1912 an adequate and entirely reasonable bill was introduced in the senate by senator george p mclean of connecticut as no 6497 calendar no 606 this bill provides federal protection for all migratory birds and embraces all save a very few of the species that are specially destructive to noxious insects the bill provides national protection to the farmers and fruitgrowers best friends it is entitled to the enthusiastic support of 90000000 of people native and alien every producer of farm products and every consumer of them owes it to himself to write at once to his member of congress and ask him 1 to urge the speedy consideration of the bill for the federal protection of all migratory birds 2 to vote for it and 3 to work for it until it is passed it matters not which one of the three bills described finally becomes a law will the american people act rationally about this matter and protect their own interests suppress the sale of all native wild gamethe deadly effect of the commercial slaughter of game and its sale for food is now becoming well understood by the american people one by one the various state legislatures have been putting up the bars against the exportation or sale of any game protected by the state the us department of agriculture says through henry oldys that free marketing of wild game leads swiftly to extermination and it is literally true up to march 1911 it appears that several states prohibited the sale of game sixteen states permitted the sale of all unprotected game and in eight more there was partial prohibition unfortunately however many of these states permitted the sale of imported game now since it happened to be a fact that the vast majority of the states prohibit the export of their game as well as the sale of it a very large quantity of such game as quail ruffed grouse snipe woodcock and shore birds was illegally shot for the market exported in defiance both of state laws and the federal lacey act and sold to the detriment of the states that produced it in other words in the laws of each state that merely sought to protect their own game regardless of the game of neighboring states there was not merely a loophole but there was a gap wide enough to drive through with a coach and four the ruffed grouse of massachusetts and connecticut often were butchered to make gotham holidays in joyous contempt of the laws at both ends of the line as a natural result the game of the atlantic coast was disappearing at a frightful rate illustration eighteen states entirely prohibit the sale of game why do the others lag behind in 1911 the nosaleofgame law of new york was born out of sheer desperation the army of destruction went up to albany wellorganized well provided with money and attorneys with three senators in the senate and two assemblymen in the lower house to wage merciless warfare on the whole wildlife cause the market gunners and game dealers not only proposed to repeal the law against spring shooting but also to defeat all legislation that might be attempted to restrict the sale of game or impose bag limits on wild fowl the milliners association proposed to wipe off the books the dutcher law against the use of the plumage of wild birds in millinery and an assemblyman was committed to that cause as its special champion then it was that all the friends of wild life in the empire state resolved upon a death grapple with the destroyers and a fight to an absolute finish the bayne bill entirely prohibiting the sale of all native wild game throughout the state of new york was drafted and thrown into the ring and the struggle began at first the nosaleofgame bill looked like sheer madness but no sooner was it fairly launched than supporters came flocking in from every side all the organizations of sportsmen and friends of wild life combined in one mighty army the strength of which was irresistible the real sportsmen of the state quickly realized that the nosale bill was directly in the interest of legitimate sport the great mass of people who love wild life and never kill were quick to comprehend the farreaching importance of the measure and they supported it with money and enthusiasm the members of the legislature received thousands of letters from their constituents asking them to support the bayneblauvelt bill they did so on its passage through the two houses only one vote was recorded against it incidentally every move attempted by the army of destruction was defeated and in the final summing up the defeat amounted to an utter rout in 1912 after a tremendous struggle the legislature of massachusetts passed a counterpart of the bayne law and took her place in the front rank of states that was a great fight the marketgunners of cape cod the game dealers and other interests entered the struggle with men in the lower house of the legislature specially elected to look after their interests just as in new york in 1911 they proposed to repeal the existing laws against spring shooting and throw the markets wide open to the sale of game from first to last through three long and stormy months the destroyers fought with a degree of determination and persistence worthy of a better cause they contested with the defenders every inch of ground in new york the destroyers were overwhelmed by the tidal wave of defenders but in massachusetts it was a prolonged handtohand fight on the ramparts five times was a bill to repeal the springshooting law introduced and defeated even after the bill had passed both houses by good majorities the governor declared that he could not sign it and then there poured into the executive offices such a flood of callers letters telegrams and telephone calls that he became convinced that the people desired the law so he signed the bill in deference to the wishes of the majority the principle that the sale of game is wrong and fatal to the existence of a supply of game is as fixed and unassailable as the rocky mountains its universal acceptance is only a question of intelligence and common honesty the open states owe it to themselves and each other to enact both the spirit and the letter of the bayne law and do it quickly before it is too late to profit by it let them remember the heath henamply protected when entirely too late to save it from extinction it is fairly beyond question that the killing of wild game for the market and its sale in the open season and out of it is responsible for the disappearance of at least fifty per cent of our stock of american feathered game it is the marketgunner the gamehog who shoots for sport and sells his game and the game dealer who have swept away the wild ducks the ruffed grouse the quail and the prairie chickens that thirty years ago were abundant on their natural ranges the foolish farmers of the middle west permitted the markethunters of chicago and the east to slaughter their own legitimate game by the barrel and the carload and ship it east to market today the waters of currituck sound are a wholesale slaughterplace for migratory wild fowl with which to supply the markets of baltimore washington and philadelphia furthermore the market gunners of currituck are robbing the people of 16 states of tens of thousands of wildfowl that legitimately belong to them during the annual autumn flight the accompanying map shows how it is done illustration map used in the campaign for the bayne law this map shows how the sale of ducks killed on the carrituck sound robs the people of 16 states for the benefit of a few stop the sale of game signed wt hornaday march 6 1911 today the cash rewards of the markethunter who can reach a large city with his product are dangerously great observe the following wholesale prices that prevailed in new york city in 1910 just prior to the passage of the bayne law they were compiled and published by henry oldys of the biological survey grouse domestic per pair 300 grouse foreign 125 to 175 partridge domestic 350 400 woodcock domestic 150 200 golden plover per dozen 250 350 english

deer per pound 22 25 venison saddle 30 35 all our feathered game is rapidly slipping away from us are we going to save anything from the wreck will we so weakly manage the game situation that later on there will be no legitimate birdshooting for our younger sons and our grandsons all laws that permit the killing of game for the market and the sale of it afterward are class legislation of the worst sort they permit a hundred men selfishly to slaughter for their own pockets the game that rightfully belongs to a hundred thousand men and boys who shoot for the legitimate recreation that such field sports afford will any of the sportsmen of america stand for this until the game is all gone the people who pay big prices for game in the hotels and restaurants of our big cities are not men who need that game as food far from it they can obtain scores of fine meat dishes without destroying the wild flocks in civilized countries wild game is no longer necessary as food to satisfy hunger and ward off starvation in the united states the day of the hungry indianfighting pioneer has gone by and there is an abundance of food everywhere the time to temporize and feel timid over the game situation has gone by the situation is desperate and nothing but strong and vigorous measures will avail anything worth while the sale of all wild game should be stopped everywhere and at all seasons throughout all north america and throughout the world today this particular curse is being felt even in india it is the duty of every true sportsman every farmer who owns a gun and every lover of wild life to enter into the campaign for the passage of bills absolutely prohibiting all traffic in wild game no matter what its origin of course the market hunters the gamehogs and the game dealers will bitterly oppose them and hire a lobby to attempt to defeat them but the fight for nosaleofgame is now on and it must not stop short of complete victory reasons why the sale of wild game should cease everywhere 1because fully 95 per cent of our legitimate stock of feathered game has already been destroyed 2because if marketgunning and the sale of game continue ten years longer all our feathered game will be swept away 3because when the sale of game was permitted one dealer was able to sell 1000000 game birds per year in new york city so he himself said 4because it is a fixed fact that every wild species of mammal bird or reptile that is pursued for moneymaking purposes eventually is wiped out of existence even the whales of the sea are no exception 5because at least 50 per cent of the decrease in our feathered game is due to marketgunning and the sale of game look at the prairie chicken of the mississippi valley and the ruffed grouse of new england 6because the laws that permit the commercial slaughter of wild birds for the benefit of less than five per cent of the inhabitants of any state are directly against the interest of the 95 per cent of other people to whom that game partly belongs 7because game killed for sale is not intended to satisfy hunger the people who eat game in large cities do not know what hunger is save by hearsay purchased game is used chiefly in overfeeding and as a rule it does far more harm than good 8because the greatest value to be derived from any game bird is in seeing it and photographing it and enjoying its living company in its native haunts who will love the forests when they become destitute of wild life and desolate 9because stopping the sale of game will help bring back the game birds to us in a few years 10because the pace that new york and massachusetts have set in this matter will render it easier to procure the passage of bayne laws in other states 11because those who legitimately desire game for their tables can be supplied from the game farms and preserves that now are coming into existence when new yorks farreaching bayne bill became a law the following dead birds lay in cold storage in new york city wild duck 98156 plover 48780 quail 14227 grouse 21202 snipe 7825 woodcock 767 rail 419 191376 they represented the last slaughterings of american game for new york today the remaining plaguespots are chicago philadelphia san francisco baltimore washington and new orleans but in new orleans the brakes have at last 1912 been applied and the market slaughter that formerly prevailed in that state has at least been checked as an instance of persistent market shooting on the greatest ducking waters of the eastern united states i offer this report from a trustworthy agent sent to currituck sound north carolina in march 1911 i beg to submit the following information relative to the number of wild ducks and geese shipped from this market and killed in the waters of back bay and the upper or north end of currituck sound from october 20th to march 1st inclusive approximately there were killed and shipped in the territory above named 130000 to 135000 wild ducks and between 1400 and 1500 wild geese from currituck sound and its tributaries there were shipped approximately 200000 wild ducks you will see from the above figures that each year the market shooter exacts a tremendous toll from the wild water fowl in these waters and it is only a question of a short time when the wild duck will be exterminated unless we can stop the ruthless slaughter the last few years i have noted a great decrease in the number of wild ducks some of the species are practically extinct i have secured the above information from a most reliable source and the figures given approximately cannot be questioned the effect of the passage of the bayne law closing the greatest american market against the sale of game was an immediate decrease of fully fifty per cent in the number of ducks and geese slaughtered on currituck sound the dealers refused to buy the birds and onehalf the killers were compelled to hang up their guns and go to work the duckslaughterers felt very much enraged by the passage of the law and at first were inclined to blame the northern members of currituck ducking clubs for the passage of the measure but as a matter of fact not one of the persons blamed took any part whatever in the campaign for the new law the unfairness of spring shootingthe shooting of game birds in late winter and spring is to be mentioned only to be condemned it is grossly unfair to the birds outrageous in principle and most unsportsmanlike no matter whether the law permits it or not why it is that any state like iowa for example can go on killing game in spring is more than i can understand i have endeavored to find a reason for it in iowa but the only real reason isthe boys want the birds i think we have at last reached the point where it may truthfully be said that now no gentleman shoots birds in spring if the plea is made that if we dont shoot ducks in the spring we cant shoot them at all then the answer isif you cant shoot game like highminded redblooded sportsman dont shoot it at all a gentleman can not afford to barter his standing and his own selfrespect for a few ducks shot in the spring when the birds are going north to lay their eggs and the man who insists on shooting in spring may just as well go right on and do various other things that are beyond the pale such as shoot quail on the ground shoot does and fawns and fish for trout with gang hooks there are no longer two sides to what once was the spring shooting question even among savages the breeding period of the wild creatures is under taboo then if ever may the beasts and birds cry kings excuse it has been positively stated in print that highclass fox hounds have been known to refuse to chase a pregnant fox even when in full view chapter xxxiii bringing back the vanished birds and game the most charming trait of wildlife character is the alacrity and confidence with which wild birds and mammals respond to the friendly advances of human friends those who are not very familiar with the mental traits of our wild neighbors may at first find it difficult to comprehend the marvelous celerity with which both birds and mammals recognize friendly overtures from man and respond to them at the present juncture this state of the wildanimal mind becomes a factor of great importance in determining what we can do to prevent the extermination of species and to promote the increase and return of wild life i think that there is not a single wild mammal or bird species now living that can not or does not quickly recognize protection and take advantage of it the most conspicuous of all familiar examples are the wild animals of the yellowstone park they embrace the elk mountain sheep antelope mule deer the black bear and even the grizzly no one can say precisely how long those several species were in ascertaining that it was safe to trust themselves within easy rifleshot of man but i think it was about five years birds recognize protection far more quickly than mammals in a comparatively short time the naturally wild and wary big game of the yellowstone park became about as tame as range cattle it was at least fifteen years ago that the mule deer began to frequent the parade ground at the mammoth hot springs military post and receive there their rations of hay whenever you see a beautiful photograph of a large band of bighorn sheep or mule deer taken at short range amid rocky mountain scenery you are safe in labeling it as having come from the yellowstone park the pronghorned antelope herd is so tame that it is difficult to keep it out of the streets of gardiner on the montana side of the line but the bears who has not heard the story of the bears of the yellowstone parkhow black bears and grizzlies stalk out of the woods every day to the garbage dumpingground how black bears actually have come into the hotels for food without breaking the truce and how the grizzlies boldly raid the grubwagons and cooktents of campers taking just what they please because they know that no man dares to shoot them indeed those raiding bears long ago became a public nuisance and many of them have been caught in steel boxtraps and shipped to zoological gardens in order to get them out of the way and yet outside the park boundaries everywhere the bears are as wary and wild as the wildest the arrogance of the bears that couldnt be shot once led to a droll and also exciting episode during the period when mr cj jones buffalo jones was superintendent of the wild animals of the park the indignities inflicted upon tourist campers by certain grizzly bears quite abraded his nerves he obtained from major pitcher authority to punish and reform a certain grizzly and went about the matter in a thoroughly buffalojonesian manner he procured a strong lariat and a beanpole seven feet long and repaired to the camp that was troubled by too much grizzly the particular offender was a fullgrown male grizzly who had become a notorious raider at the psychological moment jones lassoed him in short order getting a firm hold on the bears left hind leg quickly the end of the rope was thrown over a limb of the nearest tree and in a trice ephraim found himself swinging head downward between the heavens and the earth and then his punishment began buffalo jones thrashed him soundly with the beanpole the outraged bear swung to and fro whirled round and round clawing and snapping at the empty air roaring and bawling with rage scourged in flesh and insulted in spirit as he swung the beanpole searched out the different parts of his anatomy with a wonderful degree of neatness and precision between rage and indignation the grizzly nearly exploded a movingpicture camera was there and since that day that truly moving scene has amazed and thrilled countless thousands of people when it was over mr jones boldly turned the bear loose although its rage was as boundless as the glories of the yellowstone park it paused not to rend any of those present but headed for the tall timber and with many an indignant woof woof it plunged in and disappeared it was two or three years before that locality was again troubled by impudent grizzly bears and what is the mental attitude of every rocky mountain black or grizzly bear outside of the yellowstone park it is colossal suspicion of man perpetual fear and a clean pair of heels the moment manscent or mansight proclaims the proximity of the arch enemy of wild creatures and yet there are one or two men who tell the american public that wild animals do not think that they do not reason and are governed only by instinct a little knowledge is a dangerous thing taming wild birdsas incontestable proof of the receptive faculties of birds i will cite the taming of wild birds in the open by friendly advances there are hundreds aye thousands of men women boys and girls who could give interesting and valuable personal testimony on this point my friend j alden loring one of the naturalists of the roosevelt african expedition is an ardent lover of wild birds and mammals the taming of wild creatures in the open is one of his pastimes and his results serve well to illustrate the marvelous readiness of our wild neighbors to become close friends with man when protected i will quote from one of mr lorings letters on this subject taming wild birds is a new field in nature study and one never can tell what success he will have until he has experimented with different species some birds tame much more easily than others on three or four occasions i have enticed a chickadee to my hand at the first attempt while in other cases it has taken from fifteen minutes to a whole day chipping sparrows that frequent my doorway i have tamed in two days a nuthatch required three hours before it would fly to my hand although it took food from my stick the first time it was offered when you find a bird on her nest it is of course much easier to tame that individual than if you had to follow it about in the open and wait for it to come within reach of a stick by exercising extreme caution and approaching inch by inch i have climbed a tree to the nest of a yellowthroated vireo and at the first attempt handed the bird a mealworm with my fingers at one time i had two house wrens a yellowthroated vireo a chipping sparrow and a flock of chickadees that would come to my hand illustration six wild chipmunks dine with mr loring it would be possibleand also delightfulto fill a volume with citations of evidence to illustrate the quick acceptance of mans protection by wild birds and mammals let me draw a few illustrations from my own wild neighbors on lake agassiz in the ny zoological park within 500 feet of my office in the administration building a pair of wild woodducks made their nest last spring and have just finished rearing nine fine healthy young birds whenever you see a woodduck rise and fly in our park you may know that it is a wild bird during the summer of 1912 a small flock of wild woodducks came every night to our wildfowl pond and spent the night there a year ago a covey of eleven quail appeared in the park and have persistently remained ever since last fall and winter they came at least twenty times to a spot within forty feet of the rear window of my office in order to feed upon the wheat screenings that we placed there for them when we first occupied the zoological park grounds in 1899 there was not one wild rabbit in the whole 264 acres presently the species appeared and rabbits began to hop about confidently all over the place in 1906 we estimated that there were about eighty individuals then the marauding cats began to come in and they killed off the rabbits until not one was to be seen thereupon we addressed ourselves to those cats in more serious earnest than ever before now the cats have disappeared and one day last spring as i left my office at six oclock everyone else having previously gone i almost stepped upon two halfgrown bunnies that had been visiting on the front doormat when we were macadamizing the yards around the elephant house with a throng of workmen all about every day a robin made its nest on the heavy channeliron frame of one of the large elephant gates that swung to and fro nearly every day in 1900 we planted a young pine tree in front of our temporary office building within six feet of a main walk and at once a pair of robins nested in it and reared young there illustration wild creatures quickly respond to friendly advances chickadee and chipmunk tamed by mr loring illustration the colorado object lesson in bringing back the ducks up in putnam county where for five years deer have been protected the exhibitions that are given each year of the supreme confidence of protected deer literally astonish the natives they are almost unafraid of man and his vehicles his cattle and his horses but of course they are unwilling to be handled strangers are astonished but people who know something about the mental attitude of wild animals under protection know that it is the natural and inevitable result of real protection at mr frank seamans summer home in the catskills the phoebe birds nest on the beams under the roof of the porch at my summer home in the berkshires no sooner was our garage completed than a phoebe built her nest on the edge of the lintel over the side door and another built on a drainpipe over the kitchen door near port jervis last year a wild ruffed grouse nested and reared a large brood in the garden of mr wi mitchell within two feet of the foundation of the house on the bull river in the wilds of british columbia two trappers of my acquaintance mack norboe and charlie smith once formed a friendship with a wild weasel in a very few visits the weasel found that it was among friends and the trappers log cabin became its home i have a photograph of it taken while it posed on the doorsill the trappers said that often when returning at nightfall from their traplines the weasel would meet them a hundred yards away on the trail and follow them back to the cabin old ben the big sealion who often landed on the wharf at avalon santa catalina to be fed on fish was personally known to thousands of people an object lesson in protectiona remarkable object lesson in the recognition of protection by wild ducks came under my notice in the pages of recreation magazine in june 1903 when that publication was edited by go shields the article was entitled a haven of refuge and the place described well deserved the name it is impossible for me to impress upon the readers of this volume with sufficient force and clearness the splendid success that is easily attainable in encouraging the return of the birds the story of the mosca haven of refuge was so well told by mr charles c townsend in the publication referred to above that i take pleasure in reproducing it entire one mile north of the little village of mosca colorado in san luis valley lives the family of jc gray on the gray ranch there is an artesian well which empties into a small pond about 100 feet square this pond is never entirely frozen over and the water emptying therein is warm even during the coldest winter some five years ago mr gray secured a few wildduck eggs and hatched them under a hen the little ducks were reared and fed on the little pond the following spring they left the place to return in the fall bringing with them broods of young also bringing other ducks to the home where protection was afforded them and plenty of good feed was provided each year since the ducks have scattered in the spring to mate and rear their families returning again with greatly increased numbers in the fall and again bringing strangers to the haven of refuge i drove out to the ranch november 24 1902 and found the little pond almost black with the birds and was fortunate enough to secure a picture of a part of the pond while the ducks were thickly gathered thereon ice had formed around the edges and this ice was covered with ducks the water was also alive with others which paid not the least attention to the party of strangers on the shore from mr gray i learned that there were some 600 ducks of various kinds on the pond at that time though it was then early for them to seek winter quarters later in the year he assured me there would be between 2000 and 3000 teal mallards canvasbacks redheads and other varieties all perfectly at home and fearless of danger the family have habitually approached the pond from the house which stands on the south side and should any person appear on the north side of the pond the ducks immediately take fright and flight wheat was strewn on the ground and in the water and the ducks waddled around us within a few inches of our feet to feed paying not the least attention to us or to the old housedog which walked near six miles east of the ranch is san luis lake to which these ducks travel almost daily while the lake is open when they are at the lake it is impossible to approach within gunshot of the then timid birds some unsympathetic boys and men have learned the habit of the birds and place themselves in hiding along the course of flight to and from the lake many ducks are shot in this way but woe to the person caught firing a gun on or near the homepond when away from home the birds are as other wildducks and fail to recognize any members of the gray family while at home they follow the boys around the barnyard squawking for feed like so many tame ducks this is the greatest sight i have ever witnessed and one that i could not believe existed until i had seen it certainly it is worth travelling many miles to see and no one after seeing it would care to shoot birds that when kindly treated make such charming pets since the above was published the protected flocks of tame wild ducks have become one of the most interesting sights of florida at palm beach the tameness of the wild ducks when within their protected area and their wildness outside of it has been witnessed by thousands of visitors the saving of the snowy egret in the united statesthe time was when very many persons believed that the devastations of the plumehunters of florida and the gulf coast would be so long continued and so persistently followed up to the logical conclusion that both species of plumefurnishing egrets would disappear from the avifauna of the united states this expectation gave rise to feelings of resentment indignation and despair it happened however that almost at the last moment a solitary individual set on foot an enterprise calculated to preserve the snowy egret which is the smaller of the two species involved from final extermination the splendid success that has attended the efforts of mr edward a mcilhenny of avery island louisiana is entitled not only to admiration and praise but also to the higher tribute of practical imitation mr mcilhenny is first of all a lover of birds and a humanitarian he has traveled widely throughout the continent of north america and elsewhere and has seen much of wild life and mans influence upon it today his highest ambition is to create for the benefit of the present and as a heritage to posterity a midcontinental chain of great bird refuges in which migrating wild fowl and birds of all other species may find restingplaces and refuges during their migrations and protected feedinggrounds in winter in this grand enterprise the consummation of which is now in progress mr mcilhenny is associated with mr charles willis ward joint donor of the splendid wardmcilhenny bird preserve of 13000 acres which recently was presented to the state of louisiana by its former owners the egret and heron preserve however is mr mcilhennys individual enterprise and really furnished the motif of the larger movement of its inception and development he has kindly furnished me the following account accompanied by many beautiful photographs of egrets breeding in sanctuary one of which appears on page 27 in some recent publications i have seen statements to the effect that you believed the egrets were nearing extinction owing to the persecution of plume hunters so i know that you will be interested in the enclosed photographs which were taken in my heron rookery situated within 100 yards of my factory where i am now sitting dictating this letter this rookery was started by me in 1896 because i saw at that time that the herons of louisiana were being rapidly exterminated by plume hunters my thought was that the way to preserve them would be to start an artificial rookery of them where they could be thoroughly protected with this end in view i built a small pond taking in a wet space that contained a few willows and other shrubs which grow in wet places in a large cage in this pond i raised some snowy herons after keeping the birds in confinement for something over six months i turned them loose hoping that they would come back the next season as they were perfectly tame and were used to seeing people i was rewarded the next season by four of the birds returning and nesting in the willows in the pond this was the start of a rookery that now covers 35 acres and contains more than twenty thousand pairs of nesting birds embracing not only the egrets but all the species of herons found in louisiana besides many other water birds with a view to carrying on the preservation of our birds on a larger scale mr chas w ward and i have recently donated to the state of louisiana 13000 acres of what i consider to be the finest wild fowl feeding ground on the louisiana coast as it contains the only gravel beach for 50 miles and all of the geese within that space come daily to this beach for gravel this territory also produces a great amount of natural food for geese and ducks saving the gulls and ternsbut for the vigorous and longcontinued efforts of the audubon societies i think our coasts would by this time have been swept clean of the gulls and terns that now adorn it twenty years ago the milliners were determined to have them all the fight for them was long and hotly contested but the audubon societies won it was a great victory and has yielded results of great value to the country at large and yet it was only a small number of persons who furnished the money and made the fight which inured to the benefit of the millions of american people hereafter whenever you see an american gull or tern remind yourself that it was saved to the nation by the audubon people in times of grave emergency such as fire war and scarcity of food the wild creatures forget their fear of man and many times actually surrender themselves to his mercy and protection at such times hard is the heart and low is the code of manly honor that does not respond in a manner becoming a superior species the most pathetic wildanimal situation ever seen in the united states on a large scale is that which for six winters in succession forced several thousand starving elk into the settlement of jackson hole wyoming in quest of food at the hands of their natural enemies the elk lost all fear partly because they were not attacked and they surrounded the logenclosed haystacks barns and houses mutely begging for food previous to the winter of 1911 thousands of weak calves and cows perished around the haystacks mr sn leeks wonderful pictures tell a thrilling but very sad story to the everlasting honor of the people of jackson hole be it recorded that they rose like men to the occasion that confronted them in 1909 they gave to the elk herds all the hay that their domestic stock could spare not pausing to ascertain whether they ever would be reimbursed for it they just handed it out the famishing animals literally mobbed the haywagons today the national government has the situation in hand in times of peace and plenty the people of jackson hole take their toll of the elk herds but their example during starvation periods is to be commended to all men a slaughter of restored gamethe case of the chamois in switzerland teaches the world a valuable lesson in how not to slaughter game that has come back to its haunts through protected breeding a few years ago one of the provinces of switzerland took note of the fact that its onceabundant stock of chamois was almost extinct and enacted a law by which the remnant was absolutely protected for a long period during those years of protection the animals bred and multiplied until finally the original number was almost restored thenas always in such casesthere arose a strong demand for an open season and eventually the government yielded to the pressure of the hunters and fixed a date whereon an open season should begin illustration gulls and terns of our coasts saved from destruction these birds have been saved and brought back to us by the splendid efforts of the audubon societies and other birdlovers but for the antiplumage laws not one gull or tern would now remain on our atlantic coast from the american natural history during the period preceding that fatal date the living chamois grown half tame by years of immunity from the guns were all carefully located and marked down by those who intended to hunt them at daybreak on the fatal day the onset began guns and hunters were everywhere and the mountains resounded with the fusillade hundreds of chamois were slain by hundreds of hunters and by the close of that fatal open season the species was more nearly exterminated throughout that region than ever before once more those mountains were nice and barren of game let that bloody and disgraceful episode serve as a warning to americans who are tempted to demand an open season on game that has bred back from the verge of extinction particularly do we commend it to the notice of the people of colorado who even now are demanding an open season on the preserved mountain sheep of that state the granting of such an open season would be a brutal outrage those sheep are now so tame and unsuspicious that the killing of them would be coldblooded murder the logical conclusionwithin reasonable limits any partlydestroyed wild species can be increased and brought back by giving absolute protection from harassment and slaughter when a species is struggling to recuperate it deserves to be left entirely unmolested until it is once more on safe ground every breeding wild animal craves seclusion and entire immunity from excitement and all forms of molestation nature simply demands this as her unassailable right it is my firm belief that any wild species will breed in captivity whenever its members are given a degree of seclusion that they deem satisfactory with species that have not been shot down to a point entirely too low adequate protection generously long in duration will bring back their numbers if the people of the united states so willed it we could have wild whitetailed deer in every state and in every county save city counties between the atlantic and the rocky mountains we could easily have one thousand bob white quail for every one now living we could have squirrels in every grove and songbirds by the millionmerely by protecting them from slaughter and molestation from ohio to the great plains the pinnated grouse could be made far more common than crows and blackbirds inasmuch as all this is trueand no one with information will dispute it for a momentis it not folly to seek to supplant our own splendid native species of game birds that we never yet have decently protected with foreign species let the american people answer this question with yes or no the methods by which our nongame birds can be encouraged and brought back are very simple protect them put up shelters for them give them nestboxes in abundance protect them from cats dogs and all other forms of destruction and feed those that need to be fed i should think that every boy living in the country would find keen pleasure in making and erecting nestboxes for martins wrens and squirrels in putting up straw teepees in winter for the quail in feeding the quail and in nailing to the trees chunks of suet and fat pork every winter for the woodpeckers nuthatches and other winter residents will any person now on this earth live long enough to see the present allpervading and devilish spirit of slaughter so replaced by the love of wild creatures and the true spirit of conservation that it will be as rare as it now is common but let no one think for a moment that any vanishing species can at any time be brought back for that would be a grave error the point is always reached by every such species that the survivors are too few to cope with circumstances and recovery is impossible the heath hen could not be brought back neither could the passenger pigeon the whooping crane the sage grouse the trumpeter swan the wild turkey and the upland plover never will come back to us and nothing that we can do ever will bring them back circumstances are against those speciesand i fear against many others also thanks to the fact that the american bison breeds well in captivity we have saved that species from complete extinction but our antelope seems to be doomed it is because of the alarming condition of our best wild life that quick action and strong action is vitally necessary we are sleeping on our possibilities chapter xxxiv introduced species that have been beneficial man has made numerous experiments in the transplantation of wild species of mammals and birds from one country or continent to another about onehalf these efforts have been beneficial and the other half have resulted disastrously the transplantation of any wildanimal species is a leap in the dark on general principles it is dangerous to meddle with the laws of nature and attempt to improve upon the code of the wilderness our best wisdom in such matters may easily prove to be shortsighted folly the trouble lies in the fact that concerning transplantation it is impossible for us to know beforehand all the conditions that will affect it or that it will effect and how it will work out in its own home a species may seem not only harmless but actually beneficial to man we do not know and we can not know all the influences that keep it in check and that mould its character we do not know and we can not know without a trial how new environment will affect it and what new traits of character it will develop under radically different conditions the gentle dove of europe may become the tyrant dove of cathay the repressed rabbit of the old world becomes in australia the uncontrollable rabbit a devastator and a pest of pests no wild species should be transplanted and set free in a wild state to stock new regions without consulting men of wisdom and following their advice it is now against the laws of the united states to introduce and acclimatize in a wild state anywhere in the united states any wildbird species without the approval of the department of agriculture the law is a wise one furthermore the same principle should apply to birds that it is proposed to transplant from one portion of the united states into another especially when the two are widely separated on this point i once learned a valuable lesson which may well point my present moral incidentally also it was a narrow escape for me a gentlemen of my acquaintance who admires the european magpie and is well aware of its acceptable residence in various countries in europe once requested my cooperation in securing and acclimatizing at his country estate a number of birds of that species as in duty bound i laid the matter before our department of agriculture and asked for an opinion the department replied in effect why import a foreign magpie when we have in the west a species of our own quite as handsome and which could more easily be transplanted the point seemed well taken now i had seen much of the american magpie in its wild homethe rocky mountains and the western border of the great plainsand i thought i was acquainted with it i knew that a few complaints against it had been made but they had seemed to me very trivial to me our magpie seemed to have a generally unobjectionable record fortunately for me i wrote to mr hershey assistant curator of ornithology in the colorado state museum for assistance in procuring fifty birds for transplantation to the state of new york mr hershey replied that if i really wished the birds for acclimatization he would gladly procure them for me but he said that in the thicklysettled farming communities of colorado the magpie is now regarded as a pest it devours the eggs and nestlings of other wild birds and not only that it destroys so many eggs of domestic poultry that many farmers are compelled to keep their egglaying hens shut up in wire enclosures now this condition happened to be entirely unknown to me because i never had seen the american magpie in action in a farming community of course the proposed experiment was promptly abandoned but it is embarrassing to think how near i came to making a mistake even if the magpies had been transplanted and had become a nuisance in this state they could easily have been exterminated by shooting but the memory of the error would have been humiliating to the party of the first part the old world pheasants in americain 1881 the first chinese ringnecked pheasants were introduced into the united states twelve miles below portland oregon twelve males and three females the next year oregon gave pheasants a fiveyear close season a little later the golden and silver pheasants of china were introduced and all three species throve mightily on the pacific coast in oregon washington and western british columbia in 1900 the sportsmen of portland and vancouver were shooting cock golden pheasants according to law the success of chinese and japanese pheasants on the pacific coast soon led to experiments in the more progressive states at state expense state pheasant hatcheries have been established in massachusetts connecticut new york new jersey ohio illinois missouri iowa and california in many localities the oldworld pheasants have come to stay the rise and progress of the ringneck in western new york has already been noted it came about merely through protection that protection was protection in fact not the false protection that shoots on the sly it is the irony of fate that full protection should be accorded a foreign bird in order that it may multiply and possess the land while the same kind of protection is refused the native bob white and it is now almost a dead species so far as this state is concerned in looking about for grievances against the ringnecked and english pheasant some persons have claimed that in winter these birds are budders which means that they harmfully strip trees and bushes of the buds that those bushes will surely need in their spring opening on that point dr joseph kalbfus secretary of the pennsylvania game commission sent out a circular letter of inquiry in response to which he received many statements with but one exception all the testimony received was to the effect that pheasants are not budeaters and that generally the charge is unfounded the introduction of oldworld pheasants and the attempted introduction of the hungarian partridge are efforts designed first of all to furnish sportsmen something to shoot and incidentally to provide a new food supply for the table the people of this country are not starving nor are they even very hungry for the meat of strange birds but as a foodproducer the pheasant is all right it disgusts me to the core however to see states that wantonly and wickedly through sheer apathy and lack of business enterprise have allowed the quail the heath hen the pinnated grouse and the ruffed grouse to become almost exterminated by extravagant and foolish shooters now putting forth wonderfully diligent efforts and spending money without end in introducing foreign species many men actually take the ground that our game cant live in its own country any longer but only the ignorant and the unthinking will say so give our game birds decent sensible actual protection stop their being slaughtered far faster than they breed and they will live anywhere in their own native haunts but where is there one species of upland game bird in america that has been sensibly and adequately protected from portland maine to portland oregon there is not onenot a single locality in which protection from shooting has been sensible or just or adequate we have universally given our american upland game birds an unfair deal and now we are adding insult to slaughter by bringing in foreign game birds to replace thembecause our birds cant live before five million shotguns our american game birds can live anywhere in the haunts where nature placed them that are not today actually occupied by cities and towns give me the making of the laws and i will make the prairie chicken and quail as numerous throughout the northern states east of the great plains as domestic chickens are outside the regular poultry farms there is only one reason why there are not ten million quail in the state of new york todayone for each human inhabitantand that reason is the infernal greed and selfishness of the men who have almost exterminated our quail by overshooting dont talk to me about the hard winters killing off our quail it is the hard cheek of the men who shoot them when they ought to let them alone the state of iowa could support 500000 prairie chickens and never miss the waste grain that they would glean in the fields but now the prairie chicken is practically extinct in iowa only a few scattered specimens remaining as last survivors in some of the northern counties the migration of those birds that unexpectedly came down from the north last winter was like the fall of a meteoronly the birds promptly faded away again why should new york new jersey and massachusetts exterminate the heath hen and coddle the ringnecked pheasant and the hungarian partridge the introduction of the oldworld pheasants interests me very little every one that i see is a painful reminder of our slaughtered quail and grousethe birds that never have had a square deal from the american people thus far the introduction of the hungarian partridge has not been successful anywhere connecticut missouri new jersey and i think other states have tried this and failed the failure of that species brings no sorrow to me i prefer our own game birds and if the american people will not conserve those properly and decently they deserve to have no game birds the european red deer in new zealandoccasionally a gameless land makes a tenstrike by introducing a foreign game animal that does no harm and becomes of great value the greatest success ever made in the transplantation of game animals has been in new zealand originally new zealand possessed no large animals and no biggame when nature passed around the deer antelopes sheep goats wild cattle and bears new zealand failed to receive her share for centuries her splendid forests her grand mountains and picturesque valleys remained untenanted by big game in 1864 the prince consort of england caused seven head of european red deer to be taken from the royal park at windsor and sent to christchurch new zealand only three of the animals survived the long voyage a buck and two does for several weeks the two were kept in a barn in christchurch where they served no good purpose and were not likely to live long or be happy finally some one said lets set them free in the mountains the idea was adopted the three animals were hauled an uncertain number of miles into the interior mountains and set free they promptly settled down in their new home they began to breed and now on the north island there are probably five thousand european red deer every one of which has descended directly from the famous three and here is the strangest part of the story the red deer of the north island represent the greatest case of inandin breeding of wild animals on record according to the experience of the world in the breeding of domestic cattle not horses we should expect physical deterioration the development of diseases and disaster on the contrary the usual evil results of inbreeding in domestic cattle have been totally absent the red deer of new zealand are today physically larger and more robust animals with longer and heavier antlers and longer hair than any of the red deer of europe west of germany red deer have been introduced practically all over new zealand and the total number now in the islands must be somewhere near forty thousand the sportsmen of that country have grand sport and take many splendid trophies that transplantation has been a very great success incidentally the case of the inbred deer of the north island taken along with other cases of which we know establishes a new and important principle in evolution it is this when healthy wild animals are established in a state of nature either absolutely free or confined in preserves so large that they roam at will seek the food of nature and take care of themselves inandin breeding produces no ill effects and ceases to be a factor the animals develop in physical perfection according to the climate and their food supply and the introduction of new blood is not necessary the fallow deer on the island of lambayin the irish sea a few miles from the southeast coast of ireland is the island of lambay owned by cecil baring esq the island is precisely one square mile in area and some of its sea frontage terminates in perpendicular cliffs in many ways the island is of unusual interest to zoologists and its fauna has been well set forth by mr baring in the year 1892 three fallow deer dama vulgaris a buck and two does were transplanted from a park on the irish mainland to lambay and there set free from that slender stock has sprung a large herd which but for the many deer that have been purposely shot and the really considerable number that have been killed by going over the cliffs in stormy weather the progeny of the original three would today number several hundred head no new blood has been introduced and no deer have died of disease even counting out the losses by the rifle and by accidental death the herd today numbers more than one hundred head mr baring declares that neither he nor his gamekeeper have ever been able to discover any deterioration in the deer of lambay either in size weight size of antlers fertility or general physical stamina the deterioration through disease especially tuberculosis that always is dreaded and often observed in closely inbred domestic cattle has been totally absent in looking about for wild species that have been transplanted and that have thriven and become beneficial to man there seems to be mighty little game in sight the vast majority belong in the next chapter we will venture to mention the bob white quail that were introduced into utah in 1871 into idaho in 1875 and the california valley quail in washington in 1857 wherever these efforts have succeeded the results have been beneficial to man in 1879 a wellorganized effort was made to introduce european quail into several of the new england and middle statesto take the place of the bob white we may supposethe bird that cant stand the winters about three thousand birds were distributed and set freeand went down and out just as might have been expected during the past twenty years it is safe to say that not less than 500000 have been expended in the northern states and particularly in the northeastern states in importing live quail from kansas the indian territory oklahoma texas the carolinas and other southern states for restocking areas from which the northern bob white had been exterminated by foolish overshooting i think that fully ninetenths of these efforts have ended in total failure the quail could not survive in their strange environment i cannot recall a single instance in which restocking northern covers with southern quail has been a success there is no royal road to the restoration of an exterminated bird species where the native seed still exists by long labor and travail thorough protection and a mighty long close season it can be encouraged to breed back and return but it is an evolution that can not be hurried in the least protect nature and leave the rest to her with mammals the case is different it is possible to restock depleted areas provided time is recognized as a dominant factor i can cite two interesting cases by way of illustration but this subject will form another chapter in the transplantation of fishes conditions are widely different and many notable successes have been achieved one of the greatest hits ever made by the united states bureau of fisheries in the planting of fish in new localities was the introduction of the striped bass or rockfish roccus lineatus of our atlantic coast into the coast waters of california in 1879 135 live fish were deposited in karquines strait at martinez and in 1882 300 more were planted in suisun bay near the first locality chosen twelve years after the first planting in san francisco bay the markets of san francisco handled 149997 pounds of striped bass at that time the average weight for a whole year was eleven pounds and the average price was ten cents per pound fish weighing as high as fortynine pounds have been taken and there are reasons for the belief that eventually the fish of california will attain as great weight as those of the atlantic and the gulf the san francisco markets now sell annually about one and one half million pounds of striped bass this fish has taken its place among anglers as one of the game fishes of the california coast and affords fine sport strange to say however it has not yet spread beyond the shores of california regarding this species the records of the united states bureau of fisheries are of interest in 1897 the california markets handled 2949642 pounds worth 225527american natural history nowhere else in the world we venture to say were such extensive costly and persistent efforts put forth in the transplantation of any wild foreign species as the old us fish commission under prof spencer f baird put forth in the introduction of the german carp into the fresh water ponds lakes and rivers of the united states it was held that because the carp could live and thrive in waters bottomed with mud that species would be a boon to all inland regions where bodies of water or streams were scarce and dear although the carp is not the best fish in the world for the table it seemed that the dwellers in the prairie and great plains regions would find it far better than bullheads or no fish at allwhich are about the same thing by means of special fish cars sent literally all over the united states at a great total expense live carp hatched in the ponds near the washington monument were distributed to all applicants the german carp spread far and wide but today i think the fish has about as many enemies as friends in some places strong objections have been filed to the manner in which carp stir up the mud at the bottom of ponds and small lakes greatly to the detriment of all the native fishes found therein chapter xxxv introduced species that have become pests the man who successfully transplants or introduces into a new habitat any persistent species of living thing assumes a very grave responsibility every introduced species is doubtful gravel until panned out the enormous losses that have been inflicted upon the world through the perpetuation of follies with wild vertebrates and insects would if added together be enough to purchase a principality the most aggravating feature of these follies in transplantation is that never yet have they been made severely punishable we are just as careless and easygoing on this point as we were about the government of the yellowstone park in the days when howell and other poachers destroyed our first national bison herd and when caught redhandedas howell was skinning seven park bison cowscould not be punished for it because there was no penalty prescribed by any law today there is a way in which any revengeful person could inflict enormous damage on the entire south at no cost to himself involve those states in enormous losses and the expenditure of vast sums of money yet go absolutely unpunished the gypsy moth is a case in point this winged calamity was imported at maiden massachusetts near boston by a french entomologist mr leopold trouvelot in 1868 or 69 history records the fact that the man of science did not purposely set free the pest he was endeavoring with live specimens to find a moth that would produce a cocoon of commercial value to america and a sudden gust of wind blew out of his study through an open window his living and breeding specimens of the gypsy moth the moth itself is not bad to look at but its larvae is a great overgrown brute with an appetite like a hog immediately mr trouvelot sought to recover his specimens and when he failed to find them all like a man of real honor he notified the state authorities of the accident every effort was made to recover all the specimens but enough escaped to produce progeny that soon became a scourge to the trees of massachusetts the method of the big nastylooking mottledbrown caterpillar was very simple it devoured the entire foliage of every tree that grew in its sphere of influence the gypsy moth spread with alarming rapidity and persistence in course of time the state authorities of massachuestts were forced to begin a relentless war upon it by poisonous sprays and by fire it was awful up to this date 1912 the new england states and the united states government service have expended in fighting this pest about 7680000 the spread of this pest has been retarded but the gypsy moth never will be wholly stamped out today it exists in rhode island connecticut and new hampshire and it is due to reach new york at an early date it is steadily spreading in three directions from boston its original point of departure and when it strikes the state of new york we too will begin to pay dearly for the trouvclot experiment it is said that general sc lawrence of medford massachusetts has spent 75000 in trying to protect his trees from the ravages of this scourge the rabbit plague in australia and new zealandthe rabbit curse upon australia and new zealand is so well known as to require little comment in this case the introduction was deliberate in the days when the sheep industry was most prosperous a patriotic gentleman conceived the idea that the introduction of the rabbit and its establishment as a wild animal would be a good thing he reasoned that it would furnish a good food supply that it would furnish sport and being unable to harm any other creature of flesh and blood it was therefore harmless accordingly three pairs of rabbits were imported and set free in a short time the immense number of rabbits that began to overrun the country furnished food for reflection as well as for the table a very simple calculation brought out the startling information that under perfectly favorable conditions a single pair of rabbits could in three years time produce progeny amounting to 13718000 individuals ever since that time in discussing the rabbits of australia it has been necessary to speak in millions the inhabitants of the colony says dr richard lydekker soon found that the rabbits were a plague for they devoured the grass which was needed for the sheep the bark of trees and every kind of fruit and vegetable until the prospects of the colony became a very serious matter and ruin seemed inevitable in new south wales upwards of 15000000 rabbits skins have been exported in a single year while in thirteen years ending with 1889 no less than 39000000 were accounted for in victoria alone to prevent the increase of these rodents the introduction of weasels stoats mongooses etc has been tried but it has been found that those carnivores neglected the rabbits and took to feeding on poultry and thus became as great a nuisance as the animals they were intended to destroy the attempt to kill them off by the introduction of an epidemic disease has also failed in order to protect such portions of the country as are still free from rabbits fences of wire netting have been erected one of these fences erected by the government of victoria extending for a distance of upwards of one hundred and fifty geographical miles in new zealand where the rabbit has been introduced little more than twenty years its increase has been so enormous and the destruction it inflicts so great that in some districts it has actually been a question whether the colonists should not vacate the country rather than attempt to fight against the plague the average number of rabbit skins exported from new zealand is now twelve millionsroyal natural history the fox pest in australiaand now unfortunate australia has a new pest also acquired by importation of an alien species it is the european fox vulpes vulpes the only redeeming feature about this fresh calamity is found in the fact that the species was not deliberately introduced into australia for the benefit of the local fauna mr ow rosenhain of melbourne informs me 1912 that about thirty years ago the hunt club brought to australia about twenty foxes for the promotion of the noble sport of fox hunting in some untoward manner the most of those animals escaped they survived multiplied and have provided new south wales victoria and south australia with a fox pest of the first rank the destruction of wild bird life and poultry has become so serious that australia now is making vigorous efforts to exterminate the pest the government pays ten shillings bounty on fox scalps besides which each prime fox skin is worth from four to five dollars it is hoped that these combined values will eliminate the fox pest regarding foxes in australia mr whd le souef has this to say in his extremely interesting and valuable book wild life in australia page 146 we found that foxes were unfortunately plentiful in this district and in a hollow log that served to shelter some cubs were noticed the remains of ducks fowls rabbits lambs bandicoots and snakes so they evidently vary their fare snakes even not coming amiss they also sneak on wild ducks that are nesting by the edge of the water among the rushes and tussocky grass and catch quail also especially sitting birds these animals are and always will be a great source of trouble in the thickly timbered country and stony ranges and will gradually like the rabbit extend all over australia they are evidently not contented with ground game only as mr af kelly of barwonleigh in victoria states when riding past a bulloak tree about twentyfive feet high with either a magpies or crows nest on top i noticed the nest looked very bulky and had something red in it on going nearer i saw a large fox coiled up in it the mongoosecircumstances alter cases and a change of environment sometimes works marvelous changes in the character of an animal species now why should not the gray indian mongoose formerly called the ichneumon herpestes griscus destroy poultry in india as it does elsewhere there is poultry in plenty to be destroyed but rikkitikkitavi elects to specialize on the killing of rats and cobras and other snakes in his own sphere of influenceindia and the orientthe mongoose is a fairly decent citizen and he fits into the timeworn economy of that region as a destroyer of the thriceanathema domestic rat he has no equal in the domain of flesh and blood his temper is so fierce that one pet mongoose has been known to kill a full grown male giant bustard and put a greyhound to flight in an evil moment 1872 mr wb espeut conceived the idea that it would be a good thing to introduce mongooses to the rats of barbadoes and jamaica that were pestering the canefields to an annoying extent it was done the mongooses attacked the rats cleaned them out multiplied and then looked about for more worlds to conquer snakes and lizards were few but they cheerfully killed and devoured all there were then being continuously hungry they attacked the wild birds and poultry indiscriminately and with their usual vigor i have been told that in barbadoes they cleaned out every living thing that they could catch and kill and then they attacked the sugarcane the last count in the indictment may seem hard to believe but it is a fact that the indian mongoose often resorts to fruit and vegetable food in jamaica at the end of the ratkilling period the planters joyfully estimated that the labors of herpestes had saved between 500000 pounds and 750000 pounds to the industries of that island that was before the slaughter of wild birds and poultry began i am told that up to date the damage done by the mongoose far exceeds the value of the benefit it once conferred but the total has not been computed up to this date the mongoose has invaded and become a destructive pest in barbadoes jamaica cuba st vincent st lucia trinidad nevis fiji and all the larger islands of the hawaiian group it would require many pages to contain a full account of each introduction awakening reckoning of damages and payment of bounties for destruction that the fiendish mongoose has wrought out wherever it has been introduced the progress of the pest is everywhere the samesweeping destruction of rats snakes wild birds small mammals and finally poultry and vegetables every country that now is without the mongoose will do well to shut and guard diligently all the doors by which it might be introduced throughout its range in the western hemisphere the mongoose is a pest and the biological survey of the department of agriculture has done well in securing the enactment of a law peremptorily prohibiting the importation of any animals of that species into the united states or any of its colonies the fierce temper indomitable courage and vaulting appetite of the mongoose would make its actual introduction in any of the warm portions of the united states a horrible calamity in the southern states and all along the pacific slope clear up to seattle it could live thrive and multiply and the slaughter that it could and would inflict upon our wild birds generally especially all those that nest and live on the ground saying nothing of the slaughter of poultry would drive the american people crazy fancy an animal with the murderous ferocity of a mink the agility of a squirrel the penetration of a ferret and the cunning of a rat infesting the thickets and barnyards of this country the mongoose can live wherever a rat can live provided it can get a fair amount of animal food not for 1000000 could any one of the southern or pacific states afford to have a pair of these little gray fiends imported and set free if such a calamity ever occurs all wheels should stop and every habitant should turn out and hunt for the animals until they are found and pulverized no matter if it should require a thousand men and 100000 find them if not found the cost to the state will soon be a million a year with no ending in spite of the vigilance of our custom house officers every now and then a hindoo from some foreign vessel sneaks into the country with a pet mongoose and they do make great pets inside his shirt or in the bottom of a bag of clothing of course whenever the department of agriculture discovers any of these surreptitious animals they are at once confiscated and either killed or sent to a public zoological park for safekeeping in new york the director of the zoological park is so genuinely concerned about the possibility of the escape of a female mongoose that he has issued two standing orders all live mongooses offered to us shall at once be purchased and every female animal shall immediately be chloroformed if herpestes griseus ever breaks loose in the united states the crime shall not justly be chargeable to us the english sparrowin the united states the english sparrow is a national sorrow almost too great to be endured it is a bird of plain plumage low tastes impudent disposition and persistent fertility continually does it crowd out its betters or pugnaciously drive them away and except on very rare occasions it eats neither insects nor weed seeds it has no song and in habits it is a bird of the street and the gutter there is not one good reason why it should exist in this country if it were out of the way our native insecteaters of song and beauty could return to our lawns and orchards the english sparrow is a nuisance and a pest and if it could be returned to the land of its nativity we would gain much chapter xxxvi national and state game preserves and bird refuges out west there is said to be a feeling that game and forest conservation has gone far enough in montana particularly the national woolgrowers association has for some time been firmly convinced that the time has come to call a halt oh yes a halt on the conservation of game and forests but not on the free grazing of sheep on the public domain no not even while those same sheep are busily growing wool that is so fearfully and wonderfully conserved by a skyhigh tariff that the truly poor americans are forced to wear garments made of shoddy because they cannot afford to buy clothing made of wool this is the testimony of a responsible clothing merchant in 1912 we can readily understand the new hue and cry against conservation that the sheep men now are raising of course they are against all new game and forest reservesunless the woolly hordes are given the right to graze in them many men of the great westthe west beyond the great plainsare afflicted with a desire to do as they please with the natural resources of that region that is the great curse that today rests upon our game when the nearest game warden is 50 miles away and big game is only 5 miles away it is time for that game to take to the tall timber but in the west and east and south there are many men and women who believe in reasonable conservation and deplore destruction we have not by any means reached the point where we can think of stopping in the making of game preserves or forest preserves of the former we have scarcely begun to make the majority of the states of our union know of state game preserves only by hearsay but the time is coming when the states will come forward and perform the serious duty that they neglect today let the statesmen of america be not afraid of making too many game preserves for the next year one per day would be none too many remember that on one hand we have the army of destruction and on the other the expectant millions of posterity no executor or trustee ever erred in safeguarding an estate too carefully fifty years hence if your successors and mine find that too much land has been set aside for the good of the people they can mighty easily restore any surplus to the public domain and at a vastly increased valuation give posterity at least one chance to debate the question were our forefathers too liberal in the making of game and forest reserves we can always carve up any useless surplus of the public domain and restore it to commercial uses but none of the men of today will live long enough to see so strange a proceeding carried into effect the game preserves of the united states government are so small with the exception of the yellowstone and glacier parks that very few people ever hear of them and fewer still know of them in detail it seems to be quite time that they should be set forth categorically and it is most earnestly to be hoped that this list soon will be doubled the yellowstone national parkthis was the first of the national parks and game preserves of the united states some of our game preserves are not exactly national parks but this is both by act of congress it is 62 miles long from north to south 54 miles wide and contains a total area of 3348 square miles or 2142720 acres its western border lies in idaho and along its northern border a narrow strip lies in montana it is under the jurisdiction of the secretary of the interior and it is guarded by a detachment of cavalry from the united states army the superintendent is now a commissioned officer of the united states army the business of protecting the game is performed partly by four scouts who are civilians specially engaged for that purpose but the number has always been totally inadequate to the work to be performed at least onehalf of the public interest attaching to the yellowstone park is based upon its wild animals there the average visitor sees for the first time wild mountain sheep antelope mule deer elk grizzly bears and white pelicans roaming free but for the tragedy of the park bison herdslaughtered by poachers from 1890 to 1893 from 300 head down to 30visitors would see wild bison also but now the few wild bison remaining keep as far as possible from the routes of tourist travel the bison were slaughtered through an inadequate protective force and then utterly inadequate laws lieutcol lm brett usa superintendent of the yellowstone park advises me july 29 1912 that the wild big game in the yellowstone park in the summer of 1912 is as shown below based on actual counts and estimates of the park scouts and particularly scout mcbride the estimates of buffalo elk antelope deer sheep and bear are based on actual counts or very close observations and are pretty nearly correct col brett wild buffalo 49 moose 550 elk in summer 35000 antelope 500 mountain sheep 210 mule deer 400 whitetailed deer 100 grizzly bears 50 black bears 100 pumas 100 gray wolves none coyotes 400 pelicans 1000 the actual count of 49 wild bison in the park 10 of which are calves of 1912 will be to all friends of the bison a delightful surprise heretofore the little band had seemed to be stationary which if true would soon mean a decline the history of the wild game of the yellowstone park is blackened by two occurrences and one existing fact the fact is the town of gardiner is situated on the northern boundary of the park in the state of montana in gardiner there are a number of men armed with rifles who toward game have the graywolf quality of mercy the first stain is the massacre of the 270 wild bison for their heads and robes already noted the second blot is the equally savage slaughter in the early winter of 1911 by some of the people of gardiner reinforced by socalled sportsmen from other parts of the state of all the park elk they could killbulls cows and calvesbecause a large band wandered across the line into the shambles of gardiner on buffalo flats if the people of gardiner can not refrain from slaughtering the game of the parkthe very animals annually seen by 20000 visitors to the parkthen it is time for the american people to summon the town of gardiner before the bar of public opinion to show cause why the town should not be wiped off the map the 35000 elk that summer in the park are compelled in winter to migrate to lower altitudes in order to find grass that is not under two feet of snow in the winter of 191112 possibly 5000 went south into jackson hole and 3000 went northward into montana the sheepgrazing north of the park and the general settlement by ranchmen of jackson hole have deprived the elk herds of those regions of their natural food for several years past up to and including the winter of 191011 some thousands of weak and immature elk have perished in the jackson hole country from starvation and exposure the ranchmen of that region have had terrible timesin witnessing the sufferings of thousands of elk tamed by hunger and begging in piteous dumb show for the small and alltoofew haystacks of the ranchmen the people of jackson hole headed by sn leek the famous photographer and lecturer on those elk herds have done all that they could do in the premises the spirit manifested by them has been the exact reverse of that manifested in gardiner to their everlasting credit they have kept domestic sheep out of the jackson valleyby giving the owners of invading herds hours in which to get their sheep all out and over the western range in 1909 the state of wyoming spent in feeding starving elk 5000 in 1911 the state of wyoming spent in feeding starving elk 5000 in 1911 the us government appropriated for feeding starving elk and exporting elk 20000 in 1912 the campfire club of detroit gave for feeding hungry elk 100 in 191011 about 3000 elk perished in jackson hole in 191112 mr leeks photographs of the elk herds showed an alarming absence of mature bulls indicating that now the most of the breeding is done by immature males this means the sure deterioration of the species the prompt manner in which congress responded in the late winter of 1911 to a distress call in behalf of the starving elk is beyond all ordinary terms of praise it was magnificent in fear and trembling congress was asked through senator lodge to appropriate 5000 congress and senator lodge made it 20000 and for the first time the legislature of wyoming appealed for national aid to save the jointstock herds of wyoming and the yellowstone park glacier park montanain the wild and picturesque mountains of northwestern montana covering both sides of the great continental divide there is a region that has been splendidly furnished by the hand of nature it is a bewildering maze of thundering peaks plunging valleys evergreen forests glistening glaciers mirror lakes and roaring mountain streams its leading citizens are white mountain goats mountain sheep moose mule deer and whitetailed deer and among those present are black and grizzly bears galore commercially the 1400 square miles of glacier park even with its 60 glaciers and 260 lakes are worth exactly the price of its big trees and not a penny more for mining agriculture horticulture and stockraising it is a cipher as a transcendant pleasure ground and recreation wilderness for ninety millions of people it is worth ninety millions of dollars and not a penny less it is a pleasure park of which the greatest of the nations of the earthwhichever that may bemight well be overbearingly proud and its accessibility is almost unbelievable until seen this park is bounded on the south by the great northern railway on the east by the blackfoot indian reservation on the north by alberta and british columbia and on the west by west fork of the flathead river horizontally it contains 1400 square miles but as the goat climbs its area is at least double that its valleys are filled and its lakes are encircled by grand forests of douglas fir hemlock spruce white pine cedar and larch and if ever they are destroyed by fire it will be a national calamity a century long so long as the american people keep out of the poorhouse let there be no lumbercutting vandalism in that park destroying the beauty of every acre of forest that is touched by axe or saw the greatest beauty of those forests is the forest floor which lumbering operations would utterly destroy never mind if there is ripe timber there the american nation is not suffering for the dollars that those lovely forest giants would fetch by board measure what if a tree does fall now and then from old age we can stand the expense if posterity a hundred years hence finds itself lumberless and wishes to use those trees then let posterity pay the price and take them we are not suffering for them and our duty is to save them inviolate and hand them down as a heritage that we proudly transmit unimpaired illustration united states national game preserves and five pacific bird refuges the friends of wild life are particularly interested in glacier park as a national game reservoir and refuge for wild life on the north in alberta it is soon to be extended by waterton lakes park when i visited glacier park in 1909 with frederick h kennard and charles h conrad i procured from three intelligent guides their best estimates of the amount of big game then in the park the guides were thomas h scott josiah rogers and walter s gibbl footnote l see recreation magazine may 1910 p 213 they compared notes and finally agreed upon these figures elk 200 moose 2500 mountain sheep 700 mountain goats 10500 grizzly bears 1000 to 1500 black bears 2500 to 3000 as previously stated one of the surprising features of this new wonder land is its accessibility the great northern lands you at belton a ride of three miles over a good road through a beautiful forest brings you to the foot of lake mcdonald and in one hour more by boat you are at the hotels at the head of the lake at that point you are within three hours horseback ride of sperry glacier and the marvelous panorama that unrolls before you from the top of lincoln peak at the foot of that peak we saw a big wild white mountain goat and another one watched us climb up to the sperry glacier mt olympus national monumentfor at least six years the advocates of the preservation of american wild life and forests vainly desired that the grand mountain territory around mount olympus in northwestern washington should be established as a national forest and game preserve in addition to the preservation of the forests it was greatly desired that the remnant bands of olympic wapiti described as cervus roosevelti should be perpetuated it now contains 1975 specimens of that variety in congress two determined efforts were made in behalf of the region referred to but both were defeated by the enemies of forests and wild life in an auspicious moment dr ts palmer assistant chief of the biological survey department of agriculture thought of a law under which it would be both proper and right to bring the desired preserve into existence the law referred to expressly clothes the president of the united states with power to preserve any monumental feature of nature which it clearly is the duty of the state to preserve for all time from the hands of the spoilers with the enthusiastic approval and assistance of representative william e humphrey of seattle dr palmer set in motion the machinery necessary to the carrying of the matter before the president in proper form and kept it going with the result that on march 2 1909 president roosevelt affixed his signature to the document that closed the circuit thus was created the mount olympus national monument preserving forever 608640 acres of magnificent mountains valleys glaciers streams and forests and all the wild creatures living therein and thereon the people of the state of washington have good reason to rejoice in the fact that their most highlyprized scenic wonderland and the last survivors of the wapiti in that state are now preserved for all coming time at the same time we congratulate dr palmer on the brilliant success of his initiative the superior national game and forest preservethe people of minnesota long desired that a certain great tract of wilderness in the extreme northern portion of that state now well stocked with moose and deer should be established as a game and forest preserve unfortunately however the national government could go no farther than to withdraw the lands and waters from entry and declare it a forest reserve at the right moment some bright genius proposed that the national government should by executive order create a forest reserve and then that the legislature of minnesota should pass an act providing that every national forest of that state should also be regarded as a state game preserve both those things were donealmost as soon as said mr carlos avery the executive agent of the board of game and fish commissioners of minnesota is entitled to great credit for the action of his state and we have to thank mr gifford pinchot and president roosevelt for the executive action that represented the first half of the effort the new superior preserve is valuable as a game and forest reserve and nothing else it is a wilderness of small lakes marshes creeks hummocks of land scrubby timber and practically nothing of commercial value but the wilderness contains many moose and zoologically it is for all practical purposes a moose preserve in it in 1908 mr avery saw fiftyone moose in three days mr fullerton saw 183 in nine days and mr fullerton estimated the total number of moose in minnesota as a whole at 10000 head in area it contains 1420000 acres and the creation of this great preserve was accomplished on april 13 1909 the wichita national game preservein the wichita mountains of southwestern oklahoma there is a national game preserve containing 57120 acres on this preserve is a fenced bison range and a herd of thirtynine american bison which owe their existence to the initiative of the new york zoological society on march 25 1905 the society proposed to the national government the founding of a range and herd on a basis that was entirely new to the society it seemed desirable that for the encouragement of congress in the preservation of species that are threatened with extermination the scientific corporations of america and private individuals also should do something more than to offer advice and exhortations to the government accordingly the zoological society offered to present to the government delivered on the ground in oklahoma a herd of fifteen pureblood bison as the nucleus of a new national herd provided congress would furnish a satisfactory fenced range and maintain the herd the offer was at once accepted by hon james wilson secretary of agriculture and the society was invited to propose a site for a range the society sent a representative to the wichita national forest reserve who recommended a range and made a report upon it which the society adopted by act of congress the range was at once established and fenced its area is twelve square miles 9760 acres in october 1908 the zoological society took from its herd in the zoological park nine female and six male bison and delivered them at the bison range there were many predictions that all those bison would die of texas fever within one year but the parties most interested persisted in trying conclusions with the famous tick of texas mr frank rush was appointed warden of the new national bison range and his management has been so successful that only two of the bison died of the fever the disease has been stamped out and the herd now contains thirtynine head within five years it should reach the onehundred mark elk deer and antelope have been placed in the range and all save the antelope are doing well the wichita bison range is an unqualified success the montana national bison rangethe opening of the flathead indian reservation to settlement in 1909 afforded a golden opportunity to locate in that region another national bison herd accordingly in 1908 the american bison society formulated a plan by which the establishment of such a range and herd might be brought about that plan was successfully carried into effect in 1909 and 10 the bison society proposed to the national government to donate a herd of at least twentyfive bison provided congress would purchase a range fence it and maintain the herd the offer was immediately accepted and with commendable promptness congress appropriated 40000 with which to purchase the range and fence it the bison society examined various sites and finally recommended what was regarded as an ideal location situated near ravalli montana north of the jocko river and northern pacific railway and east of the flathead river the nearest stations are ravalli and dixon the area of the range is about twentynine square miles 18521 acres and for the purpose that it is to serve it is beautiful and perfect beyond compare in it the bison herd requires no winter feeding whatever in 1910 the bison society raised by subscription a fund of 10526 and with it purchased 37 very perfect pureblood bison from the famous conrad herd at kalispell 22 of which were females one gift bison was added by mr and mrs charles goodnight two were presented by the estate of charles conrad and three were presented from the famous corbin herd at newport nh by the blue mountain forest association starting with that nucleus of 43 head in 1910 the herd has already 1912 increased to 80 head the herd came through the severe winter of 19111912 without having been fed any hay whatever and the founders of it confidently expect to live to see it increase to one thousand head the grand canyon national game preserve of northern arizona embraces the entire grand canyon of the colorado river for a meandering distance of 101 miles and adjacent territory to an extent of 2333 square miles 1492928 acres owing to certain conditions natural and otherwise it is not the finest place in the world for the peaceful increase of wild game the canyon contains a few mountain sheep and mule deer but buckskin mountain on the northwestern side is reeking with mountain lions and gray wolves and both those species should be shot out of the entire grand canyon national forest it was on buckskin and the western wall of the canyon itself that buffalo jones mr charles s bird and their party caught nine live mountain lions in 1909 i regret to say that buffalo joness catalo experiment on the kaibab plateau seems to have met an untimely and disappointing fate for three years the bison and domestic cattle crossed and produced a number of cataloes but in 1911 practically the whole lot was wiped off the earth by cattle rustlers mr jones thinks that it was guerrillas from southern utah who murdered his enterprise partly for the reason that no other persons were within striking distance of the herd mount rainier national parkthis fine forest park is the great summer outing ground of the people of the state of washington its area is 324 square

awaits everything that may legally be killed in that state crater lake national parklike all the national parks of america generally this one also is a game sanctuary it is situated on the summit of the cascade mountains of oregon the wonderful crater lake itself is 62 miles from klamath falls 83 miles from ashland and it is 6 miles long 4 miles wide and 200 feet deep this national park was created by act of congress in 1902 its area is 249 square miles 159360 acres and it contains columbian blacktailed deer black bear the silvergray squirrel and many birds chiefly members of the grouse family owing to its lofty elevation there are few ducks the sequoia and general grant national parks were created for the special purpose of preserving the famous groves of big trees sequoia gigantea the former is in tulare county the latter in tulare and fresno counties california on the western slope of the sierra nevadas the area of sequoia park is 169605 acres and that of general grant park is 2560 acres they are under the control of the interior department these parks are important bird refuges and mr walter fry forest ranger reports in them the presence of 261 species of birds none of

province in north america and everywhere else should establish a series of state forest and game preserves is fairly incontestable as a business proposition it is today no more a debatable question or open to argument than is the water supply or sewer system of a city the only perfect way to conserve a water supply for a great human population is by acquiring title to water sheds and either protecting the forests upon them or planting forests in case none exist in one important matter the state of pennsylvania has been wide awake and in advance of the times i will cite her system of forest reserves and game preserves as a model plan for other states to follow and i sincerely hope that by the time the members of the present state game commission have passed from earth the people of pennsylvania will have learned the value of the work they are now doing and at least give them the appreciation that is deserved by publicspirited citizens who do large things for the people without hope of material reward at this moment commissioner john m phillips and dr joseph kalbfus are putting their hearts blood into the business of preserving and increasing the game and other wild life of pennsylvania and the utter lack of appreciation that is now being shown in some quarters is really distressing i refer particularly to the utterly misguided and mistaken body of hunters and anglers having headquarters at harrisburg whose members are grossly mislead into a wrong position by a man who seeks to secure a salaried state position through the hostile organization that he has built up apparently for his own use in the belief that those members generally are mislead and not meanspirited and that the organization contains a majority of conscientious sportsmen i predict that ere long the evil genius of pennsylvania game protection will be ordered to the rear while the organization as a whole takes its place on the side of the game commission where it belongs the game sanctuary scheme that pennsylvania has developed is so new that as yet only a very small fraction of the people of that state either understand it or appreciate its farreaching importance to begin with pennsylvania has acquired up to date about one million acres of forest lands scattered through 26 of the 67 counties of the state these great holdings are to be gradually increased these wild lands including many sterile mountain farms of no real value for agricultural purposes have been acquired first of all for the purpose of conserving the water supply of the state and they are called the state forest reserves next in order the state game commission has created in favorable localities in the forest reserves five great game preserves the plan is decidedly novel and original but is very simple withal in the center of a great tract of forest reserve a specially desirable tract has been chosen and its boundaries marked out by the stringing of a single heavy fence wire surrounding the entire selection the area within that boundary wire is an absolute sanctuary for all wild creatures save those that prey upon game and in it no man may hunt anything nor fire a gun the boundary wire is by no means a fence for it keeps nothing out nor in outside of the wire and the sanctuary men may hunt in the open season but at the wire every chase must end if the hunted deer knows enough to flee to the sanctuary when attacked so much the better for the deer the tide of wild life ebbs and flows under the wire and beyond a doubt the deer and grouse will quickly find that within it lies absolute safety there the breeding and rearing of young may go on undisturbed in view of the fact that hunting may go on in the forest reserve areas surrounding these sanctuaries no intelligent sportsman needs to be told that in a few years all such regions will be teeming with deer grouse and other game where there is one deer today there will be twenty ten years hencebecause the law of pennsylvania forbids the killing of does and then there will be twenty times the legitimate hunting that there is today for example the clinton county game preserve of 3200 acres is surrounded by 128000 acres of forest reserve which form legitimate hunting grounds for the game bred in the sanctuary reservoir in clearfield county the game sanctuary is surrounded by 47000 acres of forest reserve the game preserves created in pennsylvania up to date are as follows in clinton county 3200 acres in clearfield county 3200 acres in franklin county 3200 acres in perry county 3200 acres in westmoreland county 2500 acres it is the deliberate intention of the game commission to increase these game preserves until there is at least one in each county it is the policy of the commission to clear out of the game sanctuaries all the mammals and birds that destroy wild life such as foxes mink weasels skunks and destructive hawks and owls this is accomplished partly by buying old horses killing them in the preserves and poisoning them thoroughly with strychnine each preserve now contains a nucleus herd of whitetailed deer some of them imported from northern michigan ruffed grouse are breeding rapidly and in the clearfield county preserve there are said to be at least three thousand the game commission considers it a patriotic duty to preserve the wild turkey ruffed grouse and quail rather than have those species replaced at great expense by species imported from the old world in their work for the protection preservation and increase of the game of pennsylvaniapartly for the purpose of providing legitimate hunting for the mechanic as well as the millionairethe state game commissioners are putting a great amount of thought and labor and whenever their efforts are criticized their motives impugned or their honesty questioned by men who are not worthy to unlace their shoes it makes me tired and angry new york the adirondack state parkwith wise and commendable forethought the state of new york has preserved in the adirondack wilderness familiarly known as the north woods a magnificent forest domain forever dedicated to campers outdoorsmen and hunters at present 1912 it contains 2031 square miles 1300000 acres of forestclad hills valleys and mountains adorned by countless lakes and streams by some persons it has been believed that in the states forests the cutting and sale of large trees would be justifiable business and agreeable to the public but it has been demonstrated that this is not the case the people of the state firmly object to the havoc that is unavoidably wrought by logging operations in beautiful forests the state does not yet need any of the money that could be derived from such operations the chief anxiety of the public is that hereafter forest fires shall be prevented no matter what fire protection may cost the burning of coal on any railway operated through the adirondacks should be made a penal offense montana in 1911 governor norris senator cone and the legislature of montana at the solicitation of wr felton la huffman and others created the snow creek game preserve fronting for ten miles on the missouri river in the northern side of dawson county it is a magnificent tract of badlands very deeply eroded and carved and highly picturesque the new state preserve contains 96 square miles but there is so little grazing ground for antelope and bison it is absolutely imperative that a narrow strip of level grass land should be added along the southern border this proposed addition is being fiercely resisted by an organized movement of the sheep owners of montana the national wool growers association who naturally want the public domain for the free grazing of their tariffprotected sheepherds it remains to be seen whether the three sheep men south of the preservethe only men who really are affectedwill be able to thwart a movement that has for its object the development of a very good game preserve for the benefit of the ninety millions of the general american public the range is necessary to contain representatives of the big game of the plains that has been so ruthlessly swept away and particularly the vanishing pronghorned antelope once very numerous in that region in order to relieve the sheep men of all trouble on account of that preserve the area should be enlarged to the right dimensions and made a national preserve a bill for that purpose senate 5286 is now before the senate in senator mcleans committee and help is needed to overcome the active hostility of the sheep men who vow that it never shall be passed all persons who read this are invited to take this matter up with their senators and representatives without a moments delay wyoming the teton state preserveone of the largest and most important state game preserves thus far established by any of our states is that which was created by wyoming in 1904 it is situated along the south of and fully adjoining the yellowstone park and its area is 900 square miles 576000 acres its special purpose is to supplement for the elk herds and other big game the protection from killing that previously had been found in the yellowstone park alone the state preserve is an admirable halfway house for the migrating herds when they leave the national park to seek their regular winter ranges in and around the jackson valley illustration bird reservations on the gulf coast and florida in 1909 wyoming established the big horn game preserve in the mountain range of that name into it 25 elk were taken from jackson hole and set free in 1910 at the expense of the sheridan county sportsmens club louisiana great developments for the preservation of wild life have recently been witnessed in louisiana all due to the initiative and persistent activities of two men edward a mcilhenny of avery island la and charles willis ward of michigan lumberman and horticulturist the louisiana state wild fowl refuge on vermillion bay has an area of 13000 acres it was presented to the state by messrs ward and mcilhenny and formally accepted and protected it contains a great area of freshwater ponds and marshy meadows wherein grows an abundant supply of food for wild fowl it contains several miles of gravel beach which during the winter season is visited by thousands of wild geese in quest of their indispensable supply of gravel the ponds within its borders furnish feedinggrounds for canvasback ducks redhead mallard blackhead and various species of wild geese other state game preserves acres idahopayette

and game laws in canada as now set forth on the map of north america canada is a vast country we must no longer think of ontario and quebec as canada west and canada east because the new assistantnation owns and rules everything from labrador to british columbia and all the northern mainland save alaska although the fauna of canada is strictly boreal it is sufficiently dispersed and diversified to demand wise legislation and plenty of it for a nation with an outfit of provinces so new canada already is well advanced in the matter of game laws and game preserves and in some respects she has set the pace for her southern neighbors for example in new brunswick we see the lordly moose successfully hunted for sport not only without being exterminated but actually on a basis that permits it to increase in number in nova scotia we see a law in force which successfully prohibits the waste of moose meat a loss that characterizes moose hunting everywhere else throughout the range of that animal all over southern canada the use of automatic shotguns in hunting is strictly prohibited on the other hand the laws of the canadians are weak in not preventing the sale of all wild game and the killing of antelope in the matter of gameselling there are far too many open doors and a sweeping reform is very necessary speaking generally and with application from labrador to british columbia the american process of game extermination according to law is vigorously and successfully being pursued by the people of canada the open seasons are too long and the bag limits are too generous to the gunners as it is elsewhere the baglimit laws on birds are a farce because it is impossible to enforce them save on every tenth man for example in his admirable final report of the ontario game and fisheries commission 1912 commissioner kelly evans says the prairie chicken which formerly was comparatively plentiful throughout the greater portion of the rainy river district has now become practically extinct in that region various causes have been assigned for this but it would seem as usual to have been mainly the fault of indiscriminate and excessive slaughter page 226 like the united states the various portions of canada have their various local troubles in wildlife protection i think the greatest practical difficulties and the most real opposition to adequate measures is found in the provinces of quebec and ontario is it because the frenchdescended population is impatient of real restraint and objects to measures that are drastic even though they are necessary in ontario commissioner evans has been splendidly supported by the government and by all the real sportsmen of that province but the gunners and guerrillas of destruction have successfully postponed several of the reforms that he has advocated and which should have been carried into effect so far as public moral support for game protection is concerned i think that the prairie and mountain provinces have the best of it in manitoba saskatchewan alberta athabasca and british columbia the spirit of the people is mainly correct and the chief thing that seems to be lacking is a kelly evans in each of those provinces to urge public sentiment into strong action for example why should alberta still permit the hunting and killing of pronghorned antelope when it is so well known that that species is vanishing like a mist before the morning sun i think it is because no one seems to have risen up as go shields did in the united states to make a big fuss about it and demand a reform at any rate all the provinces of canada that still possess antelope should immediately pass laws giving that species absolute close seasons for ten years why neglect it longer when such neglect is now so very wrong whether this is done or not i sincerely hope that hereafter no true american sportsman will be guilty of killing one of the vanishing antelope of canada even though the law doth give it the game preserves of canada in the creation of national parks and game preserves some of the provinces of the canadian nation have displayed a degree of foresight and enterprise that merits sincere admiration while in different provinces the exact status of these establishments may vary somewhat the main purpose of each is the samethe preservation of the forests and the wild life in all of them a regulated amount of fishing is permitted and in some the taking of furbearing animals is permitted but i believe in all the birds and furless mammals are strictly protected in some parks the carrying of firearms still is permitted but that privilege is quite out of harmony with the spirit and purposes of a game preserve and should be abolished if it is necessary to carry firearms through a preserve as often happens in the yellowstone park it can be done under seals that are affixed by duly appointed officers and thus will temptation be kept out of the way of sinners up to this date i never have seen a publication which set forth in one place even so much as an annotated list of the game preserves of the various provinces of canada and at present exact information regarding them is rather difficult to obtain it seems that an adequate governmental publication on this subject is now due and overdue ontarioat the present time says commissioner evans in his final report the algonquin national park is the only actual game preserve in the province being in fact a game reserve and not a forest reserve but in the past at least a measure of protection would seem to have been afforded the game in most of the forest reserves owing to the fact that the carrying of firearms therein has been discouraged and it would appear to require but the passing of an orderincouncil to render the carrying of firearms in all reserves illegal it is sincerely to be hoped that not only will such action be taken without delay but also that all the forest reserves will be declared game reserves in the strictest sense to this sentiment all friends of wild life will join a fervent wish for its realization as conditions are today it is impossible to have too many game reserves there is everything to gain and nothing to lose by making every national forest and forest reserve on the whole continent of north america a game preserve in the strictest sense and we hope to live to see that end accomplished both in the united states and canada the algonquin national park is situated in the parry sound region just above the muskoka lakes and it has an area of 1930 square miles it is well stocked with moose caribou whitetailed deer black bear and beaver during the period of protection the beaver have increased so greatly that about 1000 were trapped last year for the market by officers of the government and about 25 were sold to zoological gardens and parks at 25 each the quetico forest reserve area 1560 square miles was created as the canadian complement of the minnesota national forest and game preserve the two join on the international boundary and each helps to protect the other both are well stocked with moose and will render valuable service in the preservation of a midcontinental contingent of that species albertain the making of game preserves the province of alberta has been splendidly progressive and liberal the total result is fairly beyond the reach of ordinary words of praise it sets a pace that should result in widespread benefits to the wild life of north america in it there is nothing fainthearted it should make some of our states think seriously regarding their own shortcomings in this particular field of endeavor albertas national parks acres sq miles rocky mountains park 2764800 4320 yoho park 1799680 2812 glacier park 1474560

field the buffalo park is near wainwright on the plains and it was created and fenced especially as a home for the herd of american bison that was purchased in montana in 1909 it now contains 1052 head of bison 20 moose 35 deer 7 elk and 6 antelope the elk island park is near fort saskatchewan and lamont and at this date 1912 it contains 53 bison 28 elk 30 deer and 5 moose the bison subsist entirely by grazing and upon hay cut within the park jasper park established in 1908 is on the athabasca river and the grand trunk pacific railway near strathcona sixty miles of the railway line lie within the park scenically jasper park is a rival of rocky mountains park and undoubtedly possesses great attractions for travellers who appreciate the beauties and grandeur of nature as expressed in mountains valleys lakes and streams waterton lakes park is situated in the extreme southwestern corner of alberta in the rocky mountains surrounding the waterton lakes at present it is nine miles long from north to south and six miles wide with its southern end resting on the international boundary and adjoining our glacier park it is the home of a few bands of mountain sheep that carry very large horns through the initiative of frederick k vreeland the campfire club of america two years ago represented to the government of alberta the great desirability of enlarging this preserve toward the north and west the better to protect the mountain sheep and other big game of that region the suggestion was received in a friendly spirit and there is good reason to hope that at an early date the enlargement will be made british columbiathis province has made an excellent beginning in the creation of game preserves the first agitation on that subject was begun in 1906 by two sportsmen whose names in connection with it have long since been forgotten on november 15 1908 the legislative council of british columbia issued a proclamation that created a very fine game preserve in the east kootenai district between the elk and bull rivers and northwestward thereof to the white river country by an unfortunate oversight the new preserve never has been officially named but we may designate it here as the elk river game preservethis preserve has a total area of about 450 square miles and includes a fine tract of mountains valleys lakes and streams it contained in 1908 about 1000 mountain goats 200 sheep a few elk and deer and about 50 grizzly bears all these have notably increased during the period of absolute protection that they have enjoyed it is probable that this preserve contains more white mountain goats than any other preserve that thus far has been made it was in this region that mr john m phillips and prof henry fairfield osborne made the first mountain goat photographs ever made at close range it is to be hoped that the protection of this preserve both as to its wild life and its timber will be made perpetual frazer river preservenext after the above there was created in british columbia a game preserve covering a large portion of the mountain territory that rises between the north and south forks of the fraser river it is about 75 miles long by 30 miles wide and contains about 2250 square miles concerning its character and wildlife population we have no details yalakom game preserveon the north side of bridge river a western tributary of the fraser about twenty miles above lilloet there has been established a game preserve having an area of about 215 square miles manitobain the making of game preserves manitoba has made an excellent beginning it is good to see from duck mountain in the north to turtle mountain in the south a chain of four liberal preserves each one protected in unmistakable terms as follows carrying firearms hunting or trapping strictly prohibited within this area the lake regions of manitoba saskatchewan and alberta form what is probably the most important wildfowl breedingground in north america to a great extent it rests with those provinces to say whether the central united states shall have any ducks and geese or not it is high time that an international treaty should be made between the united states canada and mexico for the federal protection of all migratory birds these preserves are of course intended to conserve wildfowl shorebirds grouse and all other birds as well as big game thanks to the cooperation of mr jm macoun of the canadian geological survey i am able to offer the following list of manitobas game preserves duck mountain preserve 324 sq miles 207360 acres riding mountain preserve 360 230000 spruce woods preserve 64 40960 turtle mountain preserve 100 64000 848 542320 manitoba is to be congratulated on this record quebecthis province has created two huge game preserves well worthy of the fauna that they are intended to conserve when all hunting in them is prohibited the laurentides national park is second in area of all the national parks of canada being surpassed only by the rocky mountains park of british columbia its area is 3565 square miles or 2281600 acres it occupies the entire central portion of the great area surrounded by lake st john the saguenay river the wide portion of the st lawrence and the st maurice river on the west its southern boundary is in several places only 16 miles from the st lawrence while its most northern angle is within 13 miles of lake st john its greatest width from east to west is 71 miles and its greatest length from north to south is 79 miles it covers a huge watershed in which over a dozen large rivers and many small ones have their sources it is indeed a forest primeval the rivers are well stocked with fish and the big game includes moose woodland caribou black bear lynx beaver marten fisher mink fox andsad to saythe gray wolf the caribou live in rather small bands from 10 up to 100 unfortunately hunting under license is permitted in the laurentian national park and therefore it is by no means a real game preserve it is a nearpreserve the gaspesian forest fish and game preserve created in 1906 is in the gaspe country and it has an area of 2500 square miles situated in the eastern quebec counties of gaspe and matane the connaught national park to be named in honor of hrh the duke of connaught has been proposed by mr jm macoun of the canadian geological survey the general location chosen is the mountains and forested territory north of ottawa and the ottawa river within easy access from the canadian capitol on the map the location recommended lies between the gatineau river on the east and wolf lake on the west the proposal is meeting with much popular favor and it is extremely probable that it will be carried into effect at an early date labradorduring the past two years lieutcol william wood has strongly advocated the making of game preserves in labrador that will not only tend to preserve the scanty fauna of that region from extinction but will also aid in bringing it back while col woods very energetic and praiseworthy campaign has not yet been crowned with success undoubtedly it will be successful in the near future because ultimately such causes always win their objects provided they are prosecuted with the firm and unflagging persistence which has characterized this particular campaign we congratulate col wood on the success that he will achieve in the near future game laws of the canadian provinces albertathe worst feature of the alberta laws is the annual open season on antelope two of which may be killed under each license this is entirely wrong and a perpetual close season should at once be enacted duck shooting in august is wrong and the season should not open until september it is not right that duckkilling should be made so easy and so fearfully prolonged that extermination is certain all killing of cranes and shore birds should be absolutely stopped for five years no wheatproducing province can afford the expense to the wheat crops of the slaughter of shore birds thirty species of which are great cropprotectors the bag limit of two sheep is too high by 50 per cent it should immediately be cut down to one sheep before sheep hunting in alberta becomes a lost art sheep hunting should not be encouragedquite the reverse there are already too many sheepcrazy sportsmen the bag limit on grouse and ptarmigan of 20 per day or 200 in a season is simply legalized slaughter no more and no less and if it is continued a grouseless province will be the quick result the birds are not sufficiently numerous to withstand the guns on that basis alberta should be wiser than the states below the international boundary that are annihilating their remnants of birds as fast as they can be found british columbiawe note with much satisfaction that the provincial game warden mr a bryan williams has been allowed 37000 for the pay of game wardens and 28000 for the destruction of wolves coyotes pumas and other gamedestroying animals during the past two years the following gamedestroyers were killed and bounties were paid upon them 190910 191011 wolves 655 518 coyotes 1464 3653 cougars 382 277 horned owls 854 2285 golden eagles 29 73 3374 6806 now says warden williams in his excellent annual report for 1911 in these two years a total of 2896 wolves and cougars and 5141 coyotes were destroyed as well as a number of others poisoned and not recovered for the bounty allowing fifty head for each wolf and cougar and ten for each coyote by their bounties alone 196210 head of game and domestic animals were saved is it any wonder that deer are increasing almost everywhere the great horned owl has been and still is a great scourge to the upland game birds partly because when game is abundant they become fastidious and eat only the brains of their prey the destruction of 3139 of them on the lower mainland during the last two years has made these owls sing very small and says the warden is it any wonder that grouse are again increasing i have discussed with the provincial game warden the advisability of putting a limit of one on the grizzly bear but mr williams advances good reasons for the opinion that it would be impracticable to do so at present i am quite sure however that the time has already arrived when a limit of one is necessary during the present year three of my friends who went hunting in british columbia each killed 3 grizzly bears hereafter i will locate no more bear hunters in that country until the bag limit is reduced to one grizzly per year since 1905 the trapping of bears south of the main line of the canadian pacific railway has been stopped and an excellent move too a rocky mountain without a grizzly bear is like a tissuepaper rose the bag limit on the big game of british columbia is at least twice too liberalfive deer two elk two moose one in kootenay county three caribou and three goats there is no necessity for such wasteful liberality few sportsmen go to british columbia for the sake of a large lot of animals i know many men who have been there to hunt and the great majority cared more for the scenery and the wild romance of camping out in ground mountains than for blood and trophies manitobawhat are we to think of a bag limit of fifty ducks per day in october and november a limit indeed evidently manitoba is tired of having ducks ruffed grouse pinnated and other grouse pestering her farmers and laborers while assuming to fix bag limits that will be of some benefit to those species the limit is distinctly off and nothing short of a quick and drastic reform will save a remnant that will remain visible to the naked eye new brunswickthis is the banner province in the protection of moose caribou and deer even while permitting them to be shot for sport of course only males are killed and i am assured by competent judges that thus far the killing of the finest and largest male moose has had no bad effect upon the stature or antlers of the species as a whole nova scotiaif there is anything wrong with the game laws of nova scotia it lies in the wideopen sale of moose meat and all kinds of feathered game during the open season if that province were more heavily populated it would mean a great destruction of game even with conditions as they are the sale permitted is entirely wrong and against the best interests of 97 per cent of the people as previously mentioned the law against the waste of moose meat is both novel and admirable the saving of any considerable portion of the flesh of a fullgrown bull moose along with its head is a large order but it is right the degree of accountability to which guides are held for the doings of the men whom they pilot into the woods is entirely commendable and worthy of imitation if a sportsman or gunner does the wrong thing the guide loses his license saskatchewanthis is another of the tooliberal provinces having no real surplus of big game with which to sustain for any length of time an excess of generosity i am told that in this province there is now a great deal of open country around each wild animal and yet it cheerfully offers two moose two elk two caribou and two antelope per season to each licensed gunner or sportsman the limit is too generous by half why throw away an extra 250 worth of game with each license that is precisely what the people of saskatchewan are doing today and that antelopekilling it should be stopped at once and for ten years yukonthis province permits the sale of all the finest and best wild game within its bordersmoose elk caribou bison muskox sheep and goats the flesh of all these may be sold during the open season and for sixty days thereafter of the species named above the barren ground caribou is the only one regarding which we need not worry because that species still exists in millions the osborn caribou rangifer osborni can be exterminated in our own times because it is nowhere really numerous and it inhabits exposed situations chapter xxxviii private game preserves primarily in the early days of the manonhorseback the selfelected and predatory lords of creation evolved the private game preserve as a scheme for preventing other fellows from shooting and for keeping the game sacred to slaughter by themselves the idea of conserving the game was a fourthrate consideration the first being the estoppel of the other man the oldworld owner of a game preserve delights in the annual killing of the surplus game and we have even heard it whispered that in the dark ages there were kings who enjoyed the wholesale slaughter of deer wild boar pheasants and grouse if we may accept as true the history of sport in europe there have been men who have loved slaughter with a genuine bloodlust that is quite foreign to the real natureloving sportsman in america the impulse is different here there is raging a genuine fever for private game preserves some of those already existing are of fine proportions and cost fortunes to create every true sportsman who is rich enough to own a private game preserve sooner or later acquires one you will find them scattered throughout the temperate zone of north america from the bay of fundy to san diego i have had invitations to visit preserves in an unbroken chain from the farthest corner of quebec to the pacific coast and from grand island lake superior to the gulf of mexico it was not necessarily to hunt and kill something but to see the game and the beauties of nature the wealthy american and canadian joyously buys a tract of wilderness fences it stocks it with game both great and small and provides game keepers for all the year round at first he has an idea that he will hunt therein and that his guests will hunt also and actually kill game in a mild way this fiction sometimes is maintained for years the owner may each year shoot two or three head of his surplus big game and his tenderfoot guests who dont know what real hunting is may also kill something each year but in most of the american preserves with which i am well acquainted the gentlemanly sport of hunting big game is almost a joke the trouble is usually the owner becomes so attached to his big game and admires it so sincerely he has not the heart to kill it himself and he finds no joy whatever in seeing it shot down by others in this country the slaughter of game for the market is not considered a gentlemanly pastime even though there is a surplus of preservebred game that must be reduced to the average american the slaughter of halftame elk deer and birds that have been bred in a preserve does not appeal in the least he knows that in the protection of a preserve the wild creatures lose much of their fear of man and become easy marks and shall a real sportsman go out with a gun and a bushel of cartridges on a pony and without warning betray the confidence of the wild in terms of fire and blood others may do it if they like but as a rule that is not what an american calls sport one wideawake and wellarmed grizzly bear or mountain sheep outwitted on a mountainside is worth more as a sporting proposition than a quarter of a mile of deer carcasses laid out side by side on a nice park lawn to be photographed as one days kill in america the shooting of driven game is something of which we know little save by hearsay in europe it is practiced on everything from scotch grouse to italian ibex the german crown prince in his fascinating little volume from my hunting daybook very neatly fixes the value of such shooting as a real sportsmans proposition in the following sentence the shooting of driven game is merely a question of marksmanship and is after all more in the nature of a shooting exercise than sport i have seen some shooting in preserves that was too tame to be called sport but on the other hand i can testify that in grouse shooting as it is done behind the dogs on mr carnegies moor at skibo it is sport in which the hunter earns every grouse that falls to his gun at the same time also i believe that the shooting of madly running ibex as it is done by the king of italy in his three mountain preserves is sufficiently difficult to put the best biggame hunter to the test there are times when shooting driven game calls for far more dexterity with the rifle than is ordinarily demanded in the stillhunt in america as in england and on the continent of europe private game preserves are so numerous it is impossible to mention more than a very few of them unless one devotes a volume to the subject probably there are more than five hundred and no list of them is up to date for more than one day because the number is constantly increasing i make no pretense even of possessing a list of those in america and i mention only a few of those with which i am best acquainted by way of illustration one of the earliest and the most celebrated deer parks of the united states was that of hon john dean caton of two hundred acres located near ottawa ill established about 1859 it was the experiments and observations made in that park that yielded judge catons justly famous book on the antelope and deer of america the first game preserve established by an incorporated club was blooming grove park of one thousand acres in pennsylvania where great success has been attained in the breeding and rearing of whitetailed deer in the eastern united states the most widelyknown game preserve is blue mountain forest park near newport new hampshire it was founded in 1885 by the late austin corbin and has been loyally and diligently maintained by austin corbin jr george s edgell and the other members of the corbin family ownership is vested in the blue mountain forest association the area of the preserve is 27000 acres and besides embracing much fine forest on croydon mountain it also contains many converted farms whose meadow lands afford good grazing this preserve contains a large herd of bison 86 head elk whitetailed deer wild boar and much smaller game the annual surplus of bison and other large game is regularly sold and distributed throughout the world for the stocking of other parks and zoological gardens each year a few surplus deer are quietly killed for the boston market but a far greater number are sold alive at from 25 to 30 each in carload lots in the adirondacks of northern new york there are a great many private game preserves dr ts palmer in his pamphlet on private game preserves department of agriculture places the number at 60 and their total area at 791208 acres some of them have caused much irritation among some of the hunting fishing and trapping residents of the adirondack region they seem to resent the idea of the exclusive ownership of lands that are good huntinggrounds this view of property rights has caused much trouble and some bloodshed two persons having been killed for presuming to assert exclusive rights in large tracts of wilderness property in the upland preserve under private ownership says dr palmer may be found one of the most important factors in the maintenance of the future supply of game and game birds nearly all such preserves are maintained for the propagation of deer quail grouse or pheasants they vary widely in area character and purpose and embrace some of the largest game refuges in the country some of the preserves in north carolina cover from 15000 to 30000 acres several in south carolina exceed 60000 acres in extent the megantic clubs northern preserve on the boundary between quebec and maine embraces nearly 200 square miles or upward of 125000 acres comparatively few of the larger preserves are enclosed and on such grounds hunting becomes sport quite as genuine as it is in regions open to free hunting in some instances part of the tract is fenced while large unenclosed areas are protected by being posted the character of their tenure varies also some are owned in fee simple others particularly the larger ones are leased or else comprise merely the shooting rights on the land in both size and tenure the upland preserves of the united states are comparable with the grouse moors and large deer forests of scotland of the game preserves in the south i know one that is quite ideal it is st vincent island near apalachicola florida in the northern edge of the gulf of mexico it was purchased in 1909 by dr ray v pierce and his guests kill perhaps one hundred ducks each year out of the thousands that flock to the ten big ponds that occupy the eastern third of the island into those ponds much good duck food has been introducedpotamogeton pectinatus and perfoliatus the area of the island is twenty square miles besides being a great winter resort for ducks its sandy pinecovered ridges and jungles of palms to and live oak afford fine haunts and feeding grounds for deer those jungles contain two species of whitetailed deer odocoileus louisiana and osceola and dr pierce has introduced the indian sambar deer and japanese sika deer cervus sika both of which are doing well we are watching the progress of those big sambar deer with very keen interest and it is to be recorded that already that species has crossed with the louisiana whitetailed deer illustration map of marsh island and adjacent wildfowl preserves during the autumn of 1912 public attention in the united states was for a time focused on the purchase of marsh island louisiana by mrs russell sage and its permanent dedication to the cause of wildlife protection this delightful event has brought into notice the louisiana state game preserve of 13000 acres near marsh island and its hinterland and water of 11000 acres adjoining which constitutes the wardmcilhenny wild fowl preserve these three great preserves taken together as they lie form a wildfowl sanctuary of great size and of great value to the whole mississippi valley now that all duckshooting therein has been stopped it is safe to predict that they shortly will be inhabited by a wildfowl population that will really stagger the imagination duckshooting preservesa ducking preserve is a large tract of land and water owned by a few individuals or a club for the purpose of preserving exclusively for themselves and their friends the best possible opportunities for killing large numbers of ducks and geese without interference in no sense whatever are they intended to preserve or increase the supply of wild fowl the real object of their existence is duck and goose slaughter for example the worst gooseslaughter story on record comes to us from the grounds of the glenn county club in california whereon as stated elsewhere two men armed with automatic shotguns killed 218 geese in one hour and bagged a total of 452 in one day i shall not attempt to give any list of the socalled ducking preserves the word preserve when applied to them is a misnomer thirteen states have these incorporated slaughteringgrounds for ducks and geese the greatest number being in california illinois north carolina and virginia california has carried the duckingclub idea to the limit where it is claimed that it constitutes an abuse dr palmer says that one or two of the club preserves on the western side of the san joaquin valley contain upward of 40 square miles or 25000 acres each with considerable asperity it is now publicly charged in the columns of the examiner of san francisco that for the unattached sportsmen there is no longer any duckshooting to be had in california because all the good duckinggrounds are owned and exclusively controlled by clubs in many states the private game preserves are a source of great irritation and many have been attacked in courts of lawn footnote n private game preserves and their future in the united states by ts palmer united states department of agriculture 1910 but i am not sorrowing over the woes of the unattached duckhunter or in the least inclined to champion his cause against the duckingclub member as slaughterers and exterminators of wildfowl rarely exercising mercy under ridiculous baglimits they have both been too heedless of the future and one is just as bad for the game as the other if either of them favored the game i would be on his side but i see no difference between them they both kill right up to the baglimit as often as they can and that is what is sweeping away all our feathered game curiously enough the angry unattached duckhunters of california are today proposing to have revenge on the duckclubbers by removing all restrictions on the sale of game this is on the theory that the duckless sportsmen of the state of california would like to buy dead ducks and geese for their tables it is a novel and original theory but the sane people of california never will enact it into law it would be a step just twenty years backward the public vs the private game preserveboth the executive and the judiciary branches of our state governments will in the future be called upon with increasing frequency to sit in judgment on this case conditions about us are rapidly changing the precepts of yesterday may be out of date and worthless tomorrow by way of introspection let us see what principles of equity toward man and nature we would lay down as the basis of our action if we were called to the bench named in logical sequence they would be about as follows 1 any private game preserve that is maintained chiefly as a slaughterground for wild game either birds or mammals may become detrimental to the interests of the people at large illustration egrets and herons in sanctuary on marsh island 2 it is not necessarily the duty of any state to provide for the maintenance of private deathtraps for the wholesale slaughter of migratory game 3 an oppressive monopoly in the slaughter of migratory game is detrimental to the interests of the public at large the same as any other monopoly 4 every de facto game preserve maintained for the preservation of wild life rather than for its slaughter is an institution beneficial to the public at large and therefore entitled to legal rights and privileges above and beyond all which may rightly be accorded to the socalled preserves that are maintained as killinggrounds 5 the law may justly discriminate between the actual game preserve and the mere killingground 6 whenever a killingground becomes a public burden it may be abated the same as any other public infliction in private game preserves the time has arrived when lawmakers and judges must begin to apply the bloodtest and separate the true from the false and at every step the welfare of the wild life involved must be given full consideration no men nor body of men should be permitted to practice methods that spell extermination chapter xxxix british game preserves in africa and australia this brief chapter is offered as an objectlesson to the world at large in the early days of america the founders of our states and territories gave little heed or none at all to the preservation of wild life even if they thought of that duty undoubtedly they felt that the game would always last and that they had no time for such sentimental side issues as the making of game preserves they were coping with troubles and perplexities of many kinds and it is not to be wondered at that up to forty years ago real game protection in america went chiefly by default in south africa precisely the same conditions have prevailed until recent times the early colonists were kept so busy shooting lions and making farms that not one game preserve was made if any men can be excused from the work and worry of preserving game and making preserves it is those who spend their lives pioneering and statebuilding in countries like africa men who continually have to contend with disease bad food rains insect pests dangerous wild beasts and native cussedness may well claim that they have troubles enough without going far into campaigns to preserve wild animals in countries where animals are plentiful and cheap it is for this reason that the people of alaska can not be relied upon to preserve the alaskan game they are busy with other things that are of more importance to them in may 1900 representatives of the great powers owning territory in africa held a conference in the interests of the wildanimal life of that continent as a result a convention was signed by which those powers bound themselves to make provision for the prevention of further undue destruction of wild game the principles laid down for universal observance were as follows 1 sparing of females and immature animals 2 the establishment of close seasons and game sanctuaries 3 absolute protection of rare species 4 restrictions on export for trading purposes of skins horns tusks etc 5 prohibition of the use of pits snares and game traps the brave and hardy men who are making for the british people a grand empire in africa probably are greater men than fardistant people realize to them the white mans burden of game preservation is accepted as all in the days work a mere handful of british civil officers strongly aided by the society for the preservation of the fauna of the british empire have carved out and set aside a great chain of game preserves reaching all the way from swaziland and the transvaal to khartoum taken either collectively or separately it represents grand work characteristic of the greatest colonizers on earth those preserves are worthy stones in the foundation of what one day will be a great british empire in africa the names of the men who proposed them and wrought them out should in some way be imperishably connected with them as their founders as the least reward that posterity can bestow in major j stevensonhamiltons fine work animal life in africao the author has been at much pains to publish an excellent series of maps showing the locations of the various british game preserves in africa and the map published herewith has been based chiefly on that work it is indeed fortunate for the wild life of africa that it has today so powerful a champion and exponent as this author the warden of the transvaal game preserves footnote o published by heinemann london 1912 events move so rapidly that up to this date no one so far as i am aware has paused long enough to make and publish an annotated list of the african game preserves herein i have attempted to begin that task myself and i regret that at this distance it is impossible for me to set down under the several titles the names of the men who made these preserves possible and actually founded them to thoughtful americans i particularly commend this list as a showing of the work of men who have not waited until the game had been practically exterminated before creating sanctuaries in which to preserve it in view of these results how trivial and small of soul seems the mercenary efforts of the organized woolgrowers of montana to thwart our plan to secure a paltry fifteen square miles of grass lands for the rugged and arid snow creek antelope preserve that is intended to help save a valuable species from quick extermination at this point i must quote the views of a high authority on the status of wild life and game preserves in africa the following is from major stevensonhamiltons book it is a remarkable phenomenon in human affairs how seldom the experience of others seems to turn the scale of action there are i take it very few farmers in the cape colony the orange free state or the transvaal who would not be glad to see an adequate supply of game upon their land indeed the writer is constantly dealing with applications as to the possibility of reintroducing various species from the game reserves to private farms and only the question of expense and the difficulty of transport have up to the present prevented this being done on a considerable scale when therefore the relatively small populations of such protectorates as are still well stocked with game are heard airily discussing the advisability of getting rid of it as quickly as possible one realizes how often vain are the teachings of history and how wellnigh hopeless it is to quote the result of similar action elsewhere it remains only to trust that things may be seen in truer perspective ere it is too late and that those in whose temporary charge it is may not cast recklessly away one of natures most splendid assets one moreover which once lightly discarded can never by any possibility be regained illustration the most important game preserves of africa the numbers refer to corresponding numbers in the text it is idle to say that the advance of civilization must necessarily mean the total disappearance of all wild animals this is one of those glib fallacies which flows only too readily from unthinking lips civilization in its full sensenot the advent of a few scattered pioneersof course implies their restriction especially as regards purely grassfeeding species within certain definite bounds both as regards numbers and sanctuaries but this is a very different thing from wholesale destruction that a few more or less deserving individuals may receive some small pecuniary benefit or gratify their taste for slaughter to the detriment of everyone else who may come after the fauna of an empire is the property of that empire as a whole and not of the small portion of it where the animals may happen to exist and while full justice and encouragement must be given to the farmer and pioneer neither should be permitted to entirely demolish for his own advantage resources which strictly speaking are not his ownanimal life in africa p 24 african game preserves british east africa 1p the athi plains preservethis is situated between the uganda railway and the boundary of german east africa its northern boundary is one mile north of the railway track it is about 215 miles long east and west by 105 miles from north to south and its area is about 13000 square miles it is truly a great preserve and worthy of the plains fauna that it is specially intended to perpetuate footnote p these numbers refer to corresponding numbers on the map of africa 2 the jubaland preservethis preserve lies northwest of mount kenia its southwestern corner is near lake baringo the laikipia escarpment is its western boundary up to mt nyiro and from that point its northern boundary runs 225 miles to marsabit lake from that point the boundary runs southbywest to the guaso nyiro river which forms the eastern half of the southern boundary its total area appears to be about 13000 square miles in addition to the two great preserves described above the government of british east africa has established on the uasin gishu plateau a centrally located sanctuary for elands roan antelopes and hippopotamii there is also a small special rhinoceros preserve about fifty miles southeastward of nairobi around kiu station on the railway egyptian sudan 3 a great nameless sanctuary for wild life exists on the eastern bank of the nile comprising the whole territory between the main stream the blue nile and abyssinia its length north and south is 215 miles and its width is about 125 miles which means a total area of about 26875 square miles natives and others living within this sanctuary may hunt thereinif they can procure licenses somaliland 4 hargeis reserve about

especially to preserve about one thousand elephants it is forty miles west of the southwestern arm of lake nyasa transvaal 10 sabisingwitzapongola preservethis great preserve occupies the whole region between the drakenberg mountains and the lebombo hills its total area is about 10500 square miles it lies in a compact block about 210 miles long by 50 miles wide along the portuguese border 11 rustenburg reservethis is situated at the head of the limpopo river and covers about 3500 square miles swaziland 12 the swaziland reserve contains about 1750 square miles and occupies the southwestern corner of swaziland rhodesia 13 the nweru marsh game reserve is in northwestern rhodesia bordering the congo free state the description of its local boundaries is quite unintelligible outside of rhodesia luangwa reservethe locality of this reserve cannot be determined from the official description which gives no clue to its shape or size game preserves in australasia new zealand little barrier island in the north and resolution island in the south and concerning both details are lacking australia kangaroo island near adelaide south australia is 400 miles northwest of melbourne of the total area of this rather large island of 300 square miles 140 square miles have been set aside as a game preserve chiefly for the preservation of the mallee bird lipoa occelata it is believed that eventually the whole island will become a wildlife sanctuary and it would seem that this can not be consummated a day too soon for the vanishing wild life wilsons promontory adelaide is a peninsula well suited to the preservation of wild life especially birds and it is now a sanctuary many private bird refuges have been created in australia tasmania eleven bird refuges have been created with a total area of 26000 acresan excellent record for tasmania freycinets peninsulaat present this wildlife sanctuary is not adequately protected from illicit hunting and trapping but its full protection is now demanded and no doubt this soon will be provided by the government i am informed that this offers a golden opportunity to secure a fine wildlife sanctuary at ridiculously small cost to the public the whole world is interested in the preservation of the remarkable fauna of tasmania the extermination of the thylacine would be a zoological calamity but it is impending chapter xl breeding game and fur in captivity game breedingthe breeding of game in captivity for sale in the markets of the world is just as legitimate as the breeding of domestic species this applies equally to mammals birds reptiles and fishes it is the duty of the nation and the state to foster such industries and facilitate the marketing of their products without any unnecessary formalities delays or losses to producers or to purchasers already this principle has been established in several states without going into the records it is safe to say that colorado was the pioneer in the socalled moregame movement about 1899 but there is one person who would like to have the world believe that it started in the state of new york about 1909 the idea is not quite as old as the hills but the application of it in the united states dates back through a considerable vista of years the laws of colorado providing for the creation of private game preserves and the marketing of their product under a tagging system are very elaborate and they show a sincere desire to foster an industry as yet but slightly developed in this country the laws of new york are much more simple and easy to understand than those of colorado there is one important principle now fully recognized in the new york laws for game breeding that other states will do well to adopt it is the fact that certain kinds of wild game can not be bred and reared in captivity on a commercial basis and this being true it is clearly against public policy to provide for the sale of any such species why provide for the sale of preservebred grouse and ducks which we know can not be bred and reared in confinement in marketable numbers for example if we may judge by the numerous experiments that thus far have been madeas we certainly have a right to dono man can successfully breed and rear in captivity on a commercial basis the canvasback duck teal pintail duck ruffed grouse or quail this being the case no amount of clamor from game dealers and their allies ever should induce any state legislature to provide for the sale of any of those species until it has been fully demonstrated that they have been and can be bred in captivity in large numbers the moment the markets of a state are thrown open to these impossible species from that moment the state game wardens must make a continuous struggle to prevent the importation and sale of those birds contrary to law this proposition is so simple that every honest man can see it all that any state legislature may rightfully be asked to do is to provide for the sale under tags of those species which we know can be bred in captivity in large numbers when the bayne law was drafted its authors considered with the utmost care the possibilities in the breeding of game in the united states on a commercial basis it was found that as yet only two wild native species have been and can be reared in captivity on a large scale these are the whitetailed deer and mallard duck of foreign species we can breed successfully for market the fallow deer red deer of europe and some of the pheasants of the old world for the rearing killing and marketing of all these the bayne law provides the simplest processes of state supervision that the best game protectors and game breeders of new york could devise the tagging system is expeditious cheap and effective practically the only real concession that is required of the gamebreeder concerns the killing which must be done in a systematic way whereby a state game warden can visit the breeders premises and affix the tags without any serious sacrifice of time or convenience on either side the tags cost the breeder five cents each and they pay the cost of the services rendered by the state by this admirable system which is very plainly set forth in the new york conservation commissions book of game laws all the wild game of new york and of every other state is absolutely protected at all times against illegal killing and illegal importation for the new york market now is it not the duty of connecticut maryland virginia the carolinas and every other state to return our compliment by passing similar laws massachusetts came up to public expectations at the next session of her legislature after the passage of our bayne law in 1913 california will try to secure a similar act and we know full well that her ducks geese quail grouse and bandtailed pigeon need it very much if the california protectors of wild life succeed in arousing the great quiet mass of people in that state their bayne bill will be swept through their legislature on a tidal wave of popular sentiment elkfor people who own wild woodlands near large cities there are good profits to be made in rearing whitetailed deer for the market i would also mention elk but for the fact that every man who rears a fine herd of elk quickly becomes so proud of the animals and so much attached to them that he can not bear to have them shot and butchered for market elk are just as easy to breed and rear as domestic cattle except that in the fall breeding season the fighting of rival bulls demands careful and intelligent management concerning the possibilities of feeding elk on hay at 25 per ton and declaring an annual profit i am not informed if the elk require to be fed all the year round the high price of hay and grain might easily render it impossible to produce marketable threeyearold animals at a profit whitetailed deerany one who owns from one hundred to one thousand acres of wild brushy or forestcovered land can raise whitetailed or virginia deer at a profit with smaller areas of land free range becomes impossible and the prospects of commercial profits diminish and disappear in any event a fenced range is absolutely essential and the best fence is the page 88 inches high all horizontals of no 9 wire top and bottom wires of no 7 and the perpendicular tiewires of no 12 this fence will hold deer elk bison and wild horses in large enclosures the whitetailed deer is hardy and prolific and when fairly cooked its flesh is a great delicacy in vermont the average weights of the deer killed in that state in various years have been as followin 1902 171 lbs in 1903 190 lbs in 1905 198 lbs in 1906 200 lbs in 1907 196 lbs in 1908 207 lbs and in 1909 155 lbs the reason for the great drop in 1909 is yet to be ascertained in 1910 in new york city the wholesale price of whole deer carcasses was from 22 to 25 cents per pound venison saddles were worth from 30 to 35 cents per pound on the bill of fare of a first class hotel a portion of venison costs from 150 to 250 according to the diners location it is probable that such prices as these will prevail only in the largest cities and therefore they must not be regarded as general live whitetailed deer can be purchased for breeding purposes at prices ranging from 25 to 35 each a good eastern source of supply is blue mountain forest mr austin corbin president broadway and cortlandt st new york in the west good stock can be procured from the clevelandcliffs iron company through cvr townsend negaunee mich whose preserve occupies the whole of grand island lake superior the department of agriculture has published for free distribution a pamphlet entitled raising deer and other large game animals in the united states by david e lantz which contains much valuable information although it leaves much unsaid all breeders of deer are cautioned that during the fall and early winter months all adult whitetailed bucks are dangerous to man and should be treated accordingly a measure of safety can be secured in a large park by compelling the deer always to keep at a respectful distance and making no pets whatever whenever a buck finds his horns and loses his fear of man climb the fence quickly bucks in the rutting season sometimes seem to go crazy and often they attack men wantonly and dangerously the method of attack is to an unarmed man almost irresistible the animal lowers his head stiffens his neck and with terrible force drives straight forward for your stomach and bowels usually there are eight sharp spears of bone to impale you the best defense of an unarmed man is to seize the left antler with the left hand and with the right hand pull the deers right front foot from under him merely holding to the horns makes great sport for the deer he loves that unequal combat the great desideratum is to put his fore legs out of commission and get him down on his knees does are sometimes dangerous and inflict serious damage by rising on their hind feet and viciously striking with their sharp front hoofs these tendencies in american deer are mentioned here as a duty to persons who may desire to breed deer for profit the red deer of europeanyone who has plenty of natural forest food for deer and a good market within fair range may find the european red deer a desirable species it is of size smaller and more easily managed than the wapiti and is more easily marketed because of its smaller size as a species it is hardy and prolific and of course its venison is as good as that of any other deer live specimens for stocking purposes can be purchased of sa stephan agent for carl hagenbeck cincinnati zoological gardens or of wenz mackensen yardley pa at prices ranging from 60 to 100 each according to size and age at present the supply of specimens in this country on hand for sale is very small the fallow deerthis species is the most universal park deer of europe it seems to be invulnerable to neglect and misuse for it has persisted through countless generations of breeding in captivity and the abuse of all nations in size it is a trifle smaller than our whitetailed deer with spots in summer and horns that are widely flattened at the extremities in a very interesting way it is very hardy and prolific but of course it can not stand everything that could be put upon it it needs a dry shed in winter red clover hay and crushed oats for winter food and no deer should be kept in mud as a commercial proposition it is not so meaty as the whitetail but it is less troublesome to keep the adult males are not such vicious or dangerous fighters as whitetail bucks live specimens are worth from 50 to 75 the essex county park commissioners orange new jersey have had excellent success with this species in 1906 they purchased twentyfive does and four bucks and placed them in an enclosure of 150 acres on a wooded mountainside in 1912 they had 150 deer and were obliged to take measures for a disposal of the surplus messrs wenz mackensen keep an almost continuous supply of fallow deer on hand for sale the indian sambar deeri have long advocated the introduction in the southern states wherever deer can be protected of this great hulking animated venisonfactory while i have not delved deeply into the subject of weight and growth i feel sure from casual observations of the growth of about twentyfive animals that this species produces more venison during the first two years of its life than any other deer with which i am acquainted i regard it as the greatest venisonproducer of the whole deer family and i know that is a large order the size of a yearling is almost absurd it is so great for an animal of tender years when adult the species is for its height very large and heavy as a foodproducing animal located in the southern hill forests and taking care of itself theres millions in it but it must be kept under fence for in no southern or northern state would any such mass of juicy wild meat long be permitted to roam at large unkilled through this species i believe that a million acres of southern timber lands now useless except for timber growth could be made very productive in choice venison the price would bea good fence and protection from poachers the indian sambar deer looks like a shortlegged bigbodied understudy of our american elk it breeds well in captivity and it is of quiet and tractable disposition it can not live in a country where the temperature goes down to 25 degrees f and remains there for long periods it would i am firmly convinced do well all along the gulf coast and if acclimatized along the gulf with the lapse of time and generations it would become more and more hardy grow more hair and push its way northward until it reached the latitude of tennessee but then in a wild state it could not be protected from poachers as stated elsewhere dr ray v pierce has successfully acclimatized and bred this species in his st vincent island game preserve near apalachicola florida more than that the species has crossed with the whitetailed deer of the island living specimen of the indian sambar deer are worth from 125 to 250 according to size and other conditions just at present it seems difficult for americans to procure a sufficient number of males we have had very bad luck with several males that we attempted to import for breeding purposes the mallard ducka great many persons have made persistent attempts to breed the canvasback redhead mallard black duck pintail teal and other species on a commercial basis so far as i am aware the mallard is the only wild duck that has been bred in sufficient numbers to slaughter for the markets the wood duck and mandarin can be bred in fair numbers but only sufficient to supply the demand for living birds for park purposes one would naturally suppose that a species as closely allied to the mallard as the black duck is known to be would breed like the mallard but the black duck is so timid and nervous about nesting as to be almost worthless in captivity all the species named above except the mallard must at present and in general be regarded as failures in breeding for the market of all american ducks the common mallard is the most persistent and successful breeder it quickly becomes accustomed to captivity it enjoys park life and when given even half a chance it will breed and rear its young unquestionably the mallard duck can be reared in captivity in numbers limited only by the extent of breeders facilities the amount of net profit that can be realized depends wholly upon the business acumen and judgment displayed in the management of the flock the total amount of knowledge necessary to success is not so very great but at the same time the exercise of a fair amount of intelligence and also careful diligence is absolutely necessary naturally the care and food of the flock must not cost extravagantly or the profits will inevitably disappear as a contribution to the cause of gamebreeding for the market and the creation of a new industry of value mr ls crandall and the author wrote for the new york state conservation commission a pamphlet on breeding mallard ducks for market copies of it can be procured of our state conservation commission at albany by enclosing ten cents in stamps breeding furbearing animals when hundreds of persons wrote to me asking for literature on the breeding of furbearing animals for profit for ten years i was compelled to tell them that there was no such literature during the past three years a few offerings have been made and i lose not a moment in listing them here life histories of northern animals by ernest t seton charles scribners sons 2 volumes 18 contains carefully written and valuable chapters on fox farming skunk farming marten farming and mink farming and other valuable life histories of the furbearing animals of north america rod and gun in canada a magazine for sportsmen published by wj taylor woodstock ontario contained in 1912 a series of articles on the culture of black and silver foxes by rb and lv croft country life in america has published a number of illustrated articles on fox and skunk farming with its usual enterprise and forethought the biological survey of the department of agriculture has published a valuable pamphlet of 22 pages on silver fox farming by wilfred h osgood copies of which can be procured by addressing the secretary of agriculture in consulting that contribution however it must be borne in mind that just now in fox farming history is being made more rapidly than heretofore i do not mean to say that the above are the only sources of information on furfarming for profit but they are the ones that have most impressed me the files of all the journals and magazines for sportsmen contain numerous articles on this subject and they should be carefully consulted blackfox farmingthe ridiculous prices now being paid in london for the skins of black or silver foxes has created in this country a small furore over the breeding of that colorphase of the red fox the prices that actually have been obtained both for skins and for live animals for breeding purposes have a strong tendency to make people crazy fancy paying 12000 in real money for one pair of live black foxes that has been done on prince edward island and 10000 per pair is now regarded as a bargaincounter figure on prince edward island in the gulf of st lawrence blackfox breeding has been going on for ten years and is now on a successful basis one man has made a fortune in the business and it is rumored that a stock company is considering the purchase of his tenacre fox ranch at a fabulous figure the enormous prices obtainable for live black foxes male or female make diamonds and rubies seem cheap and commonplace and it is no wonder that enterprising men are tempted to enter that industry the price of a black fox is one of the wonders of a recklessly extravagant and whimsical age all the furwearing world knows very well that fox fur is one of the poorest of furs to withstand the wear and tear of actual use about two seasons hard wear are enough to put the best fox skin on the wane and three or four can be guaranteed to throw it into the discard even the finest black fox skin is nothing superlatively beautiful a choice cross fox skin costing only 50 is far more beautiful as a color proposition but london joyously pays 2500 or 3000 for a single blackfox skin to wear of course all such fads as this are as ephemeral as the butterflies of summer the russojapanese war quickly reduced the value of alaskan blue foxes from 30 to 18 and away went the alaskan fox farms a similar twist of fortunes fickle wheel may in any year send the black fox out of royal favor and remove the bottom from the business of producing it let us hope however that the craze for that fur will continue for we like to see our friends and neighbors make good profits pheasant rearingthis subject is so well understood by gamebreeders and there is already so much good literature available regarding it it is not necessary that i should take it up here chapter xli teaching wild life protection to the young thousands of busy and burdened men and women are today striving hard early and late to promote measures that will preserve the valuable wild life of the world they desire to leave to the boys and girls of tomorrow a good showing of the marvelous bird and animal forms that make the world beautiful and interesting they are acting on the principle that the wild life of today is not ours to destroy or to keep as we choose but has been given to us in trust partly for our benefit and partly for those who come after us and audit our accounts they believe that we have no right to squander and destroy a wildlife heritage of priceless value which we have done nothing to create and which is not ours to destroy duty of parentsthis being the case it is very necessary that the young people of today should be taught early and often the virtue and the necessity of wildlife protection there is no reason that the boy of today should not take up his share of the common burden just as soon as he is old enough to wander alone through the woods let him be taught in precise terms that he must not rob birds nests and that he must not shoot songbirds woodpeckers and kingfishers with a 22calibre rifle or any other gun at this moment there lies upon my side table a vicious little 22calibre rifle that was taken from two boys who were camping in the woods of connecticut and amusing themselves by shooting valuable insectivorous birds now those boys were not wholly to blame for what they were doing but their fathers and mothers were very much to blame they should have been taught at the parental knee that it is very wrong to kill any bird except a genuine game bird and then only in the lawful open season those two fathers paid 10 each for having failed in their duty and it served them right for they were the real culprits smallcalibre rifles are becoming alarmingly common in the hands of boys parents must do their duty in the training of their boys against birdshooting it is a very serious matter a million boys who roam the fields with small rifles without having been instructed in protection can destroy an appalling number of valuable birds in the course of a year some parents are so slavishly devoted to their children that they wish them to do everything they please and be checked in nothing such parents constitute one of the pests of society and a drag upon the happiness of their own children it is now the bounden duty of each parent to teach each one of his or her children that the time has come when the resources of nature and especially wild life must be conserved to permit boys to grow up and acquire guns without this knowledge is very wrong the duty of teachers and schoolsa great deal of nature study is being taught in the public schools of the united states that the young people of our land should be taught to appreciate the works of nature and especially animal life and plant life is very desirable thus far however there is a screw loose in the system and that is the shortage in definite positive instruction regarding individual duty toward the wild creatures great and small along with their nature studies all our school children should be taught in the imperative mood 1 that it is wrong to disturb breeding birds or rob birds nests 2 that it is wrong to destroy any harmless living creature not properly classed as game except it be to preserve it in a museum 3 that it is no longer right for civilized man to look upon wild game as necessary food because there is plenty of other food and the remnant of game can not withstand slaughter in that basis 4 that the time has come when it is the duty of every good citizen to take an active aggressive part in preventing the destruction of wild life and in promoting its preservation 5 that every boy and girl over twelve years of age can do something in this cause and finally 6 that protection and encouragement will bring back the almost vanished birds we call upon all boards of education all principals of schools and all teachers to educate our boys and girls constantly and imperatively along those lines teachers do not say to your pupilsit is right and nice to protect birds but sayit is your duty to protect all harmless wild things and you must do it in a good cause there is great virtue in must really we are losing each year an immense amount of available wildlife protection the doctrine of imperative individual duty never yet has been taught in our schools as it should be taught a few teachers have indeed covered this ground but i am convinced that their proportion is mighty small text booksthe writers of the nature study text books are very much to blame because ninetenths of the time this subject has been ignored the situation has not been taken seriously save in a few cases by a very few authors i am glad to report that in 1912 there was published a fine text book by professor james w peabody of the morris high school new york and dr arthur e hunt in which from beginning to end the duty to protect wild life is strongly insisted upon it is entitled elementary biology plants animals and man hereafter no zoological or nature study text book should be given a place in any school in america unless the author of it has done his full share in setting forth the duty of the young citizen toward wild life were i a member of a board of education i would seek to establish and enforce this requirement today any author who will presume to write a text book of nature study or zoology without knowing and doing his duty toward our vanishing fauna is too ignorant of wild life and too careless of his duty toward it to be accepted as a safe guide for the young the time for criminal indifference has gone by hereafter every one who is not for the preservation of wild life is against it and it is time to separate the sheep from the goats from this time forth the preservation of our fauna should be regarded as a subject on which every candidate for a teachers certificate should undergo an examination before receiving authority to teach in a public school the candidate should be required to know why the preservation of birds is necessary why the slaughter of wild life is wrong and criminal the extent to which wild birds and mammals return to us and thrive under protection why wild game is no longer a legitimate food supply why wild game should not be sold and why the feathers of wild birds other than game birds never should be used as millinery ornaments as sensible americans and somewhat boastful of our intelligence we should put the education of the young in wildlife protection on a rational business basis state effortsin several of our states systematic efforts to educate children in their duty toward wild life are already being made to this end an annual bird day has been established for statewide observance this splendid idea is now legally in force in the following states california connecticut delaware illinois louisiana minnesota ohio and wisconsin bird day is also more or less regularly observed though not legally provided for in new york indiana colorado and alabama and locally in some cities of pennsylvania usually the observance of the day is combined with that of arbor day and the date is fixed by proclamation of the governor alabama and wisconsin regularly issue elaborate and beautiful arbor and bird day annuals and illinois and possibly other states have issued very good publications of this character the phillips educational campaign for the birdsquite recently there has come under my notice an episode in the education of school children that has given the public profound satisfaction i cite it here as an object lesson for panamerica in carrick pennsylvania just across the monongahela river from the city of pittsburgh lives john m phillips state game commissioner naturelover sportsman and friend of man he is a man who does things and gets results goat mountain park 450 square miles in british columbia today owes its existence to him for without his initiative and labor it would not have been established it was the first game preserve of british columbia three years ago mr phillips became deeply impressed by the idea that one of the best ways in the world to protect the wild life both of today and the future would be in teaching school children to love it and protect it his fertile brain and open checkbook soon devised a method for his home city his theory was that by giving the children something to do not only in protecting but in actually bringing back the birds much might be accomplished illustration bird day at carrick pa marching behind the governor in studying the subject of bringing back the birds he found that the russian mulberry is one of the finest trees in the world as a purveyor of good fruit for many kinds of birds the tree does not much resemble our native mulberry but is equally beautiful and interesting the fruit is not a long berry nor is it of a purple color but it grows from buds on the limbs and twigs something after the manner of the pussywillow it is smaller of light color and has a very distinct flavor the most striking peculiarity about the fruit is that it keeps on ripening during two months or more new berries appearing daily while others are ripening this is why it is such good bird food nor is it half bad for folks for the berries are good to look at and to eat either with cream or without and to make pies that will set any sane boys mouth awatering at sighterasmus wilson everyone knows the value of sweet cherries both to birds and to children mr phillips decided that he would give away several hundred bird boxes and also several hundred sweet cherry and russian mulberry trees the first gift distribution was made in the early spring of 1909 another followed in 1910 but the last one was the most notable on april 11 1912 carrick had a great and glorious bird day mr phillips was the author of it and governor tener the finisher on that day occurred the third annual gift distribution of raw materials designed to promote in the breasts of 2000 children a love for birds and an active desire to protect and increase them mr phillips gave away 500 bird boxes 500 sweet cherry trees and 200 mulberry trees the sun shone brightly 500 flags waved in carrick the governor made one of the best speeches of his life and erasmus wilson faithful friend of the birds wrote this good story of the occasion for the gazettetimes of pittsburgh the governor was there and the children the birdboxes and the young trees and was there ever a brighter or more fitting day for a children and bird jubilee the scene was so inspiring that gov tener made one of the best speeches of his life the distribution of several hundred cherry and mulberry trees was the occasion and the beautiful grounds of the roosevelt school carrick was the scene mr john m phillips sane sportsman and enthusiastic friend of the birds has been looking forward to this as the culmination of a scheme he has been working on for years and he was more than pleased with the outcome the intense delight it afforded him more than repaid him for all it has cost in all the years past but it was impossible to tell who were the more delightedhe or the governor or the children or the visitors who were so fortunate as to be present county superintendent of schools samuel hamilton was simply a mass of delight and how could he be otherwise surrounded as he was by 2000 and more children fairly quivering with delight children will care for and defend things that are their very own fight for them and stand guard over them realizing this mr phillips undertook to show them how they could have birds all their own being clever in devising schemes for achieving things most to be desired he began giving out birdboxes to those who would agree to put them up and to watch and defend the birds when they came to make their homes with them and he found that no more faithful sentinel ever stood on guard than the boy who had a birdhouse all his own here was the solution to the vexed problem provide boxes for those who would agree to put them up care for the birds and study their habits and needs the children agreed at once and the birds did not object so mr phillips had some hundreds four or five bluebird and wren boxes constructed during the past winter these were passed out some weeks ago to any boys or girls who would present an order signed by their parents and countersigned by the principal of the school he knows enough about a boy to know that he does not prize the things that come without effort nor will he become deeply interested in anything for which he is not held more or less responsible hence the advantage in having him write an order have it indorsed by his parents and vouched for by his school principal that he had struck the right scheme was proven by the avidity with which the girls and boys rushed for the boxes the fact that a heavy rain was falling did not dampen their ardor for a moment nor did the fact that they were tramping mr phillips beautiful lawn into a field of mud mr phillips seeing the necessity of providing food for the prospective hosts of birds and wishing to place the responsibility on the boys and girls offered to provide a cherry tree or mulberry tree for every box erected provided they should be properly planted and diligently cared for this was practically the culmination of the most unique bird scheme ever attempted and yesterday was the day set apart for the distribution of these hundreds of fruit trees the products of which are to be divided share and share alike with the birds nowhere else has such a scheme been attempted and never before has there been just such a day of jubilee the intense interest manifested by the children and the earnest enthusiasm manifested leaves no doubt about their carrying out their part of the contract illustration distributing bird boxes and fruit trees up to date 1912 mr phillips has given away about 1000 bird boxes 1500 cherry and russian mulberry trees and transformed the schools of carrick into seething masses of children militantly enthusiastic in the protection of birds and in providing them with homes and food as a final coup mr phillips has induced the city of pittsburgh to create the office of city ornithologist at a salary of 1200 per year the duty of the new officer is to protect all birds in the city from all kinds of molestation especially when nesting to erect birdhouses provide food for wild birds on a large scale and report annually upon the increase or decrease of feathered residents and visitors mr frederic s webster long known as a naturalist and practical ornithologist has been appointed to the position and is now on active duty so far as we are aware pittsburgh is the first city to create the office of city ornithologist it is a happy thought it will yield good results and other cities will follow pittsburghs good example chapter xlii the ethics of sportsmanship i count it as rather strange that american and english sportsmen have hunted and shot for a century and until 1908 formulated practically nothing to establish and define the ethics of shooting game here and there a few unwritten principles have been evolved and have become fixed by common consent but the total number of these is very few perhaps this has been for the reason that every free and independent sportsman prefers to be a law unto himself is it not doubly strange however that even down to the present year the term sportsmen never has been defined by a sportsman forty years ago a sportsman might have been defined according to the standards of that period as a man who hunts wild game for pleasure those were the days wherein no one foresaw the wholesale annihilation of species and there were no wilderness game preserves in those days gentlemen shot female hoofed game trapped bears if they felt like it killed ten times as much big game as they could use and no one made any fuss whatever about the waste or extermination of wild life those were the days of oxteams and broadaxes today we are living in a totally different worlda world of grinding crunching pulverizing progress a world of annihilation of the works of nature and what is a sportsman today a sportsman is a man who loves nature and who in the enjoyment of the outdoor life and exploration takes a reasonable toll of natures wild animals but not for commercial profit and only so long as his hunting does not promote the extermination of species in view of the disappearance of wild life all over the habitable globe and the steady extermination of species the ethics of sportsmanship has become a matter of tremendous importance if a man can shoot the last living burchell zebra or pronghorned antelope and be a sportsman and a gentleman then we may just as well drop down all bars and say no more about the ethics of shooting game but the real gentlemensportsmen of the world are not insensible to the duties of the hour in regard to the taking or not taking of game the time has come when canon laws should be laid down of worldwide application and so thoroughly accepted and promulgated that their binding force can not be ignored among other things it is time for a list of species to be published which no man claiming to be either a gentleman or a sportsman can shoot for aught else than preservation in a public museum of course this list would be composed of the species that are threatened with extermination of american animals it should include the pronghorned antelope mexican mountain sheep all the mountain sheep and goats in the united states the california grizzly bear mule deer west indian seal and california elephant seal and walrus in africa that list should include the eland white rhinoceros blessbok bontebok kudu giraffes and southern elephants sable antelope rhinoceros south of the zambesi leucoryx antelope and whaleheaded stork in asia it should include the great indian rhinoceros and its allied species the burrhel the nilgiri tahr and the gayal the david deer of manchuria already is extinct in a wild state in australia the interdiction should include the thylacine or tasmanian wolf all the large kangaroos the emu lyre bird and the malleebird think what it would mean to the species named above if all the sportsmen of the world would unite in their defense both actively and passively it would be to those species a modus vivendi worth while prior to 1908 no effort so far as we are aware ever had been made to promote the establishment of a comprehensive and uptodate code of ethics for sportsmen who shoot a few clubs of men who are hunters of big game had expressed in their constitutions a few brief principles for the purpose of standardizing their own respective memberships but that was all i have not taken pains to make a general canvass of sportsmens clubs to ascertain what rules have been laid down by any large number of organizations the boone and crockett club of new york and washington had in its constitution the following excellent article article x the use of steel traps the making of large bags the killing of game while swimming in water or helpless in deep snow and the unnecessary killing of females or young of any species of ruminant shall be deemed offenses any member who shall commit such offenses may be suspended or expelled from the club by unanimous vote of the executive committee in 1906 this club condemned the use of automatic shotguns in hunting as unsportsmanlike the lewis and clark club of pittsburgh has in its constitution as section 3 of article 3 the following comprehensive principle the term legitimate sport means not only the observance of local laws but excludes all methods of taking game other than by fair stalking or still hunting at the end of the constitution of this club is this declaration and admonition purchase and sale of trophiesas the purchase of heads and horns establishes a market value and encourages indians and others to shoot for sale often in violation of local laws and always to the detriment of the protection of game for legitimate sport the lewis and clark club condemns the purchase or the sale of the heads or horns of any game in 1906 the lewis and clark club condemned the use of automatic shotguns as unsportsmanlike the shikar club of london a club which contains all the biggame hunters of the nobility and gentry of englandq and of which his majesty king george is honorary president has declared the leading feature of its objects in the following terms to maintain the standard of sportsmanship it is not squandered bullets and swollen bags which appeal to us the test is rather in a love of forest mountains and desert in acquired knowledge of the habits of animals in the strenuous pursuit of a wary and dangerous quarry in the instinct for a welldevised approach to a fair shooting distance and in the patient retrieve of a wounded animal footnote q this organization contains in its list of members the most distinguished names in the modern annals of british sport and exploration its honorary membership of eight persons contains the names of three americans theodore roosevelt madison grant and wt hornaday and of this fact at least one person is extremely proud in 1908 the campfire club of america formally adopted as its code of ethics the sportsmans platform of fifteen articles that was prepared by the writer and placed before the sportsmen of america great britain and her colonial dependencies in that year in the book of the club it regularly appears as follows code of ethics of the campfire club of america proposed by wm t hornaday and adopted december 10 1908 1 the wild animal life of today is not ours to do with as we please the original stock is given to us in trust for the benefit both of the present and the future we must render an accounting of this trust to those who come after us 2 judging from the rate at which the wild creatures of north america are now being destroyed fifty years hence there will be no large game left in the united states nor in canada outside of rigidly protected game preserves it is therefore the duty of every good citizen to promote the protection of forests and wild life and the creation of game preserves while a supply of game remains every man who finds pleasure in hunting or fishing should be willing to spend both time and money in active work for the protection of forests fish and game 3 the sale of game is incompatible with the perpetual preservation of a proper stock of game therefore it should be prohibited by laws and by public sentiment 4 in the settled and civilized regions of north america there is no real necessity for the consumption of wild game as human food nor is there any good excuse for the sale of game for food purposes the maintenance of hired laborers on wild game should be prohibited everywhere under severe penalties 5 an indian has no more right to kill wild game or to subsist upon it all the year round than any white man in the same locality the indian has no inherent or godgiven ownership of the game of north america anymore than of its mineral resources and he should be governed by the same game laws as white men 6 no man can be a good citizen and also be a slaughterer of game or fishes beyond the narrow limits compatible with highclass sportsmanship 7 a gamebutcher or a markethunter is an undesirable citizen and should be treated as such 8 the highest purpose which the killing of wild game and game fishes can hereafter be made to serve is in furnishing objects to overworked men for tramping and camping trips in the wilds and the value of wild game as human food should no longer be regarded as an important factor in its pursuit 9 if rightly conserved wild game constitutes a valuable asset to any country which possesses it and it is good statesmanship to protect it 10 an ideal hunting trip consists of a good comrade fine country and a very few trophies per hunter 11 in an ideal hunting trip the death of the game is only an incident and by no means is it really necessary to a successful outing 12 the best hunter is the man who finds the most game kills the least and leaves behind him no wounded animals 13 the killing of an animal means the end of its most interesting period when the country is fine pursuit is more interesting than possession 14 the killing of a female hoofed animal save for special preservation is to be regarded as incompatible with the highest sportsmanship and it should everywhere be prohibited by stringent laws 15 a particularly fine photograph of a large wild animal in its haunts is entitled to more credit than the dead trophy of a similar animal an animal that has been photographed never should be killed unless previously wounded in the chase this platform has been adopted as a code of ethics by the following organizations besides the campfire club of america the lewis and clark club of pittsburgh john m phillips president the north american fish and game protective association international massachusetts fish and game protective association boston campfire club of michigan detroit rod and gun club sheridan county wyoming the platform has been endorsed and published by the society for the preservation of the wild fauna of the british empire london which is an endorsement of farreaching importance major j stevensonhamilton cmzs warden of the government game reserves of the transvaal south africa has adopted the platform and given it the most effective endorsement that it has received from any single individual in his great work on game protection in africa and wildanimal lore entitled animal life in africa and very highly commended by the committee on literary honors of the campfire club he publishes the entire platform with a depth and cordiality of endorsement that is bound to warm the heart of every man who believes in the principles laid down in that document he says it should be printed on the back of every license that is issued for hunting in africa i am profoundly impressed by the fact that it is high time for sportsmen all over the world to take to heart the vital necessity of adopting high and clearly defined codes of ethics to suit the needs of the present hour the days of game abundance and the careless treatment of wild life have gone by never to return chapter xliii the duty of american zoologists and educators to american wild life the publication of this chapter will hardly be regarded as a bid for fame or even popularity on the part of the author however the subject can not be ignored simply because it is disagreeable throughout sixty years to go no further back the people of america have been witnessing the strange spectacle of american zoologists as a mass so intent upon the academic study of our continental fauna that they seem not to have cared a continental about the destruction of that fauna during that tragic period twelve species of north american birds have been totally exterminated twentythree are almost exterminated and the mammals have fared very badly if by their works ye shall know them then no man can say that the men referred to have been conspicuous on the firing line in defense of assaulted wild life in their hearts we know that in an academic way the naturalists of america do care about wildlife slaughter and the extermination of species and we also know that perhaps fifty american zoologists have at times taken an active and serious interest in protection work i am speaking now of the general body of museum directors and curators professors and teachers of zoology in our institutions of learninga legion in themselves teachers of nature study in our secondary schools investigators and specialists in state and government service the taxidermists and osteologists and the array of literary people who like all the foregoing make their bread and butter out of the exploitation of wild life taken as a whole the people named above constitute a grand army of at least five thousand trained educated resourceful and influential persons they all depend upon wild life for their livelihood when they talk about living things the public listens with respectful attention their knowledge of the value of wild life would be worth something to our cause but thus far it never has been capitalized these people are hard workers and when they mark out definite courses and attainable goals they know how to get results yet what do we see for sixty long years with the exception of the work of a corporals guard of their number this grand army has remained in camp partly neglecting and partly refusing to move upon the works of the enemy for sixty years with the exception of the nongamebird law as a class and a mass they have left to the sportsmen of the country the dictating of laws for the protection of all the game birds the mammals and the game fishes when we stop to consider that the game birds alone embrace 154 very important species the appalling extent to which the zoologist has abdicated in favor of the sportsman becomes apparent it is a very great mistake and a wrong besides for the zoologists of the country to abandon the game birds mammals and fishes of north america to the sportsmen to do with as they please yet that is practically what has been done the time was thirty or forty years ago when wild life was so abundant that we did not need to worry about its preservation that was the golden era of study and investigation that era ended definitely in 1884 with the practical extermination of the wild american bison partly through the shameful greed and partly through the neglect of the american people we are now living in the middle of the period of extermination the questions for every american zoologist and every sportsman to answer now are shall the slaughter of species go on to a quick end of the period shall we give posterity a birdless gameless fishless continent or not shall we have close seasons all over the country for five or ten years or for five hundred years if we are courageous we will brace up and answer these questions now like men if we are fainthearted and eager for peace at any price then we will sidestep the ugly situation until the destroyers have settled it for us by the wholesale extermination of species if the zoologist cares to know then i will tell him that today the wild life of the world can be saved by law but not by sentiment alone you cannot educate a poacher a gamehog a marketgunner a milliner or a vain and foolish woman of fashion all these must be curbed and controlled by law game refuges alone will not save the wild life all species of birds mammals and game fishes of north america must have more thorough and farreaching protection than they now have do not always take your cue from the sportsmen especially regarding the enactment of long close seasons if you need good advice or help about drafting a bill write to dr ts palmer department of agriculture washington and you will receive prompt and valuable assistance the doctor is a wise man and there is nothing about protective laws that is unknown to him go to your state senator and your assemblyman with the bills that you know should be enacted into law and assure them that those measures are necessary for the wild life and beneficial to 98 per cent of the people who own the wild life you will be heard with respectful attention in any lawmaking body that you choose to enter people who cannot give time and labor must supply you with money for your campaigns ask and you will receive i have proven this many times with care and exactness account to your subscribers for the expenditure of all money placed in your hands and you will receive continuous support in times of great stress print circulars and leaflets by the tenthousand and get them into the hands of the people calling for their help our 42000 copies of the wild life call sixteen pages were distributed by organizations all over the state of new york and along with mr andrew d meloys letters to the members of the new york state league aroused such a tidal wave of public sentiment against the sale of game that the bayne bill was finally swept through the legislature with only one dissenting vote and yet in the beginning not one man dared to hope that that very revolutionary measure could by any possibility be passed in its first year in new york state even if it ever could be it was the aroused public that did it this volume has been written under great pressure in order to put the whole situation before the people of america including the zoologists and to give them some definite information state by state regarding the needs of the hour look at the needs of your own state in the roll call of states and you will find work for your hand to do clear your conscience by taking hold now to do everything that you can to stop the carnage and preserve the remnant twentyfive or fifty years hence if we have a birdless and gameless continent let it not be said that the zoologists of america helped to bring it about by wicked apathy at this juncture a brief survey of the attitude toward wild life of certain american institutions of national reputation will be decidedly pertinent i shall mention only a few of the many that through their character and position owe specific duties to this cause noblesse oblige the biological survey of the us department of agriculture is a splendid center of activity and initiative in the preservation of our wild life the work of dr ts palmer has already been spoken of and thanks to his efforts and direction the survey has become the recognized special champion of preservation in america the us forestry bureau is developing into a very valuable ally and we confidently look forward to the time when its influence in preservation will be a hundred times more potent than it is today that will be when every national forest is made a game preserve and every forest ranger is made a game warden let us have both those developments and quickly in 1896 the american museum of natural history became a center of activity in bird protection and the headquarters of the new york state audubon society the president of the museum professor henry fairfield osborn is also the president of that organization in several of the new york state movements for bird conservation especially those bearing on the plumage law the american museum has been active and at times conspicuous no one so i believe ever appealed to the president of the museum for help on the firing line without receiving help of some kind unfortunately however the preservation of wild life is not one of the declared objects of the american museum corporation or one on which its officers may spend money as is so freely and even joyously done by the zoological society the museums influence has been exerted chiefly through the active workers of the state audubon society and it was as president of that body that professor osborn subscribed to the fund that was so largely instrumental in creating the new york law against the sale of game there is room for an important improvement in the declared objects of the american museum to the cause of protection it is a distinct loss that that great and powerful institution should be unable to spend any money in promoting the preservation of our fauna from annihilation an amendment to its constitution is earnestly recommended the activities of the new york zoological society began in 1896 and they do not require comment here they have been continuous aggressive and farreaching and they have been supported by thousands of dollars from the societys treasury it is true that the funds available for protection work have not represented a great annual sum such as the work demands but the amount being expended from year to year is steadily increasing in serious emergencies there is always something available during the past two years to relieve the society of a portion of this particular burden the director of the park secured several large subscriptions from persons outside the society who previously had never entered into this work the milwaukee public museum has entered actively and effectively into the fight to preserve the birds of wisconsin from annihilation by the saloonloafer element that three years ago determined to repeal the best bird laws on the books and throw the shooting privilege wide open mr henry l ward director of the museum went to the firing line and remained there last year the saloon element thought that they had a large majority of the votes in the legislature pledged to vote their way it looked like it but when the decent people again rose and demanded justice for the birds the members of the legislature stood by them in large majorities the springshooting baglimit and huntinglicense laws were not repealed the university of kansas lawrence scored heavily for the cause of wildlife protection when in 1908 it gave to the governor of the state the services of a member of its faculty professor lewis lindsay dyche who was wanted to fill the position of state fish and game commissioner professor dyche proved to be a very live wire and his activities have covered the state of kansas to its farthest corners we love him for the host of enemies he has madeamong the poachers gamebutchers pseudosportsmen and lawbreakers generally the men who thought they had the pull of friendship for lawbreaking were first warned and then as second offenders hauled up to the bar one and all the more the destroyers try to hound the commissioner the more popular is he with the great solid mass of good citizens who believe in the saving of wild life the museum of comparative zoology has at last made a beginning in the field of protection last winter while the great battle raged over the wharton nosaleofgame bill several members of the museum staff appeared at the hearings and otherwise worked for the success of the measure it was most timely aidand very much needed it is to be hoped that that auspicious beginning will be continued from year to year the museum should keep at least one good fighter constantly in the field the boston society of natural history takes a very active part in promoting the preservation of the fauna of massachusetts and in resisting the attempts of the destroyers to repeal the excellent laws now in force its members put forth vigorous efforts in the great campaign of 1912 the brooklyn institute of arts and sciences is well represented in the field of protection by director franklin w hooper now president of the american bison society and an earnest promoter of the perpetuation of the bison when the wind cave national bison herd is fully established in south dakota as it practically is already the chief credit for that coup will be due to the unflagging energy and persistence of professor hooper the buffalo academy of sciences in 1911 entered actively and effectively under the leadership of dr lee h smith into the campaign for the bayne bill besides splendid service rendered in western new york dr smith appeared in albany with a strong delegation in support of the bill the university of california was the first institution of learning to enter the field of wildlife protection for active aggressive and permanent work wl taylor and joseph grinnell of the university museum have taken up the fight to save the fauna of california from the dangers that now threaten it at this point our enumeration of the activities of american zoological institutions comes to an unfortunate end there are many individuals to be named elsewhere in the roll of honor but that is another story i am now going to set before the public the names of certain institutions largely devoted to zoology and permeated by zoologists which thus far seem to have entirely ignored the needs of our fauna and which so far we know have contributed neither men money nor encouragement to the army of the defense partial list of institutions owing service to wild life the united states national museum contains a large and expensive corps of zoological curators and assistant curators some of whom long ago should have taken upon themselves the task of reforming the laws of the district of columbia virginia and maryland at their very doors this museum should maintain at least one man in the field of protection and the existence of the biological survey is no excuse for the museums inactivity the field museum of chicago is a great institution but it appears to be inactive in wildlife protection and indifferent to the fate of our wild life its influence is greatly needed on the firing line especially in illinois wisconsin iowa and northern minnesota first of all the odious saleofgame situation in chicago should be cleaned up the philadelphia academy of sciences has been represented on the aou committee on bird protection by mr witmer stone the time has come when this academy should be represented on the firing line as a virile wideawake selfsacrificing and aggressive force it is perhaps the oldest zoological body in the united states its scientific standing is unquestioned its members must know of the carnage that is going on around them for they are not ignorant men the pennsylvania state game commission today stands in urgent need of active vigorous and persistent assistance from the philadelphia academy in the fierce campaign already in progress for additional protective laws will that help be given the carnegie institute of washington endowment 22000000 unquestionably owes a great duty toward wild life no portion of which has yet been discharged academic research work is all very well but it does not save faunas from annihilation in the saving of the birds and mammals of north america a hundred million people are directly interested and the cause is starving for money men and publicity education is not the only duty of educators the carnegie museum at pittsburgh should be provided by pittsburgh with sufficient funds that its director can put a good man into the field of protection and maintain his activities the state of pennsylvania and the nation at large needs such a worker at pittsburgh and this statement is not open to argument the california academy of sciences the chicago academy of sciences appear to have done nothing the new york academy of sciences noteworthy in promoting the national academy of sciences the preservation and increase the rochester academy of sciences of the wild life of america the philadelphia zoological society the national zoological park a few of the institutions of learning which should each devote one man to this cause columbia university of new york has a very large and strong corps of zoological professors in its department of biology no living organism is too small or too worthless to be studied by highgrade men but does any man of columbia ever raise his voice actively and determinedly for the preservation of our fauna or any other fauna columbia should give the services of one man wholly to this cause there are men whose zoological ideals soar so high that they can not see the slaughter of wild creatures that is so furiously proceeding on the surface of this bloodstained earth we dont want to hear about the behavior of protozoans while our best song birds are being exterminated by negroes and poor whites cornell university should now awaken to the new situation all the zoological neros should not fiddle while rome burns for the sake of consistency cornell should devote the services of at least one member of its large and able faculty to the cause of wildlife protection cornell was a pioneer in forestry teaching and why should she not lead off now in the new field yale university in professor james w toumey director of the school of forestry possesses a natural readymade protector of wild life from forestry to wild life is an easy step we hopefully look forward to the development of professor toumey into a militant protectionist fighting for the helpless creatures that must be protected by man or perish if yale is willing to set a new pace for the worlds great universities she has the man ready at hand the university of chicago should become the center of a great new protectionist movement which should cover the whole middle west area from the plains to pittsburgh this is the inflexible logical necessity of the hour either protect zoology or else for very shame give up teaching it every higher institution of learning in america now has a duty in this matter times have changed things are not as they were thirty years ago to allow a great and valuable wild fauna to be destroyed and wasted is a crime against both the present and the future if we mean to be good citizens we cannot shirk the duty to conserve we are trustees of the inheritance of future generations and we have no right to squander that inheritance if we fail of our plain duty the scorn of future generations surely will be our portion chapter xliv the greatest needs of the wildlife cause and the duty of the hour the fate of wild life in north america hangs today by three very slender threads the names of which you will hardly guess unaided they are labor money and publicity the threads are slender because there is so little raw material in them we do not need money with which to buy votes or influence but money with which to pay workers to publish things to arouse the american people to sting sportsmen into action to hire wardens to prosecute gamehogs and buy refuges for wild life if a sufficient amount of money for these purposes cannot be procured then as sure as the earth continues to revolve our wild life will pass away forever this is no cause for surprise or wonder in this twentieth century money is essential to every great enterprise whether it be for virtue or mischief the enemies of wild life and the people who support them are very powerful the man whose pocket or whose personal privilege is threatened by new legislation is prompted by business reasons to work against you and spend money in protecting his interests now it happens that the men of ordinary means who have nothing personal at stake in the preservation of wild life save sentimental considerations cannot afford to leave their business more than three or four days each year on protection affairs yet many times services are demanded for many days or even weeks together in order to accomplish results bad repeal bills must be fought until they are dead and good protective bills must be supported until the breath of life is breathed into them by the executive signature with money in hand good men aways can be found who will work in game protection for about onehalf what they would demand in other pursuits with the men whom you really desire sentiment is always a controlling factor it is my inflexible rule however in asking for services that men who give valuable time and strength to the cause shall not be allowed to take their expense money from their own pockets soldiers on the firing line cannot provide the sinews of war that come from the paymasters chest campaigns of publicity are matters of tremendous necessity and importance but their successful promotion requires hundreds or possibly thousands of dollars for each state that is covered i believe that the wealthy men and women of america are the most liberal givers for the benefit of humanity that can be found in all the world new york especially contains a great number of men who year in and year out work hard for moneyin order to give it away the depth and breadth of the philanthropic spirit in new york city is to me the most surprising of all the strange impulses that sway the inhabitants of that seething mass of mixed humanity every imaginable cause for the benefit of mankindsave onehas received and still is receiving millions of gift dollars some enterprises for the transcendant education of the people are at this moment hopelessly wallowing in the excess of wealth that has been thrust upon them men are being hired at high salaries to help spend wealth in high higher highest education and research it is now fashionable to bequeath millions to certain causes that do not need them in the least in education there is a mad scramble to educate every young man to the topmost notch often far above his probable station in life and into tastes and wants far beyond his powers to maintain in all this however there would be no cause for regret if the wild life of our continent were not in such a grievous state if we felt no conscience burden for those who come after us we would not care where the millions go but since things are as they are it is heartbreaking to see the cause of wildlife protection actually starving or at the best subsisting only on financial husks and crumbs while less important causes literally flounder in surplus wealth this regret is intensified by the knowledge that in no other cause for the conservation of the resources most valuable to mankind will a dollar go so far or bring back such good results as in the preservation of wild life the promotion of the bayne bill and the enactment of the bayne law is a fair example that law is today on the statute books of the state of new york because fifty men and women promptly subscribed 5000 to a fund formed with special reference to the expenses of the campaign for that measure and the uplift of that victory will be felt for years to come just as it already has been in massachusetts at one time i was tempted to show the financial skeleton in the closet of wildlife protection by inserting here a statement of the funds available to be expended by all the new york organizations during the campaign year of 19111912 but i cannot do it the showing is too painful too humiliating from it our enemies would derive too much comfort even in new york state in view of the great interests at stake the showing is pitiful but what shall we say of massachusetts pennsylvania connecticut new jersey and a dozen other states where the situation is much worse in the winter of 1912 a cry for help came to us from a neighboring state where a terrific fight was being made by the forces of destruction against all reform measures and in behalf of retrogression on spring shooting the appeal said the situation in our legislature is the worst that it has been in years our enemies are very strong well organized and they fight us at every step we have no funds and we are expected to make bricks without straw is there not something that you can do to help us there was only one week previously a good friend who declines to be named gave us two thousand dollars of real money for just such emergencies within thirtysix hours an entirely new fighting force had been organized and equipped for service within one week those reinforcements had made a profound impression on the defenses of the enemy and in the end the great fight was won of our small campaign fund it took away over one thousand dollars but the victory was worth it with money enougha reasonable sumthe birds of north america and some of the smallmammal species also can be saved the big game that is hunted and killed outside the game preserves and outside of such places as new brunswick and the adirondacks can not be saveduntil each species is given perpetual protection colorado is saving a small remnant of her mountain sheep but montana and wyoming are wasting theirs because they allow killing and the killers are ten times too numerous for the sheep they imagine that by permitting only the killing of rams they are saving the species but that is an absolute fallacy and soon it will have a fatal ending with an endowment fund of 2000000 only double the price of the two old velasquez paintings purchased recently by a gentleman of new york a very good remnant of the wild life of north america could be saved but who will give the fund or even a quarter of it thus far the largest sums ever given in america for the cause of wildlife protection so far as i know personally have been the following albert wilcox to the national association of audubon societies 322000 mary butcher fund to the national association of audubon societies 12000 mrs russell sage for the purchase of marsh island 150000 american game protective and propagation association from the manufacturers of firearms and ammunition annually 25000 charles willis ward and ea mcilhenny purchase of game preserve presented to louisiana 39000 mrs russell sage miscellaneous gifts to the national audubon society 20000 the american bison society for the montana national herd 10526 new york zoological society total about 20000 john e thayer purchase of game preserve 5000 caroline phelps stokes bird fund ny zoological society 5000 boone and crockett fund for preservation 5000 a friend in rochester 2500 henry c frick 1500 samuel thorne 1250 of all the above the only endowment funds yielding an annual income are those of the national association of audubon societies and the caroline phelps stokes fund of 5000 in the treasury of the zoological society a fund of 25000 per year for five years has been guaranteed by the makers of shotguns rifles and ammunition to the american game protective and propagation association this is like a limited endowment in the civilized world there are citizens of many kinds but all of them can be placed in two groups 1 those with a sense of duty toward mankind and who will do their duty as good citizens and 2 those who from the cradle to the grave meanly and sordidly study their own selfish interests who never do aught save in expectation of a quick return benefit and who recognize no such thing as duty toward mankind at large men and women of the first class are honored in life mourned when dead and gratefully remembered by posterity they leave the world better than they found it and their lives have been successful men and women of the second class are merely so many pieces of animated furniture and when they pass out the world cares no more than when old chairs are thrown upon the scrapheap there are many men so selfish so ignorant and mean of soul that even out of wellfilled purses they would not give ten dollars to save the whole bird fauna of north america from annihilation to all persons of that brand it is useless to appeal as soon as you find one waste no time upon him get out of his neighborhood as quickly as you can and look for help among real men the wild life of the world cannot be saved by a few persons even though they work their hearts out in the effort the cause needs two million more helpers and they must be sought in group no 1 they are living somewhere but the great trouble is to find them before it is too late there are times and causes in which the good citizen has no option but to render service the most important of such causes are the relief of suffering humanity the conservation of the resources of nature and the prevention of vandalism if the american nation had refused aid to stricken san francisco the callous hardheartedness of it would have shocked the world if the german army of 1871 had destroyed the art treasures and the libraries of paris it would have set the german nation back ten centuries into the ranks of the lowest barbarians and yet in america and in the regions now being scourged by the feather trade a wonderful fauna is being destroyed it took millions of years to develop that marvelous array of wild life and when gone it never can be replaced yet the army of destruction is sweeping it away as joyously as a hired laborer cuts down a field of corn that wild life can be saved if done it must be done by the men and women of group no 1 the means by which it can be saved are money labor and publicity every man of ordinary means and intelligence can contribute either money or labor the men on the firing line must not be expected to furnish their own food and ammunition the workers must be provided with the money that active campaign work imperatively demands those who cannot conveniently or successfully labor should give money to this cause but at the same time every good citizen should keep in touch with his lawmaking representatives and in times of need ask for votes for whatever new laws are necessary with money enough to arouse the american people in certain ways the wild life of north america north of mexico can be saved money can secure labor and publicity and the people will do the rest for this campaign work i want and must have a permanent fund of 10000 per annumcash always ready for every emergency in field work i greatly need and must have immediately an endowment wildlife fund of at least 100000 and eventually 250000 i can no longer pass the hat each year this is needed in addition to the several thousands of dollars annually being expended by the zoological society in this work the society is already doing its utmost in wildlife protection just as it is in several other fields of activity outside of new york many wealthy men will say let new york do it that often is the way when national campaigning is to be done in national wildlife protection work new york is today bearing about ninetenths of the burden it is my belief that in 1912 outside of new york city less than 10000 was raised and expended in wildlife protection save by state and national appropriations we know that in the year mentioned new york expended 221000 in this cause all from private sources in a very short time i shall call for the 100000 that i now must have as an endowment fund for nationwide work to be placed at 512 per cent interest for the 5500 annual income that it will yield how much of this will come from outside the state of new york some of it i am sure will come from massachusetts and pennsylvania but will any of it come from cleveland cincinnati chicago st louis and san francisco the duty of the hour i have now said my say in behalf of wild life surely the path of duty toward the remnant of wild life is plain enough will those who read this book pass along my message that the hour for a revolution has struck will the millions of men commanded by general apathy now arouse before it is too late to act will the true sportsmen rise up and do their duty bravely and unselfishly will the people with wealth to give away do their duty toward wild life and humanity fairly and generously will the zoologists awake leave their tables in their stone palaces of peace and come out to the firingline will the lawmakers heed the handwriting on the wall and make laws that represent the full discharge of their duty toward wild life and humanity will the editors beat the alarmgong early and late in season and out of season until the people awake on the answers to these questions hang the fate of the
