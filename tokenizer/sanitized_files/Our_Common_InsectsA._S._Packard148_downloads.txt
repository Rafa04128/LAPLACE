scudderyou and i were drawn together many years ago by a common love for insects and their ways i dedicate this little volume of ephemeral essays to you in recognition of your worth as a man and a scientist and as a token of warm friendship yours sincerely a s packard jr preface this little volume mainly consists of a reprint of a series of essays which appeared in the american naturalist vols iv 186771 it is hoped that their perusal may lead to a better acquaintance with the habits and forms of our more common insects the introduction was written expressly for this book as well as chapter xiii hints on the ancestry of insects the scientific reader may be drawn with greater interest to this chapter than to any other portion of the book in this discussion of a perhaps abstruse and difficult theme his indulgence is sought for whatever imperfections or deficiencies may appear our systems of classification may at least be tested by the application of the theory of evolution the natural system if we mistake not is the genealogy of organized forms when we can trace the latter we establish the former considering how much naturalists differ in their views as to what is a natural classification it is not strange that a genealogy of animals or plants seems absurd to many to another generation of naturalists it must perhaps be left to decide whether to attempt the one is more unphilosophical than to attempt the other most of the cuts have already appeared in the guide to the study of insects and the american naturalist where their original sources are given while a few have been kindly contributed by prof a e verrill the boston society of natural history and prof c v riley and three are original salem june 1873 our common insects introductory what is an insect when we remember that the insects alone comprise fourfifths of the animal kingdom and that there are upwards of 200000 living species it would seem a hopeless task to define what an insect is but a common plan pervades the structure of them all the bodies of all insects consist of a succession of rings or segments more or less hardened by the deposition of a chemical substance called chitine these rings are arranged in three groups the head the thorax or middle body and the abdomen or hind body in the sixfooted insects such as the bee moth beetle or dragon fly four of these rings unite early in embryonic life to form the head the thorax consists of three as may be readily seen on slight examination and the abdomen is composed either of ten or eleven rings the body then seems divided or insected into three regions whence the name insect the head is furnished with a pair of antenn a pair of jaws mandibles and two pairs of maxill the second and basal pair being united at their base to form the socalled labium or under lip these four pairs of appendages represent the four rings of the head to which they are appended in the order stated above a pair of legs is appended to each of the three rings of the thorax while the first and second rings each usually carry a pair of wings the abdomen contains the ovipositor sometimes as in the bees and wasps forming a sting in the spiders fig 1 however there are no antenn and the second maxill or labium is wanting moreover there are four pairs of legs the centipedes fig 2 a myriopod also differ from the rest of the insects in having an indefinite number of abdominal rings each bearing a pair of legs illustration 1 spider tegenaria on examining the arrangement of the parts within we find the nervous cord consisting of two chains of swellings or nerveknots resting upon the floor or under side of the body and the heart or dorsal vessel situated just under the skin of the back and in looking at living caterpillars such as the cutworm and many thinskinned aquatic larv we can see this long tubular heart pulsating about as often as our own heart and when the insect is held against its will or is agitated the rapidity of the pulsations increases just as with us illustration 2 centipede insects do not breathe as in the higher animals by taking the air into the mouth and filling the lungs but there are a series of holes or pores along the side of the body as seen in the grub of the humble bee through which the air enters and is conveyed to every part of the body by an immense number of air tubes fig 3 air tubes or trache in the caudal appendage of the larva of a dragon fly these air tubes are everywhere bathed by the blood by which the latter becomes oxygenated illustration 3 caudal appendage of larva of agrion indeed the structure of an insect is entirely different from that of man or the quadrupeds or any other vertebrate animal and what we call head thorax abdomen gills stomach skin or lungs or jaws are called so simply for convenience and not that they are made in the same way as those parts in the higher animals an insect differs from a horse for example as much as a modern printing press differs from the press franklin used both machines are made of iron steel wood etc and both print but the plan of their structure differs throughout and some parts are wanting in the simpler press which are present and absolutely essential in the other so with the two sorts of animals they are built up originally out of protoplasm or the original jellylike germinal matter which fills the cells composing their tissues and nearly the same chemical elements occur in both but the mode in which these are combined the arrangement of their products the muscular nervous and skin tissues differ in the two animals the plan of structure namely the form and arrangement of the body walls the situation of the appendages to the body and of the anatomical systems within ie the nervous digestive circulatory and respiratory systems differ in their position in relation to the walls of the body thus while the two sorts of animals reproduce their kind eat drink and sleep see hear and smell they perform these acts by different kinds of organs situated sometimes on the most opposite parts of the body so that there is no comparison save in the results which they accomplish they only agree in being animals and in having a common animal nature illustration 4 different forms of jaws illustration 5 mouth parts of the larva of a beetle illustration 6 maxilla of a beetle how insects eat the jaws of insects fig 4 are horny processes situated on each side of the mouth they are variously toothed so as to tear the food and move horizontally instead of up and down as in the horse the act of taking the food especially if the insect be carnivorous in its habits is quite complex as not only the true jaws but the accessory jaws maxill fig 5 a upper b under side of the head of a young beetle at antenn md mandible mx maxill mx1 labium and the feelers palpi attached to the maxill and the under lip labium are of great service in enabling the insect to detect its food both by the senses of touch and smell the maxill are in the fully grown beetle fig 6 divided into three lobes the outermost forming the palpus and the two others forming sharp teeth often provided with hairs and minute brushes for cleansing the adjoining parts these strong curved teeth are used in seizing the food and placing it between the grinders where it is crushed prepared for digestion and swallowed fig 7 represents the mouth parts of the humble bee b upper lip d mandible e maxilla f maxillary palpus g tongue ih labium and tabial palpi k eye illustration 7 mouth parts of a humble bee the alimentary canal passes through the middle of the body the stomach forming usually a simple enlargement just before the stomach in certain insects as the grasshopper is a gizzard armed with rows of powerful horny teeth for finely crushing grass insects eat almost incredible quantities of food when young and growing rapidly mr trouvelot tells us in the american naturalist that the food taken by a single american silkworm in fiftysix days is equal to eightysix thousand times its primitive weight on the other hand after the insect has finished its transformations it either takes no food at all as in the may fly or merely sips the honey of flowers as in the butterfly while the june beetle and many others like it eat the leaves of trees and the tiger and ground beetles feed voraciously on other insects how insects walk in man and his allies the vertebrates the process of walking is a most difficult and apparently dangerous feat to describe the mechanics of walking the wonderful adaptation of the muscles and bones for the performance of this most ordinary action of life would require a volume the process is scarcely less complex in insects lyonnet found 3993 muscles in a caterpillar and while a large proportion belong to the internal organs over a thousand assist in locomotion hence the muscular power of insects is enormous a flea will leap two hundred times its own height and certain large solid beetles will move enormous weights as compared to the bulk of their bodies illustration 8 larva of a beetle photuris in walking as seen in the accompanying figure fig 8 three legs are thrown forward at a time two on one side and one on the other flies and many other insects can walk upside down or on glass as easily as on a level surface a flys foot as in most other insects consists of five joints tarsal joints to the last one of which is appended a pair of stout claws beneath which is a flat soft fleshy cushion or pad split into two sometimes three flaps beset on the under surface with fine hairs a part of these hairs are swollen at the end which is covered with an elastic membranous expansion capable of close contact with a highly polished surface from which a minute quantity of a clear transparent fluid is emitted when the fly is actively moving t west these hairs are hence called holding or tenent hairs with the aid of these but mainly as mr west insists by the pressure of the atmosphere a fly is enabled to adhere to perfectly smooth surfaces his studies show the following curious facts that atmospheric pressure if the area of the flaps be alone considered is equal to just onehalf the weight of a fly if the area covered by the tenent hairs be added an increase of pressure is gained equal to about onefourth the weight of a fly this leaves onefourth to be accounted for by slight viscidity of the fluid by the action i have so often alluded to which may be called grasping by molecular attraction and doubtless by other agents still more subtle with which we have at present scarcely any acquaintance how insects fly who of us as remarked by an eminent ornithologist can even now explain the long sustained peculiar flight of the hawk or turkey buzzard as it sails in the air without changing the position of its wings and we would add the somewhat similar flight of a butterfly it is the poetry of motion and a marvellous exhibition of grace and ease combined with a wonderful underlying strength and lightness of the parts concerned in flight before we give a partial account of the results obtained by the delicate experiments of professor marey on the flight of birds and insects our readers should be reminded of the great differences between an insect and a bird remembering that the former is in brief a chitinous sac so to speak or rather a series of three such spherical or elliptical sacs the head thorax and abdomen the outer walls of the body forming a solid but light crust to which are attached broad membranous wings the wing being a sort of membranous bag stretched over a framework of hollow tubes the trache so disposed as to give the greatest lightness and strength to the wing the wings are moved by powerful muscles of flight filling up the cavity of the thorax just as the muscles are the largest about the thorax of a bird moreover in the bodies of insects that fly such as the bee cockchafer and dragon fly as distinguished from those that creep exclusively the air tubes trache which ramify into every part of the body are dilated here and there especially in the base of the abdomen into large sacs which are filled with air when the insect is about to take flight so that the specific gravity of the body is greatly diminished indeed these air sacs dilatable at will by the insect may be compared to the swimming bladder of fishes which enables them to rise and fall at will to different levels in the sea thus effecting an immense saving of the labor of swimming in the birds as every body knows who has eaten a chicken or attended the dissection of a thanksgiving turkey the soft parts are external attached to the bony framework comprising the skeleton the wing bones being directly connected with the central back bone so that while these two sorts of animated flying machines are so different in structure they yet act in much the same manner when on the wing the difference between them is clearly stated by marey some of whose conclusions we now give almost word for word the flight of butterflies and moths differs from that of birds in the almost vertical direction of the stroke of their wings and in their faculty of sailing in the air without making any movements though sometimes in the course they pursue they seem to resemble birds in their flight the flight of insects and birds moreover differs in the form of the trajectory in space in the inclination of the plane in which the wings beat in the role of each of the two alternating and in an inverse sense movements that the wings execute as also in the facility with which the air is decomposed during these different movements as the wings of a fly are adorned with a brilliant array of colors we can follow the trajectory or figure that each wing writes in the air it is of the form of a figure of eight fig 9 first discovered by professor j bell pettigrew of edinburgh illustration 9 figure cut by an insects wing illustration 10 figure cut by a birds wing by an ingenious machine specially devised for the purpose professor marey found that a birds wing moves in an ellipse with a pointed summit fig 10 the insect beats the air in a distinctly horizontal plane but the bird in a vertical plane the wing of an insect is impervious to the air while the birds wing resists the air only on its under side hence there are two sorts of effects in the insect the up and down strokes are active in the bird the lowering of the wing is the only active period though the return stroke seems to sustain the bird the air acting on the wing the birds body is horizontal when the wing gives a downward stroke but when the beat is upward the bird is placed in an inclined plane like a winged projectile and mounts up on the air by means of the inclined surfaces that it passively offers to the resistance of this fluid illustration 11 trajectory of an insects wing illustration 12 trajectory of a birds wing in an insect an energetic movement is equally necessary to strike the air at both beats up and down in the bird on the contrary one active beat only is necessary the down beat it creates at that time all the motive force that will be dispensed during the entire revolution of the wing this difference is due to the difference in form of the wing the difference between the two forms of flight is shown by an inspection of the two accompanying figures 11 12 an insects wing is small at the base and broad at the end this breadth would be useless near the body because at this point the wing does not move swiftly enough to strike the air effectively the type of the insectean wing is designed then simply to strike the air but in the bird the wing plays also a passive role i e it receives the pressure of the air on its under side when the bird is projected rapidly onward by its acquired swiftness in these conditions the whole animal is carried onward in space all the points of its wing have the same velocity the neighboring regions of the body are useful to press upon the air which acts as on a paper kite the base of the wing also in the bird is broad and provided with feathers which form a broad surface on which the air presses with a force and method very efficacious in supporting the bird fig 12 gives an idea of this disposition of the wing at the active and passive time in a bird the inner half of the wing is the passive part of the organ while the external half that which strikes the air is the active part a flys wing makes 330 revolutions in a second executing consequently 660 simple oscillations it ought at each time to impress a lateral deviation of the body of the insect and destroy the velocity that the preceding oscillation has given it in a contrary direction so that by this hypothesis the insect in its flight only utilizes fifty to one hundred parts or onehalf of the resistance that the air furnishes it illustration 13 a bird on the wing in the bird fig 13 at the time of lowering the wings the oblique plane which strikes the air in decomposing the resistance produces a vertical component which resists the weight of the body and a horizontal component which imparts swiftness the horizontal component is not lost but is utilized during the rise of the wing as in a paper kite when held in the air against the wind thus the bird utilizes seventyfive out of one hundred parts of the resistance that the air furnishes the style of flight of birds is therefore theoretically superior to that of insects as to the division of the muscular force between the resistance of the air and the mass of the body of the bird we should compare the exertion made in walking on sand for example as compared with walking on marble this is easy to measure when a fish strikes the water with its tail to propel itself forward it performs a double task one part consists in pushing backwards a certain mass of water with a certain swiftness and the other in pushing on the body in spite of the resistance of the surrounding fluid this last portion of the task only is utilized it would be greater if the tail of the fish encountered a solid object almost all the propelling agencies employed in navigation undergo this loss of labor which depends on the mobility of the point d appui the bird is placed among conditions especially unfavorable the senses of insects the eyes of insects are sometimes so large as to envelop the head like an elizabethan ruffle and the creatures head as in the common house fly seems all eyes and this is almost literally the case as the two great staring eyes that almost meet on the top of the head to form one are made up of myriads of simple eyes each facet or simple eye is provided with a nerve filament which branches off from the main optic nerve so that but one impression of the object perceived is conveyed to the brain though it is taught by some that objects appear not only double but a thousand times multiplied but we should remember that with our two eyes we see double only when the brain is diseased besides the large ordinary compound eyes many insects possess small simple eyes like those of the spider the great german anatomist johannes mller believed that the compound eyes were adapted for the perception of distant objects while those nearer are seen by the simple eyes but it may be objected to this view that the spiders which have only simple eyes apparently see both near and remote objects as well as insects the sense of touch is diffused all over the body as in the hairs of the head and face of man those of insects are delicate tactile organs and on the antenn and legs insects depending on this sense rather than that of sight these appendages are covered with exquisitely fine hairs it is thought by some that the senses of hearing and smell are lodged in the antenn these organs thus combining the sense of feeling with those of hearing and smelling and the researches of anatomists lend much probability to the assertion since little pits just under the skin are found and even sometimes provided with grains of sand in the socalled ear of the lobster etc corresponding to the ear bones of the higher animals the pits being connected with nerves leading to the brain we have detected similar pits in the under side of the palpi of the perla it seems not improbable that these are organs of smell and placed in that part of the appendage nearest the mouth so as to enable the insect to select its proper food by its odor similar organs exist on the caudal appendages of a kind of fly chrysopila while the long manyjointed caudal filaments of the cockroach are each provided with nearly a hundred of these little pits which seem to be so many noses thus lesps a swiss anatomist in his remarks on the auditory sacs which he says are found in the antenn of nearly all insects declares that as we have in insects compound eyes so we have compound ears we might add that in the abdominal appendage of the cockroach we have a compound nose while in the feelers of the perla and the caudal appendage of the chrysopila the nose is simple we might also refer here to siebolds discovery of ears at the base of the abdomen of some and in the forelegs of other kinds of grasshoppers thus we need not be surprised at finding ears and noses scattered as it were sometimes almost wantonly over the bodies of insects in many worms the eyes are found all over the body while in man and his allies from the monkey down to the fish the ears and nose invariably retain the same relative place in the head how insects grow when beginning our entomological studies no fact seemed more astonishing to our boyish mind than the thought that the little flies and midges were not the sons and daughters of the big ones if every farmer and gardener knew this single fact it would be worth their while the words larva and pupa will frequently occur in subsequent pages and they should be explained the caterpillar fig 14 a represents the earliest stage or babyhood of the butterfly and it is called larva from the latin meaning a mask because it was thought by the ancients to mask the form of the adult butterfly illustration 14 a larva b chrysalis of a butterfly when the caterpillar has ended its riotous life for its appetite almost transforms its being into the very incarnation of gluttony it suddenly as if repenting of its former life as a bon vivant seeks a solitary cell or hole where like a hermit it sits and leads apparently about as useless an existence but meanwhile strange processes are going on beneath the skin and after a few convulsive struggles the back splits open and out wriggles the chrysalis a gorgeous mummylike form its body adorned with golden and silvery spots hence the word chrysalis fig 14 b from the greek meaning golden while the latin word pupa meaning a baby or doll is indicative of its youth in this state it hangs suspended to a twig or other object while the silk worm and others of its kind previous to moulting or casting their skins spin a silken cocoon which envelops and protects the chrysalis illustration 15 imago or adult butterfly at the given time and after the body of the adult has fully formed beneath the chrysalis skin there is another moult and the butterfly with baggy wet wings creeps out the body dries the skin hardens the wings expand and in a few moments sometimes an hour the butterfly fig 15 proudly sails aloft the glory and pride of the insect world we shall see in the ensuing chapters how varied are the larv and pup of insects and under what different guises insects live in their early stages illustration larva pupa and adult of a leaf beetle galeruca our common insects chapter i the home of the bees the history of the honey bee its wonderful instincts its elaborate cells and complex economy have engrossed the attention of the best observers even from the time of virgil who sang of the ligurian bee the literature of the art of beekeeping is already very extensive numerous bee journals and manuals of beekeeping testify to the importance of this art while able mathematicians have studied the mode of formation of the hexagonal cells1 and physiologists have investigated the intricate problems of the mode of generation and development of the bee itself in discussing these difficult questions we must rise from the study of the simple to the complex remembering that all nature widens upward evermore the simpler essence lower lies more complex is more perfectowning more discourse more widely wise and not forget to study the humbler allies of the honey bee we shall in observing the habits and homes of the wild bees gain a clearer insight into the mysteries of the hive the great family of bees is divided into social and solitary species the social kinds live in nests composed of numerous cells in which the young brood are reared these cells vary in form from those which are quite regularly hexagonal like those of the hive bee to those which are less regularly sixsided as in the stingless bee of the tropics melipona until in the humble bee the cells are isolated and cylindrical in form before speaking of the wild bees let us briefly review the life of the honey bee the queen bee having wintered over with many workers lays her eggs in the spring first in the worker and at a later period in the dronecells early in the summer the workers construct the large flaskshaped queencells which are placed on the edge of the comb and in these the queen larv are fed with rich and choice food the old queen deserts the nest forming a new colony the newborn queen takes her marriage flight high in the air with a drone and on her return undertakes the management of the hive and the duty of laying eggs when the supply of queens is exhausted the workers destroy the drones the first brood of workers live about six weeks in summer and then give way to a new brood the queens according to von berlepsch are known to live five years and during their whole life lay more than a million eggs in the tropics the honey bee is replaced by the meliponas and trigonas they are minute stingless bees which store up honey and live in colonies often of immense extent the cells of melipona are hexagonal nearly approaching in regularity those of the hive bee while the honey cells are irregular being much larger cavities which hold about onehalf as much honey as a cell of the humble bee gardner in his travels states that many species of melipona build in the hollow trunks of trees others in banks some suspend their nests from the branches of trees whilst one species constructs its nest of clay it being of large size f smith in a nest of the coalblack trigona trigona carbonaria from eastern australia mr f smith of the british museum found from four hundred to five hundred dead workers but no females the combs were arranged precisely similar to those of the common wasp the number of honeypots which were placed at the foot of the nest was two hundred and fifty mr smith inclines to the opinion that the hive of trigona contains several prolific females as the great number of workers can only be thus explained and m gurin found six females in a nest of the tawnyfooted melipona m fulvipes at home our nearest ally of the true honey bee is the humble bee bombus of which over forty species are known to inhabit north america the economy of the humble bee is thus the queen awakens in early spring from her winters sleep under leaves or moss or in the last years nest and selects a nesting place generally in an abandoned nest of a fieldmouse or beneath a stump or sod and immediately according to mr f w putnam2 collects a small amount of pollen mixed with honey and in this deposits from seven to fourteen eggs gradually adding to the pollen mass until the first brood is hatched she does not wait however for one brood to be hatched before laying the eggs of another but as soon as food enough has been collected she lays the eggs for a second the eggs are laid in contact with each other in one cavity of the mass of pollen with a part of which they are slightly covered they are very soon developed in fact the lines are nowhere distinctly drawn between the egg and the larva the larva and pupa and again between the latter and the imago a perfect series showing this gradual transformation of the young to the imago can be found in almost every nest illustration 15 cell and eggs of bombus as soon as the larv are capable of motion and commence feeding they eat the pollen by which they are surrounded and gradually separating push their way in various directions eating as they move and increasing in size quite rapidly they soon make large cavities in the pollen mass when they have attained their full size they spin a silken wall about them which is strengthened by the old bees covering it with a thin layer of wax which soon becomes hard and tough thus forming a cell fig 15 1 cell containing a larva on top of which 2 is a pollen mass containing three eggs the larv now gradually attain the pupa stage and remain inactive until their full development they then cut their way out and are ready to assume their duties as workers small females males or queens it is apparent that the irregular disposition of the cells is due to their being constructed so peculiarly by the larv after the first brood composed of workers has come forth the queen bee devotes her time principally to her duties at home the workers supplying the colony with honey and pollen as the queen continues prolific more workers are added and the nest is rapidly enlarged about the middle of summer eggs are deposited which produce both small females and males all eggs laid after the last of july produce the large females or queens and the males being still in the nest it is presumed that the queens are impregnated at this time as on the approach of cold weather all except the queens of which there are several in each nest die while the humble bee in some respects shows much less instinct than the solitary bees mentioned below it stands higher in the series however from having workers as well as males and females who provide food for the young the labors of the mason bees and their allies terminate after the cell is once constructed and filled with pollen the eggs are then left to hatch and the young care for themselves though the adult bee shows greater skill in architecture than the humble bee it is thus throughout nature many forms comparatively low in the scale of life astonish us with certain characters or traits reminding us of beings much superior physically and intellectually the lower forms constantly reach up and in some way ally themselves with creatures far more highly organized thus the fishlike seal reminds us strikingly of the dog both in the form of the head in its docility and great intelligence when tamed and even in its bark and the movements of the head illustration 16 melo the parasites of the humble bee are numerous such are the species of apathus which so closely resembles the humble bee itself that it requires long study to distinguish it readily its habits are not known other than that it is found in the nests of its host it differs from the humble bee in having no pollenbasket showing that its larv must feed on the food stored up by their host as it does not itself collect it the mandibles also are not like those of bombus trowelshaped for architectural purposes but acutely triangular and are probably not used in building the caterpillars of various moths consume the honey and waxen cells the twowinged flies volucella and conops and the larv of what is either an anthomyia or tachinalike fly and several species of another genus of flies anthrax together with several beetles such as the melo fig 16 stylops fig 17 male 18b female a position in the body of its host and antherophagus prey upon them illustration 17 male stylops the power of boring the most symmetrical tunnels in solid wood reaches its perfection in the large virginian carpenter bee xylocopa virginica fig 19 this bee is as large as and some allied exotic species are often considerably larger than the humble bee but not clothed with such dense hairs we have received from mr james angus of west farms n y a piece of trellis from a grape vine made of pine wood containing the cells and young in various stages of growth together with the larv and chrysalids of anthrax sinuosa fig 20 a species of fly parasitic on the larva the maggot buries its head in the soft body of the young bee and feeds on its juices mr angus thus writes us regarding its habits under date of july 19 i asked an intelligent and observing carpenter yesterday if he knew how long it took the xylocopa to bore her tunnel he said he thought she bored about onequarter of an inch a day i dont think myself she bores more than onehalf inch if she does that if i mistake not it takes her about two days to make her own length at the first start but this being across the grain of the wood may not be so easily done as the remainder which runs parallel with it she always follows the grain of the wood with the exception of the entrance which is about her own length the tunnels run from one to one and a half feet in length they generally run in opposite directions from the opening and sometimes other galleries are run one directly above the other using the same opening i think they only make new tunnels when old ones are not to be found and that the same tunnels are used for many years some of the old tunnels are very wide i have found parts of them about an inch in diameter i think this is caused by rasping off the sides to procure the necessary material for constructing their cells the partitions are composed of wood raspings and some sticky fluid probably saliva to make them adhere illustration 18 female stylops illustration 19 carpenter bee the tunnels are sometimes taken possession of by other bees and wasps i think when this is the case the xylocopa prefers making a new cell to cleaning out the dirt and rubbish of the other species i frequently find these bees remaining for a long time on the wing close to the opening and bobbing their heads against the side as if fanning air into the opening i have seen them thus employed for twenty minutes whether one bee or more makes the tunnel that is whether they take turns in boring i cannot at present say in opening the cells fig 21 more than one are generally found even at this season about two weeks ago i found as many as seven i think in one3 the hole is divided by partitions into cells about seventenths of an inch long these partitions are constructed of the coarse dust or chippings made by the bee in eating out her cells for our active little carpenter is provided with strong cutting jaws moved by powerful muscles and on her legs are stiff brushes of hair for cleaning out the tunnel as she descends into the heart of the solid wood she must throw out the chips she bites off with her powerful mandibles from the sides of the burrow by means of her hind legs passing the load of chips backwards out of the cell with her fore limbs which she uses as hands illustration 20 larva and pupa of anthrax the partitions are built most elaborately of a single flattened band of chips which is rolled up into a coil four layers deep one side forming the bottom of the cell is concave being beaten down and smoothed off by the bee the other side of the partition forming the top of the cell is flat and rough illustration 21 nest of carpenter bee at the time of opening the burrow july 8th the cells contained nearly fullgrown larv with some half developed they were feeding on the masses of pollen which were as large as a thick kidney bean and occupied nearly half the cell the larv fig 21 resemble those of the humble bee but are slenderer tapering more rapidly towards each end of the body the habits and structure of the little green ceratina ally it closely with xylocopa this pretty bee named ceratina dupla by mr say tunnels out the stems of the elder or blackberry syringa or any pithy shrub excavating them often to a depth of six or seven inches she makes the walls just wide enough to admit her body and of a depth capable of holding three or four often five or six cells fig 22 the finely built cells with their delicate silken walls are cylindrical and nearly square at each end though the free end of the last cell is rounded off they are four and a half tenths of an inch long and a little over onethird as broad the bee places them at nearly equal distances apart the slight interval between them being filled in with dirt illustration 22 nest of ceratina dr t w harris states that may 15 1832 one female laid its eggs in the hollow of an aster stalk three perfect insects were disclosed from it july 28th the observations of mr angus who saw some bees making their cells may 18th also confirm this account the history of our little upholsterer is thus cleared up late in the spring she builds her cells fills them with pollen and lays one or more eggs upon each mass thus in about two months the insect completes its transformations within this period passing through the egg the larva and chrysalid states and then as a bee living a few days more if a male or if a female living through the winter her life thus spans one year the larva fig 23 is longer than that of megachile and compared with that of xylocopa the different segments are much more convex giving a serrate outline to the back of the worm the pupa or chrysalis we have found in the cells the last of july it is white and threetenths of an inch long it differs from that of the leafcutter bee in having four spines on the end of the body illustration 23 larva of ceratina illustration 24 nest of tailor bee in none of the wild bees are the cells constructed with more nicety than those of our little ceratina she bores out with her jaws a long deep well just the size of her body and then stretches a thin delicate cloth of silk drawn tight as a drumhead across each end of her chambers which she then fills with a mixture of pollen and honey illustration 25 tailor bee her young are not in this supposed retreat entirely free from danger the most invidious foes enter and attack the brood three species of ichneumon flies two of which belong to the chalcid family lay their eggs within the body of the larva and emerge from the dried larva and pupa skins of the bee often in great numbers the smallest parasite belonging to the genus anthophorabia so called from being first known as a parasite on another bee anthophora is a minute species found also abundantly in the tight cells of the leafcutter bee the interesting habits of the leafcutting or tailor bee megachile have always attracted attention this bee is a stout thickbodied insect with a large square head stout sharp scissorslike jaws and with a thick mass of stout dense hairs on the under side of the tail for carrying pollen as she is not provided with the pollenbasket of the honey and humble bees the megachile lays its eggs in burrows in the stems of the elder fig 24 which we have received from mr james angus we have also found them in the hollows of the locust tree mr f w putnam thus speaks of the economy of m centuncularis our most common species my attention was first called on the 26th of june to a female busily engaged in bringing pieces of leaf to her cells which she was building under a board on the roof of the piazza directly under my window nearly the whole morning was occupied by the bee in bringing pieces of leaf from a rose bush growing about ten yards from her cells returning at intervals of a half minute to a minute with the pieces which she carried in such a manner as not to impede her steps when she alighted near her hole when the leafcutter bee wishes to cut out a piece of a leaf fig 25 she alights upon the leaf and in a few seconds swiftly runs her scissorslike jaws around through it bearing off the piece in her hind legs about noon she had probably completed the cell upon which she had been engaged as during the afternoon she was occupied in bringing pollen preparatory to laying her single egg in the cell for about twenty days the bee continued at work building new cells and supplying them with pollen on the 28th of july upon removing the board it was found that the bee had made thirty cells arranged in nine rows of unequal length some being slightly curved to adapt them to the space under the board the longest row contained six cells and was two and threequarters inches in length the whole leaf structure being equal to a length of fifteen inches upon making an estimate of the pieces of leaf in this structure it was ascertained that there must have been at least a thousand pieces used in addition to the labor of making the cells this bee unassisted in all her duties had to collect the requisite amount of pollen and honey for each cell and lay her eggs therein when completed upon carefully cutting out a portion of one of the cells a fullgrown larva was seen engaged in spinning a slight silken cocoon about the walls of its prison which were quite hard and smooth on the inside probably owing to the movements of the larva and the consequent pressing of the sticky particles to the walls in a short time the opening made was closed over by a very thin silken web the cells measured on the inside of the hard walls were 35 of an inch in length and 15 in diameter the natural attitude of the larva is somewhat curved in its cell but if straightened it just equals the inside length of the cell on the 31st of july two female bees came out having cut their way through the sides of their cells in three other cells several hundred minute ichneumons anthophorabia megachilis were seen which came forth as soon as the cells were opened the habits of the little blue or green mason bees osmia are quite varied they construct their cells in the stems of plants and in rotten posts and trees or like andrena they burrow in sunny banks a european species selects snail shells for its nest wherein it builds its earthen cells while other species nidificate under stones curtis found two hundred and thirty cocoons of a british species osmia paretina placed on the under side of a flat stone of which onethird were empty of the remainder the most appeared between march and june males appearing first thirtyfive more bees were developed the following spring thus there were three successive broods for three succeeding years so that these bees lived three years before arriving at maturity this may partly account for insect years which are like apple years seasons when bees and wasps as well as other insects abound in unusual numbers illustration 26 nest of osmia mr g r waterhouse in the transactions of the entomological society of london for 1864 states that the cells of osmia leucomelana are formed of mud and each cell is built separately the female bee having deposited a small pellet of mud in a sheltered spot between some tufts of grass immediately begins to excavate a small cavity in its upper surface scraping the mud away from the centre towards the margin by means of her jaws a small shallow mudcup is thus produced it is rough and uneven on the outer surface but beautifully smooth on the inner on witnessing thus much of the work performed i was struck with three points first the rapidity with which the insect worked secondly the tenacity with which she kept her original position whilst excavating and thirdly her constantly going over work which had apparently been completed the lid is excavated and rendered concave on its outer or upper surface and is convex and rough on its inner surface and in fact is a simple repetition of the firstformed portion of the cell a part of a hollow sphere the largest species of osmia known to us is a very darkblue species o lignivora we are indebted to a lady for specimens of the bees with their cells which had been excavated in the interior of a maple tree several inches from the bark the bee had industriously tunnelled out this elaborate burrow fig 26 and in this respect resembled the habits of the carpenter bee more closely than any other species of its genus the tunnel was over three inches long and about threetenths of an inch wide it contracted a little in width between the cell showing that the bee worked intelligently and wasted no more of her energies than was absolutely necessary the burrow contained five cells each half an inch long being rather short and broad with the hinder end rounded while the opposite end next to the one adjoining is cut off squarely the cell is somewhat jugshaped owing to a slight constriction just behind the mouth the material of which the cell is composed is stout silken parchmentlike and very smooth within the interstices between the cells are filled in with rather coarse chippings made by the bee the bee cut its way out of the cells in march and lived for a month afterwards on a diet of honey and water it eagerly lapped up the drops of water supplied by its keeper to whom it soon grew accustomed and seemed to recognize our smallest and most abundant species is the little green osmia simillima it builds its little oval somewhat urnshaped cells against the roof of the large deserted galls of the oakgall fly diplolepis confluentus placing them in this instance eleven in number in two irregular rows from which the mature bees issue through a hole in the gall fig 27 with two separate cells the earthen cells containing the tough dense cocoons were arranged irregularly so as to fit the concave vault of the larger gall which was about two inches in diameter on emerging from the cell the osmia cuts out with its powerful jaws an ovate lid nearly as large as one side of the cell illustration 27 nest of osmia in a gall in the harris collection are the cells and specimens of osmia pacifica the peaceful osmia which according to the manuscript notes of dr harris is found in the perfect state in earthen cells beneath stones the cell is oval cylindrical a little contracted as usual with those of all the species of the genus thus forming an urnshaped cell it is half an inch long and nearly threetenths of an inch wide while the cocoon which is rather thin is threetenths of an inch long we are not acquainted with the habits of the larva and pupa in this country but mr f smith states that the larva of the english species hatches in eight days after the eggs are laid feeds ten to twelve days when it becomes fullgrown then spins a thin silken covering and remains in an inactive state until the following spring when it completes its transformations in the economy of our wild bees we see the manifestation of a wonderful instinct as well as the exhibition of a limited reason we can scarcely deny to animals a kind of reason which apparently differs only in degree from that of man each species works in a sphere limited by physical laws but within that sphere it is a free agent they have enough of instinct and reason to direct their lives and to enable them to act their part in carrying out the plan of creation illustration paper wasp footnotes footnote 1 the cells are not perfectly hexagonal see the studies on the formation of the cells of the bee by professor j wyman in the proceedings of the american academy of arts and sciences boston 1866 and the authors guide to the study of insects p 123 footnote 2 notes on the habits of the humble bee proceedings of the essex institute vol iv 1864 p 101 mr angus also writes us as follows concerning the habits of the wandering humble bee bombus vagans i have found the males plentiful near our garden fence within a hole such as would be made by a mouse they seem to be quite numerous i was attracted to it by the noise they were making in fanning at the opening i counted at one time as many as seven thus employed and the sound could be heard several yards off several males were at rest but mostly on the wing when they would make a dash among the fanners and all would scatter and play about the workers seem to be of a uniform size and full as large as the males i think the object of the fanning was to introduce air into the nest as is done by the honey bees footnote 3 since writing the above i have opened one of the new holes of xylocopa which was commenced between three and four weeks ago in a pine slat used in the staging of the greenhouse the dimensions were as followsopening fully 38 wide depth 716 whole length of tunnel 6 516 inches the tunnel branched both ways from the hole one end from opening was 2 58 containing three cells two with larva and pollen the third empty the other side of the opening or the rest of the tunnel was empty with the exception of the old bee only one at work i think this was the work of one bee and as near as i can judge about twentyfive days work width of tunnel inside at widest 916 inch i have just found a xylocopa bobbing at one of the holes and in order to ascertain the depth of the tunnel and to see whether there were any others in them i sounded with a pliable rod and found others in one side at a depth of five and one half inches the other side was four inches deep without bees the morning was cool so that the object in bobbing could not have been to introduce fresh currents of air but must have had some relation to those inside their legs on such occasions are as i have noticed loaded with pollen chapter ii the home of the bees concluded while the andrena and halictus bees whose habits we now describe are closely allied in form to the hive bee socially they are the mudsills of bee society ranking among the lowest forms of the family of bees their burrowing habits ally them with the ants from whose nests their own burrows can scarcely be distinguished their economy does not seem to demand the exercise of so much of a true reasoning power and pliable instinct as characterizes bees such as the honey and humble bee which possess a high architectural skill moreover they are not social they have no part in rearing and caring for their young a fact that lends so much interest to the history of the hive and humble bee in this respect they are far below the wasps a family belonging next below in the system of nature a glance at the drawing fig 28 of a burrow with its side galleries of the andrena vicina reveals the economy of one of our most common forms quite early in spring when the sun and vernal breezes have dried up the soil and the fields exchange their rusty hues for the rich green verdure of may our andrena tired of its idle life among the blossoms of the willow the wild cherry and garden flowers suddenly becomes remarkably industrious and wields its spadelike jaws and busy feet with a strange and unwonted energy choosing some sunny warm grassy bank these nests were observed in the great pasture of salem not always with a southern exposure however the female sinks her deep well through the sod from six inches to a foot into the sandy soil beneath she goes to work literally tooth and nail reasoning from observations made on several species of wasps and also from studying the structure of her jaws and legs it is evident that she digs in and loosens the soil with her powerful jaws and then throws out the dirt with her legs she uses her fore legs like hands to pass the load of dirt to her hind legs and then runs backward out of her hole to dump it down behind her mr emerton tells me that he never saw a bee in the act of digging but once and then she left off after a few strokes he also says they are harmless and inoffensive on several occasions i have lain on the grass near their holes for hours but not one attempted to sting me and when taken between the fingers they make but feeble resistance illustration fig 28 nest natural size of andrena vicina showing the main burrow and the cells leading from it the oldest cell containing the pupa a is situated nearest the surface while those containing the larva b lie between the pupa and the cell e containing the pollen mass and egg resting upon it the most recent cell f is the deepest down and contains a freshly deposited pollen mass at c is the beginning of a cell g level of the ground to enter somewhat into detail we gather from the observations of mr emerton who has carefully watched the habits of these bees through several seasons the following account of the economy of this bee on the 4th of may the bees were seen digging their holes most of which were already two inches deep and one six inches the mounds of earth were so small as to be hardly noticed at this time an oil beetle was seen prowling about the holes the presence of this dire foe of andrena at this time it will be seen in a succeeding chapter on the enemies of the bees is quite significant by the 15th of may hundreds of andrena holes were found in various parts of the pasture and at one place in a previous season there were about two hundred found placed within a small area one cell was dug up but it contained no pollen four days later several andrenas were noticed resting from their toil at the opening of their burrows on the 28th of may in unearthing six holes eight cells were found to contain pollen and in two of them a small larva the pellets of pollen are about the size of a small pea they are hard and round at first before the young has hatched but as the larva grows the mass becomes softer and more pasty so that the larva buries its head in the mass and greedily sucks it in when is the pollen gathered by the bee and kneaded into the pelletlike mass on july 4th a cell was opened in which was a bee busily engaged preparing the pollen which was loosely and irregularly piled up while there was a larva in an adjoining cell nearly half an inch long it would seem then that the bee comes in from the fields laden with her stores of pollen which she elaborates into bee bread within her cell when the bee returns to her cell she does not directly fly towards the entrance since as was noticed in a particular instance she flew about for a long time in all directions without any apparent aim until she finally settled near the hole and walked into her subterranean retreat on a rainy day may 24th our friend visited the colony but found no bees flying about the holes the little hillocks had been beaten down by the pitiless raindrops and all traces of their industry effaced on digging down several bees were found indicating that on rainy days they seek the shelter of their holes and do not take refuge under leaves of the plants they frequent on the 29th of june six fullgrown larv were exhumed and one about half grown on the 20th of july the colony seemed well organized as on laying open a burrow at the depth of six inches he began to find cells the upper ones to the number of a dozen were deserted and filled with earth and grass roots and had evidently been built and used during the previous year below these were eight cells placed around the main vertical gallery reaching down to the depth of thirteen inches and all containing nearly fullgrown larv of the bees or else those of some parasitic bee nomada which had devoured the food prepared for the young andrena about the first of august the larva transforms to a pupa or chrysalis as at this time two pup were found in cells a foot beneath the surface as shown in the cut those cells situated lowest down seem to be the last to have been made while the eggs laid in the highest are the first to hatch and the larv disclosed from them the first to change to pup four days later the pup of cuckoo bees nomada were found in the cells no andrenas were seen flying about at this time on the 24th of august to be still very circumstantial in our narrative though at the risk of being tedious three burrows were unearthed and in them three fully formed bees were found nearly ready to leave their cells and in addition several pup in some other cells there were three of the parasitic nomada also nearly ready to come out which seemed to be identical with some bees noticed playing very innocently about the holes early in the summer on the last day of august very few of the holes were open a number of oil beetles were strolling suspiciously about in the neighborhood and some little black ichneumon flies were seen running about among the holes during midsummer the holes were found closed night and day by clods of earth the burrow is sunken perpendicularly with short passages leading to the cells which are slightly inclined downwards and outwards from the main gallery the walls of the gallery are rough but the cells are lined with a mucouslike secretion which on hardening looks like the glazing of earthenware this glazing is quite hard and breaks up into angular pieces it is evidently the work of the bee herself and is not secreted and laid on by the larva the diameter of the interior of the cell is about onequarter of an inch contracting a little at the mouth when the cell is taken out the dirt adheres for a line in thickness so that it is of the size and form of an acorn the larva of andrena fig 29 is soft and fleshy like that of the honey bee its body is flattened bulging out prominently at the sides and tapering more rapidly than usual towards each end of the body the skin is very thin so that along the back the heart or dorsal vessel may be distinctly seen pulsating about sixty times a minute our cut fig 28 a also represents the pupa or chrysalis as seen lying in its cell the limbs are folded close to the body in the most compact way possible on the head of the semipupa ie a transition state between the larva and pupa there are two prominent tubercles situated behind the simple eyes or ocelli these are deciduous organs apparently aiding the insect in moving about its cell they disappear in the mature pupa illustration fig 29 fig 30 fig 31 fig 31 larva of halictus parallelus fig 29 larva of andrena vicina fig 30 pupa of halictus parallelus seen from beneath to those accustomed to rearing butterflies and seeing the chrysalis at once assuming its perfected shape after the caterpillar skin is thrown off it may seem strange to hear one speak of a halfpupa and of stages intermediate between the larva and pupa but the external changes of form though rapidly passed through consisting apparently of a mere sloughing off of the outer skin are yet preceded by slow and very gradual alterations of tissues resulting from the growth of cells an inner layer of the larvaskin separates from the outer and by changes in the form of the muscles is drawn into different positions such as is assumed by the pupa which thus lies concealed beneath the larvaskin but a slight alteration is made in the general form of the larva consisting mostly of an enlargement of the thoracic segments which is often overlooked even by the special student though of great interest to the philosophic naturalist from mr emertons observations we should judge that the pupa state lasted from three to four weeks as the larv began to transform the first of august and appeared during the last week of the same month as perfect bees the andrena is seen as late as the first week in september and again early in april about the flowers of the willow it is one of the largest of its genus and a common species having in a very fragmentary way sketched the life history of our andrena and had some glimpses of its subterranean life let us now compare with it another genus of solitary bee halictus quite closely allied in all respects though a little lower in the scale the halictus parallelus excavates cells almost exactly like those of andrena but since the bee is smaller the holes are smaller though as deep mr emerton found one nest in a path a foot in depth another nest discovered september 9th was about six inches deep the cells are in form like those of andrena and like them are glazed within the egg is rather slenderer and much curved in form it is long cylindrical obtuse at one end and much smaller at the other the larva fig 31 is longer and slenderer being quite different from the rather broad and flattened larva of andrena the body is rather thick behind but in front tapers slowly towards the head which is of moderate size its body is somewhat tuberculated the tubercle aiding the grub in moving about its cell its length is nearly onehalf 40 of an inch on the pupa are four quite distinct conical tubercles forming a transverse line just in front of the ocelli and there are also two larger longer tubercles on the outer side of each of which an ocellus is situated figure 30 represents the pupa seen from beneath search was made on july 16th where the ground was hard as stone for six inches in depth below which the soil was soft and fine and over twenty cells were dug out the upper cells contained nearly mature pup and the lower ones larv of various sizes the smallest being hardly distinguishable by the naked eye each of these small larv was in a cell by itself and situated upon a lump of pollen which was the size and shape of a pea and was found to lessen in size as the larva grew larger these young were probably the offspring of several females as four mature bees were found in the hole the larva of an english species hatches in ten days after the eggs are laid another brood of bees appeared the middle of september as on the ninth of that month 1864 mr emerton found several holes of the same species of bee made in a hard gravel road near the turnpike when opened they were found to contain several bees with their young september 2nd of this year the same kind of bee was found in holes and just ready to leave the cell it is probable that these bees winter over we have incidentally noticed the presence in the nests of andrena and halictus of a stranger bee clad in gay fantastic hues which lives a parasitic life on its hosts this parasitism does not go far enough to cause the death of the host since we find the young of the parasitic cuckoo bee in cells containing the young of the former mr f smith in his catalogue of british bees says of this genus no one appears to know anything beyond the mere fact of their entering the burrows of andrenid and apid except that they are found in the cells of the working bees in their perfect condition it is most probable that they deposit their eggs on the provision laid up by the working bee that they close up the cell and that the working bee finding an egg deposited commences a fresh cell for her own progeny he has however found two specimens of nomada sexfasciata in the cells of the longhorned bee eucera longicornis he also states that while some species are constant in their attacks on certain halicti and andren others attack different species of these genera indiscriminately in like manner another cuckoo bee coelioxys is parasitic on megachile and saropoda stelis is a parasite on osmia the mason bee and melecta infests the cells of anthophora the observations of mr emerton enable us still further to clear up the history of this obscure visitor he found both the larva and pupa as well as the perfect bee in the cells of both genera so that either both kinds of bee when hatched from eggs laid in the same cell feed on the same pollen mass which therefore barely suffices for the nourishment of both or the hostess discovering the strange egg laid cuckoolike in her own nest has the forethought to deposit another ball of pollen to secure the safety of her young is such an act the operation of a blind instinct does it not rather ally our little bee with those higher animals which undoubtedly possess a reasoning power its instinct teaches it to build cells and prepare its pollen mass and lay an egg thereon its reason enables it in such an instance as this when the life of the brood is threatened to guard against any such danger by means to which it does not habitually resort this instance is paralleled by the case of our common summer yellow bird which on finding an egg of the cow bunting in its nest often builds a new nest above it to the certain destruction of the unwelcome egg in the nest beneath in the structure of the bee and in all its stages of growth our parasite seems lower in the zological scale than its host it is structurally a degraded form of workingbee and its position socially is unenviable it is lazy not having the provident habits of the workingbees it aids not in the least so far as we know the crossfertilization of plantsone great office in the economy of nature which most bees performsince it is not a pollengatherer but on the contrary is seemingly a drag and hinderance to the course of nature but yet nature kindly and as if by a special interposition provides for its maintenance and the humble naturalist can only exclaim god is great and his ways mysterious and go on studying and collecting facts leaving to his successors the more difficult task but greater joy of discovering the cause and reason of things that are but a puzzle to the philosophers of this day the larva of nomada may be known from those of its host by its slenderer body and smaller head while the body is smoother and more cylindrical both sexes of nomada imbricata and n pulchella were found by mr emerton the former in both the andrena and halictus nests and both were found in a single andrena nest illustration wood wasp chapter iii the parasites of the honey bee very few beekeepers are probably aware how many insect parasites infest the honey bee in our own literature we hear almost nothing of this subject but in europe much has been written on bee parasites from dr edward assmuss little work on the parasites of the honey bee we glean some of the facts now presented and which cannot fail to interest the general reader as well as the owner of bees the study of the habits of animal parasites has of late gained much attention among naturalists and both the honey and wild bees afford good examples of the singular relation between the host and the parasites which live upon it among insects generally there are certain species which devour the contents of the egg of the victim others and this is the most common mode of parasitism attack the insect in its larva state others in the pupa state and still others in the perfect or imago state dr leidy has shown that the wooddevouring species of beetle passalus cornutus and some myriopods or thousand legs are in some cases tenanted by myriads of microscopic plants and worms which luxuriate in the alimentary canal while the caterpillarfungus attacks sickly caterpillars filling out their bodies and sending out shoots into the air so that the insect looks as if transformed into a vegetable the ichneumon flies of which there are undoubtedly several thousand species in this country are the most common insect parasites next to these are the different species of tachina and its allied genera these like ichneumons live in the bodies of their hosts consuming the fatty parts and finishing their transformations just as the exhausted host is ready to die issue from their bodies as flies closely resembling the common housefly a small fly has been found in europe to be the most formidable foe of the hive bee sometimes producing the wellknown disease called foulbrood which is analogous to the typhus fever of man illustration 32 phora and its young this fly belonging to the genus phora fig 32 phora incrassata a larva b puparium c another species from mammoth cave is a small insect about a line and a half long and found in europe during the summer and autumn flying slowly about flowers and windows and in the vicinity of beehives its white transparent larva is cylindrical a little pointed before but broader behind the head is small and rounded with short threejointed antenn and at the posterior end of the body are several slender spines the puparium or pupa case inclosing the delicate chrysalis is oval consisting of eight segments flattened above with two large spines near the head and four on the extremity of the body when impelled by instinct to provide for the continuance of its species the phora enters the beehive and gains admission to a cell when it bores with its ovipositor through the skin of the bee larva laying its long oval egg in a horizontal position just under the skin the embryo of the phora is already well developed so that in three hours after the egg is inserted in the body of its unsuspecting and helpless host the embryo is nearly ready to hatch in about two hours more it actually breaks off the larger end of the eggshell and at once begins to eat the fatty tissues of its victim its posterior half still remaining in the shell in an hour more it leaves the egg entirely and buries itself completely in the fatty portion of the young bee the maggot moults three times in twelve hours after the last moult it turns around with its head towards the posterior end of the body of its host and in another twelve hours having become fullfed it bores through the skin of the young eats its way through the broodcovering of the cell and falls to the bottom of the hive where it changes to a pupa in the dust and dirt or else creeps out of the door and transforms in the earth twelve days after the fly appears the young bee emaciated and enfeebled by the attacks of its ravenous parasite dies and its decaying body fills the bottom of the cell with a slimy foulsmelling mass called foulbrood this gives rise to a miasma which poisons the neighboring brood until the contagion for the disease is analogous to typhus jail or shipfever spreads through the whole hive unless promptly checked by removing the cause and thoroughly cleansing the hive foulbrood sometimes attacks our american hives and though the cause may not be known yet from the hints given above we hope to have the history of our species of phora cleared up should our disease be found to be sometimes due to the attacks of such a parasitic fly illustration 33 bee louse and larva we figure the bee louse of europe fig 33 b braula cca which is a singular wingless spiderlike fly allied to the wingless sheep tick melophagus the wingless bat tick nycteribia and the winged horse fly hippobosca the head is very large without eyes or ocelli simple eyes while the ovate hindbody consists of five segments and is covered with stiff hairs it is onehalf to twothirds of a line long this spider fly is pupiparous that is the young of which only a very few are produced is not born until it has assumed the pupa state or is just about to do so the larva fig 33 a is oval elevenjointed and white in color the very day it is hatched it sheds its skin and changes to an oval puparium of a dark brown color its habits resemble those of the flea indeed should we compress its body strongly it would bear a striking resemblance to that insect it is evidently a connecting link between the flea and the two winged flies like the former it lives on the body of its host and obtains its food by plunging its stout beak into the bee and sucking its blood it has not been noticed in this country but is liable to be imported on the bodies of italian bees generally one or two of the braulas may on close examination be detected on the body of the bee sometimes the poor bees are loaded down by as many as a hundred of these hungry bloodsuckers assmuss recommends rubbing them off with a feather as the bee goes in and out of the door of its hive illustration 34 hive trichodes among the beetles are a few forms occasionally found in bees nests and also parasitic on the body of the bee trichodes apiarius fig 34 a larva b pupa front view has long been known in europe to attack the young bees in its perfect or beetle state it is found on flowers like our trichodes nuttallii which is commonly found on the spira in august and which may yet prove to enter our beehives the larva devours the brood but with the modern hive its ravages may be readily detected illustration 35 melo the oil beetle melo angusticollis fig 35 male differing from the female by having the antenn as if twisted into a knot fig 36 the active larva found on the body of the bee is a large dark blue insect found crawling in the grass in the vicinity of the nests of andrena halictus and other wild bees in may and again in august and september the eggs are laid in a mass covered with earth at the root of some plant during april and early in may when the willows are in blossom we have found the young recently hatched larv in considerable abundance creeping briskly over the bees or with their heads plunged between the segments of the body greedily sucking in the juices of their host those that we saw occurred on the humble and other wild bees and on various flies syrphus and muscid and there is no reason why they should not infest the honey bee which frequents similar flowers as they are actually known to do in europe these larv are probably hatched out near where the bees hibernate so as to creep into their bodies before they fly in the spring as it would be impossible for them to crawl up a willow tree ten feet high or more their feet being solely adapted for climbing over the hairy body of the bee which they do not leave until about to undergo their strange and unusual transformations illustration early stages of melo in europe assmuss states that on being brought into the nest by the bee they leave the bee and devour the eggs in the bee cells and then attack the bee bread when fullfed and ready to pass through their transformations to attain the beetle state instead of at once assuming the pupa and imago forms as in the trichodes represented in fig 34 they pass through a hypermetamorphosis as fabre a french naturalist calls it in other words the changes in form which are preparatory to assuming the pupa and imago states are more marked and almost coequal with the larva and pupa states so that the melo instead of passing through three states the egg larva and pupa in realty passes through these and two others in addition which are intermediate the whole subject of the metamorphosis of this beetle needs revision but fabre states that the larva soon after entering the nest of its host changes its skin and assumes a second larva form newport who with siebold has carefully described the metamorphoses of melo does not mention this stage in its development which fabre calls pseudochrysalis it is motionless the head is masklike without movable appendages and the feet are represented by six tubercles this is more properly speaking the semipupa and the mature pupa grows beneath its masklike form which is finally moulted this form however according to fabre changes its skin and turns into a third larva form fig 37 after some time it assumes its true pupa form fig 38 and finally moults this skin to appear as a beetle fabre has also in a lively and wellwritten account given a history of sitaris a european beetle somewhat resembling melo he states that sitaris lays its eggs near the entrance of bees nests and at the very moment that the bee lays her egg in the honey cell the flattened ovate sitaris larva drops from the body of the bee upon which it has been living and feasts upon the contents of the freshly laid egg after eating this delicate morsel it devours the honey in the cells of the bee and changes into a white cylindrical nearly footless grub and after it is fullfed and has assumed a supposed pupa state the skin without bursting incloses a kind of hard pupa skin which is very similar in outline to the former larva within whose skin is found a whitish larva which directly changes into the true pupa in a succeeding state this pupa in the ordinary way changes to a beetle which belongs to the same group of coleoptera as melo we cannot but think from observations made on the humble bee the wasp two species of moths and several other insects that this hypermetamorphosis is not so abnormal a mode of insect metamorphosis as has been supposed and that the changes of these insects made beneath the skin of the mature larva before assuming the pupa state are almost as remarkable as those of melo and sitaris though less easily observed than they several other beetles allied to melo are known to be parasitic on wild bees though the accounts of them are fragmentary the stylops parasite the history of stylops a beetle allied to melo is no less strange than that of melo and is in some respects still more interesting on june 18th i captured an andrena vicina which had been stylopized on looking at my capture i saw a pale reddishbrown triangular mark on the bees abdomen this was the flattened head and thorax of a female stylops fig 39a position of the female of stylops seen in profile in the abdomen of the bee fig 39b the female seen from above the head and thorax are soldered into a single flattened mass the baggy hindbody being greatly enlarged like that of the gravid female of the white ant and consisting of nine segments illustration 39 female stylops on carefully drawing out the whole body pl 1 fig 6 as seen from above and showing the alimentary canal ending in a blind sac fig 6a side view which is very extensible soft and baggy and examining it under a high power of the microscope we saw multitudes at least several hundred of very minute larv like particles of dust to the naked eye issuing in every direction from the body of the parent now torn open in places though most of them made their exit through an opening on the under side of the headthorax the stylops being hatched while still in the body of the parent is therefore viviparous she probably never lays eggs on the last of april when the mezereon was in blossom i caught the singular looking male stylops childreni fig 40 a side view it is about onefourth of an inch long which was as unlike its partner as possible i laid it under a tumbler when the delicate insect flew and tumbled about till it died of exhaustion in a few hours it appears then that the larv are hatched during the middle or last of june from eggs fertilized in april the larv then crawl out upon the body of the bee on which they are transported to the nest where they enter according to pecks observations the body of the larva on whose fatty parts they feed previous to changing to a pupa the larva lives with its head turned towards that of its host but before assuming the perfect state which they do in the late summer or autumn it must reverse its position the female protrudes the front part of her body between the segments of the abdomen of her host as represented in our figure this change newport thinks takes place after the beehost has undergone its metamorphoses though the bee does not leave her earthen cells until the following spring though the male stylops deserts his host his wingless partner is imprisoned during her whole life within her host and dies immediately after giving birth to her myriad for newport thinks she produces over two thousand offspring illustration 40 male stylops xenos peckii an allied insect was discovered by dr peck to be parasitic in the body of wasps and there are now known to be several species of this small but curious family stylopid which are known to live parasitically on the bodies of our wild bees and wasps the presence of these parasites finally exhausts the host so that the sterile female bee dies prematurely as in the higher animals bees are afflicted with parasitic worms which induce disease and sometimes death the wellknown hair worm gordius is an insect parasite the adult form is about the size of a slender knitting needle and is seen in moist soil and in pools it lays according to dr leidy millions of eggs connected together in long cords the microscopical tadpoleshaped young penetrate into the bodies of insects frequenting damp localities fairly ensconced within the body of their unsuspecting host they luxuriate on its fatty tissues and pass through their metamorphoses into the adult form when they desert their living house and take to the water to lay their eggs in europe siebold has described gordius subbifurcus which infests the drones of the honey bee and also other insects professor siebold has also described mermis albicans which is a similar kind of hair worm from two to five inches long and whitish in color this worm is also found strangely enough only in the drones though it is the workers which frequent watery places to appease their thirst illustration 41 bee fungus thousands of insects are carried off yearly by parasitic fungi the ravages of the muscardine caused by a minute fungus botrytris bassiana have threatened the extinction of silk culture in europe and the still more formidable disease called pebrine is thought to be of vegetable origin dr leidy mentions a fungus which must annually carry off myriads of the seventeen year locust a somewhat similar fungus mucor mellitophorus fig 41 infests bees filling the stomach with microscopical colorless spores so as greatly to weaken the insect as there is a probability that many insects parasites on the wild bees may sooner or later afflict the honey bee and also to illustrate farther the complex nature of insect parasitism we will for a moment look at some other bee parasites illustration pl 1 parasites of bees among the numerous insects preying in some way upon the humble bee are to be found other species of bees and moths flies and beetles insect parasites often imitate their host apathus plate i fig 1 a ashtoni can scarcely be distinguished from its host and yet it lives cuckoolike in the cells of the humble bee though we know not yet how injurious it really is then there are conops and volucella the former of which lives like tachina and phora within the bees body while the latter devours the brood the young plate i figs 5 5a of another fly allied to anthomyia of which the onion fly fig 42 is an example is also not unfrequently met with a small beetle plate 1 fig 4 antherophagus ochraceus is a common inmate of humble bees nests and probably feeds upon the wax and pollen we have also found several larv fig 43 of a beetle of which we do not know the adult form of similar habits is probably a small moth nephopteryx edmandsii plate i figs 2 2a larva fig 2b chrysalis or pupa which undoubtedly feeds upon the waxen walls of the bee cells and thus like the attacks of the common bee moth galleria cereana whose habits are so well known as not to detain us must prove very prejudicial to the well being of the colony this moth is in turn infested by an ichneumon fly microgaster nephoptericis plate i figs 3 3a which must prove quite destructive illustration 42 onion fly and maggot illustration 43 larva of beetle the figures of the early stages of a minute ichneumon represented on the same plate fig 7 larva and 7a pupa of

insect known at all is the pteratomus putnami pl i fig 8 wanting the hind leg or winged atom which is only oneninetieth of an inch in length and is parasitic on anthophorabia itself a parasite a species of mite plate i figs 9 9a the same seen from beneath is always to be found in humble bees nests but it is not thought to be specially obnoxious to the bees themselves though several species of mites gamasus etc are known to be parasitic on insects chapter iv a few words about moths the butterflies and moths from their beauty and grace have always been the favorites among amateur entomologists and rare and costly works have been published in which their forms and gorgeous colors are represented in the best style of natural history art we need only mention the folio volume of madam merian of the last century harriss aurelian the works of cramer stoll drury hbner horsfield doubleday and westwood and hewitson as comprising the most luxurious and costly entomological works near the close of the last century john abbot went from london and spent several years in georgia rearing the larger and more showy butterflies and moths and painting them in the larva chrysalis and adult or imago stage these drawings he sent to london to be sold many of them were collected by sir james edward smith and published under the title of the natural history of the rarer lepidopterous insects of georgia collected from the observations of john abbot with the plants on which they feed london 1797 2 vols fol besides these two rare volumes there are sixteen folio volumes of drawings by abbot in the library of the british museum this work is of especial interest to the american student as it illustrates the early stages of many of our butterflies and moths indeed the study of insects possesses most of its interest when we observe their habits and transformations caterpillars are always to be found and with a little practice are easy to raise we would therefore advise any one desirous of beginning the study of insects to take up the butterflies and moths they are perhaps easier to study than any other group of insects and are more ornamental in the cabinet as a scientific study we would recommend it to ladies as next to botany in interest and in the ease in which specimens may be collected and examined the example of madam merian and several ladies in this country who have greatly aided science by their well filled cabinets and critical knowledge of the various species and their transformations is an earnest of what may be expected from their followers though the moths are easy to study compared with the bees flies beetles and bugs and dragon flies yet many questions of great interest in philosophical entomology have been answered by our knowledge of their structure and mode of growth the great works of herold on the evolution of a caterpillar of lyonet on the anatomy of the cossus of newport on that of the sphinx and of siebold on the parthenogenesis of insects are proofs that the moths have engaged the attention of some of the master minds in science the study of the transformations of the moths is also of great importance to one who would acquaint himself with the questions concerning the growth and metamorphoses and origin of animals we should remember that the very words metamorphosis and transformation now so generally applied to other groups of animals and used in philosophical botany were first suggested by those who observed that the moth and butterfly attain their maturity only by passing through wonderful changes of form and modes of life the knowledge of the fact that all animals pass through some sort of a metamorphosis is very recent in physiology moreover the fact that these morphological eras in the life of an individual animal accord most unerringly with the gradation of forms in the type of which it is a member was the discovery of the eminent physiologist von baer up to this time the true significance of the luxuriance and diversity of larval forms had never seriously engaged the attention of systematists in entomology what can possibly be the meaning of all this putting on and taking off of caterpillar habiliments or in other words the process of moulting with the frequent changes in ornamentation and the seeming fastidiousness and queer fancies and strange conceits of these young and giddy insects seems hidden and mysterious to human observation indeed few care to spend the time and trouble necessary to observe the insect through its transformations and that done if only the larva of the perfect insect can be identified and its form sketched how much was gained a truthful and circumstantial biography in all its relations of a single insect has yet to be written we should also apply our knowledge of the larval forms of insects to the details of their classification into families and genera constantly collating our knowledge of the early stages with the structural relations that accompany them in the perfect state the simple form of the caterpillar seems to be a concentration of the characters of the perfect insect and presents easy characters by which to distinguish the minor groups and the relative rank of the higher divisions will only be definitely settled when their forms and methods of transformation are thoroughly known thus for example in two groups of the large attacuslike moths which are so amply illustrated in dr harriss treatise on insects injurious to vegetation if we take the different forms of the caterpillars of the tau moth of europe which are figured by duponchel and godard we find that the very young larva has four hornlike processes on the front and four on the back part of the body the full grown larva of the regalis moth of the southern and middle states is very similarly ornamented it is an embryonic form and therefore inferior in rank to the tau moth multiply these horns over the surface of the body lessen their size and crown them with hairs and we have our io moth so destructive to corn now take off the hairs elongating and thinning out the tubercles and make up the loss by the increased size of the worm and we have the caterpillar of our common cecropia moth again remove the naked tubercles almost wholly smooth off the surface of the body and contract its length thus giving a greater convexity and angularity to the rings and we have before us the larva of the stately luna moth that tops this royal family here are certain criteria for placing these insects before our minds in the order that nature has placed them we have certain facts for determining which of these three insects is highest and which lowest in the scale when we see the larva of the luna moth throwing off successively the io and cecropia forms to take on its own higher features so that there is a meaning in all this shifting of insect toggery this is but an example of the many ways in which both pleasure and mental profit may be realized from the thoughtful study of caterpillar life in collecting butterflies and moths for cabinet specimens one needs a gauze net a foot and a half deep with the wire frame a foot in diameter a widemouthed bottle containing a parcel of cyanide of potassium gummed on the side in which to kill the moths which should as soon as life is extinct be pinned in a corklined collecting box carried in the coat pocket the captures should then be spread and dried on a grooved setting board and a cabinet formed of corklined boxes or drawers as a substitute for cork frames with paper tightly stretched over them may be used or the pith of cornstalks or palm wood caterpillars should be preserved in spirits or in glycerine with a little alcohol added some persons ingeniously empty the skins and inflate them over a flame so that they may be pinned by the side of the adult some of the most troublesome and noxious insects are found among the moths i need only mention the canker worm and american tent caterpillar and the various kinds of cut worms as instances illustration 43 parasite of the american silk worm we must not however forget the good done by insects they undoubtedly tend by their attacks to prevent an undue growth of vegetation the pruning done to a tree or herb by certain insects undoubtedly causes a more healthy growth of the branches and leaves and ultimately a greater production fruit again as pollenbearers insects are a most powerful agency in nature it is undoubtedly the fact that the presence of bees in orchards increases the fruit crop and thus the thousands of moths though injurious as caterpillars wild bees and other insects that seem to live without purpose are really though few realize it among the best friends and allies of man moreover insects are of great use as scavengers such are the young or maggots of the house fly the mosquitoes and numerous other forms that seem created only to vex us when in the winged state still a larger proportion of insects are directly beneficial from their habit of attacking injurious species such as the ichneumons fig 43 the ichneumon of the american silk worm and certain flies fig 44 tachina also many carnivorous species of wasps beetles and flies dragon flies and aphis lions fig 45 the lacewinged fly adult larva and eggs illustration 44 tachina parasite of colorado potato beetle illustration 45 the lacewinged fly its larva and eggs but few however suspect how enormous are the losses to crops in this country entailed by the attacks of the injurious species in europe the subject of applied entomology has always attracted a great deal of attention most sumptuous works elegant quartos prepared by naturalists known the world over and published at government expense together with smaller treatises have frequently appeared while the subject is taught in the numerous agricultural colleges and schools especially of germany in the densely populated countries of europe the losses occasioned by injurious insects are most severely felt though from many causes such as the greater abundance of their insect parasites and the far greater care taken by the people to exterminate their insect enemies they have not proved so destructive as in our own land in this connection i may quote from one of dr asa fitchs reports on the noxious insects of new york where he says i find that in our wheatfields here the midge formed 59 per cent of all the insects on this grain the past summer whilst in france the preceding summer only 7 per cent of the insects on wheat were of this species in france the parasitic destroyers amounted to 85 per cent while in this country our parasites form only 10 per cent a true knowledge of practical entomology may well be said to be in its infancy in our own country when as is wellknown to agriculturists the cultivation of wheat has almost been given up in new england new york pennsylvania ohio and virginia from the attacks of the wheat midge hessian fly joint worm and chinch bug according to dr shimers estimate says mr riley in his second annual report on the injurious insects of missouri which may be considered a reasonable one in the year 1864 threefourths of the wheat and onehalf of the corn crop were destroyed by the chinch bug throughout many extensive districts comprising almost the entire northwest at the annual rate of increase according to the united states census in the state of illinois the wheat crop ought to have been about thirty millions of bushels and the corn crop about one hundred and thirtyeight million bushels putting the cash value of wheat at 125 and that of corn at 50 cents the cash value of the corn and wheat destroyed by this insignificant little bug no bigger than a grain of rice in one single state and one single year will therefore according to the above figures foot up to the astounding total of over seventythree millions of dollars the imported cabbage butterfly pieris rap recently introduced from europe is estimated by the abb provatncher a canadian entomologist to destroy annually two hundred and forty thousand dollars worth of cabbages around quebec the hessian fly according to dr fitch destroyed fifteen million dollars worth of wheat in new york state in one year 1854 the army worm of the north leucania unipuncta which was so abundant in 1861 from new england to kansas was reported to have done damage that year in eastern massachusetts exceeding half a million of dollars the joint worm isosoma hordei alone sometimes cuts off whole fields of grain in virginia and northward the colorado potato beetle is steadily moving eastward now ravaging the fields in indiana and ohio and only the forethought and ingenuity in devising means of checking its attacks resulting from a thorough study of its habits will deliver our wasted fields from its direful assaults these are the injuries done by the more abundant kinds of insects injurious to crops we should not forget that each fruit or shade tree garden shrub or vegetable has a host of insects peculiar to it and which year after year renew their attacks i could enumerate upwards of fifty species of insects which prey upon cereals and grass and as many which infest our field crops some thirty well known species ravage our garden vegetables there are nearly fifty species which attack the grape vine and their number is rapidly increasing about seventyfive species make their annual onset upon the apple tree and nearly an equal number may be found upon the plum pear peach and cherry among our shade trees over fifty species infest the oak twentyfive the elm seventyfive the walnut and over one hundred species of insects prey upon the pine indeed we may reasonably calculate the annual loss in our country alone from noxious animals and the lower forms of plants such as rust smut and mildew as at a low estimate not far from five hundred million dollars annually of this amount at least onetenth or fifty million dollars could probably be saved by human exertions to save a portion of this annual loss of food stuffs fruits and lumber should be the first object of farmers and gardeners when this saving is made farming will become a profitable and safe profession but while a few are well informed as to the losses sustained by injurious insects and use means to ward off their attacks their efforts are constantly foiled by the negligence of their neighbors as illustrated so well by the history of the incursions of the army worm and canker worm it is only by a combination between farmers and orchardists that these and other pests can be kept under the matter can be best reached by legislation we have fish and game laws why should we not have an insect law why should we not frame a law providing that farmers and all owning a garden or orchard should cooperate in taking preventive measures against injurious insects such as early or late planting of cereals to avert the attacks of the wheat midge and hessian fly the burning of stubble in the autumn and spring to destroy the joint worm the combined use of proper remedies against the canker worm the various cut worms and other noxious caterpillars a law carried out by a proper state entomological constabulary if it may be so designated would compel the idle and shiftless to clear their farms and gardens of noxious animals illustration 46 pickle worm and its moth among some of the injurious insects reported on by mr riley the state entomologist of missouri is a new pest to the cucumber in the west the pickle worm phacellura nitidalis fig 46 this is a caterpillar which bores into the cucumbers when large enough to pickle and which is occasionally found in pickles three or four worms sometimes occur in a cucumber and in the garden a single one will cause it to rot one of the most troublesome intruders in our graperies is the vine dresser choerocampa pampinatrix fig 47 larva and pupa fig 48 adult a single caterpillar of which will sometimes strip a small vine of its leaves in a few nights and occasionally nips off bunches of halfgrown grapes illustration 48 vine dresser moth 47 vine dresser and chrysalis another caterpillar which is sometimes so abundant as nearly to defoliate the grape vine is the eight spotted alypia fig 49 a larva b side view of a segment this must not be confounded with the bluish larva of the wood nymph eudryas grata fig 50 which differs from the alypia caterpillar in being bluish and in wanting the white patches on the side of the body and the more prominent hump on the end of the body another moth psychomorpha epimenis fig 51 a larva b side view of a segment c top view of the hump also feeds on the grape eating the terminal buds it is also bluish and wants the orange bands on the side of the body another moth of this family is the american procris acoloithus americana fig 52a larva b pupa c cocoon d e imago a dark blue moth with a deep orange collar whose black and yellow caterpillar is gregarious fig 53 living in companies of a dozen or more and eating the softer parts of the leaves it is quite common in the western and southern states the figure represents two separate broods of caterpillars feeding on either side of the midrib of the leaf but if the moths are as a rule the enemies of our crops there are the silk worms of the east and southern europe and california which afford the means of support to multitudes of the poorer classes and supply one of the most valuable articles of clothing blot out the silk worm and we should remove one of the most important sources of national wealth the annual revenue from the silk trade of the world amounting to 254500000 illustration 49 eightspotted alypia and larva illustration 50 eudryas grata illustration 51 larva of psychomorpha illustration 52 american procris and young illustration 53 larv of american procris silk culture is rapidly assuming importance in california and though the chinese silk worm has not been successfully cultivated in the eastern states yet the american silk worm teleas polyphemus see frontispiece male fig 54 larva 55 pupa 56 cocoon can we are assured by mr trouvelot be made a source of profit this is a splendid member of the group of which the gigantic attacus atlas of china is a type it is a large fawn colored moth with a tawny tinge the caterpillar is pale green and is of the size indicated in the cut mr trouvelot says that of the several kinds of silk worms the larva of the present species alone deserves attention the cocoons of platysamia cecropia may be rendered of some commercial value as the silk can be carded but the chief objection is the difficulty of raising the larva the polyphemus worm spins a strong dense oval cocoon which is closed at each end while the silk has a very strong and glossy fibre mr trouvelot from whose interesting account in the first volume of the american naturalist we quote says that in 1865 not less than a million could be seen feeding in the open air upon bushes covered with a net five acres of woodland were swarming with caterpillar life the bushes were scrub oaks the worms being protected by a net after meeting with such great success mr trouvelot lost all his worms by pebrine the germs being imported in eggs received from japan through m gurinmneville of paris enough however was done to prove that silk raising can be carried on profitably when due precautions are taken as far north as boston as this moth extends to the tropics it can be reared with greater facility southwards the cocoon is strong and dense and closed at each end so that the thread is continuous while the silk has a very strong and glossy fibre illustration 54 american silk worm next in value to the american silk worm is the ailanthus silk worm samia cynthia a species allied to our callosamia promethea it originated from china where it is cultivated and was introduced into italy in 1858 and thence spread into france where it was introduced by m gurinmneville its silk is said to be much stronger than the fibre of cotton and is a mean between fine wool and ordinary silk the worm is very hardy and can be reared in the open air both in this country and in europe the main drawback to its culture is the difficulty in unreeling the tough cocoon and the shortness of the thread the cocoon being open at one end the yamama moth anthera yamama was introduced into france from japan in 1861 it is closely allied to the polyphemus moth and its caterpillar also feeds on the oak its silk is said to be quite brilliant but a little coarser and not so strong as that of the bombyx mori the perny silk worm is extensively cultivated by the chinese in manchouria where it feeds on the oak its silk is coarser than that of the common silk worm but is yet fine strong and glossy bengal has furnished the tussah moth which lives in india on the oak and a variety of other trees it is largely raised in french and english india according to nogus and is used in the manufacture of stuffs called corahs illustration 55 chrysalis of american silk worm illustration 56 cocoon of american silk worm the last kind of importance is the arrhindy silk worm from india it has been naturalized in france and algeria by m gurinmneville who has done so much in the application of entomology to practical life it is closely allied to the cynthia or ailanthus worm with the same kind of silk and a similar cocoon and feeds on the castor oil plant the diseases of silk worms naturally receive much attention like those afflicting mankind they arise from bad air resulting from too close confinement bad food and other adverse causes the most fatal and widespread disease and one which since 1854 has threatened the extermination of silk worms in europe is the pebrine it is due to the presence of minute vegetable corpuscles which attack both the worms and the eggs it was this disease which swept off thousands of mr trouvelots polyphemus worms and put a sudden termination to his important experiments the germs having been implanted in eggs of the yamama moth imported from japan by m gurinmneville and which were probably infected as they passed through paris though the disaster happened several years since he tells us that it will be useless for him to attempt the raising of silk worms in the town where his establishment is situated as the germs of the disease are most difficult to eradicate so direful in france were the ravages of this disease that two of the most advanced naturalists in france quatrefages and pasteur were commissioned by the french government to investigate the disease pasteur found that the infected eggs differed in appearance from the sound ones and could thus be sorted out by aid of the microscope and destroyed thus these investigations carried on year after year and seeming to the ignorant to tend to no practical end resulted in saving to france her silk culture during the past year 1871 so successful has his method proved that a french scientific journal expresses the hope of the complete reestablishment and prosperity of this great industry a single person who obtained in 1871 in his nurseries 30000 ounces of eggs hopes the next year to obtain 100000 ounces from which he expects to realize about one million dollars illustration the potato caterpillar chapter v the clothes moth for over a fortnight we once enjoyed the company of the caterpillar of a common clothes moth it is a little pale delicate worm fig 57 magnified about the size of a darning needle and rather less than half an inch in length with a pale horncolored head the ring next the head being of the same color it has sixteen feet the first six of them well developed and constantly in use to draw the slender body in and out of its case its head is armed with a formidable pair of jaws with which like a scythe it mows its way through thick and thin but the case is the most remarkable feature in the history of this caterpillar hardly has the helpless tiny worm broken out of the egg previously laid in some old garment of fur or wool or perhaps in the haircloth of a sofa when it begins to make a shelter by cutting the woolly fibres or soft hairs into bits which it places at each end in successive layers and joining them together by silken threads constructs a cylindrical tube fig 58 of thick warm felt lined within with the finest silk the tiny worm can spin the case is not perfectly cylindrical being flattened slightly in the middle and contracted a little just before each end both of which are always kept open the case before us is of a stonegray color with a black stripe along the middle and with rings of the same color round each opening had the caterpillar fed on blue or yellow cloth the case would of course have been of those colors other cases made by larv which had been eating loose cotton were quite irregular in form and covered loosely with bits of cotton thread which the little tailor had not trimmed off days go by a vigorous course of dieting on its feast of wool has given stature to our hero his case has grown uncomfortably small shall he leave it and make another no housewife is more prudent and saving out come those scissorjaws and lo a fearful rent along each side of one end of the case two wedgeshaped patches mend the breach the caterpillar retires for a moment and reappears at the other end the scissors are once more pulled out two rents appear to be filled up by two more patches or gores and our caterpillar once again breathes more freely laughs and grows fat upon horse hair and lambs wool in this way he enlarges his case till he stops growing illustration 59 58 57 early stages of the clothes moth our caterpillar seeming to be fullgrown and apparently out of employment we cut the end of his case half off two or three days after he had mended it from the inside drawing the two edges together by silken threads and though he had not touched the outside yet so neatly were the two parts joined together that we had to search for some time with a lens to find the scar to keep our friend busy during the cold cheerless weather for it was midwinter we next cut a third of the case entirely off nothing daunted the little fellow bustled about drew in a mass of the woolly fibres filling up the whole mouth of his den and began to build on afresh and from the inside so that the newmade portion was smaller than the rest of the case the creature worked very slowly and the addition was left in a rough unfinished state we could easily spare these voracious little worms hairs enough to serve as food and to afford material for the construction of their paltry cases but that restless spirit that ever urges on all beings endowed with life and the power of motion never forsakes the young clothes moth for a moment he will not be forced to drag his heavy case over rough hairs and furzy wool hence with his keen jaws he cuts his way through thus the more he travels the more mischief he does after taking his fill of this sort of life he changes to a chrysalid fig 59 and soon appears as one of those delicate tiny demure moths that fly in such numbers from early in the spring until the autumn very many do not recognize these moths in their perfect stage so small are they and vent their wrath on those great millers that fly around lamps in warm summer evenings it need scarcely be said that these large millers are utterly guiltless of any attempts upon our wardrobes they make their attacks in a more open form on our gardens and orchards we will give a more careful description of the clothes moth which was found in its different stages june 12th in a mass of loose cotton the larva is white with a tolerably plump body which tapers slightly towards the tail while the head is much of the color of gumcopal the rings of the body are thickened above especially on the thoracic ones by two transverse thickened folds it is onefifth of an inch long the body of the chrysalis or pupa is considerably curved with the head smooth and rounded the long antenn together with the hind legs which are folded along the breast reach to the tip of the hind body on the upper surface of each ring of which is a short transverse row of minute spines which aid the chrysalis in moving towards the mouth of its case just before the moth appears at first the chrysalis is whitish but just before the exclusion of the moth becomes the color of varnish when about to cast its pupa skin the skin splits open on the back and the perfect insect glides out the act is so quickly over with that the observer has to look sharp to observe the different steps in the operation illustration 60 clothes moth our common clothes moth tinea flavifrontella fig 60 is of a uniform lightbuff color with a silky iridescent lustre the hind wings and abdomen being a little paler the head is thickly tufted with hairs and is a little tawny and the upper side of the densely hirsute feelers palpi is dusky the wings are long and narrow with the most beautiful and delicate long silken fringe which increases in length towards the base of the wing they begin to fly in may and last all through the season fluttering with a noiseless stealthy flight in our apartments and laying their eggs in our woollens successive broods of the clothes moth appear through the summer in the autumn they cease eating retire within their cases and early in spring assume the chrysalis state there are several allied species which have much the same habits except that they do not all construct cases but eat carpets clothing articles of food grain etc and objects of natural history careful housewives are not much afflicted with these pests the slovenly and thriftless are overrun with them early in june woollens and furs should be carefully dusted shaken and beaten dr t w harris states that powdered black pepper strewed under the edge of carpets is said to repel moths sheets of paper sprinkled with spirits of turpentine camphor in coarse powder leaves of tobacco or shavings of russia leather should be placed among the clothes when they are laid aside for the summer and furs and other small articles can be kept by being sewed in bags with bits of camphor wood red cedar or of spanish cedar while the cloth lining of carriages can be secured forever from the attacks of moths by being washed or sponged on both sides with a solution of the corrosive sublimate of mercury in alcohol made just strong enough not to leave a white stain on a black feather the moths can be most readily killed by pouring benzine among them though its use must be much restricted from the disagreeable odor which remains the recent experiments made with carbolic acid however convince us that this will soon take the place of other substances as a preventive and destroyer of noxious insects illustration the juniper sicklewing chapter vi the mosquito and its friends the subject of flies becomes of vast moment to a pharaoh whose ears are dinned with the buzz of myriad winged plagues mingled with angry cries from malcontent and flypestered subjects or to the summer traveller in northern lands where they oppose a stronger barrier to his explorations than the loftiest mountains or the broadest streams or to the african pioneer whose cattle his main dependence are stung to death by the tsetze fly or the fariner whose eyes on the evening of a warm spring day after a placid contemplation of his growing acres of wheat blades suddenly detects in dismay clouds of the wheat midge and hessian fly hovering over their swaying tops the subject indeed has in such cases a national importance and a few words regarding the main points in the habits of flieshow they grow how they do not grow after assuming the winged state and how they bite for who has not endured the smart and sting of these dipterous shylocks that almost torment us out of our existence while taking their drop of our hearts bloodmay be welcome to our readers illustration 61 head of the mosquito the mosquito will be our first choice as she leaps off from her light bark the cast chrysalis skin of her early life beneath the waters and sails away in the sunlight her velvety wings fringed with silken hairs and her neatly bodiced trim figure though her nose is rather salient considering that it is half as long as her entire body present a beauty and grace of form and movement quite unsurpassed by her dipterous allies she draws near and softly alights upon the hand of the charmed beholder subdues her trumpeting notes folds her wings noiselessly upon her back daintily sets down one foot after the other and with an eagerness chastened by the most refined delicacy for the feelings of her victim and with the air of velpeau redivivus drives through crushed and bleeding capillaries shrinking nerves and injured tissues a manybladed lancet of marvellous fineness of wonderful complexity and fitness while engorging herself with our blood we will examine under the microscope the mosquitos mouth the head fig 61 is rounded with the two eyes occupying a large part of the surface and nearly meeting on the top of the head out of the forehead so to speak grow the long delicate hairy antennm a and just below arises the long beak which consists of the bristlelike maxill mx with their palpi mp and mandibles m and the single hairlike labrum these five bristlelike organs being laid in the hollowed labium l thus massed into a single awllike beak the mosquito without any apparent effort thrusts them all except the labium into the flesh her hind body may be seen tilling with the red blood until it cries quits and the insect withdraws its sting and flies sluggishly away in a moment the wounded parts itch slightly though a very robust person may not notice the irritation or a more delicate individual if asleep though if weakened by disease or if stung in a highly vascular and sensitive part such as the eyelid the bite becomes really a serious matter multiply the mosquito a thousand fold and one flees their attacks and avoids their haunts as he would a nest of hornets early in spring the larva fig 62 a of the mosquito may be found in pools and ditches it remains at the bottom feeding upon decaying matter thus acting as a scavenger and in this state doing great benefit in clearing swamps of miasms until it rises to the surface for air which it inhales through a single respiratory tube c situated near the tail when about to transform into the pupa state it contracts and enlarges anteriorly near the middle the larval skin is thrown off and the insect appears in quite a different form fig 62 a the head and thorax are massed together the rudiments of the mouth parts and of the wings and legs being folded upon the breast while there are two breathing tubes d situated upon the back instead of the tail which ends in two broad paddles a so that it comes to the surface head foremost instead of tail first a position according better with its increased age and experience in pond life in a few days the pupa skin is cast the insect availing itself of its old habiliments as a raft upon which to float while its body is drying grows lighter and its wings expand for its marriage flight the males are beautiful both physically and morally as they do not bite their manners are more retiring than those of their stronger minded partners as they rarely enter our dwellings and live unnoticed in the woods they may be easily distinguished from the females by their long maxillary palpi and their thick bushy feathered antenn the female lays her elongated oval eggs in a boatshaped mass which floats on the water a mosquito lives three or four weeks in the water before changing to the adult or winged stage how many days they live in the latter state we do not know illustration 62 larva and pupa of the mosquito our readers will understand then that all flies like our mosquito for example grow while in the larva and pupa state and after they acquire wings do not grow so that the small midges are not young mosquitoes but the adult winged forms of an entirely different species and genus of fly and the myriads of small flies commonly supposed to be the young of larger flies are adult forms belonging to different species of different genera and perhaps of different families of the suborder of diptera the typical species of the genus culex to which the mosquito belongs is culex pipiens described by linnus and there are already over thirty north american species of this genus described in various works few insects live in the sea but along the coast of new england a small slender white larva fig 63a magnified and head greatly enlarged fig 64 pupa and fore foot of larva showing the hooks whose body is no thicker than a knitting needle lives between tides and has even been dredged at a depth of over a hundred feet which transforms into a yellow mosquitolike fly fig 65 with head of the female magnified which swarms in summer in immense numbers i have called it provisionally chironomus oceanicus or ocean gnat the larv of other species have been found by mr s i smith living at great depths in our northern lakes these kinds of gnats are usually seen early in spring hovering in swarms in mid air illustration 65 ocean gnat illustration 63 larva of ocean gnat illustration 64 pupa of ocean gnat the strange fact has been discovered by grimm a russian naturalist that the pupa of a feathered gnat is capable of laying eggs which produce young during the summer time previous to this it had been discovered that a larva of a gnat fig 66 a eggs from which the young are produced which lives under the bark of trees in europe also produced young born alive the hessian fly fig 67 a larva b pupa c stalk of wheat injured by larv and wheat midge which are allied to the mosquito are briefly referred to in the calendar so that we pass over these to consider another pest of our forests and prairies illustration 66 viviparous gall larva illustration 67 hessian fly and its young the black fly is even a more formidable pest than the mosquito in the northern subarctic regions it opposes a barrier against travel the labrador fisherman spends his summer on the sea shore scarcely daring to penetrate the interior on account of the swarms of these flies during a summer residence on this coast we sailed up the esquimaux river for six or eight miles spending a few hours at a house situated on the bank the day was warm and but little wind blowing and the swarms of black flies were absolutely terrific in vain we frantically waved our net among them allured by some rare moth after making a few desperate charges in the face of the thronging pests we had to retire to the house where the windows actually swarmed with them but here they would fly in our faces crawl under ones clothes where they even remain and bite in the night the children in the house were sickly and worn by their unceasing torments and the shaggy newfoundland dogs whose thick coats would seem to be proof against their bites ran from their shelter beneath the bench and dashed into the river their only retreat in cloudy weather unlike the mosquito the black fly disappears only flying when the sun shines the bite of the black fly is often severe the creature leaving a large clot of blood to mark the scene of its surgical triumphs prof e t cox state geologist of indiana has sent us specimens of a much larger fly which baron osten sacken refers to this genus which is called on the prairies where it is said to bite horses to death the buffalo gnat westwood states that an allied fly rhagio columbaschensis is one of the greatest scourges of man and beast in hungary where it has been known to kill cattle illustration 68 black fly illustration 69 black fly larva the simulium molestum fig 68 enlarged as the black fly is called lives during the larva state in the water the larva of a labrador species fig 69 enlarged which we found is about a quarter of an inch long and of the appearance here indicated the pupa is also aquatic having long respiratory filaments attached to each side of the front of the thorax according to westwood the posterior part of its body is enclosed in a semioval membranous cocoon which is at first formed by the larva the anterior part of which is eaten away before changing to a pupa so as to be open in front the imago is produced beneath the surface of the water its fine silky covering serving to repel the action of the water illustration 70 mycetobia multitudes of a long slender white worm may often be found living in the dirt and sour sap running from wounds in the elm tree two summers ago we discovered some of these larv and on rearing them found that they were a species of mycetobia fig 70 a larva b pupa the larva is remarkable for having the abdominal segments divided into two portions the hinder much smaller than the anterior division its whole length is a little over a third of an inch the pup were found sticking out in considerable numbers from the tree being anchored by the little spines at the tail the head is square ending in two horns and the body is straight and covered with spines especially towards the end of the tail they were a fifth of an inch in length the last of june the flies appeared somewhat resembling gnats and about a line long the worms continued to infest the tree for six weeks the flies remaining either upon or near it illustration 71 mouth parts of tabanus we now come to that terror of our equine friends the horse fly gad or breeze fly in its larval state some species live in water and in damp places under stones and pieces of wood and others in the earth away from water where they feed on animal and probably on decaying matter mr b d walsh found an aquatic larva of this genus which within a short time devoured eleven water snails thus at this stage of existence this fly often so destructive even at times killing our horses is beneficial during the hotter parts of summer and when the sun is shining brightly thousands of these horse flies appear on our marshes and inland prairies there are many different kinds over one hundred species of the genus tabanus alone living in north america our most common species is the green head or tabanus lineola when about to bite it settles quietly down upon the hand face or foot it matters not which and thrusts its formidable lancetlike jaws deep into the flesh its bite is very painful as we can testify from personal experience we were told during the last summer that a horse which stood fastened to a tree in a field near the marshes at rowley mass was bitten to death by these green heads and it is known that horses and cattle are occasionally killed by their repeated harassing bites in cloudy weather they do not fly and they perish on the cool frosty nights of september the timb or tsetze fly is a species of this group of flies and while it does not attack man plagues to death and is said to poison by its bite the cattle in certain districts of the interior of africa thus almost barring out explorers on comparing the mouthparts of the horse fly fig 71 mouth of t lineola we have all the parts seen in the mosquito but greatly modified like the mosquito the females alone bite the male horse fly being harmless and frequenting flowers living upon their sweets the labrum lb mandibles m and maxill mx are short stiff and lancetlike and the maxillary palpi mp a the five terminal joints of the antenn are large stout and twojointed while the jaws both maxill and mandibles are thrust into the flesh the tongue l spreads around the tube thus formed by the lancets and pumps up the blood flowing from the wound by aid of the sucking stomach or crop being a sac appended to the throat other gad flies but much smaller though as annoying to us in woods and fields are the species of golden eyed flies chrysops which fly and buzz interminably about our ears often taking a sudden nip they plague cattle settling upon them and drawing their blood at their leisure illustration 72 carpet fly illustration 73 carpet worm we turn to a comparatively unknown insect which has occasionally excited some distrust in the minds of housekeepers it is the carpet fly scenopinus pallipes fig 72 which in the larva state is found under carpets on which it is said to feed the worm fig 73 has a long white cylindrical body divided into twelve segments exclusive of the head while the first eight abdominal segments are divided by a transverse suture so that there appear to be seventeen abdominal segments the sutures appearing too distinct in the cut mr f g sanborn has reared the fly here figured from the worm the larva also lives in rotten wood it is too scarce ever to prove very destructive in houses either this or a similar fly was once found we are told by a scientific friend in great numbers in a rat used in dressing a young ladys hair the worms were living upon the hair stuffing one of the most puzzling objects to the collector of shells or insects is the almost spherical larva of microdon globosus fig 74 it is flattened and smooth beneath and seems to adhere to the under side of stones where it might be mistaken for a snail the syrphus fly or aphis eater deserves more than the passing notice which we bestow upon it the maggot fig 75 in the act of devouring an aphis is to be sought for established in a group of plant lice aphis which it seizes by means of the long extensible front part of the body the adult fly fig 76 is gayly spotted and banded with yellow resembling closely a wasp it frequents flowers illustration 74 microdon illustration 75 syrphus larva 76 syrphus fly illustration 77 larva of rattailed fly 78 rattailed fly and its pupa the singular rattailed pupacase of eristalis fig 77 lives in water and when in want of air protrudes its long respiratory tube out into the air we present the figure of an allied fly merodon bardus fig 78 a puparium natural size we will not describe at length the fly as the admirable drawings of mr emerton cannot fail to render it easily recognizable the larva is much like the puparium or pupa case here figured which closely resembles that of eristalis in possessing along respiratory filament showing that the maggot undoubtedly lives in the water and when desirous of breathing protrudes the tube out of the water thus drawing in air enough to fill its internal respiratory tubes trache the merodon narcissa probably lives in the soil or in rotten wood as the pupacase has no respiratory tube having instead a very short sessile truncated tube scarcely as long as it is thick the case itself is cylindrical and rounded alike at each end illustration 79 human bot worm we now come to the bot flies which are among the most extraordinary in their habits of all insects the history of the bot flies is in brief thus the adult twowinged fly lays its eggs on the exterior of the animal to be infested they are conveyed into the interior of the host where they hatch and the worm or maggot lives by sucking in the purulent matter caused by the irritation set up by its presence in its host or else the worm itself after hatching bores under the skin when fully grown it quits the body and finishes its transformations to the flystate under ground many quadrupeds from mice squirrels and rabbits up to the ox horse and even the rhinoceros suffer from their attacks while man himself is not exempt the body of the adult fly is stout and hairy and it is easily recognized by having the opening of the mouth very small the mouthparts being very rudimentary the larv are in general thick fleshy footless grubs consisting of eleven segments exclusive of the head which are covered with rows of spines and tubercles by which they move about within the body thus irritating the animals in which they take up their abode the breathing pores stigmata open in a scaly plate at the posterior end of the body the mouthparts mandibles etc of the subcutaneous larv consist of fleshy tubercles while in those species which live in the stomachs and frontal sinuses of their host they are armed with horny hooks illustration 80 horse bot fly the larv attain their full size after moulting twice just before assuming the pupa state the maggot leaves its peculiar dwelling place descends into the ground and there becomes a pupa though retaining its larval skin which serves as a protection to it whence it is called a puparium several wellauthenticated instances are on record of a species of bot fly inhabiting the body of man in central and south america producing painful tumors under the skin of the arm legs and abdomen it is still under dispute whether this human bot fly is a true or accidental parasite the more probable opinion being that its proper host is the monkey or dog in cayenne this revolting grub is called the ver macaque fig 79 in para ura in costa rica torcel and in new granada gusano peludo or nuche the dermatobia noxialis supposed to be the ver moyocuil of the inhabitants of mexico and new granada lives beneath the skin of the dog illustration 81 bot fly of ox and larva illustration 82 sheep bot illustration 83 skin bot fly the bot fly of the horse gastrophilus equi fig 80 and larva is pale yellowish spotted with red with short grayish yellow hairs and the wings are banded with reddish she lays her eggs upon the knees of the horse they are conveyed into the stomach where the larva lives from may until october and when full grown are found hanging by their mouth hooks on the edge of the rectum of the horse whence they are carried out in the excrement the pupa state lasts for thirty or forty days and the perfect fly appears the next season from june until october the bot fly of the ox hypoderma bovis fig 81 and larva is black and densely hairy and the thorax is banded with yellow and white the larva is found during the month of may and also in summer living in tumors on the backs of cattle when fully grown which is generally in july they make their way out and fall to the ground and live in the pupacase from twentysix to thirty days the fly appearing from may until september it is found all over the world the oestrus ovis or sheep bot fly fig 82 larva is of a dirty ash color the abdomen is marbled with yellowish and white flecks and is hairy at the end this species of bot fly is larviparous ie the eggs are hatched within the body of the mother the larv being produced alive m f brauer of vienna the author of the most thorough work we have on these flies tells me that he knows of but one other bot fly a species of cephanomyia which produces living larv instead of eggs the eggs of certain other species of bot flies do not hatch until three or four days after they are laid the larv of the sheep bot fly live during april may and june in the frontal sinus of the sheep and also in the nasal cavity whence they fall to the ground when fully grown in twentyfour hours they change to pup and the flies appear during the summer we also figure the cuterebra buccata fig 83 a side view which resembles in the larval state the ox bot fly its habits are not known though the young of other species infest the opossum squirrel hare etc living in subcutaneous tumors illustration the banded lithacodes chapter vii the house fly and its allies illustration 84 mouthparts of the house fly the common house fly musca domestica scarcely needs an introduction to any one of our readers and its countenance is so well known that we need not present a portrait here but a study of the proboscis of the fly reveals a wonderful adaptability of the mouthparts of this insect to their uses we have already noticed the most perfect condition of these parts as seen in the horse fly in the proboscis of the house fly the hard parts are obsolete and instead we have a fleshy tongue like organ fig 84 bent up beneath the head when at rest the maxill are minute their palpi mp being singlejointed and the mandibles m are comparatively useless being very short and small compared with the lancetlike jaws of the mosquito or horse fly but the structure of the tongue itself labium l is most curious when the fly settles upon a lump of sugar or other sweet object it unbends its tongue extends it and the broad knoblike end divides into two broad flat muscular leaves l which thus present a suckerlike surface with which the fly laps up liquid sweets these two leaves are supported upon a framework of tracheal tubes in the cut given above mr emerton has faithfully represented these modified trach which end in hairs projecting externally thus the inside of this broad fleshy expansion is rough like a rasp and as newport states is easily employed by the insect in scraping or tearing delicate surfaces it is by means of this curious structure that the busy house fly occasions much mischief to the covers of our books by scraping off the albuminous polish and leaving tracings of its depredations in the soiled and spotted appearance which it occasions on them it is by means of these also that it teases us in the heat of summer when it alights on the hand or face to sip the perspiration as it exudes from and is condensed upon the skin illustration 85 larva a pupacase of house fly illustration 86 larva of flesh fly every one notices that house flies are most abundant around barns in august and september and it is in the ordure of stables that the early stages of this insect are passed no one has traced the transformations of this fly in our country but we copy from bouchs work on the transformations of insects the rather rude figures of the larva fig 85 and pupacase a of the musca domestica of europe which is supposed to be our species bouch states that the larva is cylindrical rounded posteriorly smooth and shining fleshy and yellowish white and four lines long the pupacase or puparium is dark reddishbrown and three lines in length it remains in the pupa state from eight to fourteen days in europe it is preyed upon by minute ichneumon flies chalcids the flesh fly musca csar or the bluebottle fly feeds upon decaying animal matter its larva fig 86 is long cylindrical the head being pointed and the body conical the posterior end being squarely docked the larva of a sarguslike form which feeds on offal transforms into a flattened pupacase fig 87 provided with long scattered hairs the house fly disappears in autumn at the approach of cold weather though a few individuals pass through the winter hibernating in houses and when the rooms are heated may often be seen flying on the windows other species fly early in march on warm days having hibernated under leaves and the bark of trees moss etc an allied species the m vomitoria is the meat fly closely allied are the parasitic species of tachina which live within the bodies of caterpillars and other insects and are among the most beneficial of insects as they prey on thousands of injurious caterpillars another fly of this muscid group the idia bigoti according to coquerel and mondiere produces in the natives of senegal hard red fluctuating tumors in which the larva resides illustration 87 larva of a sarguslike fly many of the smaller muscids mine leaves running galleries within the leaf or burrowing in seeds or under the bark of plants we have often noticed blisterlike swellings on the bark of the willow which are occasioned by a cylindrical short fleshy larva fig 88a much enlarged about a line in length which changes to a pupa within the old larval skin assuming the form here represented fig 88b and about the last of june changes to a small black fly fig 88 which baron osten sacken refers doubtfully to the genus loncha illustration 86 willow blister fly the apple midge frequently does great mischief to apples after they are gathered mr f g sanborn states that ninetenths of the apple crop in wrentham mass were destroyed by a fly supposed to be the molobrus mali or apple midge described by dr fitch the eggs were supposed to have been laid in fresh apples in the holes made by the coddling moth carpocapsa pomonella whence the larv penetrated into all parts of the apple working small cylindrical burrows about onesixteenth of an inch in diameter mr w c fish has also sent me from sandwich mass specimens of another kind of apple worm which he writes has been very common in barnstable county it attacks mostly the earlier varieties seeming to have a particular fondness for the old fashioned summer or hightop sweet the larv fig 89 a enter the fruit usually where it has been bored by the apple worm carpocapsa not uncommonly through the crescentlike puncture of the curculio and sometimes through the calyx when it has not been troubled by other insects many of them arrive at maturity in august and the fly soon appears successive generations of the maggots following until cold weather i have frequently found the pup in the bottom of barrels in a cellar in the winter and the flies appear in the spring in the early apples the larv work about in every direction if there be several in an apple they make it unfit for use apples that appear perfectly sound when taken from the tree will sometimes if kept be all alive with them in a few weeks baron osten sacken informs me that it is a drosophila the species of which live in putrescent vegetable matter especially fruits illustration 89 apple worm and its larva illustration 90 parent of the cheese maggot illustration 91 pupa case of winefly an allied fly is the parent of the cheese maggot the fly itself piophila casei fig 90 is black with metallic green reflections and the legs are dark and paler at the kneejoints the middle and hind pair of tarsi being dark honey yellow the wine fly is also a piophila and lives the life of a perpetual toper in old wine casks and partially emptied beer cider and wine bottles where with its pupacase fig 91 it may be found floating dead in its favorite beverage illustration 92 bird tick we now come to the more degraded forms of flies which live parasitically on various animals we figure from a specimen in the museum of the peabody academy of science the bird tick ornithomyia fig 92 which lives upon the great horned owl its body is much flattened adapted for its life under the feathers where it gorges itself with the blood of its host illustration 93 the horse tick here belongs also the horse tick hippobosca equina fig 93 it is about the size of the house fly being black with yellow spots on the thorax verrill4 says that it attacks by preference those parts where the hair is thinnest and the skin softest especially under the belly and between the hind legs its bite causes severe pain and will irritate the gentlest horses often rendering them almost unmanageable and causing them to kick dangerously when found they cling so firmly as to be removed with some difficulty and they are so tough as not to be readily crushed if one escapes when captured it will instantly return to the horse or perchance to the head of its captor where it is an undesirable guest another species sometimes infests the ox illustration 94 sheep tick illustration 95 bat tick in the wingless sheep tick melophagus ovinus fig 94 with the pupacase on the left the body is wingless and very hairy and the proboscis is very long the young are developed within the body of the parent until they attain the pupa state when she deposits the pupa case which is nearly half as large as her abdomen other genera are parasitic on bats among them are the singular spiderlike bat ticks nycteribia fig 95 which have small bodies and enormous legs and are either blind or provided with four simple eyes they are of small size being only a line or two in length such degraded forms of diptera have a remarkable resemblance to the spiders mites ticks etc the reader should compare the nycteribia with the young sixfooted moose tick figured farther on another spiderlike fly is the chionea valga fig 96 and 97 larva of the european species which is a degraded tipula the latter genus standing near the head of the diptera the chionea according to harris lives in its early stages in the ground like many other gnats and is found early in the spring sometimes crawling over the snow we have also figured and mentioned previously page 41 the bee louse braula another wingless spiderlike fly illustration 96 spider fly illustration 97 larva of spider fly the flea is also a wingless fly and is probably as has been suggested by an eminent entomologist as baron osten sacken informs us a degraded genus of the family to which mycetobia belongs its transformations are very unlike those of the fly ticks and agree closely with the early stages of mycetophila one of the tipulid family in its adult condition the flea combines the characters of the diptera with certain features of the grasshoppers and cockroaches and the bugs the body of the flea fig 98 greatly magnified a antenn b maxill and their palpi c d mandibles the latter with the labium which is not shown in the figure forming the acute beak is much compressed and there are minute wingpads instead of wings present in some species illustration 98 flea magnified illustration 99 larva of flea dr g a perkins of salem has succeeded in rearing in considerable numbers from the eggs the larv of this flea the larv fig 99 much enlarged a antenna b the terminal segments of the abdomen when hatched are half a line in length the body is long cylindrical and pure white with thirteen segments exclusive of the head and provided with rather long hairs it is very active in its movements and lives on blood clots remaining on unswept floors of outhouses or in the straw or bed of the animals they infest in six days after the eggs are laid the larv appear and in a few days after leaving the egg they mature spin a rude cocoon and change to pup and the perfect insects appear in about ten days a good authority states that the human flea does not exist in america we never saw a specimen in this country a practical point is how to rid dogs of fleas as a preventive measure we would suggest the frequent sweeping and cleansing of the floors of their kennels and renewing the straw or chips composing their bedschips being the best material for them to sleep upon flea afflicted dogs should be washed every few days in strong soapsuds or weak tobacco or petroleum water a writer in sciencegossip recommends the use of the persian insect destroyer one package of which suffices for a good sized dog the powder should be well rubbed in all over the skin or the dog if small can be put into a bag previously dusted with the powder in either case the dog should be washed soon after illustration 100 chique one of the most serious insect torments of the tropics of america is the sarcopsylla penetrans called by the natives the jigger chigoe bicho chique or pique fig 100 enlarged a gravid female natural size the female during the dry season bores into the feet of the natives the operation requiring but a quarter of an hour usually penetrating under the nails and lives there until her body becomes distended with eggs the hindbody swelling out to the size of a pea her presence often causes distressing sores the chigoe lays about sixty eggs depositing them in a sort of sac on each side of the external opening of the oviduct the young develop and feed upon the swollen body of the parent flea until they mature when they leave the body of their host and escape to the ground the best preventive is cleanliness and the constant wearing of shoes or slippers when in the house and of boots when out of doors illustration the willow gall fly chapter viii the borers of our shade trees in no way can the good taste and public spirit of our citizens be better shown than in the planting of shade trees regarded simply from a commercial point of view one cannot make a more paying investment than setting out an oak elm maple or other shade tree about his premises to a second generation it becomes a precious heirloom and the planter is duly held in remembrance for those finer qualities of heart and head and the wise forethought which prompted a deed simple and natural but a deed too often undone what an increased value does a fine avenue of shade trees give to real estate in a city and in the country the single stately elm rising gracefully and benignantly over the wayside cottage year after year like a guardian angel sending down its blessings of shade moisture and coolness in times of drought and shelter from the pitiless storm recalls the tenderest associations of generation after generation that go from the old homestead occasionally the tree or a number of them sicken and die or linger out a miserable existence and we naturally after failing to ascribe the cause to bad soil want of moisture or adverse atmospheric agencies conclude that the tree is infested with insects especially if the bark in certain places seems diseased often the disease is in streets lighted by gas attributed to the leakage of the gas such a case has come up recently at morristown new jersey an elm was killed by the elm borer compsidea tridentata and the owner was on the point of suing the gas company for the loss of the tree from the supposed leakage of a gas pipe while the matter was in dispute a gentleman of that city took the pains to peel off a piece of the bark and found as he wrote me great numbers of the larv of this beetle in the bark and between the bark and the wood while the latter is tattooed with sinuous grooves in every direction and the tree is completely girdled by them in some places there are three different sizes of the larv evidently one two and three years old or more properly six eighteen and thirty months old the tree had to be cut down dr harris in his treatise on injurious insects gives an account of the ravages of this insect which we quote on the 19th of june 1846 theophilus parsons esq sent me some fragments of bark and insects which were taken by mr j richardson from the decaying elms on boston common and among the insects i recognized a pair of these beetles in a living state the trees were found to have suffered terribly from the ravages of these insects several of them had already been cut down as past recovery others were in a dying state and nearly all of them were more or less affected with disease or premature decay their bark was perforated to the height of thirty feet from the ground with numerous holes through which insects had escaped and large pieces had become so loose by the undermining of the grubs as to yield to slight efforts and come off in flakes the inner bark was filled with burrows of the grubs great numbers of which in various stages of growth together with some in the pupa state were found therein and even the surface of the wood in many cases was furrowed with their irregular tracks very rarely did they seem to have penetrated far into the wood itself but their operations were mostly confined to the inner layers of the bark which thereby became loosened from the wood beneath the grubs rarely exceed threequarters of an inch in length they have no feet and they resemble the larv of other species of saperda except in being rather more flattened they appear to complete their transformations in the third year of their existence the beetles probably leave their holes in the bark during the month of june and in the beginning of july for in the course of thirty years i have repeatedly taken them at various dates from the fifth of june to the tenth of july it is evident from the nature and extent of their depredations that these insects have alarmingly hastened the decay of the elm trees on boston mall and common and that they now threaten their entire destruction other causes however have probably contributed to the same end it will be remembered that these trees have greatly suffered in past times from the ravages of cankerworms moreover the impenetrable state of the surface soil the exhausted condition of the subsoil and the deprivation of all benefit from the decomposition of accumulated leaves which in a state of nature the trees would have enjoyed but which a regard for neatness has industriously removed have doubtless had no small influence in diminishing the vigor of the trees and thus made them fall unresistingly a prey to insect devourers the plan of this work precludes a more full consideration of these and other topics connected with the growth and decay of these trees and i can only add that it may be prudent to cut down and burn all that are much infested by the borers illustration 101 elm tree beetle the threetoothed compsidea fig 101 is a rather flatbodied dark brown beetle with a rusty red curved line behind the eyes two stripes on the thorax and a threetoothed stripe on the outer edge of each wing cover it is about onehalf an inch in length illustration 102 elm tree borer the larva fig 102 is white subcylindrical a little flattened with the lateral fold of the body rather prominent the end of the body is flattened obtuse and nearly as wide at the end as at the first abdominal ring the head is onehalf as wide as the prothoracic ring being rather large the prothoracic ring or segment just behind the head is transversely oblong being twice as broad as long there is a pale dorsal corneous transversely oblong shield being about twothirds as long as wide and nearly as long as the four succeeding segments this plate is smooth except on the posterior half which is rough with the front edge irregular and not extending far down the sides fine hairs arise from the front edge and side of the plate and similar hairs are scattered over the body and especially around the end on the upper side of each segment is a transversely oblong ovate roughened area with the front edge slightly convex and the hinder slightly arcuate on the under side of each segment are similar rough horny plates but arcuate in front with the hinder edge straight it differs from the larva of the linden tree borer saperda vestita in the body being shorter broader more hairy with the tip of the abdomen flatter and more hairy the prothoracic segment is broader and flatter and the rough portion of the dorsal plates is larger and less tranversely ovate the structure of the head shows that its generic distinctness from saperda is well founded as the head is smaller and flatter the clypeus being twice as large and the labrum broad and short while in s vestita it is longer than broad the mandibles are much longer and slenderer and the antenn are much smaller than in s vestita illustration 103 linden tree beetle illustration 104 linden tree borer the linden tree borer fig 103 is a greenish snuffyellow beetle with six black spots near the middle of the back and it is about eighttenths of an inch in length though often smaller the beetles according to dr paul swift as quoted by dr harris were found in philadelphia upon the small branches and leaves on the 28th day of may and it is said that they come out as early as the first of the month and continue to make their way through the back of the trunk and large branches during the whole of the warm season they immediately fly into the top of the tree and there feed upon the epidermis of the tender twigs and the petioles of the leaves often wholly denuding the latter and causing the leaves to fall they deposit their eggs two or three in a place upon the trunk or branches especially about the forks making slight incisions or punctures for their reception with their strong jaws as many as ninety eggs have been taken from a single beetle the grubs fig 104 e a enlarged view of the head seen from above b the under view of the same c side view

that three years are required to mature the insect various expedients have been tried to arrest their course but without effect a stream thrown into the tops of trees from the hydrant is often used

the author for the use of this and the figures of the bot fly of the horse the turkey duck and hog louse the cattle tick the itch insect and mange insect of the horse chapter ix certain parasitic insects the subject of our discourse is not only a disagreeable but too often a painful one not only is the mere mention of the creatures name of which we are to speak tabooed and avoided by the refined and polite but the creature itself has become extinct and banished from the society of the good and respectable indeed under such happy auspices do a large proportion of the civilized world now live that their knowledge of the habits and form of a louse may be represented by a blank not so with some of their greatgreatgrandfathers and grandmothers if history sacred and profane poetry5 and the annals of literature testify aright for it is comparatively a recent fact in history that the louse has awakened to find himself an outcast and an alien among savage nations of all climes some of which have been dignified with the apt though high sounding name of phthiriophagi and among the chinese and other semicivilized peoples these lords of the soil still flourish with a luxuriance and rankness of growth that never diminishes so that we may say without exaggeration that certain mental traits and fleshly appetites induced by their consumption as an article of food may have been created while a separate niche in our anthropological museums is reserved for the instruments of warfare both offensive and defensive used by their phthiriophagous hunters then have we not in the very centres of civilization the poor and degraded which are most faithfully attended lay these revolting satellites but bantering aside there is no more engaging subject to the naturalist than that of animal parasites consider the great proportion of animals that gain their livelihood by stealing that of others while a large proportion of plants are more or less parasitic they gain thereby in interest to the botanist and many of them are eagerly sought as the choicest ornaments of our conservatories not so with their zological confrres all that is repulsive and uncanny is associated with them and those who study them though perhaps among the keenest intellects and most industrious observers speak of them without the limits of their own circle in subdued whispers or under a protest and their works fall under the eyes of the scantiest few but the study of animal parasites has opened up new fields of research all bearing most intimately on those two questions that ever incite the naturalist to the most laborious and untiring diligencewhat is life and its origin the subjects of the alternation of generations or parthenogenesis of embryology and biology owe their great advance in large degree to the study of such animals as are parasitic and the question whether the origin of species be due to creation by the action of secondary laws or not will be largely met and answered by the study of the varied metamorphoses and modes of growth the peculiar modification of organs that adapt them to their strange modes of life and the consequent variation in specific characters so remarkably characteristic of those animals living parasitically upon others6 with these considerations in view surely a serious thoughtful and thorough study of the louse in all its varieties and species is neither belittling nor degrading nor a waste of time we venture to say moreover that more light will be thrown on the classification and morphology of insects by the study of the parasitic species and other degraded wingless forms that do not always live parasitically especially of their embryology and changes after leaving the egg than by years of study of the more highly developed insects alone among hymenoptera the study of the minute ichueumons such as the proctotrupids and chalcids especially the eggparasites among moths the study of the wingless cankerworm moth and orgyla among diptera the flea bee louse sheep tick bat tick and other wingless flies among coleoptera the melo and singular stylops and xenos among neuroptera the snow insect boreus the podura fig 109 and lepisma and especially the hemipterous lice will throw a flood of light on these prime subjects in philosophical entomology illustration 109 podura without farther apology then and very dependent on the labors of others for our information we will say a few words on some interesting points in the natural history of lice in the first place how does the louse bite it is the general opinion among physicians supported by able entomologists that the louse has jaws and bites but while the bird lice mallophaga do have biting jaws whence the germans call them skineaters pelzfresser the mouth parts of the genus pediculus or true louse resemble in their structure those of the bedbug fig 110 and other hemiptera in its form the louse closely resembles the bedbug and the two groups of lice the pediculi and mallophaga should be considered as families of hemiptera though degraded and at the base of the hemipterous series the resemblance is carried out in the form of the egg the mode of growth of the embryo and the metamorphosis of the insect after leaving its egg illustration 110 bedbug schidte a danish entomologist has it seems to us forever settled the question as to whether the louse bites the flesh or sucks blood and decides a point interesting to physicians ie that the loathsome disease called phthiriasis is a nonentity from this source not only many living in poverty and squalor are said to have died but also men of renown among whom denny in his work on the anoplura or lice of great britain mentions the name of pheretima as recorded by herodotus antiochus epiphanes the dictator sylla the two herods the emperor maximian and phillip the second schidte in his essay on phthirius and on the structure of the mouth in pediculus annals and magazine of natural history 1866 page 213 says that these statements will not bear examination and that this disease should be placed on the retired list for such a malady is impossible to be produced by simply bloodsucking animals and that they are only the disgusting attendants on other diseases our author thus describes the mouth parts of the louse lice are no doubt to be regarded as bugs simplified in structure and lowered in animal life in accordance with their mode of living as parasites being small flattened apterous myopic crawling and climbing with a conical head moulded as it were to suit the rugosities of the surface they inhabit provided with a soft transversely furrowed skin probably endowed with an acute sense of feeling which can guide them in that twilight in which their mode of life places them the peculiar attenuation of the head in front of the antenn at once suggests to the practised eye the existence of a mouth adapted for suction this mouth differs from that of the hemiptera bedbug etc generally in the circumstance that the labium is capable of being retracted into the upper part of the head which therefore presents a little fold which is extended when the labium is protruded in order to strengthen this part a flat band of chitine is placed on the under surface just as the shoemaker puts a small piece of guttapercha into the back of an indiarubber shoe as however the chitine is not very elastic this band is rather thinner in the middle in order that it may bend and fold a little when the skin is not extended by the lower lip the latter consists as usual of two hard lateral pieces of which the fore ends are united by a membrane so that they form a tube of which the interior covering is a continuation of the elastic membrane in the top of the head inside its orifice there are a number of small hooks which assume different positions according to the degree of protrusion if this is at its highest point the orifice is turned inside out like a collar whereby the small hooks are directed backwards so that they can serve as barbs these are the movements which the animal executes after having first inserted the labium through a sweatpore when the hooks have got a firm hold the first pair of set the real mandibles transformed are protruded these are towards their points united by a membrane so as to form a closed tube from which again is inserted the second pair of set or maxill which in the same manner are transformed into a tube ending in four small lobes placed crosswise it follows that when the whole instrument is exserted we perceive a long membranous flexible tube hanging down from the labium and along the walls of this tube the setiform mandibles and maxill in the shape of long narrow bands of chitine in this way the tube of suction can be made longer or shorter as required and easily adjusted to the thickness of the skin in the particular place where the animal is sucking whereby access to the capillary system is secured at any part of the body it is apparent from the whole structure of the instrument that it is by no means calculated on being used as a sting but is rather to be compared to a delicate elastic probe in the use of which the terminal lobes probably serve as feelers as soon as the capillary system is reached the blood will at once ascend into the narrow tube after which the current is continued with increasing rapidity by means of the pulsation of the pumping ventricle and the powerful peristaltic movement of the digestive tube illustration7111 mouth of the louse if we compare the form of the louse fig 112 pediculus capitis the head louse fig 113 p vestimenti the body louse with the young bedbug as figured by westwood modern classification of insects iip 475 we shall see a very close resemblance the head of the young cimex being proportionally larger than in the adult while the thorax is smaller and the abdomen is more ovate less rounded moreover the body is white and partially transparent illustration 113 body louse illustration 112 head louse under a high power of the microscope specimens treated with diluted potash show that the mandibles and maxill arise near each other in the middle of the head opposite the eyes their bases slightly diverging thence they converge to the mouth over which they meet and beyond are free being hollow thin bands of chitine meeting like the maxill or tongue of butterflies to form a hollow tube for suction the mandibles each suddenly end in a curved slender filament which is probably used as a tactile organ to explore the best sites in the flesh of their victim for drawing blood on the other hand the maxill which are much narrower than the mandibles become rounded towards the end bristle like and tipped with numerous exceedingly fine barbs by which the bug anchors itself in the flesh while the blood is pumped through the mandibles the base of the large tubular labium or beak which ensheathes the mandibles and maxill is opposite the end of the clypeus or front edge of the upper side of the head and at a distance beyond the mouth equal to the breadth of the labium itself the labium which is divided into three joints becomes flattened towards the tip which is square and ends in two thin membranous lobes probably endowed with a slight sense of touch on comparing these parts with those of the louse it will be seen how much alike they are with the exception of the labium a very variable organ in the hemiptera from the long sucker of the pediculus to the stout chitinous jaws of the mallophaga or bird lice is a sudden transition but on comparing the rest of the head and body it will be seen that the distinction only amounts to a family one though burmeister placed the mallophaga among the orthoptera grasshoppers and crickets on account of the mandibles being adapted for biting it has been a common source of error to depend too much upon one or a single set of organs insects have been classified on characters drawn from the wings or the number of the joints of the tarsi or the form of the mouth parts we must take into account in endeavoring to ascertain the limits of natural groups as the internal anatomy and the embryology and metamorphosis of insects before we can hope to obtain a natural classification the family of bird lice is a very extensive one embracing many genera and several hundred species one or more species infest the skin of all our domestic and wild mammals and birds some birds sheltering beneath their feathers four or five species of lice before giving a hasty account of some of our more common species we will give a sketch of the embryological history of the lice with special reference to the structure of the mouth parts illustration 114 embryo of the louse illustration 115 mouth parts of the louse the eggs fig 114 egg of the head louse are long oval somewhat pearshaped with the hinder end somewhat pointed while the anterior end is flattened and bears little conical micropyles m minute orifices for the passage of the spermatozoa into the egg which vary in form in the different species and genera the opposite end of the egg is provided with a few bristles the female attaches her eggs to the hairs or feathers of her host illustration 116 mouth parts of the louse illustration 118 mouth parts of louse illustration 117 mouth parts of louse after the egg has been fertilized by the male the blastoderm or primitive skin forms and subsequently two layers or embryonal membranes appear the outer is called the amnion fig 114 am while the inner visceral membrane db partially wraps the rude form of the embryo in its folds the head vk of the embryo is now directed towards the end of the egg on which the hairs are situated afterwards the embryo revolves on its axis and the head lies next to the opposite end of the egg eight tubercles bud out from the under side of the head of which the foremost and longest are the antenn as those succeeding are the mandibles maxill and second maxill or labium behind them arise six long slender tubercles forming the legs and the primitive streak rudely marks the lower wall of the thorax and abdomen not yet formed figure 115 represents the head and mouth parts of the embryo of the same louse vk is the forehead or clypeus ant the antenn mad the mandibles max1 the first pair of maxill and max2 the

the same still farther advanced the mandibles mad are sharp and resemble the jaws of the mallophaga and the maxill max1 and labium max2 are still large while afterwards the labium becomes nearly obsolete figure 118 represents a front view of the mouth parts of a bird louse goniodes lb is the upper lip or labrum lying under the clypeus mad the mandibles max the maxill l the lyreformed piece and pl the plate illustration 119 louse of cow we will now describe some of the common species of lice found on a few of our domestic animals and the mallophagous parasites occurring on certain mammals and birds the family pediculina or true lice is higher than the bird lice their mouth parts as well as the structure of the head resembling the true hemiptera especially the bed bug the clypeus or front of the head is much smaller than in the bird lice the latter retaining the enlarged forehead of the embryo it being in some species half as large as the rest of the head all of our domestic mammals and birds are plagued by one or more species of lice figure 119 represents the hmatopinus vituli which is brownish in color as the specimen figured came from the burnett collection of the boston society of natural history together with those of the goat louse the louse of the common fowl and of the cat they are undoubtedly naturalized here quite a different species is the louse of the hog h suis fig 120 illustration 120 louse of hog the remaining parasites belong to the skinbiting lice or mallophaga and i will speak of the several genera referred to in their natural order beginning with the highest form and that which is nearest allied to pediculus illustration 121 louse of domestic fowl the common barnyard fowl is infested by a louse that we have called goniocotes burnettii fig 121 in honor of the late dr w i burnett a young and talented naturalist and physiologist who paid more attention than any one else in this country to the study of these parasites and made a large collection of them now in the museum of the boston society of natural history it differs from the g hologaster of europe which lives on the same bird in the short second joint of the antenn which are also stouter and in the long head the clypeus being much longer and more acutely rounded while the head is less hollowed out at the insertion of the antenn the abdomen is oval and onehalf as wide as long with transverse broad irregular bands along the edges of the segments the mandibles are short and straight two toothed the body is slightly yellowish and variously streaked and banded with pitchy black the duck is infested by a remarkably slender form fig 122 philopterus squalidus figure 123 represents the louse of the cat and another species fig 124 of the same genus trichodes lives upon the goat the most degraded genus is gyropus mr c cook has found gyropus ovalis of europe abundant on the guinea pig a species is also found on the porpoise an interesting fact as this is the only insect we know of that lives parasitically on any marine animal illustration 122 duck louse the genus goniodes fig 125 g stylifer the turkey louse is of great interest from a morphological and developmental point of view as the antenn are described and figured by denny as being in the males cheliform fig 126 a male b female the first joint being very large and thick the third considerably smaller recurved towards the first and forming a claw the fourth and fifth very small arising from the back of the third he farther remarks that the males of this which lives on the turkey and all the other species of goniodes use the first and third joints of the antenn with great facility acting the part of a finger and thumb the antenn of the females are of the ordinary form this handlike structure is so far as we know without a parallel among insects the antenn of the hemiptera being almost uniformly filiform and from two to ninejointed the design of this structure is probably to enable the male to grasp its consort and also perhaps to cling to the feathers and thus give it a superiority over the weaker sex in its advances towards courtship why is this advantage possessed by the males of this genus alone the world of insects and of animals generally abounds in such instances though existing in other organs and the developmentist dimly perceives in such departures from a normal type of structure the origin of new generic forms whether due at first to a seemingly accidental variation or as in this instance perhaps to long use as prehensile organs through successive generations of lice having the antenn slightly diverging from the typical condition until the present form has been developed another generation of naturalists will perhaps unanimously agree that the creator has thus worked through secondary laws which many of the naturalists of the present day are endeavoring in a truly scientific and honest spirit of inquiry to discover illustration 124 louse of the goat illustration 123 louse of the cat in their claw or leglike form these male antenn also repeat in the head the general form of the legs whose prehensile and grasping functions they assume we have seen above that the appendages of the head and thorax are alike in the embryo and the present case is an interesting example of the unity of type of the jointed appendages of insects and articulates generally illustration 120 antenn of goniodes another point of interest in these degraded insects is that the process of degradation begins either late in the life of the embryo or during the changes from the larval to the adult or winged state an instance of the latter may be observed in the wingless female of the canker worm so different from the winged male this difference is created after the larval stage for the caterpillars of both sexes are the same so far as we know so with numerous other examples among the moths in the louse the embryo late in its life resembles the embryos of other insects even corixa a member of a not remotely allied family but just before hatching the insect assumes its degraded louse physiognomy the developmentist would say that this process of degradation points to causes acting upon the insect just before or immediately after birth inducing the retrogression and retardation of development and would consider it as an argument for the evolution of specific forms by causes acting on the animal while battling with its fellows in the struggle for existence and perhaps consider that the metamorphoses of the animal within the egg are due to a reflex action of the modes of life of the ancestors of the animal on the embryos of its descendants illustration 125 the turkey louse footnotes footnote 5 ha whare ye gaun

interior of the tube chapter x the dragon fly were we to select from among the insects a type of all that is savage relentless and bloodthirsty the dragon fly would be our choice from the moment of its birth until its death usually a twelvemonth it riots in bloodshed and carnage living beneath the waters perhaps eleven months of its life in the larva and pupa states it is literally a walking pitfall for luckless aquatic insects but when transformed into a fly ever on the wing in pursuit of its prey it throws off all concealment and reveals the more unblushingly its rapacious character not only do its horrid visage and ferocious bearing frighten children who call it the devils darningneedle but it even distresses older persons so that its name has become a byword could we understand the language of insects what tales of horror would be revealed what traditions sagas fables and myths must adorn the annals of animal life regarding this dragon among insects to man however aside from its bad name and its repulsive aspect which its gay trappings do not conceal its whole life is beneficent it is a scavenger being like that class ugly and repulsive and holding literally among insects the lowest rank in society in the water it preys upon young mosquitoes and the larv of other noxious insects it thus aids in maintaining the balance of life and cleanses the swamps of miasmata thus purifying the air we breathe during its existence of three or four weeks above the waters its whole life is a continued good to man it hawks over pools and fields and through gardens decimating swarms of mosquitoes flies gnats and other baneful insects it is a true malthus delight and following that sanguinary philosopher we may believe that our dragon fly is an entomological tamerlane or napoleon sent into the world by a kind providence to prevent too close a jostling among the myriads of insect life we will then conquer our repugnance to its ugly looks and savage mien and contemplate the hideous monstrosityas it is useless to deny that it combines the graces of the hunchback of notre dame and dickens quilp with certain features of its ownfor the good it does in nature even among insects a class replete with forms the very incarnation of ugliness and the perfection of all that is hideous in nature our dragon fly is most conspicuous look at its enormous head with its beetling brows retreating face and heavy under jawsall eyes and teethand hung so loosely on its short weak neck sunk beneath its enormous hunchbackfor it is wofully roundshoulderedwhile its long thin legs shrunken as if from disease are drawn up beneath its breast and what a hobgoblin it is its gleaming wings are however beautiful objects they form a broad expanse of delicate parchmentlike membrane drawn over an intricate network of veins though the body is bulky it is yet light and easily sustained by the wings the long tail undoubtedly acts as a rudder to steady its flight these insects are almost universally dressed in the gayest colors the body is variously banded with rich shades of blue green and yellow and the wings give off the most beautiful iridescent and metallic reflections during july and august the various species of libellula and its allies most abound the eggs are attached loosely in bunches to the stems of rushes and other waterplants in laying them the dragon fly according to mr p r uhlers observations alights upon waterplants and pushing the end of her body below the surface of the water glues a bunch of eggs to the submerged stem or leaf libellula auripennis i have often seen laying eggs and i think i was not deceived in my observation that she dropped a bunch of eggs into the open ditch while balancing herself just a little way above the surface of the water i have also seen her settled upon the reeds in brackish water with her abdomen submerged in part and there attaching a cluster of eggs i feel pretty sure that l auripennis does not always deposit the whole of her eggs at one time as i have seen her attach a cluster of not more than a dozen small yellow eggs there must be more than one hundred eggs in one of the large bunches the eggs of some of the agrions are bright applegreen but i cannot be sure that i have ever seen them in the very act of oviposition they have curious habits of settling upon leaves and grass growing in the water and often allow their abdomens to fall below the surface of the water sometimes they fly against the surface but i never saw what i could assert to be the projecting of the eggs from the body upon plants or into the water the english entomologists assert that the female agrion goes below the surface to a depth of several inches to deposit eggs upon the submerged stems of plants the agrions however according to lucaze duthiers a french anatomist make with the ovipositor a little notch in the plant upon which they lay their eggs illustration 127 under side of head of diplax with the labium or mask fully extended x x xthe three subdivisions of the labium y the maxill or second pair of jaws these eggs soon hatch probably during the heat of summer the larva is very active in its habits being provided with six legs attached to the thorax on the back of which are the little wingpads or rudimentary wings the large head is provided with enormous eyes while a pair of simple minute eyelets ocelli are placed near the origin of the small bristlelike feelers or antenn seen from beneath instead of the formidable array of jaws and accessory organs commonly observed in most carnivorous larv we see nothing but a broad smooth mask covering the lower part of the face as if from sheer modesty our young dragon fly was endeavoring to conceal a gape but wait a moment some unwary insect comes within striking distance the battery of jaws is unmasked and opens upon the victim this mask fig 127 is peculiar to the young or larva and pupa of the dragon fly it is the labium or under lip greatly enlarged and armed at the broad spoonshaped extremity fig 127 x with two sharp hooks adapted for seizing and retaining its prey at rest the terminal half is so bent up as to conceal the face and thus the creature crawls about to all appearance the most innocent and lamblike of insects illustration 128 abdominal valves a side view not only does the immature dragon fly walk over the bottom of the pool or stream it inhabits but it can also leap for a considerable distance and by a most curious contrivance by a syringelike apparatus lodged in the end of the body it discharges a stream of water for a distance of two or three inches behind it thus propelling the insect forwards this apparatus combines the functions of locomotion and respiration there are as usual two breathing pores stigmata on each side of the thorax but the process of breathing seems to be mostly carried on in the tail the trache are here collected in a large mass sending their branches into folds of membrane lining the end of the alimentary canal and which act like a piston to force out the water the entrance to the canal is protected by three to five triangular horny valves fig 128 9 10 128 a side view which open and shut at will when open the water flows in bathing the internal gilllike organs which extract the air from the water which is then suddenly expelled by a strong muscular effort illustration 129 agrion b false gill of larva in the smaller forms such as agrion a saucium fig 129 fig 129 b side view of false gill showing but one leaf the respiratory leaves called the tracheary or falsegills are not enclosed within the body but form three broad leaves permeated by trache or airvessels they are not true gills however as the blood is not aerated in them they only absorb air to supply the trache which aerate the blood only within the general cavity of the body these false gills also act as a rudder to aid the insect in swimming it is interesting to watch the dragon flies through their transformations as they can easily be kept in aquaria little almost nothing is known regarding their habits and any one who can spend the necessary time and patience in rearing them so as to trace up the different stages from the larva to the adult fly and describe and figure them accurately will do good service to science illustration 130 pupa of cordulia mr uhler states that at present we know but little of the young stages of our species but the larva and pupa of the libellulas may be always known from the schnas by the shorter deeper and more robust form and generally by their thick clothing of hair figure 130 represents the pupa of cordulia lateralis and figure 131 that of a dragon fly referred doubtfully to the genus didymops for descriptions and figures of other forms the reader may turn to mr louis cabots essay on the immature state of the odonata published by the museum of comparative zoology at cambridge illustration 131 pupa of didymops the pupa scarcely differs from the larva except in having larger wingpads fig 132 it is still active and as much of a gourmand as ever when the insect is about to assume the pupa state it moults its skin the body having outgrown the larva skin by a strong muscular effort a rent opens along the back of the thorax and the insect having fastened its claws into some object at the bottom of the pool the pupa gradually works its way out of the larvaskin it is now considerably larger than before immediately after this tedious operation its body is soft but the crust soon hardens this change with most species probably occurs early in summer illustration 132 pupa of schna when about to change into the adult fly the pupa climbs up some plant near the surface of the water again its back yawns wide open and from the rent our dragon fly slowly emerges for an hour or more it remains torpid and listless with its flabby soft wings remaining motionless the fluids leave the surface the crust hardens and dries rich and varied tints appear and our dragon fly rises into its new world of light and sunshine a gorgeous but repulsive being tennyson thus describes these changes in the two voices today i saw the dragon fly come from the wells where he did lie an inner impulse rent the veil of his old husk from head to tail came out clear plates of sapphire mail he dried his wings like gauze they grew through crofts and pastures wet with dew a living flash of light he flew of our more common typical forms of dragon flies we figure a few commonly observed during the summer the threespotted dragon fly libellula trimaculata of which figure 133 represents the male is so called from the three dark clouds on the wings of the female but the opposite sex differs in having a dark patch at the front edge of the wings and a single broad cloud just beyond the middle of the wing libellula quadrimaculata the fourspotted dragon fly fig 134 is seen on the wing in june flying through dry pine woods far from any standing water illustration 133 libellula trimaculata male illustration 134 libellula quadrimaculata the largest of our dragon flies are the devils darningneedles eschna heros and grandis seen hawking about our gardens till dusk they frequently enter houses carrying dismay and terror among the children the hindbody is long and cylindrical and gaily colored with bright green and bluish bands and spots illustration 135 diplax berenice male illustration 136 diplax berenice female illustration 137 larva of diplax one of our most common dragon flies is the ruby dragon fly diplax rubicundula which is yellowishred it is seen everywhere flying over pools and also frequents dry sunny woods and glades another common form is diplax berenice fig 135 male fig 136 female the accompanying cut 137 represents the larva probably of this species according to mr uhler it is black the head blue in front spotted with yellow while the thorax and abdomen are striped with yellow there are fewer stripes on the body of the male which has only four large yellow spots on each side of the abdomen still another pretty species is diplax elisa fig 138 it is black with the head yellowish and with greenishyellow spots on the sides of the thorax and base of the abdomen there are three dusky spots on the front edge of each wing and a large cloud at the base of the hind pair towards the hind angles of the wing rather a rare form and of much smaller stature is the nannophya bella fig 138 female it was first detected in baltimore and we afterwards found it not unfrequently by a pond in maine its abdomen is unusually short and the reticulations of the wings are large and simple the female is black while the male is frosted over with a whitish powder many more species of this family are found in this country and for descriptions of them we would refer the reader to dr hagens synopsis of the neuroptera of north america published by the smithsonian institution illustration 138 diplax elisa illustration 139 nannophya bella illustration 140 may fly the libellulid or family of dragon flies and the ephemerid or may flies fig 140 are the most characteristic of the neuroptera or veinywinged insects this group is a most interesting one to the systematist as it is composed of so many heterogeneous forms which it is almost impossible to classify in our rigid and at present necessarily artificial systems we divide them into families and subfamilies genera and subgenera species and varieties but there is an endless shifting of characters in these groups the different groups would seem well limited after studying certain forms when to the systematists sorrow here comes a creature perhaps mimicking an ant or aphis or other sort of bug or even a butterfly and for which they would be readily mistaken by the uninitiated bibliographers have gone mad over books that could not be classified imagine the despair of an insecthunter and entomophile as he sits down to his box of dried neuroptera he seeks for a true neuropter in the white ant before him but its very form and habits summon up a swarm of true ants and then the little wingless book louse atropos fig 141 scampering irreverently over the musty pages of his systema natur reminds him of that closest friend of manpediculus vestimenti again his studies lead him to that gorgeous inhabitant of the south the butterflylike ascalaphus with its resplendent wings and slender knobbed antenn so much like those of butterflies and visions of these beautiful insects fill his minds eye or sundry duncolored caddis flies modest delicate neuroptera with finely fringed wings and slender feelers create doubts as to whether they are not really allies of the clothes moth so close is the resemblance

discovered and at last disgusted with the stiff and arbitrary systems of our booksa disgust we confess most wholesome if it only leads him into a closer communion with nature the sooner one leaves

habits of the closest observation and most patient reflectionbe he painter or poet philosopher or insecthunter of low degree he will gain an intellectual strength and power of interpreting nature that is the gift of true genius illustration the ant lion and adult chapter xi mites and ticks but few naturalists have busied themselves with the study of mites the honored names of hermann von heyden dugs dujardin and pagenstecher nicolet koch and robin and the lamented claparde of geneva lead the small number who have published papers in scientific journals after these and except an occasional note by an amateur microscopist who occasionally pauses from his diatomaniacal studies and looks upon a mite simply as a microscopic object to be classed in his micrographic vade mecum with mounted specimens of sheeps wool and the hairs of other quadrupeds a distorted proboscis of a fly and podura scales we read but little of mites and their habits but few readers of our natural history textbooks learn from their pages any definite facts regarding the affinities of these humble creatures their organization and the singular metamorphosis a few have been known to pass through we shall only attempt in the present article to indicate a few of the typical forms of mites and sketch with too slight a knowledge to speak with much authority an imperfect picture of their appearance and modes of living mites are lowly organized arachnids this order of insects is divided into the spiders the scorpions the harvestmen and the mites acarina they have a rounded oval body without the usual division between the headthorax and abdomen observable in spiders the headthorax and abdomen being merged in a single mass there are four pairs of legs and the mouth parts consist as seen in the adjoining figure of a young tick fig 142 young ixodes albipictus of a pair of maxill c which in the adult terminates in a two or threejointed palpus or feeler a pair of mandibles b often covered with several rows of fine teeth and ending in three or four larger hooks and a serrated labium a these parts form a beak which the mite or tick insinuates into the flesh of its host upon the blood of which it subsists while many of the mites are parasitic on animals some are known to devour the eggs of insects and other mites thrusting their beaks into the egg and sucking the contents we have seen a mite nothrus ovivorus fig 143 busily engaged in destroying the eggs of a moth like that of the canker worm and dr shimer has observed the acarus malus sucking the eggs of the chinch bug i have also observed another mite devouring the aphides on the rose leaves in my garden so that a few mites may be set down as beneficial to vegetation while a few species are injurious to man the larger part are beneficial being either parasitic and baneful to other noxious animals or more directly useful as scavengers removing decaying animal and vegetable substances illustration 142 ixodes albipictus and young8 the transformations of the mites are interesting to the philosophic zoologist since the young of certain forms are remarkably different from the adults and in reaching the perfect state the mite passes through a metamorphosis more striking than that of many insects the young on leaving the egg have six legs as we have seen in the case of the ixodes sometimes however as for example in the larva as we may call it of a european mite typhlodromus pyri the adult of which according to a scheuten is allied to acarus and lives under the epidermis of the leaves of the pear in europe while mr t taylor of the department of agriculture at washington has found a species in the pear leaves about washington and still another form in peach leaves there are but two pairs of legs present and the body is long cylindrical and in a degree wormlike i have had the good fortune to observe the different stages of a bird mite intermediate in its form between the acarus and sarcoptes or itch mite on march 6th mr c cooke called my attention to certain little mites which were situated on the narrow groove between the main stem of the barb and the outer edge of the barbules of the feathers of the downy woodpecker and subsequently we found the other forms in the down under the feathers these long wormlike mites were evidently the young of a singular sarcopteslike mite as they were found on the same specimen of woodpecker at about the same date and it is known that the growth of mites is rapid the metamorphoses judging by the information which we now possess occupying usually but a few days illustration 143 eggeating mite the young though there is probably a still earlier hexapodous stage of this sarcoptid has an elongated oblong flattened body with four short legs provided with a few bristlelike hairs and ending in a stalked sucker by aid of which the mite is enabled to walk over smooth hard surfaces the body is square at the end with a slight median indentation and four long bristles of equal length they remained motionless in the groove on the barb of the feather and when removed seemed very inert and sluggish a succeeding stage of this mite which may be called the pupal is considerably smaller than the larva and looks somewhat like the adult the body having become shorter and broader the adult is a most singular form its body being rudely ovate with the head sunken between the fore legs which are considerably smaller than the second pair while the third pair are twice as large as the second pair and directed backwards and the fourth pair are very small not reaching the extremity of the body which is deeply cleft and supports four long bristles on each side of the cleft while other bristles are attached to the legs and body giving the creature originally illshapen a haggard unkempt appearance the two stigmata or breathing pores open near the cleft in the end of the body and the external opening of the oviduct is situated between the largest and third pair of legs no males were observed in a species of acarus tyroglyphus somewhat like the cheese mite which we have alive at the time of writing in a box containing the remains of a lucanus larva which they seem to have consumed as both young and old are swarming there by myriads the young are oval and like the adults except that they are sixlegged the fourth pair growing out after a succeeding moult such is a brief summary of what has been generally known regarding the metamorphoses of a few species of mites in a few kinds no males have been found the females have been isolated after being hatched and yet have been known to lay eggs which produced young without the interposition of the males this parthenogenesis has been noticed in several species illustration 144 cheyletus these insects often suddenly appear in vast numbers on various articles of food and about houses so as to be very annoying mr j j h gregory of marblehead mass has found a mite allied to the european species here figured fig 144 very injurious to the seeds of the cabbage which it sucked dry this is an interesting form and we have called it cheyletus seminivorus it is of medium size and especially noticeable from the tripartite palpi which are divided into an outer long curved clawlike lobe with two rounded teeth at the base and two inner slender lobes pectinated on the inner side the third innermost lobe being minute the beak terminates in a sharp bladelike point we have received a cheyletuslike mite said to have been extracted from the human face in new orleans the body is oblong square behind the head is long and pointed while the maxill end in a long curved toothed sicklelike blade that this creature has the habits of the itch mite is suggested by the curious large hairlike spines with which the body and legs are sparsely armed some being nearly half as long as the body these hairs are covered with very fine spinules those on the end of the body are regularly spoonshaped these strange hairs which are thickest on the legs probably assisted the mite in anchoring itself in the skin of its host we have read no account of this strange and interesting form it is allied to the acaropsis mericourti which lives in the human face a species apparently of the genus gamasus according to dr leidy has been found living in the ear at the bottom of the external auditory meatus and attached to the membrana tympani of steers whether this mite is a true parasite of the ear of the living ox or whether it obtained access to the position in which it was found after the death of the ox in the slaughter house has not yet been determined we will now give a hasty glance at the different groups of mites pausing to note those most interesting from their habits or relation to man the most highly organized mite and by its structure most closely allied to the spider is the little red garden mite belonging to the genus trombidium to which the genus tetranychus is also nearly related our own species of the former genus have not been worked up or in other words identified and described so that whether the european t holosericeum linn is our species or not we cannot tell the larv of this and similar species are known to live parasitically upon harvestmen phalangium often called daddylonglegs and upon aphides grasshoppers and other insects mr riley has made known to us through the american naturalist and from his account our information is taken the habits of certain young of the garden mite trombidium which are excessively annoying in the southwestern states the first is the leptus americanus fig 145 or american harvest mite it is only known as yet in the larval or leptus state when it is of the form indicated in the cut and brick red in color this species is barely visible with the naked eye moves readily and is found more frequently upon children than upon adults it lives mostly on the scalp and under the arm pits but is frequently found on the other parts of the body it does not bury itself in the flesh but simply insinuates the anterior part of the body just under the skin thereby causing intense irritation followed by a little red pimple as with our common ticks the irritation lasts only while the animal is securing itself and its presence would afterwards scarcely be noticed but for the pimple which results illustration 145 a american harvest mite b irritating harvest mite the dots underneath indicating the natural size the second species fig 145 b leptus irritans is also only known in the leptus stage it is evidently the larva of a distinct genus from the other form having enormous maxill and a broad body it is also brick red mr riley says that this is the most troublesome and perhaps best known of the two causing intense irritation and swelling on all parts of the body but more especially on the legs and around the ankles woe betide the person who after bathing in the mississippi anywhere in this latitude is lured to some green dressingspot of weeds or grass he may for the time consider himself fortunate in getting rid of mud and dirt but he will afterwards find to his sorrow that he exchanged them for something far more tenacious in these microscopic harvestmites if he has obtained a good supply of them he will in a few hours begin to suffer from severe itching and for the next two or three days will be likely to scratch until his limbs are sore with the strong mandibles and the elbowed maxill which act like arms this mite is able to bury itself completely in the flesh thereby causing a red swelling with a pale pustulous centre containing watery matter if in scratching he is fortunate enough to remove the mite before it enters the part soon heals but otherwise the irritation lasts for two three or four days the pustulous centre reappearing as often as it is broken the animal itself on account of its minute size is seldom seen and the uninitiated when first troubled with it are often alarmed at the symptoms and at a loss to account for them fortunately these little plagues never attach themselves to persons in such immense numbers as do sometimes young or socalled seed ticks but i have known cases where from the irritation and consequent scratching the flesh had the appearance of being covered with ulcers and in some localities where these pests most abound sulphur is often sprinkled during jigger season in the boots or shoes as a protection sulphur ointment is the best remedy against the effects of either of these mites though when that cannot be obtained saleratus water and salt water will partially allay the irritation the normal food of either must apparently consist of the juices of plants and the love of blood proves ruinous to those individuals who get a chance to indulge it for unlike the true jigger the female of which deposits eggs in the wound she makes these harvestmites have no object of the kind and when not killed by the hands of those they torment they soon die victims to their sanguinary appetite illustration 146 astoma of the fly another leptuslike form is the parasite of the fly described by mr riley under the name of astoma muscarum fig 146 how nearly allied it is to the european astoma parasiticum we have not the means of judging the european tetranychus telarius linn or webmaking mite spins large webs on the leaves of the linden tree then succeed in the natural order the water mites hydrachna which may be seen running over submerged sticks and on plants mostly in fresh water and rarely on the borders of the sea the young after leaving the egg differ remarkably from the adults so as to have been referred to a distinct genus achlysia by the great french naturalist audouin they live as parasites on various water insects such as dytiscus nepa and hydrometra and when mature live free in the water though von baer observed an adult hydrachna concharum living parasitically on the gills of the freshwater mussel anodon the species are of minute size collectors of beetles often meet with a species of uropoda attached firmly to their specimens of dunginhabiting or carrion beetles it is a smoothly polished round flattened mite with short thick legs scarcely reaching beyond the body illustration 147 cattle tick we now come to the ticks which comprise the largest mites the genus argas closely resembles ixodes gerstaecker states that the argas persicus is very annoying to travellers in persia the habits of the wood ticks ixodes are well known travellers in the tropics speak of the intolerable torment occasioned by these pests which occurring ordinarily on shrubs and trees attach themselves to all sorts of reptiles beasts and cattle and even man himself as he passes by within their reach sometimes cases fall within the practice of the physician who is called to remove the tick which is found sometimes literally buried beneath the skin mr j stauffer writes me that on june 23d the daughter of abraham jackson colored playing among the leaves in a wood near springville lancaster county penn on her return home complained of pain in the arm no attention was paid to it till the next day when a raised tumor was noticed a small portion protruding through the skin apparently like a splinter of wood the child was taken to dr morency who applied the forceps and after considerable pain to the child and labor to himself extracted a species of ixodes nearly onequarter of an inch long and of an oval form and brown mahogany color with a metallic spot like silver bronze centrally on the dorsal region this tick proved from mr stauffers figures to be without doubt ixodes unipunctata it has also been found in massachusetts by mr f g sanborn another species is the ixodes bovis fig 147 the common cattle tick of the western states and central america it is very annoying to horned cattle gorging itself with their blood but is by no means confined to them alone as it lives indifferently upon the rattlesnake the iguana small mammals and undoubtedly any other animal that brushes by its lurkingplace in the forest it is a reddish coriaceous flattened seedlike creature with the body oblong oval and contracted just behind the middle when fully grown it measures from a quarter to half an inch in length we have received it from missouri at the hands of mr riley and mr j a mcniel has found it very abundantly on horned cattle on the western coast of nicaragua we now come to the genus acarus tyroglyphus of which the cheese and sugar mites are examples some species of acarian mites have been found in the lungs and bloodvessels and even the intestinal canal of certain vertebrates while the too familiar itch insect lurks under the skin of the hand and other parts of the body of certain uncleanly human bipeds illustration 148 sugar mite many people have been startled by statements in newspapers and more authoritative sources as to the immense numbers of mites acarus sacchari fig 148 found in unrefined or raw sugar according to prof cameron of dublin as quoted in the journal of the franklin institute for november 1868 dr hassel who was the first to notice their general occurrence in the raw sugar sold at london found them in a living state in no fewer than sixtynine out of seventytwo samples he did not detect them in a single specimen of refined sugar in an inferior sample of raw sugar examined in dublin by mr cameron he reports finding five hundred mites in ten grains of sugar so that in a pounds weight occurred one hundred thousand of these little creatures which seem to have devoted themselves with a martyrlike zeal to the adulteration of sugar they appear as white specks in the sugar the disease known as grocers itch is undoubtedly due to the presence of this mite which like its ally the sarcoptes works its way under the skin of the hand in this case however of cleanly persons mr cameron states that the kind of sugar which is both healthful and economical is the dry largegrained and lightcolored variety closely allied to the preceding is the cheese mite acarus siro linn which often abounds in newly made cheese lyonet states that during summer this mite is viviparous acarus farin degeer as its name indicates is found in flour other species have been known to occur in ulcers illustration 149 mange mite we should also mention the mange insect of the horse psoroptes equi fig 149 much enlarged a head more magnified according to prof verrill it is readily visible to the naked eye and swarms on horses afflicted with the mange which is a disease analogous to the itch in man it has a soft depressed body spiny beneath at the base of the legs and on the thorax one or both of the two posterior pairs of feet bear suckers and all are more or less covered with long slender hairs this insect may be destroyed by the same remedies as are used for lice and for the human itch the best remedy is probably a solution of sulphuret of potassium illustration 150 itch mite illustration 151 nose mite the itch insect sarcoptes scabiei fig 150 was first recognized by an arabian author of the twelfth century as the cause of the disease which results from its attacks the body of the insect is rounded with the two hind pair of feet rudimentary and bearing long hairs it buries itself in the skin on the more protected parts of the body and by its punctures maintains a constant irritation other species are known to infest the sheep and dog another singular mite is the demodex folliculorum fig 151 which was discovered by dr simon of berlin buried in the diseased follicles of the wings of the nose in man it is a long slender wormlike form with eight short legs and in the larva state has six legs this singular form is one of the lowest and most degraded of the order of arachnids a most singular mite was discovered by newport on the body of a larva of a wild bee and described by him under the name of heteropus ventricosus the body of the fully formed female is long and slender after attaining this form its small abdomen begins to enlarge until it assumes a globular form and the mass of mites look like little beads mr newport was unable to discover the male and thought that this mite was parthenogenous it will be seen that the adult demodex retains the elongated wormlike appearance of the larva of the higher mites such as typhlodromus this is an indication of its low rank and hints of a relationship to the tardigrades and the pentastoma the latter being a degraded mite and the lowest of its order living parasitically within the bodies of other animals illustration harvestman footnotes footnote 8 the figure at the bottom on the left represents the adult fullygorged tick chapter xii bristletails and springtails the thysanura as the poduras and their allies the lepismas are called have been generally neglected by entomologists and but few naturalists have paid special attention to them9 of all those microscopists who have examined podura scales as test objects we wonder how many really know what a podura is in preparing the following account i have been under constant indebtedness to the admirable and exhaustive papers of sir john lubbock in the london linnan transactions vols 23 26 and 27 entomologists will be glad to learn that he is shortly going to press with a volume on the poduras which in distinction from the lepismas to which he restricts the term thysanura he calls collembola in allusion to the suckerlike tubercle situated on the under side of the body which no other insects are known to possess the group of bristletails as we would dub the lepismas in distinction from the springtails we will first consider they are abundant in the middle states under stones and leaves in forests and northward are common in damp houses while one beautiful species that we have never noticed elsewhere is our cricket on the hearth abounding in the chinks and crannies of the range of our house and also in closets where it feeds on sugar etc and comes out like cockroaches at night shunning the light like the cockroaches which it vaguely resembles in form this species loves hot and dry localities in distinction from the others which seek moisture as well as darkness by some they are called silver witches and as they dart off when disturbed like a streak of light their bodies being coated in a suit of shining mail which the arrangement of the scales resembles they have really a weird and ghostly look the most complicated genus and the one which stands at the head of the family is machilis one species of which lives in the northern and middle states and another in oregon they affect damp places living under leaves and stones they all have rounded highly arched bodies and large compound eyes the two being united together the maxillary palpi are greatly developed but the chief characteristics are the twojointed stylets arranged in nine pairs along each side of the abdomen reminding us of the abdominal legs of myriopods the body ends in three long bristles as in lepisma the lepisma saccharina of linnus if as is probable that is the name of our common species is not uncommon in old damp houses where it has the habits of the cockroach eating cloths tapestry silken trimmings of furniture and doing occasional damage to libraries by devouring the paste and eating holes in the leaves and covers of books in general form lepisma may be compared to the larva of perla a netveined neuropterous insect and also to the narrowbodied species of cockroaches minus the wings the body is long and narrow covered with rather coarse scales and ends in three many jointed anal stylets or bristles which closely resemble the many jointed antenn which are remarkably long and slender the thermophilous species already alluded to may be described as perhaps the type of the genus the l saccharina being simpler in its structure the body is narrow and flattened the basal joints of the legs being broad flat and almost triangular like the same joints in the cockroaches the legs consist of six joints the tarsal joints being large and two in number and bearing a pair of terminal curved claws the three thoracic segments are of nearly equal size and the eight abdominal segments are also of similar size the trache are well developed and may be readily seen in the legs the end of the rather long and weak abdomen is propped up by two or three pairs of bristles which are simple not jointed but moving freely at their insertion thus they take the place of legs and remind one of the abdominal legs of the myriopods and we shall see in certain other genera machilis and campodea of the bristletails that there are actually twojointed bristles arranged in pairs along the abdomen they may probably be directly compared with the abdominal legs of myriopods further study however of the homologies of these peculiar appendages and especially a knowledge of the embryological development of lepisma and machilis is needed before this interesting point can be definitely settled the three many jointed anal stylets may however be directly compared with the similar appendages of perla and ephemera the mode of insertion of the antenn of this family is much like that of the myriopods the front of the head being flattened and concealing the base of the antenn as in the centipedes and pauropus indeed the head of any thysanurous insect seen from above bears a general resemblance in some of its features to that of the centipede and its allies so in a less degree does the head of the larv of certain neuroptera and coleoptera the eyes are compound the single facets forming a sort of heap the clypeus and labrum or upper lip is in all the thysanura carried far down on the under side of the head the clypeus being almost obsolete in the podurid this being one of the most essential characters of that family indeed it is somewhat singular that these and other important characteristics of this group have been almost entirely passed over by authors who have consequently separated these insects from other groups on what appear to the writer as comparatively slight and inconsiderable characters the mouthparts of the lepismatid especially the thermophilous lepisma which we now describe are most readily compared with those of the larva of perla the rather large stout mandibles are concealed at their tips under the upper lip which moves freely up and down when the creature opens its mouth the mandible is about onethird as broad as long armed with three sharp teeth on the outer edge and with a broad cutting edge within and still further inwards a lot of straggling spinules in all these particulars the mandible of lepisma is comparable with that of certain coleoptera and neuroptera so also are the maxill and labium though we are not aware that any one has indicated how close the homology is the accompanying figure 152 of the maxilla of a beetle may serve as an example of the maxilla of the coleoptera orthoptera and neuroptera in these insects it consists almost invariably of three lobes the outer being the palpus the middle lobe the galea and the innermost the lacinia the latter undergoing the greatest modifications forming a comb composed of spines and hairs varying greatly in relative size and length how much the palpi vary in these groups of insects is well known the galea sometimes forms a palpuslike appendage now these three lobes may be easily distinguished in the maxilla of lepisma the palpus instead of being directed forward as in the insects mentioned above in the pupa of ephemera the maxilla is much like that of lepisma is inserted nearer the base than usual and thrown off at right angles to the maxilla so that it is stretched out like a leg and in moving about the insect uses its maxill partly as supports for its head they are very long and large and five or sixjointed the galea or middle division forms a simple lobe while the lacinia has two large chitinous teeth on the inner edge and internally four or five hairs arising from a thin edge illustration 152 maxilla the labium is much as in that of perla being broad and short with a distinct median suture indicating its former separation in embryonic life into a pair of appendages the labial palpi are threejointed the joints being broad and in life directed backwards instead of forwards as in the higher insects there are five american species of the genus lepisma in the museum of the peabody academy besides the common l saccharina there are four undescribed species one found about outhouses and cellars and the heatloving form perhaps an imported species found in a kitchen in salem and apparently allied to the l thermophila lucas of houses in brest france and lastly two allied forms one from key west and another from polvon western nicaragua collected by mr mcniel the last three species are beautifully ornamented with finely spinulated hairs arranged in tufts on the head while the sides of the body and edges of the basal joints of the legs are fringed with them the interesting genus nicoletia stands at the bottom of the group it has the long linear scaleless body of campodea in the family below but the head and its appendages are like lepisma the maxillary palpi being fivejointed and the labial palpi fourjointed the eyes are simple arranged in a row of seven on each side of the head the abdomen ends in three long and many jointed stylets and there are the usual false branchial feet along each side of the abdomen there are two european species which occur in greenhouses no species have yet been found in america illustration 153 japyx solifugus the next family of thysanura is the campode comprising the two genera campodea and japyx these insects are much smaller than the lepismid and in some respects are intermediate between that family and the podurid including the smynthurid in this family the body is long and slender and the segments much alike in size there is a pair of spiracles on each thoracic ring the mandibles are long and slender ending in three or four teeth and with the other appendages of the mouth are concealed within the head only the tips of the palpi and of the maxill when these are opened projecting a very little beyond the rounded entire margin of the epistoma according to haliday the maxill are combshaped due to the four slender minutely ciliated spines placed within the outer tooth the labium in japyx is fourlobed and bears a small twojointed palpus the legs are fivejointed the tarsi consisting of a single joint ending in two large claws the abdomen consists of ten segments and in campodea along each side is a series of minute twojointed appendages such as have been described in machilis these are wanting in japyx none of the species in this family have the body covered with scales they are white with a yellowish tinge the more complicated genus of the two is japyx fig 153 japyx solifugus found under stones in southern europe a the mouth from beneath with the maxill open b maxilla d mandible c outline of front of head seen from beneath with the labial palpi in position which as remarked by the late mr haliday who has published an elaborate essay on this genus in the linnan transactions vol 24 1864 resembles forficula in the large forceps attached to its tail an american species j saussurii lives in mexico and we look for its discovery in texas illustration 154 campodea staphylinus campodea c staphylinus westw fig 154 enlarged a mandible b maxilla otherwise closely related has more rudimentary mouthparts and the abdomen ends in two many jointed appendages illustration fig 155 larva of perla our common american species of campodea c americana lives under stones in damp places it is yellowish about a sixth of an inch in length is very agile in its movements and would easily be mistaken for a very young lithobius a larger species and differing in having longer antenn has been found by mr c cooke in mammoth cave and has been described in the american naturalist under the name of campodea cookei haliday has remarked that this family bears much resemblance to the neuropterous larva of perla fig 155 as previously remarked by gervais and the many points of resemblance of this family and the lepismid to the larval forms of some neuroptera that are active in the pupa state the pseudoneuroptera of erichson and other authors are very striking campodea resembles the earliest larval form of chloon as figured by sir john lubbock even to the single jointed tarsus and why these two thysanurous families should be removed from the neuroptera we are unable at present to understand as to our mind they scarcely diverge from the neuropterous type more than the mallophaga or biting lice from the type of hemiptera haliday remarking on the opinion of linnus and schrank who referred campodea to the old genus podura says with much truth it may be perhaps no unfair inference to draw that the insect in question is in some measure intermediate between both i e podura and lepisma this is seen especially in the mouthparts which are withdrawn into the head and become very rudimentary affording a gradual passage into the mouthparts of the podurid which we now describe the next group the podurelles of nicolet and collembola of lubbock are considered by the latter who has studied them with far more care than any one else as less closely allied to the lepismid than has hitherto been supposed he says the presence of trache the structure of the mouth and the abdominal appendage all indicate a wide distinction between the lepismid and the podurid we must indeed in my opinion separate them entirely from one another and i would venture to propose for the group comprised in the old genus podura the term collembola as indicating the existence of a projection or mammilla enabling the creature to attach or glue itself to the body on which it stands then without expressing his views as to the position and affinities of the lepismid he remarks as the upshot of all this then while the collembola are clearly more nearly allied to the insecta than to the crustacea or arachnida we cannot i think regard them as orthoptera or neuroptera or even as true insects that is to say the coleoptera orthoptera neuroptera lepidoptera etc are in my opinion more nearly allied to one another than they are to the podurid or smynthurid on the other hand we certainly cannot regard the collembola as a group equivalent in value to the insecta if then we attempt to map out the articulata we must i think regard the crustacea and insecta as continents the myriopoda and collembola as islandsof less importance but still detached or if we represent the divisions of the articulata like the branching of a tree we must picture the collembola as a separate branch though a small one and much more closely connected with the insecta than with the crustacea or the arachnida lamarck regarded them as more nearly allied to the crustacea than insecta gervais also in the histoire naturelle des insectes aptres indicates a considerable diversity existing between the lepismid and podurid though they are placed next to each other somewhat similar views have been expressed by so high an authority as professor dana who in the american journal of science vol 37 jan 1864 proposed a classification of insects based on the principle of cephalization and divided the hexapodous insects into three groups the first pteroprosthenics or ctenopters comprising the hymenoptera diptera aphaniptera fleas lepidoptera homoptera trichoptera and neuroptera the second group pterometasthenics or elytropters comprising the coleoptera hemiptera and orthoptera while the thysanura compose the third group lubbock has given us a convenient historical view of the opinions of different authors regarding the classification of these insects which we find useful nicolet the naturalist who previous to lubbock has given us the most correct and complete account of the thysanura regarded them as an order equivalent to the coleoptera or diptera for example in this he followed latreille who established the order in 1796 the abb bourlet adopted the same view on the other hand burmeister placed the thysanura as a separate tribe between the mallophaga bird lice and orthoptera and gerstaecker placed them among the orthoptera fabricius and blainville put them with the neuroptera and the writer in his guide to the study of insects and previously in 1863 ignorant of the views of the two last named authors considered the thysanura as degraded neuroptera and noticed their resemblance to the larv of perla ephemera and other neuroptera such as rhaphidia and panorpa regarding them as standing in the same relation to the rest of the neuroptera in the linnan sense as the flea does to the rest of the diptera or the lice and thrips to the higher hemiptera after having studied the thysanura enough to recognize the great difficulty of deciding as to their affinities and rank the writer does not feel prepared to go so far as dana and lubbock for reasons that will be suggested in the following brief account of the more general points in their structure reserving for another occasion a final expression of his views as to their classification the podurid so well known by name as affording the scales used by microscopists as test objects are common under stones and wet chips or in damp places cellars mushrooms and about manure heaps they need moisture and consequently shade they abound most in spring and autumn laying their eggs at both seasons though most commonly in the spring during a mild december they may be found in abundance under sticks and stones even in situations so far north as salem mass illustration 156 smynthurus the body of the poduras is rather short and thick most so in smynthurus fig 156 and becoming long and slender in tomocerus and isotoma the segments are inclined to be of unequal size the prothoracic ring sometimes becoming almost obsolete and some of the abdominal rings are much smaller than others while in lipura and anura the lowest forms of the group the segments are all much alike in size the head is in form much like that of certain larv of neuroptera and of forficula an orthopterous insect the basal half of the head is marked off from the eyebearing piece epicranium by a vshaped suture10 fig 157 head of degeeria compare also the head of the larva of forficula fig 158 in which the suture is the same and the insertion of the antenn is removed far down the front near the mouth the clypeus being very short this piece so large and prominent in the higher insects is not distinctly separated by suture from the surrounding parts of the head thus affording one of the best distinctive characters of the podurid the eyes are situated on top of the head just behind the antenn and are simple consisting of a group of from five to eight or ten united into a mass in smynthurus but separated in the podurid see fig 176 e eye of anurida the antenn are usually fourjointed and vary in length in the different genera illustration 157 head of degeeria illustration 158 larva of forficula the mouthparts are very difficult to make out but by soaking the insect in potash for twentyfour hours thus rendering the body transparent they can be satisfactorily observed they are constructed on the same general type as the mouthparts of the neuroptera orthoptera and coleoptera and except in being degraded and with certain parts obsolete they do not essentially differ11 on observing the living podura the mouth seems a simple ring with a minute labrum and groups of hairs and spinules which the observer partly by guesswork can identify as jaws and maxill and labium but in studying the parts rendered transparent we can identify the different appendages figure 159 shows the common tomocerus plumbeus greatly enlarged fig 160 seen from above and as the mouthparts of the whole group of poduras are remarkably constant a description of one genus will suffice for all the labrum or upper lip is separated by a deep suture from the clypeus and is trapezoidal in form the mandibles and maxill are long and slender and buried in the head with the tips capable of being extended out from the ring surrounding the mouth for a very short distance the mandibles md fig 159 are like those of the neuroptera orthoptera and coleoptera in their general form the tip ending in from three to six teeth three on one mandible and six on the other while below is a rough denticulated molar surface where the food seized by the terminal teeth is triturated and prepared to be swallowed just behind the mandibles are the maxill which are trilobate at the end as in the three orders of insects above named the outer lobe or palpus is a minute membranous tubercle ending in a hair fig 161 mp while the middle lobe or galea is nearly obsolete though i think i have seen it in smynthurus where it forms a lobe on the outside of the lacinia the lacinia or inner lobe fig 161 lc 162 the same enlarged in tomocerus consists of two bundles of spinules one broad like a ruffle and the other slender pencillike ending in an inner row of spines like the spinules on the lacinia of the japyx and campodea and more remotely the lacini of the three suborders of insects above referred to there is also a horny prominent threetoothed portion fig 161 g these homologies have never been made before so far as the writer is aware but they seem natural and suggested by a careful examination and comparison with the abovementioned mandibulate insects illustration 159 161 160 162 tomocerus plumbeus and mouthparts greatly enlarged the spring consists of a pair of threejointed appendages with the basal joints soldered together early in embryonic life while the other two joints are free forming a fork it is longest in smynthurus and degeeria and shortest in achorutes fig 172 b where it forms a simple forked tubercle and is obsolete in lipura and anura its place being indicated by an oval scar the third joint varies in form being hairy serrate and knifelike in form as in tomocerus fig 159 a or minute with a supplementary tooth as in achorutes fig 172 c this spring is in part homologous with the ovipositor of the higher insects which originally consists of three pairs of tubercles each pair arising apparently from the seventh eighth and ninth the latter the penultimate segments of the abdomen in the hymenoptera the spring of the podura seems to be the homologue of the third pair of these tubercles and is inserted on the penultimate segment this comparison i have been able to make from a study of the embryology of isotoma illustration 163 catch holding spring of achorutes another organ and one which so far as i am aware has been overlooked by previous observers i am disposed to consider as possibly an ovipositor in the genus achorutes it may be found in the segment just before the springbearing segment and situated on the median line of the body it consists fig 163 of two squarish valves from between which projects a pair of minute tubercles or blades with four rounded teeth on the under side this pair of infinitesimal saws reminds one of the blades of the sawfly and i am at a loss what their use can be unless to cut and pierce so as to scoop out a shallow place in which to deposit an egg it is homologous in situation with the middle pair of blades which composes the ovipositor of higher insects and if it should prove to be used by the creature in laying its eggs we should then have with the spring an additional point of resemblance to the neuroptera and higher insects and instead of this spring being an important differential character separating the thysanura from other insects it binds them still closer though still differing greatly in representing only a part of the ovipositor of the higher insects this is a catch for holding the spring in place but all the poduras differ from other insects in possessing a remarkable organ situated on the basal segment of the abdomen it is a small tubercle with chitinous walls forming two valves from between which is forced out a fleshy sucker or as in smynthurus a pair of long tubes which are capable of being darted out on each side of the body enabling the insect to attach itself to smooth surfaces and rest in an inverted position the eggs are laid few in number either singly or several together on the under side of stones chips or as in the case of isotoma walkerii under the bark of trees they are round transparent the development of the embryo of isotoma in general accords with that of the phryganeid and suggests on embryological grounds the near relationship of the thysanura to the neuroptera illustration 164 165 166 167 development of a poduran the earliest stage observed was at the time of the appearance of the primitive band fig 164 a b folding of the primitive band c the dotted line crosses the primitive band and terminates in a large yolk granule which surrounds the egg as in the caddis flies soon after the primitive segments appear fig 165 1 antenn 2 mandibles 3 maxill the labium was not seen 57 legs c yolk surrounded by the primitive band and seem to originate just as in the caddis flies figure 166 is a front view of the embryo shortly before it is hatched figure 167 side view of the same the figures as in fig 165 sp spring l labrum the labrum or upper lip and the clypeus are large and as distinct as in the embryos of other insects a fact to which we shall allude again the large threejointed spring is now well developed and the inference is drawn that it represents a pair of true abdominal legs the embryo when about to hatch throws off the eggshell and amnion in a few seconds the larva is perfectly white and is very active in its movements running over the damp inner surface of the bark it is a little over a hundredth of an inch in length and differs from the adult in being shorter and thicker with the spring very short and stout in fact the larva assumes the form of the lower genera of the family such as achorutes and lipura the adult more closely resembling degeeria the larva after its first moult retains its early clumsy form and is still white after a second moult it becomes purplish and much more slender as in the adult the eggs are laid and the young hatched apparently within a period of from six to ten days returning to the stage indicated by figures 166 and 167 i am induced to quote some remarks published in the memoirs of the peabody academy of science no 2 p 18 which seem to support the view that these insects are offshoots from the neuroptera the front of the head is so entirely different from what it is in the adult that certain points demand our attention it is evident that at this period the development of the insect has gone on in all important particulars much as in other insects especially the neuropterous mystacides as described by zaddach the head is longer vertically than horizontally the frontal or clypeal region is broad and greater in extent than the epicraniooccipital region the antenn are inserted high up on the head next the ocelli falling down over the clypeal region the clypeus however is merged with the epicranium and the usual suture between them does not appear distinctly in after life though its place is seen in figure 167 to be indicated by a slight indentation the labrum is distinctly defined by a well marked suture and forms a squarish knoblike protuberance and in size is quite large compared to the clypeus from this time begins the process of degradation when the insect assumes its thysanurous characters which consist in an approach to the form of the myriopodous head the front or clypeal region being reduced to a minimum and the antenn and eyes brought in closer proximity to the mouth than in any other insects sir john lubbock has given us an admirable account of the internal anatomy of these little creatures his elaborate and patient dissections filling a great gap in our knowledge of their internal structure the space at our disposal only permits us to speak briefly of the respiratory system lubbock found a simple system of trache in smynthurus which opens by two spiracles in the head opposite the insertion of the antenn i e on the back of the head von olfers says that they open on the prothorax nicolet and olfers claim to have found trache in several lower genera orchesella tomocerus and achorutes and allied genera but lubbock was unable to detect them and i may add that i have not yet been able after careful search to find them either in living specimens or those rendered transparent by potash having given a hasty sketch of the external aspect of the poduras i extract from lubbocks work

whom i had sent specimens for comparison this genus differs in the form of the head from lipura and also wants the terminal upcurved spines while the antenn are much more pointed the legs fig 175 end in a large long curved claw on examining specimens soaked in potash i have found that the mouthparts of this species fig 176 md mandibles mx maxill e eyes and a singular accessory group of small cells are like those of achorutes as previously noticed by laboulbne the mandibles like those of other poduras end in from three to six teeth and have a broad manytoothed molar surface below the maxill end in a tridentate lacinia as usual though the palpi and galea i have not yet studied the genus anura may be readily recognized by the mouth ending in an acutely conical beak with its end quite free from the head and hanging down beneath it the body is short and broad much tuberculated while the antenn are short and pointed and the legs are much shorter than in lipura not reaching more than a third of their length beyond the body our common form occurs under the bark of trees for the reason that i can find no valid characters for separating these three genera as a family from the other poduras i am inclined to think that they form by the absence of the spring only a subdivision perhaps a subfamily of the podurid the best way to collect poduras is on turning up the stick or stone on the under side of which they live to place a vial over them allowing them to leap into it they may be incited to leap by pushing a needle under the vial they may also be collected by a bottle with a sponge saturated with ether or chloroform they may be kept alive for weeks by keeping moist slips of blotting paper in the vial in this way i have kept specimens of degeeria tomocerus and orchesella from the middle of december till late in january during this time they occasionally moulted and tomocerus plumbeus after shedding its skin ate it within a few hours poduras feed ordinarily on vegetable matter such as dead leaves and growing cryptogamic vegetation these little creatures can be easily preserved in a mixture of alcohol and glycerine or pure alcohol though without the glycerine the colors fade we have entered more fully in this chapter into the details of structure than heretofore too much so perhaps for the patience of our readers but the study of the poduras possesses the liveliest interest since these lowest of all the sixfooted insects may have been among the earliest land animals and hence to them we may look with more or less success for the primitive ancestral forms of insect life footnotes footnote 9 nicolet in the annales de la societe entomologique de france tome v 1847 has given us the most comprehensive essay on the group though latreille had previously published an important essay de lorganization exterieure des thysanoures in the nouvelles annales du museum dhistoire naturelle paris 1832 which i have not seen gervais has also given a useful account of them in the third volume of apteres of rorets suite a buffion published in 1844 the abbe bourlet templeton westwood and haliday have published important papers on the thysanura and meinert a danish naturalist and olfers a german anatomist have published important papers on the anatomy of the group in this country say and fitch have described less than a dozen species and the writer has described two american species of campodea c americana our common form and c cookei discovered by mr c cooke in mammoth cave while humbert has described in a french scientific journal a species of jupyx j saussurii from mexico footnote 10 the direct homology of these parts of the head the occiput and the epicranium with perla forficula etc seems to me the best evidence we could have that the podur are not an independent group in these most fundamental characters they differ widely from the myriopods i am not aware that this important relation has been appreciated by observers footnote 11 as we descend to the soft tubelike suctorial mouth of anura which is said not to have hard mouthparts we see the final point of degradation to which the mouth of the thysanura is carried i think that this gradual degradation of the mouthparts in this group indicates that the appendages in these animals are not formed on an independent type intermediate so to speak between the mandibulate and haustellate types but are simply a modification through disuse of the mandibulate type as seen in neuropterous insects footnote 12 lubbock considers that papirius should be placed in a distinct family from smynthurus because it wants trache their presence or absence scarcely seems to us to be a family character as they are wanting in the podurid and are not essential to the life of these animals while in other respects papirius seems to differ but slightly from smynthurus footnote 13 dr laboulbne has recently and we think with good reason separated anura maritima from the genus anura under the name of anurida maritima chapter xiii hints on the ancestry of insects illustration 177 pentastoma illustration 178 centipede though our course through the different groups of insects may have seemed rambling and desultory enough and pursued with slight reference to a natural classification of the insects of which we have spoken yet beginning with the hive bee the highest intelligence in the vast world of insects we have gradually though with many a sudden step descended to perhaps the most lowly organized forms among all the insects the parasitic mites while the demodex is probably the humblest in its organization of any of the insects we have treated of there is still another mite which some eminent naturalists continue to regard as a worm which is yet lower in the scale this is the pentastoma fig 177 p tnioides which lives in the manner of the tape worm a parasitic life in the higher animals though instead of inhabiting the alimentary canal the wormlike mite takes up its abode in the nostrils and frontal sinus of dogs and sheep and sometimes of the horse at first however it is found in the liver or lungs of various animals sometimes in man it is then in the earliest or larval state and assumes its true mite form being oval in shape with minute horny jaws adapted for boring and with two pairs of legs armed with sharp retractile claws such an animal as this is little higher than some worms and indeed is lower than many of them we should also not pass over in silence the centipedes fig 178 scolopocryptops sexspinosa and galley worms or thousand legs and their allies myriopods which by their long slender bodies and great number of segments and feet vaguely recall the worms but they with the mites are true insects as they are born with only three pairs of feet as are the mites and ticks and breathe by trache and thus a common plan of structure underlies the entire class of insects illustration 179 young pauropus illustration 180 springtail illustration 181 young julus a very strange myriopod has been discovered by sir john lubbock in europe and we have been fortunate enough to find a species in this country it is the pauropus it consists when fully grown of nine segments exclusive of the head bearing nine pairs of feet the young of pauropus fig 179 is born with three pairs of feet and in its general appearance reminds us of a springtail fig 180 as may be seen by a glance at the cut this sixlegged form of pauropus may also be compared with the young galley worm fig 181 illustration 182 leptus illustration 183 tardigrade passing to the group of spiders and mites we find that the young mites when first hatched have but three pairs of feet while their parents have four like the spiders figure 182 represents the larva leptus of the red garden mites while a figure of the water bear or tardigrade fig 183 is introduced to compare with it as it bears a resemblance to the young of the mites though their young are born with their full complement of legs an exception to their nearest allies the true mites now if we compare these early stages of mites and myriopods with those of the true sixfooted insects as in the larval melo cicada thrips and dragon fly we shall see quite plainly that they all share a common form what does this mean to the systematist who concerns himself with the classification of the myriads of different insects now living it is a relief to find that all can be reduced to the comparatively simple forms sketched above it is to him a proof of the unity of organization pervading the world of insects he sees how nature seizing upon this archetypal form has by simple modifications of parts here and there by the addition of wings and other organs wanting in these simple creatures rung numberless changes in this elemental form and starting from the simplest kinds such as the poduras spiders grasshoppers and may flies allied creatures which we now know were the first to appear in the earlier geologic ages we rise to the highest the bees with their complex forms their diversified economy and wonderful instincts in ascending this scale of being while there is a progress upwards the beetles for instance being higher than the bugs and grasshoppers and the butterflies and moths on the whole being more highly organized than the flies and while we see the hymenopterous sawflies with their larv mimicking so closely the caterpillars of the butterflies in the progress from the sawflies up to the bees we behold a gradual loss of the lower sawfly characters in the cynips and chalcid flies and see in the sandwasps and true wasps a constant and accelerating likeness to the bee form yet this continuity of improving organizations is often broken and we often see insects which recall the earlier and more elementary forms illustration 184 male stylops again going back of the larval period and studying the insect in the egg we find that nearly all the insects yet observed agree most strikingly in their mode of growth so that for instance the earlier stages of the germ of a bee fly or beetle bear a remarkable resemblance to each other and suggest again more forcibly than when we examine the larval condition that a common design or pattern at first pervades all in the light of the studies of von baer of lamarck and darwin should we be content to stop here or does this ideal archetype become endowed with life and have a definite existence becoming the ancestral form of all insects the prototype which gave birth to the hundreds of thousands of insect forms which are now spread over our globe just as we see daily happens where a single aphis may become the progenitor of a million offspring clustering on the same tree is there not something more than analogy in the two things and is not the same lifegiving force that evolves a million young aphides from the germ stock of a single aphis in a single season the same in kind with the production of the living races of insects from a primeval ancestor when we see the aphis giving origin in one season to successive generations the individuals of which may be counted by the million it is no less mysterious than that other succession of forms of insect life which has peopled the globe during the successive chapters of its history while we see in one case the origin of individual forms and cannot explain what it is that starts the life in the germ and so unerringly guides the course of the growing embryo it is illogical to deny that the same lifegiving force is concerned in the production of specific and generic forms illustration 185 female stylops who can explain the origin of the sexes what is the cause that determines that one individual in a brood of stylops for example fig 184 male fig 185 grublike female in the body of its host shall be but a grub living as a parasite in the body of its host while its fellow shall be winged and as free in its actions as the most highly organized insect it is no less mysterious because it daily occurs before our eyes so perhaps none the less mysterious and no more discordant with known natural laws may the law that governs the origin of species seem to those who come after us certainly the present attempts to discover that law however fatuitous they may seem to many are neither illogical nor judging by the impetus already given to biology or the science of life labor altogether spent in vain the theory of evolution is a powerful tool when judiciously used that must eventually wrest many a secret from the grasp of nature but whether true or unproved the theory of evolution in some shape has actually been adopted by the large proportion of naturalists who find it indispensable in their researches and it will be used until found inadequate to explain facts notwithstanding the present distrust and even fear with which it is received by many we doubt not but that in comparatively few years all will acknowledge that the theory of evolution will be to biology what the nebular hypothesis is to geology or the atomic theory is to chemistry while the evolution theory is as yet imperfect and many objections some seemingly insuperable can be raised against it it should be borne in mind that the nebular hypothesis is still comparatively crude and unsatisfactory though indispensable as a working theory to the geologist and in chemistry though the atomic theory may not be satisfactorily demonstrated to some minds until an atom is actually brought to sight it is yet invaluable in research many short sighted persons complain that such a theory sets in the background the idea of a personal creator but minds no less devout and perhaps a trifle more thoughtful see the hand of a creator not less in the evolution of plants and animals from prexistent forms through natural laws than in the evolution of a summers shower through the laws discovered by the meteorologist who looks back through myriads of ages to the causes that led to the distribution of mountain chains ocean currents and trade winds which combine to produce the necessary conditions resulting in that shower indeed to the student of nature the evolution theory in biology with the nebular hypothesis and the grand law in physics of the correlation of forces all interdependent and revealing to us the mode in which the creator of the universe works in the world of matter together form an immeasurably grander conception of the order of creation and its ordainer than was possible for us to form before these laws were discovered and put to practical use we may be allowed then in a reverent spirit of inquiry to attempt to trace the ancestry of the insects and without arriving perhaps at any certain result for it is largely a matter of speculation point out certain facts the thoughtful consideration of which may throw light on this difficult and embarrassing question without much doubt the poduras are the lowest of the sixfooted insects they are more embryonic in their appearance than others as seen in the large size of the head compared with the rest of the body the large clumsy legs and the equality in the size of the several segments composing the body in other characters such as the want of compound eyes the absence of wings the absence of a complete ovipositor and the occasional want of trache they stand at the base of the insect series that they are true insects however we endeavored to show in the previous chapter and that they are neuropterous we think is most probable since not only in the structure of the insect after birth do they agree with the larv of certain neuropters but as we have shown in another place14 in comparing the development of isotoma a poduran with that of a species of caddis fly the correspondence throughout the different embryological stages nearly up to the time of hatching is very striking and it is a remarkable fact as we have previously noticed that when it begins to differ from the caddis fly embryo it begins to assume the poduran characters and its development consequently in some degree retrogrades just as in the lice previous to hatching as we have shown in a previous chapter so that i think we are warranted at present in regarding the thysanura and especially the family of podarids as degraded neuropters consequently the poduras did not have an independent origin and do not perhaps represent a distinct branch of the genealogical tree of articulates while the poduras may be said to form a specialized type the bristletails lepisma machilis nicoletia and campodea are as we have seen much more highly organized and form a generalized or comprehensive type they resemble in their general form the larva of ephemerids and perhaps more closely the immature perla and also the wingless cockroaches illustration 186 embryo of diplax illustration 187 embryo of louse now such forms as these thysanura together with the mites and the singular pauropus we cannot avoid suspecting to have been among the earliest to appear upon the earth and putting together the facts first of their low organization secondly of their comprehensive structure resembling the larv of other insects and thirdly of their probable great antiquity we naturally look to them as being related in form to what we may conceive to have been the ancestor of the class of insects not that the animals mentioned above were the actual ancestors but that certain insects bearing a greater resemblance to them than any others with which we are acquainted and belonging possibly to families and orders now extinct were the prototypes and progenitors of the insects now known illustration 188 embryo of spider illustration 189 embryo of podura though the study of the embryology of insects is as yet in its infancy still with the facts now in our possession we can state with tolerable certainty that at first the embryos of all insects are remarkably alike and the process of development is much the same in all as seen in the figure of diplax fig 186 the louse fig 187 the spider fig 188 and the podura fig 189 and we could give others bearing the same likeness we notice that at a certain period in the life of the embryo all agree in having the head large and bearing from two to four pairs of mouth organs resembling the legs the thorax is merged in with the abdomen and the general form of the embryo is ovate now this general embryonic form characterizes the larva of the mites of the myriopods and of the true insects to such a generalized embryonic form to which the insects may be referred as the descendants we would give the name of leptus as among crustacea the ancestral form is referred to nauplius a larval form of the lower crustacea and through which the greater part of the crabs shrimps barnacles water fleas etc pass to attain their definite adult condition a little water flea was described as a separate genus nauplius before it was known to be the larva of a higher water flea and so also leptus was thought to be a mature mite accordingly we follow the usage of certain naturalists in dealing with the crustacea and propose for this common primitive larval condition of insects the term leptus illustration 190 zoa the first to discuss this subject of the ancestry of insects was fritz mller who in his fr darwin15 published in 1863 says at the end of his work having reached the nauplius the extreme outpost of the class retiring farthest into the gray mist of primitive time we naturally look round us to see whether ways may not be descried thence towards other bordering regions but i can see nothing certain even towards the nearer provinces of the myriopoda and arachnida i can find no bridge for the insecta alone the development of the malacostraca crabs lobsters shrimps etc may perhaps present a point of union like many zo the insecta possess three pairs of limbs serving for the reception of nourishment and three pairs serving for locomotion like the zo they have an abdomen without appendages as in all zo the mandibles in insecta are destitute of palpi certainly but little in common compared with the much which distinguishes these two animal forms nevertheless the supposition that the insecta had for their common ancestor a zoa which raised itself into a life on land may be recommended for further examination p 140 afterwards hckel in his generelle morphologie 1866 and history of creation published in 1868 reiterates the notion that the insects are derived from the larva zoa fig 190 of the crabs though he is doubtful whether they did not originate directly from the worms16 it may be said in opposition to the view that the insects came originally from the same early crustacean resembling the larva of a crab or shrimp that the differences between the two types are too great or in other words the homologies of the two classes too remote17 and the two types are each too specialized to lead us to suppose that one was derived from the other moreover we find through the researches of messrs hartt and scudder that there were highly developed insects such as may flies grasshoppers etc in the devonian rocks of new brunswick leading us to expect the discovery of low insects even in the upper silurian rocks at any rate this discovery pushes back the origin of insects beyond a time when there were true zo as the shrimps and their allies are not actually known to exist so far back as the silurian not having as yet been found below the coal measures the view that the insects were derived from a zoa was also sustained by friedrich brauer the distinguished entomologist of vienna in a paper18 read in march 1869 following the suggestion of fritz mller and hckel he derives the ancestry of insects from the zoa of crabs and shrimps however he regards the podurids as the more immediate ancestors of the true insects selecting campodea as the type of such an ancestral form remarking that the campodeastage has for the insects and myriopods the same value as the zoa for the crustacea he says nothing regarding the spiders and mites at the same time19 the writer in criticising hckels views of the derivation of insects from the crustacea ignorant of the fact that he had also suggested that the insects were possibly derived directly from the worms and also independently of brauers opinions declared his belief that though it seemed premature after the discovery of highly organized winged insects in rocks so ancient as the devonian and with the late discovery of a land plant in the lower silurian rocks of sweden20 to even guess as to the ancestry of insects yet he would suggest that instead of being derived from some zoa the ancestors of the insects including the sixfooted insects spiders and myriopods must have been wormlike and aquatic and when the type became terrestrial we would imagine a form somewhat like the young pauropus which combines in a remarkable degree the characters of the myriopods and the degraded wingless insects such as the smynthurus podura etc some such forms may have been introduced late in the silurian period for the interesting discoveries of fossil insects in the devonian of new brunswick by messrs hartt and scudder and those discovered by messrs meek and worthen in the lower part of the coal measures at morris illinois and described by mr scudder reveal carboniferous myriopods two species of euphorberia more highly organized than pauropus and a carboniferous scorpion buthus closely resembling a species now living in california together with another scorpionlike animal mazonia woodiana while the devonian insects described from st john by mr scudder are nearly as highly organized as our grasshoppers and may flies dr dawson has also discovered a well developed milleped xylobius in the lower coal measures of nova scotia so that we must go back to the silurian period in our search for the earliest ancestor or if not of darwinian proclivities prototype of insects afterwards21 the writer carrying out the idea suggested above referred the ancestry of the myriopods arachnids and hexapodous insects to a leptuslike terrestrial animal bearing a vague resemblance to the nauplius form among crustacea inasmuch as the body is not differentiated into a head thorax and abdomen though the head may be free from the rest of the body and there are three pairs of temporary locomotive appendages like nauplius which was first supposed to be an adult entomostracan the larval form of trombidium had been described as a genus of mites under the name of leptus also ocypete and astoma and was supposed to be adult in the same year sir john lubbock22 agrees with brauer that the groups represented by podura and campodea may have been the ancestors of the insects remarking that the genus campodea must be regarded as a form of remarkable interest since it is the living representative of a primval type from which not only the collembola podura etc and thysanura but the other great orders of insects have all derived their origin the comparison of the leptus with the nauplius or prezoal stage of crustacea is much more natural but here we are met with apparently insuperable difficulties while the nauplius fig 191 has but three pairs of appendages which become the two pairs of antenn and succeeding pair of limbs of the adult in the leptus as the least number we have five pairs two of which belong to the head the maxill and mandibles and three to the thorax besides these is a true heed distinct from the hinder region of the body it is evident that the leptus fundamentally differs from the nauplius and begins life on a higher plane we reject therefore the crustacean origin of the insects our only refuge is in the worms and how to account for the transmutation of any worm with which we are at present acquainted into a form like the leptus with its mandibulated mouth and jointed legs seems at first well nigh impossible we have the faintest possible indication in the structure of some mites and of the tardigrades and pentastoma where there is a striking recurrence as we may term it to a wormlike form readily noticed by every observer whatever his opinion may be on the developmental theory in the demodex we see a tendency of the mite to assume under peculiar circumstances an elongated wormlike form the mouthparts are aborted though from what we know of the embryology of other mites they probably are indicated early in embryonic life while the eight legs are not jointed and form simple tubercles in the tardigrades a long step lower we have unjointed fleshy legs armed with from two to four claws but the mouthparts are essentially mite in character a decided worm feature is the fact that they are hermaphrodites each individual having ovaries and spermaries as is the case with many worms illustration 191 nauplius when we come to the singular creatures of which pentastoma and linguatula are the type we have the most striking approximation to the worms in external form but these are induced evidently by their parasitic mode of life they lose the rudimentary jointed limbs which some linguatula especially have well marked in the embryo and from being oval rudely mitelike in form they elongate and only the claws or simple curved hooks like those of young tape worms remain to indicate the original presence of true jointed legs in seeking for the ancestry of our hypothetical leptus among the worms we are at best groping in the dark we know of no ancestral form among the true annelides nor is it probable that it was derived from the intestinal worms the only worm below the true annelides that suggests any remote analogy to the insects is the singular and rare peripatus which lives on land in warm climates its body not divided into rings is provided with about thirty pairs of fleshy tubercles each ending in two strong claws and the head is adorned with a pair of fleshy tubercles it is remotely possible that some silurian land worm if any such existed allied to our living peripatus may have been the ancestor of a series of types now lost which resulted in an animal resembling the leptus illustration 192 platygaster error we may however as bearing upon this difficult question cite some remarkable discoveries of professor ganin a russian naturalist on the early stages of certain ichneumon parasites which show some worm features in their embryonic development in a species of platygaster fig 192 p error of fitch which is a parasite on a twowinged gall fly the earliest stage observed after the egg is laid is that in which the egg contains a single cell with a nucleus and nucleolus out of this cell fig 193 a a arise two other cells the central cell a gives origin to the embryo the two outer ones multiply by subdivision and form the embryonal membrane or amnion which is a provisional envelope and does not assist in building up the body of the germ the central single cell however multiplies by the subdivision of its nucleus thus building up the body of the germ figure 193 b g shows the yolk or germ just forming out of the nuclei a and b the peripheral cells of the blastoderm skin or amnion figure 193 c shows the yolk transformed into the embryo g with the outer layer of blastodermic cells b the body of the germ is infolded so that the embryo appears bent on

closely resembles shows the first larva stage after leaving the egg this strange form the author remarks would scarcely be thought an insect were not its origin and farther development known but rather a parasitic copepodous crustacean whence he calls this the cyclopslike stage in this condition it clings to the inside of its host by means of its hooklike jaws md moving about like a cestodes embryo with its well known six hooks the tail moves up and down and is of but little assistance in its efforts to change its place singularly enough the nervous vascular and respiratory systems trache are wanting and the alimentary canal is a blind sac remaining in an indifferent or unorganized state how long it remains in this state could not be ascertained illustration 193 development of

genital organs ms band of muscles is attained by means of a moult as usual in the metamorphoses of insects with the change of skin the larva entirely changes its form socalled hypodermic cells are developed the singular tail is dropped the segments of the body disappear and the body grows oval while within begins a series of remarkable changes like the ordinary development of the embryo of most other insects within the egg the cells of the hypodermis multiply greatly and lie one above the other in numerous layers they give rise to a special primitive organ closely resembling the primitive band of all insect embryos the alimentary canal is made anew and the nervous and vascular systems now appear but the trache are not yet formed it remains in this state for a much longer period than in the previous stage illustration 196 third larva of polynema the third larval form only a few live to reach this is of the usual long oval form of the larv of the ichneumons and the body has thirteen segments exclusive of the head the muscular system has greatly developed and the larva is much more lively in its motions than before the new organs that develop are the air tubes and fat bodies the imaginal disks or rudimentary portions destined to develop and form the skin of the adult or imago arise in the pupa state which resembles that of other ichneumons these disks are only engaged in platygaster in building up the rudimentary appendages while in the flies muscid and corethra they build up the whole body according to the remarkable discovery of weismann not less interesting is the history of the development of a species of polynema another eggparasite which lays its eggs one seldom two in the eggs of a small dragon fly agrion virgo which oviposits in the parenchyma of the leaves of waterlilies the eggs develop as in platygaster the earliest stage of the embryo is very remarkable it leaves the egg when very small and immovable and with scarcely a trace of organization being a mere flaskshaped sac of cells23 it remains in this state five or six days in the second stage or histriobdellalike form the larva is in its general appearance like the low worm to which ganin compares it it may be described as bearing a general resemblance to the third and fully developed larval form fig 196 tg three pairs of abdominal tubercles destined to form the sting l rudiments of the legs fk portion of the fatty body at rudiments of the antenn fl imaginal disks or rudiments of the wings no trache are developed in the larva nor do any exist in the imago ganin thinks that as these insects are somewhat aquatic the adult insects flying over the surface of the water the wings may act as respiratory organs like gills it lives six to seven days before pupating and remains from ten to twelve days in the pupa state the origin of the sting is clearly ascertained ganin shows that it consists of three pairs of tubercles situated respectively on the seventh eighth and ninth segments of the abdomen fig 196 tg the labium is not developed from a pair of tubercles as is usual but at once appears as an unpaired or single organ the pupa state lasts for five or six days and when the imago appears it eats its way through a small round opening in the end of the skin of its host the agrion larva illustration 197 development of eggparasites the development of ophloneurus another eggparasite agrees with that of platygaster and polynema this eggparasite passes its early life in the eggs of pieris brassic and two or three live to reach the imago state though about six eggs are deposited by the female the eggs are oval and not stalked the larva is at first of the form indicated by figure 197 e and when fully grown becomes of a broad oval form the body not being divided into segments it differs from the genera already mentioned in remaining within its egg membrane and not assuming their strange forms from the nonsegmented saclike larva it passes directly into the pupa state the last eggparasite noticed by ganin is teleas whose development resembles that of platygaster it is a parasite in the eggs of gerris the water boatman figure 197 a represents the egg

at antenn md hooklike mandibles mo mouth b bristles m intestine sw the tail ul under lip or labium in the second larval stage which is oval in form and not segmented the primitive band is formed in concluding the account of his remarkable discoveries ganin draws attention to the great differences in the formation of the eggs and the germs of these parasites from what occurs in other insects the egg has no nutritive cells the formation of the primitive band usually the first indication of the germ is retarded till the second larval stage is attained and the embryonal membrane is not homologous with the socalled amnion of other insects but may possibly be compared with the skin developed on the upper side of the low wormlike acarian pentastomum and the larval skin of the embryos of many low crustacea he says also that we cannot perhaps find the homologues of the provisional organs of the larv such as the singularly shaped antenn the clawlike mandibles the tongueor earlike appendages in other arthropoda insects and crustacea but that they may be found in the parasitic lernan crustaceans and in the leeches such as histriobella he is also struck by the similarity in the development of these eggparasites to that of a kind of leech nephelis the embryo of which is provided with cili recalling the larva of teleas fig 197 b c while in the true leeches hirudo the primitive band is not developed until after they have passed through a provisional larval stage this complicated metamorphosis of the eggparasites ganin also compares to the socalled hypermetamorphosis of certain insects melo sitaris and the stylopid made known by siebold newport and fabre and he considers it to be of the same nature he also in closing compares such early larval forms as those given in figures 193 e and 194 to the free swimming copepoda finally he says a few words on the theory of evolution and remarks there is no doubt that if a solution of the questions arising concerning the genealogical relations of different animals among themselves is possible comparative embryology will afford the first and truest principles he modestly suggests that the facts presented in his paper will widen our views on the genetic relations of the insects to other animals and refers to the opinion first expressed by fritz mller fr darwin p 91 and endorsed by hckel in his generelle morphologie that we must seek for the ancestors of insects and arachnida in the zoa form of crustacea he cautiously remarks however that the embryos and larv observed by me in the eggparasites open up a new and wide field for a whole series of such considerations but i will suppress them since i am firmly convinced that a theory which i build up today can easily be destroyed with some few facts which i learn tomorrow since comparative embryology as a science does not yet exist so do i think that all genetic theories are too premature and without a strong scientific foundation the writer is perhaps less cautious but he cannot refrain from making some reflections suggested by the remarkable discoveries of ganin in the first place these facts bear strongly on the theory of evolution by acceleration and retardation in the history of these early larval stages we see a remarkable acceleration in the growth of the embryo a simple sac of unorganized cells with a halfmade intestine so to speak is hatched and made to perform the duty of an ordinary quite highly organized larva even the formation of the primitive band usually the first indication of the organization of the germ is postponed to a comparatively late period in larval life the different anatomical systems ie the heart with its vessels the nervous system and the respiratory system trache appear at longer or shorter intervals while in one genus the trache are not developed at all thus some portions of the animal are accelerated in their development more than others while others are retarded and in some species certain organs are not developed at all meanwhile all live in a fluid medium with much the same habits and surrounded with quite similar physical conditions the highest degree of acceleration is seen in the reproductive organs of the cecidomyian larva of miastor which produces a summer brood of young alive and living free in the body of the childparent and in the pupa of chironomus which has been recently shown by von grimm a fellow countryman of ganin to produce young in the spring while the adult fly lays eggs in the autumn in the usual manner this is in fact a true virgin reproduction and directly comparable to the alternation of generations observed in the jelly fishes in salpa and certain intestinal worms we can now in the light of the researches of siebold leuckart ganin and others trace more closely than ever the connection between simple growth and metamorphosis and metamorphosis and parthenogenesis and perceive that they are but the terms of a single series by the acceleration in the development of a single set of organs the reproductive no more wonderful than the acceleration and retardation of the other systems of organs so clearly pointed out in the embryos of platygaster and its allies we see how parthenogenesis under certain conditions may result the barren platygaster larva the fertile cecidomyia larva the fertile aphis larva the fertile chironomus pupa the fertile hydroid polype and the fertile adult queen bee are simply animals in different degrees of organization and with reproductive systems differing not in quality but in the greater or less rapidity of their development as compared with the rest of the body another interesting point is that while the larv vary so remarkably in form the adult ichneumon flies are remarkably similar to one another do the differences in their larval history seem to point back to certain still more divergent ancestral forms these remarkable hypermetamorphoses remind us of the metamorphosis of the embryo of echinoderms into the pluteusand bipinnariaforms of the starfish sea urchins and holothurians24 of the actinotrochaform larva of the sipunculoid worms of the tornaria into balanoglossus the worm of the cercariaform larva of distoma of the pilidiumform larva of nemertes and the larval forms of the leeches25 as well as the mite pentastomum and certain other aberrant mites such as myobia while fritz mller and dohrn have considered the insects as having descended from the crustacea some primitive zoaform and dohrn has adduced the supposed zoaform larva of these eggparasites as a proof we cannot but think in a subject so purely speculative as the ancestry of animals that the facts brought out by ganin tend to confirm our theory that the ancestry of all the insects including the arachnids and myriopods should be traced directly to the worms the development of the degraded aberrant arachnidan pentastomum accords in some important respects with that of the intestinal worms the leptusform larva of julus with its strange embryological development in some respects so like that of some worms points in that direction as certainly as does the embryological development of the eggparasite ophioneurus the nauplius form of the embryo or larva of nearly all crustacea also points back to the worms as their ancestors the divergence having perhaps originated as we have suggested in the rotatoria while the crustacea may have resulted from a series of prototypes leading up from the rotifers fig 198 it is barely possible that one of these creatures may have given rise to a form resulting in two series of beings one leading to the leptus form the other to the nauplius for the true annelides chtopods are too circumscribed and homogeneous a group to allow us to look to them for the ancestral forms of insects but that the insects may have descended from some low worms is not improbable when we reflect that the syllis and allied genera of annelides bear appendages consisting of numerous joints indeed the strange dujardinia rotifers figured by quatrefages in its general form is remarkably like the larva of chloon it has a quite distinct head bearing five long slender jointed antenn and but eight or nine rings to the body which ends in two long many jointed appendages exactly like the tentacles quatrefages adds that its movements are usually slow but when it wishes to move more rapidly it moves its body alternately up and down with much vivacity and shoots forwards by bounds so to speak a little after the manner of the larv of the mosquito histoire naturelle des annels tome 2 p 69 the gills of aquatic insects only differ from those of worms in possessing trache though the gills of the crustacea may be directly compared with those of insects illustration 198 a rotifer but when once inside the circle of the class of insects the ground is firmer as our knowledge is surer granting now that the leptuslike ancestor of the sixfooted insects has become established it is not so difficult to see how the podur and finally a form like campodea appeared aquatic forms resembling the larva of the ephemer perl and more remotely the forficul and white ants of today were probably evolved with comparative suddenness given the evolution of forms like the earwigs forficula cockroaches and white ants termes the latter of which abounded in the coal period and it was not a great step forward to the evolution of the dragonflies the psocus the chrysopa the lice or parasitic hemiptera together with thrips thus forming the establishment of lines of development leading up to those neuroptera with a complete metamorphosis and finally to the grasshoppers and other forms of orthoptera together with the hemiptera illustration 199 chrysopa illustration 200 panorpa we have thus advanced from wingless to winged forms i e from insects without a metamorphosis to those with a partial metamorphosis like the perlas to the may flies and dragon flies in which the adult is still more unlike the larva to the chrysopa fig 199 and forceps tails panorpa fig 200 and caddis flies in which especially the latter the metamorphosis is complete the pupa being inactive and enclosed in a cocoon illustration 201 embryo of diplax having assumed the creation of our leptus by evolutional laws we must now account for the appearance of trache and those organs so dependent on them the wings which by their presence and consequent changes in the structure of the crust of the body afford such distinctive characters to the flying insects and raise them so far above the creeping spiders and centipedes our leptus at first undoubtedly breathed through the skin as do most of the poduras since we have been unable to find trache in them nor even in the prolarva of a genus of minute ichneumon egg parasites nor in the linguatul and tardigrades and some mites such as the itch insect and the demodex and other acari in the myriopod pauropus lubbock was unable to find any traces of trache if we examine the embryo of an insect shortly before birth as in the young dragon fly figure 201 the dotted line t crosses the rudimentary trache we find it to consist of two simple tubes with few branches while there are no stigmata or breathing holes to be seen in the sides of the body this fact sustains the view of gegenbaur26 that at first the trache formed two simple tubes in the bodycavity and that the primary office of these tubes was for lightening the body and that their function as respiratory tubes was a secondary one the aquatic protoleptus as we may term the ancestor of leptus may have had such tubes as these which acted like the swimming bladder of fishes for lightening the body as suggested by gegenbaur it is known that the swimming bladder of fishes becomes developed into the lungs of airbreathing vertebrates and man himself as our leptus adopted a terrestrial life and needed more air a connection was probably formed by a minute branch on each side of the body with some minute pore for such exist whose uses are as yet unknown through the skin which finally became specialized into a stigma or breathing pore and from the tracheal system being closed we now have the open tracheal system of land insects the next inquiry is as to the origin of the wings here the question arises if wingless forms are exceptional among the winged insects and the loss of wings is obviously dependent on the habits as in the lice and environment of the species as in beetles living on islands which are apt to lose the hinder pair of wings why may not their acquisition in the first place have been due to external agencies and as they are suddenly discarded why may they not have suddenly appeared in the first place in aquatic larv there are often external gilllike organs being simple sacs permeated by trache as in agrion fig 129 or the may flies these organs are virtually aquatic wings aiding the insect in progression as well as in arating the blood as in the true wings they are very variable in position some being developed at the extremity of the abdomen as in agrion or along the sides as in the may flies or filiform and arranged in tufts on the under side of the body as in perla and the naturalist is not surprised to find them absent or present in accordance with the varying habits of the animal for example in the larv of the larger dragon flies libellula etc they are wanting while in agrion and its allies they are present now we conceive that wings formed in much the same way and with no more disturbance so to speak to the insects organization appeared during a certain critical period in the metamorphosis of some early insect as soon as this novel mode of locomotion became established we can easily see how surrounding circumstances would favor their farther development until the presence of wings became universal if space permitted us to pursue this interesting subject farther we could show how invariably correlated in form and structure are the wings of insects to the varied conditions by which they are surrounded and which we are forced to believe stand in the relation of cause to effect again why should the wings always appear on the thorax and on the upper instead of the under side as this is the seat of the centre of gravity it is evident that cosmical laws as well as the more immediate laws of biology determine the position and nature of the wings of an insect correlated with the presence of wings is the wonderful differentiation of the crust especially of the thorax where each segment consists of a number of distinct pieces while in the spiders and myriopods the segments are as simple as in the abdominal segments of the winged insect it is not difficult here to trace a series leading up from the poduras in which the segments are like those of spiders to the wonderful complexity of the parts in the thoracic segments of the lepidoptera and hymenoptera in his remarks on the origin of insects27 sir john lubbock says i feel great difficulty in conceiving by what natural process an insect with a suctorial mouth like that of a gnat or butterfly could be developed from a powerfully mandibulate type like the orthoptera or even from the neuroptera is it not more difficult to account for the origin of the mouthparts at all they are developed as tubercles or folds in the tegument and are homologous with the legs figure 186 shows that the two sorts of limbs are at one time identical in form and relative position the thought suggests itself that these long soft fingerlike appendages may have been derived from the tentacles of the higher worms but the grounds for this opinion are uncertain at any rate the earliest form of limb must have been that of a soft tubercle armed with one or two or many terminal claws as seen in aquatic larv such as chironomus fig 202 ephydra fig 203 a b c pupa and many others as the protoleptus assumed a terrestrial life and needed to walk the rudimentary feet would tend to elongate and in consequence need the presence of chitine to harden the integument until the habit of walking becoming fixed the necessity of a jointed structure arose after this the different needs of the offspring of such an insect with their different modes of taking food vegetable or animal would induce the diverse forms of simple or raptorial or leaping or digging limbs a peculiar use of the anterior members as seen in grasping the food and conveying it to the mouth perhaps originally a simple orifice with soft lips as in peripatus would tend to cause such limbs to be grouped together to concentrate around the mouthopening and to be directed constantly forwards with use as in the case of legs these originally soft mouthfeet would gradually harden at the extremities until serviceable in biting when they would become jaws and palpi given a mouth and limbs surrounding it and we at once have a rude head set off from the rest of the body and in fact such is the history of the development of these parts in the embryo at first the head is indicated by the buds forming the rudiments of limbs the segments to which they are attached do not form a true head until after the mouthparts have attained their jawlike characters and it is not until the insect is about to be hatched that the head is definitely walled in illustration 202 foot of chironomus illustration 203 ephydra we have arrived then at our leptus with a head bearing two pairs of jaws the spiders and mites do not advance beyond this stage but in the true insects and myriopods we have the addition of special sense organs the antenn and another pair of appendages the labial palpi it is evident that in the ancestor of these two groups the first pair of appendages became early adapted for purely sensory purposes and were naturally projected far in advance of the mouth forming the antenn before considering the changes from the mandibulate form of insects to those with mouth parts adapted for piercing and sucking we must endeavor to learn how far it was possible for the caterpillar or maggot to become evolved from the leptuslike larv of the neuroptera orthoptera hemiptera and most coleoptera i may quote from a previous article28 a few words in relation to two kinds of larv most prevalent among insects there are two forms of insectean larv which are pretty constant one we call leptiform from its general resemblance to the larv of the mites leptus the larv of all the neuroptera except those of the phryganeid and panorpid which are cylindrical and resemble caterpillars are more or less leptiform i e have a flattened or oval body with large thoracic legs such are the larv of the orthoptera and hemiptera and the coleoptera except the curculionid possibly the cerambycid and buprestid which approach the maggotlike form of the larv of weevils on the other hand taking the caterpillar or bee larva with their cylindrical fleshy bodies in most respects typical of larval forms of the hymenoptera lepidoptera and diptera as the type of the cruciform larva etc the larv of the earliest insects were probably leptiform and the cruciform condition is consequently an acquired one as suggested by fritz mller29 it seems that these two sorts of larv had also been distinguished by dr brauer in the article already referred to with which however the writer was unacquainted at the time of writing the above quoted article the similar views presented may seem to indicate that they are founded in nature dr brauer after remarking that the podurids seemed to fulfil hckels idea of what were the most primitive insects and noticing how closely they resemble the larv of myriopods says specially interesting are those forms among the podurid which are described as campodea and japyx since the larv of a great number of insects may be traced back to them but he adds and with this view we are unable to agree while others the caterpillarlike forms raupenform resulted from them by a retrograde process and also the still lower maggotlike forms while on the one hand campodea with its abdominal feet and the larva of lithobius are related so on the other the lepismatid which are very near the blattari are nearly related to the myriopods since their abdominal segments often bear appendages machilis the campodeaform appears in most of the pseudoneuroptera libellulids ephemerids perlids psocids and termes orthoptera coleoptera neuroptera perhaps modified in the strepsiptera stylops and xenos and coccid in their first stage of development and indeed in many of these at their first moult farther on he says a larger part of the most highly developed insects assume another larvaform which appears not only as a later acquisition through accommodation with certain definite relations but also arises as such before our eyes the larv of butterflies and moths of saw flies and panorp show the form most distinctly and i call this the caterpillar form raupenform that this is not the primitive form but one later acquired we see in the beetles the larv of melo and sitaris in their fully grown condition possess the caterpillar form but the new born larv of these genera show the campodea form the last form is lost as soon as the larva begins its parasitic mode of life the larger part of the beetles the neuroptera in part the bees and flies the last with the most degraded maggot form possess larv of this second form he considers that the caterpillar form is a degraded campodea form the result of its stationary life in plants or in wood illustration pl 2 examples of leptiform larv explanation of plate 2 figure 1 different forms of leptus 2 diplax 3 coccinella larva 4 cicada larva 5 cicindela larva 6 ant lion

halictus larva 14 andrena larva illustration 204 tipula larva for reasons which we will not pause here to discuss we have always regarded the eruciform type of larva as the highest that it is the result of degradation from the leptus or campodea form we should be unwilling to admit though the maggots of flies have perhaps retrograded from such forms as the larv of the mosquitoes and crane flies tipulids fig 204 that the cylindrical form of the bee grub and caterpillar is the result of modification through descent is evident in the caterpillarlike form of the immature caddis fly pl 3 fig 2 here the fundamental characters of the larva are those of the corydalus and sialis and panorpa types of closely allied groups the features that remind us of caterpillars are superadded evidently the result of the peculiar tubeinhabiting habits of the young caddis fly in like manner the caterpillarform is probably the result of the leafeating life of a primitive leptiform larva in like manner the softbodied maggot of the weevil is evidently the result of its living habitually in cavities in nuts and fruits did the soft baggy female stylops live exposed like its allies in other families to an outofdoors life its skin would inevitably become hard and chitinous in these and multitudes of other cases the adaptation of the form of the insect to its mode of life is one of cause and effect and not a bit less wonderful after we know what induced the change of form having endeavored to show that the caterpillar is a later production than the young wingless cockroach with which geological facts harmonize we have next to account for the origin of a metamorphosis in insects here it is necessary to disabuse the readers mind of the prevalent belief that the terms larva pupa and imago are fixed and absolute if we examine at a certain season the nest of a humble bee we shall find the occupants in every stage of growth from the egg to the pupa and even to the perfectly formed bee ready to break out of its larval cell so slight are the differences between the different stages that it is difficult to say where the larval stage ends and the pupa begins so also where the pupal state ends and the imago begins the following figures 205208 will show four of the most characteristic stages of growth but it should be remembered that there are intermediate stages between now we have noticed similar stages in the growth of a moth though a portion of them are concealed beneath the hard dense chrysalis skin the external differences between the larval and pupal states are fixed for a large part of the year in most butterflies and moths though even in this respect there is every possible variation some moths or butterflies passing through their transformations in a few weeks others requiring several months while still others take a year the majority of the moths living under ground in the pupa state for eight or nine months the stages of metamorphosis in the diptera are no more suddenly acquired than in the bee or butterfly in all these insects the rudiments of the wings legs and even of the ovipositor of the adult exist in the young larva we have found somewhat similar intermediate stages in the metamorphoses of the beetles the insects we have mentioned are those with a complete metamorphosis we have seen that even in them the term complete is a relative and not absolute expression and that the terms larva and pupa are convenient designations for states varying in duration and assumed to fulfil certain ends of existence and even then dependent on length of seasons variation in climate and even on the locality when we descend to the insects with an incomplete metamorphosis as in the may fly we find that as in the case of chloon sir john lubbock has described twentyone stages of existence and let him who can say where the larval ends and the pupal or imaginal stages begin so in a stronger sense with the grasshopper and cockroach the adult state in these insects is attained after a number of moults of the skin during each of which the insect gradually draws nearer to the final winged form but even the socalled pup or half winged individuals known not to be adult in some cases feel the sexual impulse while a number of species in each of the families represented by these two insects never acquire wings illustration 205 larva 206 semipupa 207 advanced semipupa 208 pupa early stages of the humble bee still how did the perfect metamorphosis arise we can only answer this indirectly by pointing to the panorpa and caddis flies with their nearly perfect metamorphosis though more nearly allied otherwise to those neuroptera with an incomplete metamorphosis as the lacewinged fly than the insects of any other suborder if among a group of insects such as the neuroptera we find different families with all grades of perfection in metamorphosis it is possible that larger and higher groups may exist in which these modes of metamorphosis may be fixed and characteristic of each had we more space for the exposition of many known facts the sceptic might perceive that by observing how arbitrary and dependent on the habits of the insects are the metamorphoses of some groups the fixed modes of other and more general groups may be seen to be probably due to biological causes or in other words have been acquired through changes of habits or of the temperature of the seasons and of climates many facts crowd upon us which might serve as illustrations and proofs of the position we have taken for instance though we have in tropics rainy and dry seasons when in the latter insects remain quiescent in the chrysalis state as in the temperate and frigid zones yet did not the change from the earlier ages of the globe when the temperature of the earth was nearly the same the world over to the times of the present distribution of heat and cold in zones possibly have its influence on the metamorphoses of insects and other animals it is a fact that the remains of those insects with a complete metamorphosis the bees butterflies and moths flies and beetles abound most in the later deposits while those with an incomplete metamorphosis are fewer in number and the earliest to appear again certain groups of insects are not found in the polar regions their absence is evidently due to the adverse climatic conditions of those regions the development of the same groups is striking in the tropics where the sum of environing conditions all tend to favor the multiplication of insect forms it should be observed that some insects as the grasshopper for example as mller says quit the egg in a form which is distinguished from that of the adult insect almost solely by the want of wings while the freshly hatched young of the bee we may add is farthest from the form of the adult it is evident that in the young grasshoppers the metamorphoses have been passed through so to speak in the egg while the bee larva is almost embryonic in its build the helpless young maggot of the wasp which is fed solely by the parent may be compared to the human infant while the lusty young grasshopper which immediately on hatching takes to the grass or clover field with all the enthusiasm of a duckling to its native pond may be likened to that young feathered mariner the lowest animals as a rule are at birth most like the adult so with the earliest known crustacea the king crabs and in all probability the primeval trilobites passed through their metamorphoses chiefly in the egg so in the ancient nebaliads peltocaris discinocaris and ceratiocaris if we may follow the analogy of the recent nebalia the young probably closely resembled the adult while the living crabs and shrimps usually pass through the most marked metamorphoses among the worms the highest and perhaps the most recent forms pass through the most remarkable metamorphoses illustration 209 jaws of ant lion another puzzle for the evolutionist to solve is how to account for the change from the caterpillar with its powerful jaws to the butterfly with its sucking or haustellate mouthparts we shall best approach the solution of this difficult problem by a study of a wide range of facts but a few of which can be here noticed the older entomologists divided insects into haustellate or suctorial and mandibulate or biting insects the butterfly being an example of one and the beetle serving to illustrate the other category but we shall find in studying the different groups that these are relative and not absolute terms we find mandibulate insects with enormous jaws like the dytiscus or chrysopa larva or ant lion perforated as in the former or enclosing as in the latter two insects the maxill b which slide backward and forward within the hollowed mandibles a fig 209 jaws of the ant lion along which the blood of their victims flows they suck the blood and do not tear the flesh of their prey the enormous mandibles of the adult corydalus are too large for use and as walsh observed are converted in the male into simple clasping organs and to omit a number of instances in the suctorial hemiptera or bugs we have different grades of structure in the mouthparts in the biting lice mallophaga the mouth is mandibulate in the thrips it is mandibulate the jaws being free and the maxill bearing palpi while the pediculi are suctorial and the true bugs are eminently so but in the bed bug it is easy to see that the beak is made up of the two pairs of jaws which are simply elongated and adapted for piercing and sucking among the socalled haustellate insects the mouthparts vary so much in different groups and such different organs separately or combined perform the function of sucking that the term haustellate loses its significance and even misleads the student for example in the house fly the tongue fig 210 l the mandibles m and maxill mp are useless a fleshy prolongation of the labium or second maxill is the sucker while the mandibles and maxill are used as lancets by the horse fly fig 211 m mandibles mx maxill the maxill in the butterfly are united to form the sucking tube while in the bee the end of the labium fig 212 is specially adapted for lapping not sucking the nectar of flowers but even in the butterfly or more especially the moth there is a good deal of misapprehension about the structure of the socalled tongue the mouthparts of the caterpillar exist in the moth the mandibles of the caterpillar occur in the head of the moth as two small tubercles fig 213 m they are aborted in the adult while the maxill are as a rule greatly developed in the moth in the caterpillar they are minute and almost useless the labium or second maxill so large in the moth serves simply as a spinneret in the caterpillar but we find a great amount of variation in the tongue or sucker of moths and in the silk moths the maxill are rudimentary and there is no tongue these organs being but little more developed than in the caterpillar figure 213 b shows the minute bladelike maxilla of the magnificent luna moth an approximation to the originally bladelike form in beetles and neuroptera the maxill in this insect are minute rudimentary and of no service to the creature which does not take food in other moths of the same family we have found the maxill longer and touching at their tips though too widely separate at base to form a sucking tube while in others the maxill are curved and meet to form a true tube illustration 210 mouthparts of the house fly illustration 211 mouthparts of horse fly illustration 212 head of humble bee illustration 213 mouthparts of moths in the cecropia moth it is difficult to trace the rudiments of the maxill at all and thus we have in the whole range of the moths every gradation from the wholly aborted maxill of the platysamia cecropia to those of macrosila cluentius of madagascar which form a tongue according to mr wallace nine and a quarter inches in length probably to enable their owner to probe the deep nectaries of certain orchids these changes in form and size are certainly correlated with important differences in habits and the evolutionist can as rightly say that the structural changes were induced by use and disuse and change of habits and the environment of the animal as on the other hand the advocate of special creation claims that the two are simply correlated and that is all we know about it illustration 214 ichneumon fly another set of organs placed on quite another region of the body unite to form the sting of the bee or its equivalent the ovipositor of other hymenopterous insects such as the ichneumon fly fig 214 the saw of the saw fly and the augur of the cicada these are all formed on the same plan arising early in the larval stage as three pairs of little tubercles which ultimately form long blades the innermost constituting the true ovipositor we have found that one pair of these organs forms the spring of the podura and that in these insects it is three jointed and thus is morphologically a pair of legs soldered together at their base we would venture to regard the ovipositor of insects as probably representing three pairs of abdominal legs comparable with those of the myriopods and even as we have suggested in another place the three pairs of jointed spinnerets of spiders thus the ovipositor of the bee has a history and is not apparently a special creation but a structure gradually developed to subserve the use of a defensive organ so the organs of special sense in insects are in most cases simply altered hairs the hairs themselves are modified epithelial cells the eyes of insects simple and compound are at first simply epithelial cells modified for a special purpose and even the egg is but a modified epithelial cell attached to the walls of the ovary which in turn is morphologically but a gland thus nature deals in simples and with her units of structure elaborates as her crowning work a temple in which the mind of man formed in the image of god may dwell her results are not the less marvellous because we are beginning to dimly trace the process by which they arise it should not lessen our awe and reverence for deity if with minds made to adore we also essay to trace the movements of his hand in the origin of the forms of life some writers of the evolution school are strenuous in the belief that the evolution hypothesis overthrows the idea of archetypes and plans of structure but a true genealogy of animals and plants represents a natural system and the types of animals be they four as cuvier taught or five or more are recognized by naturalists through the study of dry hard anatomical facts accepting then the type of articulates as founded in nature from the similar modes of development and points of structure perceived between the worms and the crustacea on the one hand and the worms and insects on the other have we not a strong genetic bond uniting these three great groups into one grand subkingdom and can we not in imagination perceive the successive steps by which the creator acting through the laws of evolution has built up the great articulate division of the animal kingdom

lower cambrian age the writer has through the kindness of prof torell seen specimens of these plants in the museum of the geological survey at stockholm mr murray of the canadian geological survey was the first to discover in america labrador straits of belle isle this same genus of plants they are described and figured by mr billings who speaks of them as slender cylindrical straight reedlike plants in the canadian naturalist for august 1872 should the terrestrial nature of these plants be established on farther evidence then we are warranted in supposing that there were isolated patches of land in the cambrian or primordial period and if there was land there must have been bodies of fresh water hence there may have been both terrestrial and aquatic insects possibly of forms like the podurids may flies perl mites and pauropus of the present day there was at any rate land in the upper silurian period as dr j w dawson describes land plants psilophyton from the lower heiderberg rocks of gaspe new brunswick corresponding in age with the ludlow rocks of england we might also state in this connection that dr dawson the eminent fossil botanist of montreal concludes from the immense masses of carbon in the form of graphite in the laurentian rocks of canada that the laurentian period was probably an age of most prolific vegetable growth whether the vegetation of the laurentian was wholly aquatic or in part terrestrial we have no means of knowing in 1855 dr t sterry hunt asserted that the presence of iron ores not less than that of graphite points to the existence of organic life even during the laurentian or socalled azoic period in 1861 he went farther and stated his belief in the existence of an abundant vegetation during the laurentian period the eophyton in labrador

ganin does not mention it of the development of the embryo of julus the thousand legs which according to newport hatches the 25th day after the egg is laid at this period the embryo is partially organized having faint traces of segments and is still enveloped in its embryonal membranes and retains its connection with the shell in this condition it remains for seventeen days when it throws off its embryonal membrane and becomes detached from the shell footnote 24 it is a suggestive fact that these deciduous forms give way through histolysis to true larval forms just as in some flies musca vomitoria the true larval form goes under and the adult form is built up from the imaginal disks of the larva in an analogous manner the deciduous pluteuscondition of the young echinoderm perishes and is absorbed by the growing body of the permanent adult stage this deciduous stage of the ichneumon may accordingly be termed the prelarval stage now as we find insects with and without this prelarval stage and in the radiates quite different degrees of metamorphoses the inquiry arises how far these differences are correlated with and consequently dependent upon the physical surroundings of these animals in the free swimming condition merely to point out the differences in the mode of development of animals is an interesting matter and one could do worse things but the philosophical naturalist cannot rest here he must seek how these differences were brought about footnote 25 leuckart in his great work die menschlichen parasiten p 700 after the analogy of hirudo which develops a primitive streak late in larval life ventures to consider the first indications of the germ of nemertes in its larval pilidium form as a primitive streak he also suggests that the development of the later larval forms of the echinoderms is the same in kind moreover nearly twenty years ago 1854 zaddach a german naturalist contended that the worms are closely allied in their mode of development to the insects and crustaceans he compares the mode of development of a leech clepsine and certain bristlebearing worms snuris lumbricatus and uaxes and we may now from kowalenskys researches 1871 add the common earth worm lumbricus in which there is no such metamorphosis as in the sea nereids to that of insects the mode of formation of the primitive band in the leeches and earth worms being much like that of insects this confirms the view of leuckart and ganin who both seem to have overlooked zaddachs remarks moreover the rings of the harder bodied worms as zaddach says contain chitine as in the insects zaddach also enters into farther details which in his opinion ally the worms nearer to the insects than many naturalists at his time were disposed to allow the singular echinoderes has some

times of their appearance must be necessarily vague and apply only in a very general way to the northern states insects appear in texas about six weeks earlier than in virginia in the middle states six weeks earlier than in northern new england and the northwestern states and in new england about six weeks earlier than in labrador the time of the appearance of insects corresponds to the time of the flowering or leafing out of certain trees and herbs for instance the larv of the american tent caterpillar and of the canker worm hatch just as the apple tree begins to leaf out a little later the plant lice appear to feast on the tender leaves and when during the first week in june our forests and orchards are fully leafed out hosts of insects are marshalled to ravage and devour their foliage the insects of early spring in april the gardener should scrape and wash thoroughly all his fruit trees so as to rub off the eggs of the bark lice which hatch out early in may many injurious caterpillars and insects of all kinds winter under loose pieces of bark or under matting and straw at the base of the trees search should also be made for the eggs of the canker worm and the american tent caterpillar which last are laid in bunches half an inch long on the terminal shoots of many of our fruit trees a little labor spent in this way will save many dollars worth of fruit the castings of the apple tree borer saperda bivittata should be looked for at the base of the tree and its ravages be promptly arrested its presence can also be detected it is said by the dark appearance of the bark where the grub is at work cut in and pull out the young grub it is the best time of the year to catch and kill this pest cylindrical bark borers which are little round black weevillike beetles often causing fireblight in pears etc are now flying about fruit trees to lay their eggs and many other weevils and boring beetles especially the pea weevil bruchus pisi fig 215 the pine weevil pissodes strobi fig 216 and hylobius pales and hylurgus terebrans also infesting the pine now abound and the collector can obtain many specimens not met with at other times illustration 215 pea weevil and maggot illustration 216 pine weevil and young the housewife must now guard against the intrusion of clothes moths tinea while many other species of minute moths tineids and of leafrollers tortricid will be flying about orchards and gardens just as the buds are beginning to unfold especially the coddling moth carpocapsa pomonella on warm days myriads of these and other insects may be seen filling the air it is the busiest time of their lives as all are on errands of love to their kind but of mischief to the agriculturist when the may flowero commendable flowre and most in

such as tachina fig 218 and its allies the four spotted mosquito anopheles quadrimaculatus and the delicate species of chironomus whose males have such beautifully feathered antenn assemble in swarms now is the time for the collector to turn up stones and sticks by the rivers side and in grassy damp pastures for ground beetles carabid and to frequent sunny paths for the gay cicindela and the bombylius fly or fish in brooks and pools for water beetles and various larv of neuroptera and diptera while many flies and beetles are attracted to freshly cut maples or birches running with sap indeed many insects rarely found elsewhere assemble in quantities about the stumps of these trees from which the sap oozes in march and april in april the injurious insects in the northern states have scarcely begun their work of destruction as the buds do not unfold before the first of may we give an account however of some of the beneficial insects which are now to be found in grasslands and in gardens the farmer should know his true insect friends as well as his insect foes we introduce to our readers a large family of groundbeetles carabid from carabus the name of the typical genus which prey on those insects largely injurious to crops a study of the figures will familiarize our readers with the principal forms they are darkcolored brown or black with metallic hues and are seen in spring and throughout the summer running in grass or lurking under stones and sticks in damp places whence they sally forth to hunt by night when many vegetableeating insects are most active illustration 219 calosoma scrutator illustration 220 calosoma calidum and larva the larv are found in much the same situations as the mature beetles they are elongate oblong and rather broad the

casnonia fig 223 c pensylvanica which has a long neck and spotted wing covers figure 224 pangus caliginosus and figure 225 agonum cupripenne represent two common forms the former is black while the latter is a pretty insect greenish with purplishred wingcovers and black legs figure 226 enlarged about three times represents a singular larva found by mr j h emerton under a stone early in spring dr leconte to whom we sent a figure supposes that it may possibly be a larva of harpalus or pangus caliginosus it is evidently a young carabid the under side is represented the insects of may during this month there is great activity among the insects as the flowers bloom and the leaves appear multitudes wake from their long winter sleep and during this month pass through the remainder of their transformations and prepare for the summer campaign most insects hibernate in the chrysalis or pupa state while many winter in the caterpillar or larva state such as the larv of several noctuid and the yellowbear and other caterpillars of arctia and its allies other insects hibernate in the adult or imago form either as beetles butterflies or certain species of bees it is well known that the queen humble bee winters under the moss or in her old nest during the present month her rovings seem to have a more definite object and she seeks some deserted mouses nest or hollow in a tree or stump and there stows away her pellets of pollen containing two or three eggs apiece which late in the summer are to form the nucleus of a wellappointed colony the carpenter bees ceratina and xylocopa the latter of which is found in abundance south of new england are busy in refitting and tunnelling the hollows of the grape while the ceratina hollows out the stem of the elder or blackberry this little upholsterer bee carpets her honeytight apartment storing it with food for her young and later in the season in june several of these cartridgelike cells whose silken walls resemble the finest and most delicate parchment may be found in the hollow stems of these plants the mason bee osmia places her nest in a more exposed site building her earthen cells of pellets of moistened mud either situated under a stone or in some more sheltered place for instance in a deserted oakgall ranging half a dozen of them side by side along the vault of this strange domicile meanwhile their more lowly relatives the andrena and halictus bees are engaged in tunnelling the side of some sunny bank or path running long galleries underground sometimes for a foot or more at the farthest end of which are to be found in summer little earthen urnlike cells in which the grubs live upon the pollen stored up for them in little balls of the size of a pea later in the month the gall flies cynips those physiological puzzles sting the leaves of our oaks of different species giving rise to the strange excrescences and manifold deformities which deface the stems and leaves of our most beautiful forest trees

have found the rare larva of melita phaeton fig 229 clothed in the richest red and velvety black feeding daintily upon the hazel nut and tender leaves of the golden rod in june it changes to the chrysalis state and early in july the butterfly rises from the cold damp bogs where we have oftenest found it clad in its rich dress of velvety black and red later still when the lilac blooms and

squash plants before they are fairly up and the plum weevil conotrachelus nenuphar fig 232 will sting the newly formed fruit late in the month or early in june many other weevils now abound stinging the seeds and fruit and depositing their eggs just under the skin so immense are the numbers of insects which fill the air and enliven the fields and woodlands just as summer comes in that a bare enumeration of them would overcrowd our pages and tire the reader illustration 233 may fly a word however about our water insects late in the month the may fly ephemera fig 233 appears often rising in immense numbers from the surface of pools and sluggish brooks in europe whole clouds of these delicate forms with their thin white wings have been known to fall like snow upon the ground when the peasants gather them up in heaps to enrich their gardens and farms the case worms or caddis flies fig 234 begin now to leave their portable houses formed of pieces of leaves or sticks and fine gravel or even of shells as in an european species and fly over the water resting on the overhanging trees a few busy mosquito hawks or dragon flies libellula herald the coming of the summer brood of these indefatigable friends of the agriculturist during their whole life below the waters these entomological herods have slain and sucked the blood of myriads of infant mosquitoes and other insects and now

destructor has two broods the fly appearing both in spring and autumn the fly lays twenty or thirty eggs in a crease in the leaf of the young plant in about four days in warm weather they hatch and the palered larv crawl down the leaf working their way in between it and the main stalk passing downward till they come to a joint just above which they remain a little below the surface of the ground with the head towards the root of the plant here they imbibe the sap by suction alone and by the simple pressure of their bodies become imbedded in the side of the stem two or three larv thus imbedded serve to weaken the plant and cause it to wither and die the second brood of larv remains through the winter in the flaxseed or puparium by turning the stubble with the plough in the autumn and early spring its imago may be destroyed and thus its ravages may be checked figure 237 represents the female which is about onethird as large as a mosquito a the larva b the pupa and c represents the joint

fig 49 flies at this time and in august its larva feeds on the grape sphinx gordius s 5maculata fig 239 and other sphinges and sesia the clearwinged moth appear the last of may arctia arge a virgo a phalerata and other species fly from the last of may through the summer hyphantria textor the fallweaver is found in may or june the moth of the saltmarsh caterpillar appears at this time and various cut worms agrotis fig 240 abound hiding in the daytime under stones and sticks etc while various tineids and tortrices or leafrolling caterpillars begin to devour tender leaves and buds and opening blossoms of flowers and fruit trees illustration 239 sphinx 5maculata larva and pupa illustration 240 cut worm and moth the whitepine weevil flies about in warm days we have found its burrows winding irregularly over the inner surface of the bark and leading into the sapwood each cell in which it hibernates in the middle of march contains the yellowish white footless grub early in april it changes to a pupa and a month after the beetle appears and in a few days deposits its egg under the bark of old pine trees it also oviposits in the terminal shoots of pine saplings dwarfing and permanently deforming the tree associated with this weevil we have found the smaller rounder more cylindrical whitish grubs of the hylurgus terebrans which mines the inner layers of the bark slightly grooving the sapwood later in april it pupates and its habits accord in general with those of pissodes strobi another pine weevil also abounds at this time as well as otiorhynchus picipes fig 241 which injures beans etc illustration 241 garden weevil cylindrical barkborers which are little round weevillike beetles are now flying about fruit trees to lay their eggs in the bark associated with the pissodes we may find in april the galleries of tomicus pini branching out from a common centre they are filled up with fine sawdust and according to dr fitch are notched in the sides in which the eggs have been placed where they would remain undisturbed by the beetle as it crawled backwards and forth through the gallery these little beetles have not the long snouts of the weevils hence they cannot bore through the outer bark but enter into the burrows made the preceding year and distribute the eggs along the sides fitch another tomicus more dangerous than the preceding feeds exclusively in the sapwood running solitary galleries for a distance of two inches towards the centre of the tree we figure tomicus xylographus say fig 242 enlarged it is the most formidable enemy to the white pine in the north and the yellow pine in the south that we have it also flies in may ptinus fur fig 243 much enlarged is now found in outhouses and is destructive to cloth furs etc resembling the larderbeetle dermestes in its habits it is fourteen hundredths of an inch in length illustration 242 pine weevil illustration 243 ptinus and larva the insects of june early in the month the parsnip butterfly papilio asterias may be seen flying about preparatory to laying its eggs for the brood of caterpillars which appear in august at the time of the flowering of the raspberry and blackberry the young larva of vanessa antiopa one of our most abundant butterflies may be found living socially on the leaves of the willow while the mature larva of another much smaller butterfly the little copper skipper chrysophanus americans so abundant at this time may sometimes be found on the clover it is a short oval greenish worm with very short legs the duncolored skippers hesperia abound towards the middle of the month darting over the flowers of the blueberry and blackberry in sunny openings in the forests the family of hawk moths sphinges now appear in greater abundance hovering at twilight over flowerbeds and during this time deposit their eggs on the leaves of various fruittrees the american tent caterpillar makes its cocoon and assumes the pupa state the caterpillar passes several days within the cocoon in what may be called the semipupa states during which period the chrysalis skin is forming beneath the contracted and loosened larva skin we once experimented on a larva which had just completed its cocoon to learn how much silk it could produce on removing its cocoon it made another of the same thickness but on destroying this second one it spun a third but frail web scarcely concealing its form a minute ichneumon parasite allied to platygaster lays its eggs within those of this moth as we once detected one under a bunch of eggs and afterwards reared a few from the same lot of eggs a still more minute eggparasite fig 244 we have seen ovipositing in the early spring in the eggs of the cankerworm illustration 244 canker worm eggparasite among that beautiful family of moths the phalnid comprising the geometers loopers or spanworms are two formidable foes to fruit growers the habits of the canker worm should be well known with proper care and welldirected energy we believe their attacks can be in a great measure prevented the english sparrow doves and other insectivorous birds if there are any others that eat them should be domesticated in order to reduce the number of these pests more care than has yet been taken should be devoted to destroying the eggs laid in the autumn and also the wingless females as they crawl up the trees in the spring and autumn to lay their eggs the evil is usually done before the farmer is well aware that the calamity has fallen upon him as soon as and even before the trees have fairly leafed out they should be visited morning noon and night shaken and thoroughly examined and cleared of the caterpillars by wellconcerted action among agriculturists who should form a board of destruction numbering every man woman and child on the farm this fearful scourge may be abated by the simplest means as the cholera or any epidemic disease can in a great measure be averted by taking proper sanitary precautions the canker worms hatch out during the early part of may from eggs laid in the fall and spring on the branches of various fruittrees just as the buds unfold the young caterpillars make little holes through the tender leaves eating the pulpy portions not touching the veins and midribs when four weeks old they creep to the ground or let themselves down by spinning a silken thread and burrow from two to six inches in the soil where they change to chrysalids in a day or two and in this state live till late in the fall or until the early spring when they assume the imago or moth form the sexes then unite and the eggs are deposited for the next generation the canker worm is widely distributed though its ravages used to be confined mostly to the immediate vicinity of boston we have seen specimens of the moth from illinois riley has found it in missouri illustration 245 abraxas ribearia the abraxas ribearia of fitch fig 245 moth the wellknown currant worm defoliates whole rows of currant bushes this pretty caterpillar may be easily known by its body being of a deep golden color spotted with black the bushes should be visited morning noon and night and thoroughly shaken killing the caterpillars and sprinkled with ashes illustration 246 may beetle and young among multitudes of beetles coleoptera injurious to the crops are the may beetle lachnosterna fusca fig 246 whose larva a large white grub is injurious to the roots of grass and to strawberry vines the rose beetle appears about the time of the blossoming of the rose the fireflies now show their light during mild evenings and on hot sultry days the shrill rasping song of the male cicada for they all have voiceless wives cuts the air the chinchbug that fell destroyer of our wheat crops appears according to harris in the middle of the month and may be seen in their various stages of growth on all kinds of grain on corn and herdsgrass during the whole summer so widely spread is this insect at present that we have even detected it in august on the summit of mount washington illustration 247 pemphigus the diptera or twowinged flies contain hosts of noxious insects such as the various cecidomyians or twowinged gall flies which now sting the culms of the wheat and grasses and various grains and leaves of trees producing galllike excrescences of varying form legions of these delicate minute flies fill the air at twilight hovering over wheat fields and shrubbery a strong north west wind at such times is of incalculable value to the farmer moreover minute flies allied to the house fly such as tephritis oscinis etc now attack the young cereals doing immense injury to grain illustration 248 apple bark louse millions of aphides or plant lice now infest our shade and fruit trees crowding every green leaf into which they insert their tiny beaks sucking in the sap causing the leaves to curl up and wither they also attack the stems and even the roots of plants though these latter pemphigus fig 247 differ generically from the true plant lice fruit trees should be again washed and rubbed to kill off the young bark lice of which the common apple bark louse aspidiotus conchiformis fig 248 whose oystershaped scales may be found in myriads on neglected trees is a too familiar example another pest of apple trees is the woolly blight eriosoma lanigera these insects secrete from the surface of the body a downy cottony substance which conceals the animal and when they are as usual grouped together on the trees makes them look like patches of mould the natural insect enemies of the plant lice now abound such are the lady bugs coccinella fig 249 the larva of the syrphus fly fig 76 which devours immense quantities and the larva of the goldeneyed lacewinged fly chrysopa fig 256 illustration 249 coccinella and young the last days of june are literally the heyday and jubilee of insect life the entomological world holds high carnival though in this country they are perhaps more given to massmeetings and caucuses the earth the air and the water teem with insect life the insects of midsummer now appear among the butterflies the wood satyrus neonympha eurythris skips in its low flight through the pines the larva of grapta progne appears on the currants and feeds beneath the leaves on hot sunny days the larva of cynthia cardui may be found on the hollyhocks the pupa state lasts twelve days the butterfly appearing in the middle or last of july the hyphantria textor now lays its smooth spherical eggs in broad patches on the under side of the leaves of the apple which the caterpillar will ravage in august and its ally the halesidota cary we have found ovipositing the last week in the month on the leaves of the butternut the squash bug coreus gonocerus tristis fig 250 is now very abundant gathering about the roots of the squash vines often in immense numbers blackening the stems with their dark blackishbrown bodies this insect is easily distinguished from the yellow striped squash beetle previously mentioned by its much greater size and its entirely different structure and habits it is a true bug hemipter of which the bedbug is an example piercing the leaves and stalks and drawing out the sap with its long sucker illustration 250 squash bug in june also we have found that beautiful butterfly milita phaeton rising from the low cold swamps its larva transforms early in june or the last week in may into a beautiful chrysalis the larva hibernates through the winter and may be found early in spring feeding on the leaves of the aster the viburnum dentatum and hazel it is black and deep orangered with long thickset black spines the currant borer trochilium tipuliforme fig 251 a beautiful slender agile deep blue moth with transparent wings flies the last of the month about currant bushes and its chrysalids may be found in may in the stems among moths that of the american tent caterpillar flies during the last of june and july and its white cocoons can be detected under bark and in sheltered parts of fences and outhouses among others of the interesting group of silk worms bombycid are lithosa crocota and allies which fly in the daytime and the different species of arctia and the white arctians spilosoma and leucarctia the parent of the saltmarsh caterpillar illustration 251 currant moth many leaf rollers tortrices are rolling up leaves in various ways for their habitations and to conceal them from too prying birds and hosts of young tineans are now mining leaves and excavating the interior of seeds and various fruits grapegrowers should guard against the attacks of a species of tortrix penthina vitivorana which rolls the leaves of the grape and according to mr m c reed of hudson ohio in midsummer deposits its eggs in the grape a single egg in a grape its presence is soon indicated by a reddish color on that side of the yet green grape and on opening it the winding channel opened by the larva in the pulp is seen and the minute worm which is white with a dark head is found at the end of the channel it continues to feed upon the pulp of the fruit and when it reaches the seeds eats out their interior and if the supply from one grape is extinguished before its growth is completed it fastens this to an adjoining grape with a web and burrows into it it finally grows to about onehalf of an inch in length becomes brown almost black the head retaining its cinnamon color when it leaves the grape it is very active and has the power of letting itself down by a thread of silk all my efforts to obtain the cocoons failed until i placed fresh grape leaves in the jar containing the grapes the larv immediately betook themselves to these and cutting a curved line through the leaf thus sometimes two lines thus folded the edge or edges over and in the fold assumed the chrysalis form from specimens saved i shall hope to obtain the perfect insect this season and perhaps obtain information which will aid in checking its increase already it is so abundant that it is necessary to examine every branch of ripe grapes and clip out the infested berries before sending them to the table a rapid increase in its numbers would interfere seriously with the cultivation of the grape in this locality the rose beetle macrodactyla subspinosa appears in great abundance the various species of buprestis are abundant among them are the peachborer dicerca divaricata which may be now found flying about peach and cherry trees and chrysobothris fulvogutta and c harrisii about white pines a large weevil arrhenodes septentrionalis which lives under the bark of the white oak appears in june and july the chinch bug begins its terrible ravages in the wheat fields the various species of chrysopa or lacewinged flies appear during this month the insects of july during midsummer the bees and wasps are very busy building their nests and rearing their young the humble bees late in june and the first of this month send out their first broods of workers and about the middle of the month the second lot of eggs are laid which produce the smallersized females and males while eggs laid late in the month and early in august produce the largersized queens which soon hatch these hibernate the habits of their peculiar parasite apathus an insect which closely resembles the humble bee are still unknown illustration 252 whitefaced wasp the leafcutter bee megachile may be seen flying about with pieces of roseleaf with which she builds for a period of twenty days her cells often thirty in number using for this purpose according to mr f w putnams estimate32 at least one thousand pieces the bees referred to worked so diligently that they ruined five or six rosebushes not leaving a single unblighted leaf uncut and were then forced to take the leaves of a locust tree as a substitute the papermaking wasps of which vespa maculata fig 252 the whitefaced wasp is our largest species are now completing their nests and feeding their young with flies the solitary wasp odynerus albophaleratus fills its earthen cells with minute caterpillars which it paralyzes with its poisonous sting a group of mudcells each stored with food for the single larva within we once found concealed in a deserted nest of the american tent caterpillar numerous species of wood wasps crabronid are engaged in tunnelling the stems of the blackberry the elder and syringa and enlarging and refitting old nail holes and burrowing in rotten wood storing their cells with flies caterpillars aphides and spiders according to the habit of each species eumenes fraterna which attaches its single large thinwalled cell of mud to the stems of plants is according to dr t w harris known to store it with canker worms pelopus the muddauber is now building its earthen cells plastering them on old rafters and stone walls the saw flies tenthredo etc abound in our gardens this month the selandria vitis attacks the vine while selandria ros the rose slug injures the rose the disgusting pear slugworm s cerasi often live twenty to thirty on a leaf eating the parenchyma or softer tissues leaving the blighted leaf the leaves should be sprinkled with a mixture of whaleoil soap and water in the proportion of two pounds of soap to fifteen gallons of water illustration 253 imported cabbage butterfly among the butterflies melita ismeria in the south and m harrisii in the north are sometimes seen a second brood of colias philodice the common sulphuryellow butterfly appears and pieris oleracea visits turnippatches it lays its eggs in june on the leaves and the fullgrown darkgreen hairy larva may be found in august the pieria rap or imported cabbage butterfly fig 253 male is now also abundant its green hairy larva is fearfully prevalent about boston and new york the last of the month a new brood of grapta comma appears and a second brood of the larva of chrysophanus americanus may be found on the sorrel the larv of pyrrarctia isabella hatch out the first week in july and the snuffcolored moth enters our windows at night in company with a host of nightflying moths these large moths many of which are injurious to crops are commonly thought to feed on clothes and carpets the true carpet and clothes moths are minute species which flutter noiselessly about our apartments their narrow feathery wings are edged with long silken fringes and almost the slightest touch kills them illustration 254 apple borer larva and pupa illustration 255 lady bug and pupa among beetles the various borers such as the saperda or apple tree borer fig 254 are now pairing and fly in the hot sun about trees nearly each tree has its peculiar enemy which drives its galleries into the trunk and branches of the tree among the tiger beetles frequenting sandy places the large cicindela generosa and the cicindela hirticollis are most common the grotesque larv live in deep holes in sandbanks illustration 256 lacewinged fly and eggs illustration 257 forcepstail the ninespotted lady bug coccinella novemnotata fig 255 with pupa is one of a large group of beetles most beneficial from their habit of feeding on the plant lice we figure another enemy of the aphides chrysopa and its eggs fig 256 mounted each on a long silken stalk thus placed above the reach of harm among other beneficial insects belonging to the neuroptera is the immense family of libellulid or dragon flies the forcepstail or panorpa p rufescens fig 257 is found in bushy fields and shrubbery they prey on smaller insects and the males are armed at the extremity of the body with an enormous forcepslike apparatus the insects of august during this month great multitudes of bugs hemiptera are found in our fields and gardens and to this group of insects the present chapter will be devoted they are nearly all injurious to crops as they live on the sap of plants stinging them with their long suckers their continued attacks cause the leaves to wither and blight the grain aphis in certain years desolates our wheat fields we have seen the heads black with these terrible pests they pierce the grain extract the sap causing it to shrink and lose the greater part of its bulk it is a most insidious and difficult foe to overcome illustration 258 leafhopper of the vine the various leafhoppers tettigonia fig 258 and ceresa abound on the leaves of plants sadly blighting them and the tettigonias frequent damp wet swampy places a very abundant species on grass produces what is called frogs spittle it can easily be traced through all its changes by frequently examining the mass of froth which surrounds it tettigonia vitis blights the leaf of the grapevine it is a tenth of an inch long and is strawyellow striped with red tettigonia ros a still smaller species infests the rose often to an alarming extent the notonecta or water boatman is much like a tettigonia but its wings are transparent on the outer half and its legs are fringed with long hairs being formed for swimming it rows over the surface in pursuit of insects notonecta undulata say fig 259 is a common form in new england another insect hunter is the singular ranatra fusca fig 260 it is light brown in color with a long respiratory tube which it raises above the surface of the water when it wishes to breathe this species connects the waterboatman with the waterskaters or gerris a familiar insect of which gerris paludum fig 261 is commonly seen running over the surface of streams and pools illustration 259 notonecta illustration 260 ranatra illustration 261 water skater illustration 262 pirates reduvius and its allies belong to a large family of very useful insects as they prey largely on caterpillars and noxious insects such is pirates picipes fig 262 a common species it is an ally of reduvius personates a valued friend to man as in europe it destroys the bedbug its specific name is derived from its habit while immature of concealing itself in a case of dust the better to approach its prey illustration 263 phymata another friend of the agriculturist is the phymata erosa fig 263 mr f g sanborn states that these insects have been taken in great numbers upon the linden trees in the city of boston and were seen in the act of devouring the aphides which have infested the shade trees of that city for several years past they are described by a gentleman who watched their operations with great interest as stealing up to a louse coolly seizing and tucking it under the arm then inserting the beak and sucking it dry they are supposed to feed also on other vegetableeating insects as well as the plant louse phytocoris lineolaris swarms in our gardens during this month it is described and figured in harriss treatise on insects closely allied though generally wingless is that enemy of our peace the bedbug it has a small somewhat triangular head orbicular thorax and large round flattened abdomen it is generally wingless having only two small wingpads instead the eggs are oval white the young escape by pushing off a lid at one end of the shell they are white transparent differing from the perfect insect in having a broad triangular head and short thick antenn indeed this is the general form of lice pediculus vestimenti and p capitis to which the larva of cimex has the closest affinity some cimices are parasites infesting pigeons swallows etc in this way also showing their near relation to lice besides the reduvius the cockroach is the natural enemy of the bedbug and destroys large numbers houses have been cleared of bugs after being thoroughly fumigated with brimstone during this month the ravages of grasshoppers are in the west very widespread we have received from major f hawn of leavenworth kansas a most interesting account of the redlegged locust caloptenus femurrubrum they commence depositing their eggs in the latter part of august they are fusiform slightly gibbous and of a buffcolor they are placed about threefourths of an inch beneath the surface in a compact mass around a vertical axis pointing obliquely up and outwards and are partially cemented together the whole presenting a cylindrical structure not unlike a small cartridge they commence hatching in march but it requires a range of temperature above 60 f to bring them to maturity and under such conditions they become fledged in thirtythree days and in from three to five days after they enter upon their migratory flight their instincts are very strong when food becomes scarce at one point a portion of them migrate to new localities and this movement takes place simultaneously over large areas in their progress they stop at no obstacle they can surmount in these excursions they often meet with other trains from an opposite direction when both join in one the insects are voracious but discriminating in their choice of food yet i know of no plant they reject if pressed by hunger not even the foliage of shrubs and trees including pine and cedar illustration 264 seventeen year locust eggs and pupa during this month the seventeenyear locust cicada septendecim of linnus fig 264 has disappeared and only a few harvest flies as the two other species we have are called raise their shrill cry during the dogdays but as certain years are marked by the appearance of vast swarms in the middle states we cannot do better than to give a brief summary of its history which we condense in part from dr harris work the seventeenyear locust ranges from southeastern and western massachusetts to louisiana of its distribution west of the mississippi valley we have no accurate knowledge in southern massachusetts they appear in oak forests about the middle of june after pairing the female by means of her powerful ovipositor bores a hole obliquely to the pith and lays therein from ten to twenty slender white eggs which are arranged in pairs somewhat like the grains on an ear of wheat and implanted in the limb she thus oviposits several times in a twig and passes from one to another until she has laid four or five hundred eggs after this she soon dies the eggs hatch in about two weeks though some observers state that they do not hatch for from forty to over fifty days after being laid the active grubs are provided with three pairs of legs after leaving the egg they fall to the ground burrow into it and seek the roots of plants whose juices they suck by means of their long beaks they sometimes attack the roots of fruit trees such as the pear and apple they live nearly seventeen years in the larva state and then in the spring change to the pupa which chiefly differs from the larva by having rudimentary wings the damage done by the larv and pup then consists in their sucking the sap from the roots of forest and occasionally fruit trees regarding its appearance mr l b case writes us june 15 from richmond indiana just now we are having a tremendous quantity of locusts in our forests and adjoining fields and people are greatly alarmed about them some say they are egyptian locusts etc this morning they made a noise in the woods about half a mile east of us very much like the continuous sound of frogs in the early spring or just before a storm at evening it lasted from early in the morning until evening mr v t chambers writes us that it is abounding in the vicinity of covington kentucky in common with a large portion of the western country he points out some variations in color from those described by dr fitch from new york and states that those occurring in kentucky are smaller than those of which the measurements are given by dr fitch and states that these differences indicate that the groups appearing in different parts of the country at intervals of seventeen years are of different varieties a careful comparison of large numbers collected from different broods in different localities and different years would alone give the facts to decide this interesting point mr riley has shown that in the southern states a variety appears every thirteen years regarding the question raised by mr chambers whether the sting of this insect is poisonous and which he is inclined to believe to be in part true we might say that naturalists generally believe it to be harmless no hemiptera are known to be poisonous that is to have a poisongland connected with the sting like that of the bee and careful dissections by the eminent french naturalist lacazeduthiers of three european species of cicada have not revealed any poison apparatus at the base of the sting another proof that it does not pour poison into the wound made by the ovipositor is that the twig thus pierced and wounded does not swell as in the case of plants wounded by gall flies which perhaps secrete an irritating poison giving rise to tumors of various shapes many insects sting without poisoning the wound the bite of the mosquito black fly flea the bed bug and other hemipterous insects are simply punctured wounds the saliva introduced being slightly irritant and to a perfectly healthy constitution they are not poisonous though they may grievously afflict some persons causing the adjacent parts to swell and in some weak constitutions induce severe sickness regarding this point mr chambers writes i have heardnot through the paperswithin a few days past of a child within some twenty miles of this place dying from the sting of a cicada but have not had an opportunity to inquire into the truth of the story but the following you may rely on a negro woman in the employment of a v winston esq at burlington boone county ky fifteen miles distant from here went barefooted into his garden a few days since and while there was stung or bitten in the foot by a cicada the foot immediately swelled to huge proportions but by various applications the inflammation was allayed and the woman recovered mr winston who relates this stands as high for intelligence and veracity as any one in this vicinity i thought on first hearing the story that probably the sting was by some other insect but mr winston says that he saw the cicada but perhaps this proves that the sting is not fatal that depends on the subject some persons suffer terribly from the bite of a mosquito while others scarcely feel them the cuticle of a negros foot is nearly impenetrable and perhaps the sting would have been more dangerous in a more tender part it is not improbable that the sting was made by a wasp stizus which preys on the cicada dr le baron and mr riley believe the wound to be made by the beak which is the more probable solution of the problem a word more about the seventeenyear cicada professor orton writes us from yellow springs ohio that this insect has done great damage to the apple peach and quince trees and is shortening the fruit crop very materially by boring into twigs bearing fruit the branches break and the fruit goes with them many orchards have lost full two years growth though the plum and cherry trees seemed exempt they attacked the grape blackberry raspberry elm white and slippery maple white ash willow catalpa honeylocust and wild rose we have traces of the cicada this year from columbus ohio to st louis washington and philadelphia have also had a visitation illustration 265 hop vine moth and young illustration 266 humble bee parasite we figure the hopvine moth and the larva fig 265 which abound on hops the last of summer also the ilythia colonella fig 266 a pupa known in england to be a parasite of the humble bee we have frequently met with it here though not in humble bees nests the larv feed directly upon the young bees according to curtis farm insects the spindleworm moth gortyna ze whose caterpillar lives in the stalks of indian corn and also in dahlias flies this month the withering of the leaves when the corn is young shows the presence of this pest the beetles of various cylindrical bark borers and blight beetles tomicus and scolytus appear again this month during this month the tree cricket oecanthus niveus fig 267 lays its eggs in the branches of peach trees it will also eat tobacco leaves illustration 267 tree cricket we figure 268 the moth of ennomos subsignaria the larva of which is so injurious to shade trees in new york city it is a widely diffused species occurring probably throughout the northern states we have taken the moth in northern maine we have received from mr w v andrews the supposed larv of this moth they are loopers that is they walk with a looping gait as if measuring off the ground they walk over whence the name geometers more usually applied to them they are rather stout brown and roughened like a twig of the tree they inhabit with an unusually large rustred head and red proplegs while the tip of the body is also red they are a little over an inch long illustration 268 ennomos subsignaria the insects of september few new insects make their first appearance for the season during this month most of the species which abound in the early part of the month are the august forms which live until they are killed by the frosts late in the month from this cause there is towards the end of the month a very sensible diminution of the number of insects the early frosts warn these delicate creatures of approaching cold hence the whole insect population is busied late in the month in looking out snug winter quarters or providing for the continuance of the species warned by the cool and frosty nights multitudes of caterpillars prepare to spin their dense silken cocoons which guard them against frost and cold such are the spinners as the germans call them the silk moths of which the american silk worm is a fair example the last of september it spins its dense cocoon in which it hibernates in the chrysalis state the larv of those moths such as the sphinges or hawk moths which spin no cocoon descend deep into the earth where they transform into chrysalids and lie in deep earthen cocoons the wild bees may now be found frequenting flowers in considerable numbers both sexes of the humble bee the leafcutter bee and other smaller genera abound during the warm days ones attention during an unusually warm and pleasant day in this month is attracted by clouds of insects filling the air especially towards sunset when the slanting rays of the sun shine through the winged hosts on careful investigation these insects will prove to be nearly all ants and perhaps to belong to a single species looking about on the ground an unusual activity will be noticed in the anthills this is the swarming of the ants the autumnal brood of females has appeared and this is their marriage day the history of a formicarium or ants nest is as follows the workers only hibernate and are found early in the spring taking care of the eggs and larv produced by the autumnal brood of females in the course of the summer these eggs and larva arrive at maturity and swarm on a hot sultry day usually early in september the females after their marriage flight for the small diminutive males seek their company at this time descend and enter the ground to lay their eggs for new colonies or as westwood states they are often seized by the workers and retained in the old colonies having no more inclination to fly they pluck off their wings and may be seen running about wingless dr c c abbot gives us the following account of the swarming of a species in new jersey on the afternoon of oct 6th at about 4 p m we were attracted to a part of the large yard surrounding our home by a multitude of large sized insects that filled the air and appeared to be of some unusual form of insect life judging of them from a distance on closer inspection these creatures proved to be a brood of red ants formica that had just emerged from their underground home and were now for the first time using their delicate wings the sky at the time was wholly overcast the wind strong southeast thermometer 66 fahr taking a favorable position near the mass as they slowly crawled from the ground up the blades of grass and stems of clover and small weeds we noted first that they seemed dazed without any method in their movements save an illdefined impression that they must go somewhere again they were pushed forward usually by those coming after them which seemed to add to their confusion as a brood or colony of insects their every movement indicated that they were wholly ill at ease once at the end of a blade of grass they seemed even more puzzled as to what to do if not followed by a fellow ant as was usually the case they would invariably fall down again to the earth and sometimes repeat this movement until a new comer joined in the ascent when the uncertain individual would be forced to use his wings this flight would be inaugurated by a very rapid buzzing of the wings as though to dry them or prove their owners power over them but which it is difficult to say after a short rest the violent movement of the wings would recommence and finally losing fear as it were the ant would let go his hold upon the blade of grass and rise slowly upwards it could in fact scarcely be called flight the steady vibration of the wings simply bore them upwards ten twenty or thirty feet until they were caught by a breeze or by the steadier wind that was moving at an elevation equal to the height of the surrounding pine and spruce trees so far as we were able to discover their wings were of the same use to them in transporting them from their former home that the wings of many seeds are in scattering them both are wholly at the mercy of the winds mr bates in describing the habits of the saba ants oecodoma cephalotes says33 the successful dbut of the winged males and females depends likewise on the workers it is amusing to see the activity and excitement which reign in an ants nest when the exodus of the winged individuals is taking place the workers clear the roads of exit and show the most lively interest in their departure although it is highly improbable that any of them will return to the same colony the swarming or exodus of the winged males and females of the saba ant takes place in january and february that is at the commencement of the rainy season they come out in the evening in vast numbers causing quite a commotion in the streets and lanes we have quoted this passage from mr bates fascinating book because of the great similarity and dissimilarity in the movements of the two species at this period of their existence remembering at the time the above remarks concerning the south american species we looked carefully for the workers in this instance and failed to discover above half a dozen wingless ants above ground and these were plodding about very indifferent as it appeared to us to the fate or welfare of their winged brothers and on digging down a few inches we could find but comparatively few individuals in the nest and could detect no movements on their parts that referred to the exodus of winged individuals then going on on the other hand the time of day agrees with the remarks of mr bates when we first noticed them about 4 p m they had probably just commenced their flight it continued until nearly 7 p m or a considerable time after sundown the next morning there was not an individual winged or wingless to be seen above ground the nest itself was comparatively empty and what few occupants there were seemed to be in a semitorpid condition were they simply resting after the fatigue and excitement of yesterday it was not possible for us to calculate what proportion of these winged ants were carried by the wind too far to return to their old home but certainly a large proportion were caught by the surrounding trees and we found on search some of these crawling down the trunks of the trees with their wings in a damaged condition how near the trees must be for them to reach their old home we should like to learn and what tells them which road to take dr duncan states34 it was formerly supposed that the females which alighted at a great distance from their old nests returned again but huber having great doubts upon this subject found that some of them after having left the males fell on to the ground in outoftheway places whence they could not possibly return to the original nest we unfortunately did not note the sex of those individuals that we intercepted in their return trip but we can not help expressing our belief that at least in this case there was scarcely an appreciable amount of returning on the part of those whose exodus we have just described although so many were caught by the nearer trees and shrubbery is it probable that these insects could find their way to a small underground nest where there was no travel in the vicinity other than the steady departure of individuals who like themselves were terribly bothered with the wings they were carrying about with them american naturalist we have noticed that those females that do not return to the old nest found new ones in maine and massachusetts we have for several successive years noticed the swarming of certain species of ants during an unusually warm and sultry day early in september the autumnal brood of plant lice now occur in great numbers on various plants the last brood however does not consist exclusively of males and females for of some of the wingless individuals previously supposed to be perfect insects of both sexes dr w i burnett found that many were in reality of the ordinary gemmiparous form such as those composing the early summer broods the white pine plant lice lachnus strobi may be seen laying their long string of black oval eggs on the needles of the pine they are accompanied by hosts of twowinged flies ichneumons and in the night by many moths which feed on the aphishoney they secrete and which drops upon the leaves beneath footnotes footnote 30

scientific treatise as the one whose features we have briefly sketched and we can only conclude our notice of it by advising all our natural history readers to make its acquaintance there is no work we should prefer to it as a book for the student for it is a treatise which displays an absolute avoidance of mere compilation and it is pervaded by such a tone of earnestness and contains so many original observations that the reader is inducted by it out of the usual bookland of idealism into the substantial region of actuality and factscientific opinion london too often do we meet with a
