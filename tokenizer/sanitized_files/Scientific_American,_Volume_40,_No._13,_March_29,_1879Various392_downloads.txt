everything in the way of heavy labor to the saving of muscle and energy that may be more profitably employed and since inventive genius has devised means of governing steam with absolute accuracy there seems to be no limit to its economical application a recent invention in steam engineering which exhibits in a marked degree the controllability and adaptability of steam is mr herbert wadsworths steam tiller an engraving of which we present herewith illustration fig 1 2 3 this machine fig 1 is provided with a steam cylinder similar to the cylinder of a steam engine containing a piston the rod of which is attached to a crosshead a that slides on ways b secured to the bed supporting the cylinder the tiller d as it is carried to starboard or port slides through a socket e pivoted to the crosshead the motion of the rudder is communicated to the steam cutoff by means of the shaft c crank j rod k crank i and the hollow valve spindle when the tiller is amidships the valve handle h is at right angles to the cylinder and parallel to the tiller by moving the lever h to right or left steam is admitted to one end or the other of the cylinder which acting on the tiller through the piston piston rod and crosshead moves the rudder and when the rudder reaches the desired position the cutoff will have been moved the amount necessary to prevent further entrance of steam when the rudder is influenced by the waves or by the expansion or contraction of steam the cutoff alters its position in relation to the valve and automatically arranges the steam passages so that the piston is returned to its proper position the details of the cutoff are shown in fig 2 the valve g which covers the cutoff f acts like a four way cock the spindle of the cutoff f is connected with the lever i and is moved by the rudder as already described by enlarging or gradually narrowing the ends of the steam ports great rigidity or elasticity may be given to the hold of this engine according to the requirements of the particular vessel few and simple as are the parts of this machine it is possible by balancing the valves and suiting the diameter of the cylinder to the work to be performed to overcome great resistances with a slight effort the inventor says that this system of valves is considered by experts to be novel and very valuable in fig 3 is shown a pattern of a slide valve suited to special purposes its working is essentially the same as that of the valve already described the ports are set side by side parallel with the sides of the valve the supply port is in the middle the other ports lead to opposite ends of the cylinder illustration fig 4 in fig 4 is shown another application of the controlling valve and cutoff described above two oscillating steam cylinders are employed in working the rudder they are placed on opposite sides of the chest a and are supplied with steam through the controlling valve b the piston rods of the two cylinders are connected with cranks placed on opposite ends of the shaft c at right angles to each other upon this shaft halfway between the pillow blocks which support it there is a worm which engages a toothed sector d on the rudderpost e to an extension of the rudderpost is secured an arm f which is connected with the arm g of the controlling valve by shifting the lever h the supply of steam to the two cylinders may be increased or diminished or its direction may be changed so that the engines will be reversed or stopped this engine is remarkable for its simplicity the cylinders may be detached and changed if required one size of bed answering for three different sizes of cylinder which may vary only in diameter the stroke being the same so that the castings for engines of different power are the same except in the matter of the cylinders and pistons and all the parts are interchangeablea feature of modern engine building that cannot be too highly valued further information may be obtained from herbert wadsworth 26 merchants bank building 28 state street boston mass how our patent laws promote and improve american industries on another page we print in full a most suggestive paper recently read before the manchester eng scientific and mechanical society by mr frederick smith a prominent builder of that city contrasting the qualities styles and prices of american and english builders hardwarea paper which the ironmonger pronounces one of the most serious indictments yet preferred against british workmanship in that department the field covered by the paperthe supplying of house builders hardwareembraces a multitude of conveniences but no real necessities why is it that america has been prolific in novel devices and clever improvements in this department of manufacture as in so many others while england has gone on stolidly copying ancient forms changing only to cheapen by the introduction of poor material and sham construction mr smith mentions several reasons that english manufacturers have given him for the state of things he as an englishman so greatly deplores but evidently he is not satisfied with any of them and very justly for none of them touches the real causethe radically different attitude of the public mind toward inventions characteristic of the two countries in england the user of household inconveniences accepts them as matters of fact or if he grumbles at them he never thinks of trying to change them it is not his business and if he should devise an improvement ten to one he could not get it made to patent it is practically out of the question for if it were not condemned offhand as trivial the patent fees would make it cost more than it was likely to be worth the mechanic who makes such things is trained to work to pattern and not waste his time on experiments besides if he should make a clever invention he would not be able to raise the necessary fees for a patent or to get any one to help him thereto the manufacturer makes what his customers call for why should he spend his money and spoil his plant to introduce improvements so things go until some pestilent yankees flood the markets with better articles at a lower price and british consumers suddenly discover that they want something that the native manufacturer cannot make the need was there but invention did not follow how happened it that the american manufacturer did not pursue the same uninventive course what produced the radically different attitude of the american mind toward newfangled notions out of which inventions proceeded and flourished no doubt several causes have been at work freedom of thought and action popular education a blending of races and the tide of adventurous spirits naturally resorting to a new and free land these have had their influence undoubtedly but all these have existed more or less completely in other new lands without that outburst of creative energy which has made america the nursery of inventions great and small the determining cause the one condition that prevailed here and not elsewhere was the circumstance that almost from the start new ideas were given a market value in this country unlike all others the american patent law directly encouraged independent thinking in all classes the fees were low and the protection offered fairly good men soon found that it paid to invent that one of the surest roads to competency was a patented improvement on something of general use if a household utensil or appliance went wrong or worked badly every user was directly interested in devising something better and more than that he was interested in making his invention known and in securing its adoption the workman at his bench had an everpresent inducement to contrive something at once cheaper and better than the article he was hired to make he could patent his improvement or the wholly original device he might hit upon for a few dollars and his patent would count as capital it would make him his own master possibly bring him a fortune the manufacturer could not rest contented with the thing he set out to make for the meanest hired man in his employ might suddenly become a competitor he must be constantly alert for possible improvements or his rivals would get ahead of him the result is a nation of inventors at whose hands the newest of lands has leaped to the leadership in the arts almost at a bound there is talk of changing all this of emulating the conservative spirit of the old world of putting inventors under bonds of stopping the rush of industrial improvementto enable a few shortsighted yet grasping corporations to get along without paying license fees for such inventions as they happen to approve of they profess to want inventors to go on making improvements they are willing to ascribe all honor to the successful inventor but they are determined not to pay him for his work still more they are determined to change the attitude of the public mind toward inventors and inventions if such a change can be wrought by plausible misrepresentations the fact that they were able to inveigle one branch of the american congress into assenting to their unjust and mischievous scheme is one of the anomalies of our recent history it should be taken as a timely warning of impending danger to all the industrial interests of the country it is outrageous that the inventors of the land after having raised their country to the first rank among industrial nations should have to defend their constitutional rights against congressional invasion but the fact exists and the defense should be made a matter of personal interest and effort not only by every inventor and manufacturer but by every honest citizen pleuropneumonia the cattle plague which is creating so much anxiety throughout the eastern states is a contagious fever affecting cows chiefly characterized by extensive exudations into the respiratory organs and attended by a low typhus inflammation of the lungs plur and bronchia it has prevailed in europe for ages at times developing into widespread scourges causing incalculable loss it was imported into england in 1839 and again three years later and it was estimated that within twentyfive years thereafter the losses by deaths alone in england had amounted to 450000000 in 1858 the disease was carried to australia by an english cow and spreading to the cattle ranges almost depopulated them in 1843 an infected dutch cow brought the disease to brooklyn where it has since lingered slowly spreading among the cattle in kings and queens counties in 1847 several head of infected english cattle were imported into new jersey and spreading among a herd of valuable cattle made it necessary for them all to be slaughtered the only certain method of stamping out the disease in 1859 four infected cows were imported into massachusetts from holland the plague spread rapidly and was stamped out only by persistent effort the state paying for over 1000 slaughtered cattle since 1867 the disease has not been known there meantime the pest had invaded eastern pennsylvania delaware and maryland where it has since prevailed in isolated localities the absence of large herds of moving cattle in these districts except for speedy slaughter has prevented the disease from developing into a general plague the recent action of the british council in forbidding the importation of american live cattle is likely to prove of inestimable benefit to this country in forcibly calling attention to the grave risk that the presence of the disease on long island and elsewhere constantly entails fortunately the drift of the cattle traffic is eastward and as yet there has been no propagation of the poison in the great cattle ranges of the west unless summarily arrested however the disease will surely reach those sources of our cattle supply and occasion losses that can be estimated only in hundreds of millions of dollars the experience of all countries into which this disease has gained access appears to prove that there is only one way of getting rid of itnamely the immediate killing of all infected cattle and the thorough disinfection of the premises in which they are found the disease is purely infectious and is never found in regions where it has not gained a foothold by importation palliative measures have in every instance failed to eradicate the disease and are only justifiable as in australia after the plague has reached dimensions utterly beyond the reach of any process of extermination professor law of cornell university one of our best informed veterinary surgeons most emphatically opposes every attempt to control the disease by quarantining the sick or by the inoculation of the healthy we may quarantine the sick he says but we cannot quarantine the air to establish quarantine yards is simply to maintain prolific manufacturers of the poison which is given off by the breath of the sick and by their excretions to such an extent that no watchfulness can insure against its dissemination besides the expense of thorough quarantining operations would amount to more than the value of the infected animals whose lives might be saved thereby inoculation is still less to be tolerated at this stage of the pest the professor says germany holland belgium france and england have been treating the victims of this plague for nearly half a century but the result has only been the increase of disease and death our own infected states have been treating it for a third of a century and today it exists over a wider area than ever before contrast this with the results in massachusetts and connecticut where the disease has been repeatedly crushed out at small expense and there can be no doubt as to which is the wisest course as all the plagues are alike in the propagation of the poison in the bodies of the sick i may be allowed to adduce the experience of two adjacent counties in scotland when invaded by the rinderpest aberdeen raised a fund of 2000 and though she suffered several successive invasions she speedily crushed out the poison wherever it appeared by slaughtering the sick beasts and disinfecting the premises the result was that little more than half the fund was wanted to reimburse the owners for their losses and the splendid herds of the county were preserved forfar on the other hand set herself to cure the plague with the result of a universal infection the loss of many thousands of cattle and the ruin of hundreds of farmers finally the malady was crushed out in the entire island by the method adopted by aberdeen and other well advised counties at the outset and again cattle have been inoculated by the tens of thousands in belgium and holland and of all europe these are the countries now most extensively infected france prussia italy austria and england have each practiced it on a large scale and each remains a home of the plague australia has followed the practice and is now and must continue an infected country our own infected states have inoculated and the disease has survived and spread in spite of it and even by its aid whatever country has definitively exterminated the plague norway sweden denmark holstein mecklenburg switzerland massachusetts and connecticut that country has prohibited inoculation and all other methods that prevail on the principle of preserving the sick and has relied on the slaughter of the infected and the thorough disinfection of their surroundings so will it be with us if any state adopts or allows any of these temporizing measures that state will only repeat the experience of the past alike in the old world and the new will perpetuate the disease in the country will entail great losses on its citizens will keep up the need for constant watchfulness and great expense by the adjoining states for their own protection and will indefinitely postpone the resumption of the foreign live stock trade which a few months ago promised to be one of the most valuable branches of our international commerce we are persuaded that the position taken by professor law and other similarminded veterinary surgeons is the only safe one the disease can be stamped out now with comparatively small loss if trifled with and tolerated it cannot but result in a great national calamity spain a field for machinery and patents from a too lengthy communication to admit in full to our columns a resident of madrid communicates to the scientific american some facts relative to the fertility of the soil of spain her necessity for improved agricultural and other implements and closes with the assertion that it is a good field withal for patents we cull from the letter as follows i have lived says the writer for a number of years in this beautiful country so little understood by foreigners so little appreciated by its own inhabitants the spain of romance poetry and song is the garden as well as the california of europe but it stands in great need of the healthgiving touch of the north american enterprise we have here the same mineral treasures the same unrivaled advantages of climate that made spain once the industrial and commercial emporium of the world but spain is awakening she is endeavoring to shake off her lethargy the late exhibition of paris has proved this and those who are familiar with the past history and present condition of spain have been astonished at the result of this effort a new era has commenced for the country and it is everywhere evident that a strong current of enterprise and industry has set in but it is with nations as with individuals when they have remained long in complete inaction brain and muscles are torpid and cannot at first obey the will spain needs the assistance of other nations hardened and inured to toil the plows now used to till the land are precisely such as were those left by the moors in the unfinished furrow when with tears and sighs they bade farewell to their broad fields their mosques and palaces whose ideal architecture is still the wonder of the world to go forth as outcasts and exiles in obedience to the cruel edict that drove them away to the deserts of africa i doubt whether there is an american plow in spain much less a steam plow sowing and reaping machines are here unknown and grain is tread out by oxen and mules just as it was in scripture times and cleaned by women who toss it in the air to scatter the chaff everything is primitive and oriental here as yet spain could supply all europe with butter and cheese and on the contrary these articles are imported in large quantities from england holland and switzerland the traveler crosses leagues and leagues of meadow land where not a tree is to be seen nor one sheep pasture and which are nevertheless watered by broad rivers that carry away to the ocean the water that would by irrigation convert these fields into productive farms there are many places in spain where the wine is thrown away for want of purchasers and vats in which to keep it in the upper aragon the mortar with which the houses are built is made with wine instead of water the former being the most plentiful aragon needs an enterprising american company to convert into wholesome table wine the infinite varieties there produced and which our neighbors the french buy and carry away to convert into bordeaux we want american enterprise in galicia and asturias where milk is almost given away to convert it into the best of butter and cheese and also in those same provinces where delicious fruit is grown in such abundance that it is left on the ground for the swine spain needs many more railroads and canals all of which when constructed are subsidized by the government the railroads at the rate of 12000 a kilometer and many more additional advantages are offered for canals with regard to commerce with spain we have to lament the same indifference on the part of the americans i have for instance an american doubleburner petroleum lamp all who see it admire and covet it but they are not to be had here if we except one american in madrid who brings mostly pumps and similar articles on a very small scale we have no dealers in american goods here wooden clothes pins lemon squeezers clothes horses potato peelers and the hundreds of domestic appliances of american invention elsewhere considered indispensable are in spain unknown we had confidently expected that the new spanish law on patents would draw the attention of american inventors toward this country that today offers a wide field for every new practical invention but i am sorry to see that with the exception of edison and a few others the americans have not yet availed themselves of the easy facility for taking patents for spain where new inventions and new industries are now eagerly accepted and adopted and while the americans are thus careless as to their own interests the french take out and negotiate in spain american patents with insignificant variations let american inventors be assured that any new invention useful and practical and above all requiring but little capital to establish it as an industry will find a ready sale in spain i could enlarge to a much greater extent upon the indifference of american inventors merchants manufacturers and business men as to the market they have in spain in their respective lines and upon the importance of building up a trade with this country but to do so would require more space than i think you would feel justified in occupying in your columns peter cooper as an inventor the successes of peter coopers long and useful life are well known not so many are aware of his varied experience in the direction of failure particularly in the field of invention more than once he has found his best devices profitless because ahead of his time or because of conditions political or otherwise which no one could foresee he possessed the rare qualities however of pluck and perseverance and when one thing failed he lost no time in trying something else before he was of age he had learned three tradesand he did not make his fortune at either in a familiar conversation with a herald writer recently mr cooper related some of his early experiences particularly with reference to enterprises which did not succeed his father was a hatter and as a boy young cooper learned how to make a hat in all its parts the father was not successful in business and the hatters trade seems to have offered little encouragement to the son accordingly he learned the art of making ale why he did not stick to that calling and become a millionaire brewer mr cooper does not say most probably the national taste for stronger tipple could not at that time be overcome and ale could not compete with new england rum and applejack the young mechanic next essayed the art of coachmaking at which he served a full apprenticeship at the end of his time his employer offered to set him up in business but the offer was not accepted through fear of losing anothers money he felt that if he took the money and lost it he would have to be a slave for life so he quit coachmaking and went to work for a man at hempstead l i making machines for shearing cloth in three years on 150 a day cooper had saved enough money to buy his employers patent immediately he introduced improvements in the manufacture and in the machine which the war with england made a great demand for by excluding foreign cloths at this time cooper married in due time the family numbered three and the young fathers inventive faculty was again called upon in those days said mr cooper to the reporter smiling as the remembrance came to his mind we kept no servants as they do nowadays and my wife and myself had to do all that was to be done after our first child was born i used to come into the house and find my wife rocking the cradle and i relieved her from that while i was there after doing that for a few days i thought to myself that i could make that thing go of itself so i went into my shop and made a pendulous cradle that would rock the child then i attached a musical instrument which would sing for it and at the same time the machine would keep the flies off the latter was very simple by hanging something to the cross bar as the cradle swung under it backward and forward it would create wind enough to drive away the flies the machine was wound up by a weight and would run for nearly half an hour without stopping i took out a patent for it and one day a peddler came along with a horse and wagon as they do in the country and saw the cradle he struck a bargain with me and bought the patent right for the state of connecticut giving for it his horse and wagon and all the goods he had with him they afterward made some there but nothing like as good as mine it was a beautiful piece of furniture said mr cooper regretfully as he thought of it as a thing of the past they afterward substituted springs for the weight movement but that kind was not so good about this time the war with england ended and the market was spoiled for the shearing machines then we believe mr cooper tried his hand at cabinetmaking but that failed and he set up a grocery store where the bible house now stands while selling groceries mr cooper made an invention which ought to have made his fortune but it did not the story is best told in mr coopers own words it was just before the erie canal was completed and i conceived a plan by which to tow boats by the use of all the elevated waters on the line of the canal to demonstrate that that was practicable i made with my own hands a chain two miles long and placed posts 200 feet apart in the east river from bellevue dock down town about a mile these posts supported grooved wheels to lay the chain in forming an endless chain the whole was moved by an overshot waterwheel placed at the bellevue dock a reservoir twelve feet square and three deep held the water to turn the wheel at the suggestion of governor clinton mr cooper tightened his chain and pulled up the end post just before the grand trial of his device was to come off he succeeded in getting stone enough to anchor the post however and the experiment went off swimmingly the boat was hooked on to the chain and the passage back and forwardtwo mileswas made in eleven minutes i ran that boat some ten days says mr cooper to let people see what could be done and carried nearly a thousand people part of the time i ran two boats once i counted 52 people in one boat i made the whole chain myself and planted the posts as i could find no wheels to suit me i made the moulds and cast the wheels myself out of block tin and zinc it was no small job i can tell you this was unquestionably a grand invention in itself it was a perfect success but it was not used mr cooper tells why it demonstrated completely that the elevated water power along the line of the canal and every lock in the canal could be made use of to drive the boats governor clinton gave me 800 for the privilege of buying the right to the plan in case he should want to use it on the erie canal in making the canal he had promised the people along the route that as soon as it was finished they could sell their horses to tow the boats their grain and fodder to feed the horses and their provisions for the passengers on reflection he thought that if he took all that away from them he would have to run the gantlet again and he could not afford to do that there never was anything done with the plan until a few years ago when mr welch president of the camden and amboy railroad and canal invented exactly the same thing and put it in practice on his locks on the canal he found it saved half the time and great expense he went to washington to take out a patent for it and when he got there he found that i had patented the same thing fiftythree years before my patent had run out so he could use the plan on his canal it has also been used on one lock on the erie canal if they could have used that chain on the whole length of the erie canal it would have saved many millions of dollars this would not be a bad place were there room for it to speak of undeveloped and therefore worthless inventions and the assumption that if an inventor does not make his invention immediately profitable it must be good for nothing and should be dispatented but the moral goes without telling mr coopers next attempt at invention was made about the same time but in quite a different direction it was during the struggle of the greeks for independence and wishing to do something for their assistance mr cooper undertook to make a torpedo boat for them mr cooper says it was a small one that could be taken on board ship and used to destroy any vessel that came to destroy them it was fixed with a rotary steam engine and a screw wheel to propel it it was intended to be guided from the ship or the shore there were two steel wires fixed to the tiller of the rudder and the operator could pull on one side or the other and guide the vessel just as a horse is guided with reins it was so arranged that at night it would carry a light with its dark side toward the object to be destroyed and by simply keeping the light in range with the vessel it would be sure to hit it the torpedo was carried on a little iron rod projecting in front of the torpedo vessel a few inches under water contact would discharge the torpedo and bend this iron rod this would reverse the action of the engine and cause the torpedo vessel to return right back from whence it came ready to carry another torpedo unfortunately the torpedo boat was not ready in time to go with the ship carrying the contributions for greece it was stored in mr coopers factory he had then turned his attention to glue and was destroyed by the burning of the factory it seems to have been quite a promising affair for the time mr cooper says i experimented with it at once to see how far it could be guided i made a steel wire ten miles long and went down to the narrows to test the matter i had steel yards fastened to one end of the wire and to the other end the torpedo vessel as attached it got about six miles away when a vessel coming into the harbor crossed the wire and broke it although the experiment was not complete it showed that for at least six miles i could guide the vessel as easily as i could guide a horse mr coopers work as the pioneer locomotive builder in this country his later inventions and improvements in the manufacture of railway iron and wrought iron beams for fireproof buildings his application of anthracite coal to iron puddling and his other successes are almost as widely known as his philanthropic efforts for the education and advancement of the industrial classes of this city after all we are not sure but the story of his long and varied and always honorable career told by himself would not be worth to young people who have to make their way in life through many difficulties more even than the advantages of the noble institution which bears his name taste for readingsir john herschel has declared that if he were to pray for a taste which should stand under every variety of circumstance and be a source of happiness and cheerfulness to him through life it would be a taste for reading give a man he affirms that taste and the means of gratifying it and you cannot fail of making him good and happy for you bring him in contact with the best society in all ages with the tenderest the bravest and the purest men who have adorned humanity making him a denizen of all nations a contemporary of all times and giving him a practical proof that the world has been created for him for his solace and for his enjoyment africa crossed again information has been received by way of lisbon march 12 that the portuguese explorer pinto has succeeded in traversing africa from west to east and has reached transvaal the latitude of his course across is not mentioned curious facts in magnetism at the meeting of the new york academy of sciences february 17th the article in the march number of harpers magazine entitled garys magnetic motor was incidentally alluded to and prof c a seeley made the following remarks the article claims that mr gary has made a discovery of a neutral line or surface at which the polarity of an induced magnet while moving in the field of the inducing pole is changed the alleged discovery appears to be an exaggerated statement of some curious facts which although not new are not commonly recognized if a bar of iron be brought up end on near a magnetic pole the bar becomes an induced magnet but an induced magnet quite different from what our elementary treatises seem to predict on the first scrutiny it is a magnet without a neutral point and only one kind of magnetismnamely that of the inducing pole moreover the single pole is pretty evenly distributed over the whole surface so that if iron filings be sprinkled on the bar they will be attracted at all points and completely cover it now if while the bar is covered by filings it be moved away from the inducing pole the filings will gradually and progressively fall beginning at the end nearest the inducing pole and continuing to some point near the middle of the bar the filings at the remote end will generally be held permanently when the bar is carried beyond the field of the inducing pole it is simply a weak magnet of ordinary propertiesi e of two poles and a neutral point between them a plausible and simple explanation of this case is that the inducing pole holds or binds the induced magnetism of opposite name so that it has no external influence the two magnetisms are related to each other as are the positive and negative electricities of the leyden jar let the inducing pole be n the s of the bar will be attracted by it and bound while the n of the bar becomes abnormally free and active on moving the bar from the pole the bound magnetism is released and a part becomes residual magnetism now when the residual balances the free magnetism which is of opposite name we are on garys neutral line in a restricted sense there is a change of polarity over the half of the bar contiguous to the inducing pole on the other half there is no change of pole in any sense experiment with a shingle nail in the place of the filings la gary bring the nail to the induced bound pole and it may be held except at the neutral line now if one will read the magazine article with such ideas as these he will feel pretty sure that the writer of it has used words recklessly that gary has not made an original discovery and that the neutral line whatever it be has only an imagined relation to the principle of the motor the gary motor as a perpetual motion scheme of course is not worthy of serious notice from a society devoted to science it has no noteworthy novelty of construction or conception mr gary is afflicted with the very old delusion of the cutoff or shield of magnetism which is to cost less than what comes from it his cutoff is a sheet of iron which we know acts simply as an armature a new phenomenon in statical electricity m e duter in a paper read before the french academy in december showed that when a leyden jar is charged with either positive or negative electricity its internal volume increases and that this effect is a new phenomenon unexplainable by either a theory of an increase of temperature or of an electrical pressure the experiment was performed by means of a flaskshaped leyden jar with a long tube attached to its neck and containing a liquid which served as the inner armature the authors attention had been called to the fact that this phenomenon had been observed ten years ago by m gori his researches just made public leave no doubt of the accuracy of m duters view that the glass of the jar really expands according to the theory of elasticity the effect of an internal pressure in a hollow sphere is in the inverse ratio of its thickness m duter therefore had three flasks made of the same volume but of thicknesses of 4 mm 08 mm and 05 mm respectively they were filled with water and enveloped by tin foil each carried a capillary thermometer tube in which the variations of the height of liquid served to measure the changes in volume due to electrification he found that these changes were imperceptible in the thick glass very marked in the flask of mean thickness and rose to 30 mm in the thinnest the variations in volume were very nearly in inverse ratio of the square roots of the thicknesses a new ore crusher the accompanying

accompanying engraving represents two different styles of regulator invented by mr stenberg in which the effect of centrifugal force is utilized in a vessel a of parabolic shape is placed a disk c which floats on glycerine contained by the vessel and is attached to the walls of the vessel by an annular membrane so that it may rise and fall in a vertical direction as the glycerine is carried with more or less force toward the edge of the vessel by centrifugal action the inner surface of the vessel a is provided with radial grooves by which the rotary motion of the vessel is communicated to the glycerine to the center of the disk c is attached a vertical rod which extends downward through the hollow shaft and is connected with governor valve an increase of speed throws the glycerine toward the periphery of the valve and raising the disk c closes the steam valve a diminution of speed permits the glycerine to fall back when the disk descends and the valve opens illustration

which has lately been visited by a party of united states naval officers they were surveying a rock east of the south cape of formosa and called at this island they found a curious race of malay stock these aborigines did not know what money was good for nor had they ever used tobacco or rum they gave the officers goats and pigs for tin pots and brass buttons and hung around the vessel all day in their canoes waiting for a chance to dive for something which might be thrown overboard they wore clouts only ate taro and yams and had axes spears and knives made of common iron their canoes were made without nails and were ornamented with geometrical lines they wore the beards of goats and small shells as ornaments such is the account of these strange people given by dr siegfried in a letter read at the last meeting of the philadelphia academy of natural sciences remedy for the new carpet beetle noticing a statement made by mr j a lintner to the effect that the persian insect powder would probably prove unavailing as a remedy against the ravages of the new carpet beetle anthrenus w l carpenter of the usa was led to institute some experiments with this well known insecticide the results of which he communicates to the current number of the naturalist a small quantity of the powder was introduced on the point of a penknife under a tumbler beneath which various insects were consecutively confined the movements of the insects brought them in contact with the poison which readily adhered to their body in endeavoring to remove it from their appendages a few particles would be carried to the mouth and thence to the stomach with fatal effect the results were briefly thus a honey bee became helpless in 15 minutes a mad wasp in 8 minutes a small ant in 5 minutes a large butterfly resisted the effects for over an hour and apparently recovered but died the next day a housefly became helpless in 10 minutes a mosquito in 15 and a flea in 3 minutes in experimenting on beetles an insect was secured as nearly the size of the carpet beetle as could be found it was easily affected and became helpless in 12 minutes in these and experiments with various other insects the scent from the powder did not produce any bad effect on those subjected to its odor where actual contact was not possible but when carried to the mandibles the effect was to produce complete paralysis of the motor nerves the experiments prove that all insects having open mouth parts are peculiarly susceptible to this popular insecticide as a result the writer does not hesitate to recommend the powder to housekeepers as an infallible agent in destroying the carpet beetle and preventing its ravages the persian insect powder liberally sprinkled upon the floor before putting down a carpet and afterward freely placed around the edges and never swept away will suffice to preserve a large sized carpet no ill effects from its use need be feared by the householder since the drug is poisonous to

section of the pen and fig 3 is a vertical section of a portion of the driving apparatus in this instrument compressed air is used as a motive force for driving the perforating needle the inverted cup shown in detail in fig 3 has its mouth closed with a flexible diaphragm which is vibrated rapidly by a pitman having a convex end attached by its center to the middle of the diaphragm the pitman is reciprocated by a simple treadle motion which will be readily understood by reference to fig 1 illustration brickenridges pneumatic stencil pen the cup has a small aperture covered by a valve to admit of the entrance of air when the diaphragm is drawn down the pen shown in detail in fig 2 has a cup and flexible diaphragm similar to the one already described the diaphragm rests upon the enlarged end of a bar which carries at its lower end a perforating needle the pen is connected with the driving mechanism by a flexible tube the needle bar is pressed lightly against the diaphragm by a spiral spring when the treadle motion is operated the impelling diaphragm is rapidly vibrated and through the medium of the air contained in the flexible tube it communicates motion to the pen diaphragm and consequently to the needle bar and needle if while the needle is reciprocated in this way the pen is moved over the surface of the paper a line of fine perforations will be made with this instrument

formation of the company for laying the first atlantic cable monday march 10 the projector of the enterprise mr cyrus w field spoke as follows neighbors and friends twentyfive years ago this evening in this house in this room and on this table and at this very hour was signed the agreement to form the new york newfoundland and london telegraph companythe first company ever formed to lay an ocean cable it was signed by five persons four of whompeter cooper moses taylor marshall o roberts and myselfare here tonight the fifth mr chandler white died two years after and his place was taken by mr wilson g hunt who is also present of my associates it is to be said to their honoras might have been expected from men of their high position and characterthat they stood by the undertaking manfully for twelve long years through discouragements such as nobody knows but themselves those who applaud our success know little through what struggles it was obtained one disappointment followed another till hope deferred made the heart sick we had little help from outside for few had any faith in our enterprise but not a man deserted the ship all stood by it to the end my brother dudley is also here who as the counsel of the company was present at the signing of the agreement and went with mr white and myself the week after to newfoundland to obtain the charter and was our legal adviser through those anxious and troubled years when success seemed very doubtful at st johns the first man to give us a hearty welcome and who aided us in obtaining our charter was mr edward m archibald then prime minister of newfoundland and now for more than twenty years the honored representative of her majestys government at this port who is also here tonight it is a matter for grateful acknowledgment that we were spared to see accomplished the work that we began and that we meet now at the end of a quarter of a century to look with wonder at what has been wrought since in other parts of the world our little company came into existence only a few weeks before the western union telegraph company which is entitled to share in our congratulations and has kindly brought a connecting wire into this room by which we can this evening communicate with every town and village from the atlantic to the pacific and by our sea cables with europe asia africa australia new zealand the west indies and south america while our small circle has been broken by death but once very different has it been with the atlantic telegraph company which was formed in london in 1856 to extend our line across the ocean at its beginning there were eighteen english and twelve american directors thirty in all of whom twentynine have either died or retired from the board i alone still remain one of the directors many of the great men of science on both sides of the atlantic who inspired us by their knowledge and their enthusiasm have passed away we have lost bache whose coast survey mapped out the whole line of the american shores and maury who first taught us to find a path through the depths of the seas and berryman who sounded across the atlantic and morse and last but not least henry across the water we miss some who did as much as any men in their generation to make the name of england greatfaraday and wheatstone stephenson and brunelall of whom gave us freely of their invaluable counsel refusing all compensation because of the interest which they felt in the solution of a great problem of science and engineering skill it is a proud satisfaction to remember that while the two governments aided us so generously with their ships making surveys of the ocean and even carrying our cables in the first expeditions such men as these gave their support to an enterprise which was to unite the two countries and in the end to bring the whole world together others there are among the living and the dead to whom we are under great obligations but i cannot repeat the long roll of illustrious names yet i must pay a passing tribute to one who was my friend as he was the steadfast friend of my countryrichard cobden he was one of the first to look forward with the eye of faith to what has since come to pass as long ago as 1851 he had a sort of prophets dream that the ocean might yet be crossed and advised prince albert to devote the profits of the great london exhibition of that year to an attempt thus to unite england with america he did not live to see his dream fulfilled but though men die their works their discoveries and their inventions live from that small beginning under this roof arose an art till then scarcely known that of telegraphing through the depths of the sea twentyfive years ago there was not an ocean cable in the world a few short lines had been laid across the channel from england to the continent but all were in shallow water even science hardly dared to conceive of the possibility of sending human intelligence through the abysses of the ocean but when we struck out to cross the atlantic we had to lay a cable over 2000 miles long in water over 2 miles deep that great success gave an immense impulse to submarine telegraphy then in its infancy but which has since grown till it has stretched out its fingers tipped with fire into all the waters of the globe its lines have gone into all the earth and its words to the ends of the world today there are over 70000 miles of cable crossing the seas and the oceans and as if it were not enough to have messages sent with the speed of lightning they must be sent in opposite directions at the same moment i have just received a telegram from valentia ireland which reads this anniversary witnesses duplex working across the atlantic as an accomplished factby which the capacity of all our ocean cables is doubled who can measure the effect of this swift intelligence passing to and fro already it regulates the markets of the world but better still is the new relation into which it brings the different kindreds of mankind nations are made enemies by their ignorance of each other a better acquaintance leads to a better understanding the sense of nearness the relation of neighborhood awakens the feeling of brotherhood is it not a sign that a better age is coming when along the ocean beds strewn with the wrecks of war now glide the messages of peace one thing only remains which i still hope to be spared to see and in which to take a part the laying of a cable from san francisco to the sandwich islandsfor which i have received this very day a concession from king kalakaua by his minister who is here to nightand from thence to japan by which the island groups of the pacific may be brought into communication with the continents on either sideasia and americathus completing the circuit of the globe but life is passing and perhaps that is to be left to other hands many of our old companions have fallen and we must soon give place to our successors but though we shall pass away it is a satisfaction to have been able to do something that shall remain when we are gone if in what i have done to advance this enterprise i have done something for the honor of my country and the good of the world i am devoutly grateful to my creator this has been the great ambition of my life and is the chief inheritance which i leave to my children correspondence the gary motor to the editor of the scientific american in your article on the gary motor issue of march 8 page 144 you say there is no neutral line in the sense that polarity changes when mr gary moves his piece of sheet iron with its attached shingle nail across the pole or near the pole of a magnet the most delicate instruments fail to detect such a change of polarity etc mr garys claim of a neutral line is of course absurd but you are wrong in saying that the polarity does not change under the conditions described in the harpers monthly article mr gary is perfectly correct in claiming a change of polarity in that experiment although his other claim of deriving from this change of polarity a continuous motion without consuming energy are manifestly absurd illustration gary motor a illustration gary motor b the change of polarity is easily explained if a bar of soft iron whose length is two or three times the distance between the poles of the horseshoe magnet be placed in front of the latter as in the sketch and at some distance poles will be induced as shown by the letters n s now let the bar approach the magnet when within a short distance consequent points will be formed and the polarity at the ends will be reversed the bar having four poles as in the second sketch the bar of soft iron must have certain dimensions depending on the size and power of the horseshoe magnet by using a powerful electromagnet in place of a permanent one a soft iron bar of considerable size may be used and the change of polarity exhibited by showing the repulsion in one case for the south pole and in the other for the north pole of a heavy permanent magnet when in the proper position a very small movement of the soft iron bar is sufficient to produce the change wm a anthony cornell university ithaca n y march 2 1879 garys neutral line to the editor of the scientific american i have just read the article in the issue of march 8 on the gary motor and cannot refrain from offering a suggestion on the subject when i read the article referred to in harpers i formed the same opinion of the socalled invention that the writer in the scientific american has expressed and in the main such is my opinion still i however tried the experiment by which gary claims to prove the existence of his neutral line and soon found the same explanation that the writer in the american has given i then curiously enough modified the experiment in precisely the manner he suggests placing the magnet in a vertical position and using first a piece of sheet iron and then an iron wire under it this was before seeing the article in the scientific american my experiment is well illustrated by the writers diagram except that the nail should be at the end of the iron wire where its polarity is of course most strongly marked but the result is not as he states it for as the wire is brought up toward the magnet the nail drops off before the wire touches the magnet when the sheet iron is used the point at which the nail drops off is farther from the magnet than in the case of the wire and when it is brought nearer it will again pick up the nail which then continues to cling until the iron touches the magnet and afterwards thus the existence of a line in which the soft iron or induced magnet does not attract the nail and above and below which it does attract it is demonstrated that the polarity of the induced magnet is reversed when it crosses this line may be demonstrated as follows when it is held beyond or below this line fig 1 the negative pole of the permanent magnet the positive being kept at a distance may be made to approach the iron and touch it without causing the nail to drop fig 3 but when contact occurs the whole of the iron must possess the polarity of that part of the magnet which it touches namely negative hence in the position indicated in fig 1 the polarity of the induced magnet does not correspond with that of the permanent magnet but is as indicated by the letters on the other hand if the positive pole alone be made to approach the nail will drop but when it is very near or in contact it again holds the nail and the iron is now positive and if the negative pole also be now brought into contact the polarity of the soft iron will correspond with that of the magnet as shown in fig 2 illustration garys neutral line a illustration garys neutral line b illustration garys neutral line c these experiments should be performed with the soft iron under both poles of the magnet and the ends of the former should extend somewhat beyond the poles of the latter or the nail is liable to jump to the magnet as the neutral line is crossed the position of the letters in fig 1 of the previous article represents the polarity of the induced magnet to be the same as that of the permanent which is true only within or above the line described and this together with his statement that no such line can be discovered appears to indicate that the writer relied upon his knowledge of the laws of magnetism to state what would be the result without testing it experimentally it is probable that this reversal of polarity is susceptible of explanation by the known laws of magnetic currents but if it has hitherto escaped observation its discovery is certainly deserving of notice and may lead to valuable results of the fact any one may easily convince himself by the simple experiments above

cave of decorah iowa to the editor of the scientific american some years ago i visited the ice cave of decorah winneshiek county iowa and having since been unable to receive any explanation of the wonderful phenomenon exhibited by it i write hoping that you or some correspondent may explain the paradox the thriving town of decorah lies in a romantic valley of the upper iowa river and the cave is almost within its corporate limits following the left bank of the stream one soon reaches the vicinity and with a hard scramble through a loose shale up the side of a precipitous hill forming the immediate bank of the river the entrance is gainedan opening 5 feet wide and 8 feet high these dimensions generally describe the caves section from the entrance the course is a steep declineseldom less than 40 at times the ceiling is so low that progress on hands and knees is necessary about 125 feet from the entrance the ice chamber is reached at this spot the cave widens into a well proportioned room 8 by 12 feet the floor is solid ice of unknown thickness and on the right hand wall of the room a curtain of ice drops to the floor from a crevice extending horizontally in the rock at the height of ones eyes close examination discovers the water oozing from this crevice and as it finds its way down the side it freezes in the low temperature of the chamber singularly this one crevice and that no wider than a knife edge furnishes this natures ice house with the necessary water it was a hot day in august the thermometer marking 80 in the shade when the visit was made and comparatively the cold was intense in common with all visitors we detached some large pieces of ice and with them hurriedly departed glad to regain the warmth of the outside world the most remarkable fact in connection with this wonder is that the water only freezes in the summer as the cold of actual winter comes on the ice of the cave gradually melts and when the river below is frozen by the fierce cold of northern iowa the ice has disappeared and a muddy slush has taken the place of the frigid floor i would add that the ice chamber forms the terminus of the cave beyond a shallow crevice in the crumbling rock forbids further advance the rock formation of this region is the portland sandstone why should the temperature of the ice chamber be such as to freeze the water trickling into it and above all why should the ice disappear with the cold of winter mansfield o h m w the writing telegraph on the evening of february 26 1879 the writing telegraph of mr e a cowper of london was exhibited in operation before the society of telegraph engineers in that city it is a curious and remarkable invention by its use the handwriting of the operator may be transmitted but a double circuit that is two telegraph wires are used the operator moves with his hand an upright pointer or stylus with which he writes the message on paper the stylus has two arms connected with it one of which arms when the stylus makes an upward movement causes a current to be sent over one wire while the other arm causes a current to pass over the other wire when the stylus is moved laterally these two motions are at the receiving end of the line made to operate on the needles of galvanometers and the latter are by silk threads combined or connected with a delicately suspended ink tube from which a minute stream of ink falls upon the strip of paper below it the arrangement being such that the combined motions of the galvanometers so move the ink pen as to make it correspond to the motion of the stylus at the sending end the apparatus is said to work very well and it is expected that it will form a useful adjunct to the art of telegraphy we present herewith a facsimile of writing done by this new instrument which has been worked with success over a line of forty miles length it is hardly probable that it can compete in rapidity with some of the telegraph instruments now in use but for many purposes it is likely to become important while in point of ingenuity it is certainly a great achievement and the author is deserving of the highest credit illustration writing telegraph a rare geological specimen rev r m luther while absent in attendance upon the missionary convention held in addison vt obtained through the kindness of the rev mr nott a rare and curious geological specimen from the shores of lake champlain it is a slab of limestone about eleven inches long by six inches wide which seems to be composed almost entirely of fossils there is not half an inch square of the surface which does not show a fossil there are many varieties some of which have not been identified but among those which have been are many remains of the trinucleus conceniricus some specimens of petraia fragments of the orthis a number of discin several well preserved specimens of lepten and impressions of lingula the latter is the only shell which has existed from the first dawn of life until the present time without change the specimens of existing lingula are precisely similar to those found in the earliest geological formations there are also in the slab several rare specimens of seaweed remains of which are seldom found at so early an age in the geological history of the world the slab belongs to the lower silurian formation the first in which organic remains are found it is probably from the trenton epoch of that age if geologists can be trusted at the time the little animals whose remains are thus preserved were living the only part of this continent which had appeared above the primeval ocean was a strip of land along the present st lawrence river and the northern shores of the great lakes with a promontory reaching out toward the adirondacks and a few islands along what is now the atlantic coast linebennington vt banner cowpers writing telegraph the most recent of the brilliant series of telegraphic marvels which has from time to time and especially of late engaged the attention of the world is the telegraphic pen of mr e a cowper the well known engineer of great george street westminster this ingenious apparatus which constitutes the first real telegraph was publicly shown by its inventor at the meeting of the society of telegraph engineers on wednesday february 26 there had been no lack of copying telegraphs hitherto we have bakewells cassellis meyers and darlincourts so recently tried at our general post office by mr preece all of these instruments telegraph an almost perfect copy of the writing or sketch submitted to them by means of synchronous mechanism but the process is necessarily complex and slow whereas by the new device a person may take the writing pencil in his hand and himself transmit his message in the act of writing it the principle which guided mr cowper to a solution of the problem which he has successfully overcome is the well known mathematical fact that the position of any point in a curve can be determined by its distance from two rectangular coordinates it follows then that every position of the point of a pencil stylus or pen as it forms a letter can be determined by its distance from two fixed lines say the adjacent edges of the paper moreover it is obvious that if these distances could be transmitted by telegraph and recombined so as to give a resultant motion to a duplicate pen a duplicate copy of the original writing would be produced but inasmuch as the writing stylus moves continuously over the paper the process of transmission would require to be a continuous one that is to say the current traversing the telegraph line and conveying the distances in question or what comes to the same thing the up and down and direct sidelong ranges of the stylus would require to vary continuously in accordance with the range to be transmitted mr cowper effects this by employing two separate telegraphic circuits each with its own wire battery sending and receiving apparatus one of these circuits is made to transmit the up and down component writing of the pencils motion while the other simultaneously transmits its sidelong component at the receiving station these two components are then recomposed by a pantograph arrangement of taut cords or levers and the resultant motion is communicated to the duplicate pen at that place the plan adopted by mr cowper to transmit each continuously varying component is to cause the resistance of the circuit to vary very closely with the component in question fig 5 shows how the apparatus is theoretically arranged for this purpose p is the writing style which is held in the writers hand in the ordinary way while he shapes the letters one by one on paper pulled uniformly underneath by means of clockwork to p are attached at right angles two arms a a one for each circuit but as it is only necessary to consider one of the circuits say that sending up and down motions we will confine our attention for the present to the arm a one pole of the sending battery b is connected to the arm a the other pole being connected to earth now the arm a is fitted with a sliding contact at its free extremity and as the pencil p is moved in writing a slides lengthwise across the edges of a series of thin metal contact plates c insulated from each other by paraffined paper between each pair of these plates there is a resistance coil c and the last of these is connected through the last plate to the line l it will be seen that as a slides outward across the plates the current from the battery has to pass through fewer coils since a shortcircuits a number of coils proportional to its motion but the fewer of these coils in circuit the stronger will be the current in the line so that the extent of the motion of the arm a in the direction of its length that is to say the direct component of the motion of the pencil along the line of the arm a is attended by a corresponding change in the current traversing the line if the pencil makes a long up and down stroke there will be a strong current in the line if a short one there will be a weak current and so on a precisely similar arrangement is used to transmit the sidelong motion of the pencil along the line l illustration fig 5 the current from the line l flows at the receiving station through a powerful galvanometer g to earth the galvanometer has a stout needle one

the needle of g is also connected to the pen p by a taut thread t stretched by means of the spring s now since the needle of each of these galvanometers deflects in proportion to the strength of the current flowing through its coil the points of these two needles keep moving with the varying currents but since these currents vary the motions of the sending pen the receiving pen controlled by the united movements of the needles will trace out a close copy of the original writing we give on another page a facsimile of a sentence written by mr cowpers telegraph illustration the cowper writing

of the french aluminum manufacturers at the late exhibition has again called attention to that metal which is so admirably adapted to many purposes on account of its great lightness and its stability under the influence of the atmosphere while aluminum industry has heretofore been thought to be confined to france solely we are now told by mr c bambery in the annual report of the society of berlin instrument makers that for some years past aluminum has been extensively manufactured in berlin three firms especially stckradt hcke and schultze are engaged in this branch of industry the articles manufactured principally are nautical instruments as sextants compasses etc the german navy is supplied throughout with aluminum instruments as a proof of the superiority of german aluminum it may here be mentioned that the normal sets of weights and balances used by the international commission for the regulation of weights and measures which lately was in session at paris were obtained from stckradt in berlin and not from any of the firms at paris the reputed seat of aluminum industry aluminum is in berlin generally used pure and cast pieces only are composed of aluminum containing about 5 per cent of silver nevertheless the use of aluminum will remain limited even in case the cost of manufacturing it could be materially reduced until some method shall have been discovered by which aluminum may be soldered this difficulty has in spite of all efforts not yet been overcome and for some purposes to which the metal would otherwise be well adapted it remains so far unavailable here then is a chance for some ingenious mind an improved door bolt the accompanying engraving represents in perspective and in section an improved door bolt recently patented by mr thomas hoesly of new glaras wis the principal features of this bolt will be understood by reference to the engraving on the plate or body are cast two loops or guides for the bolt and the plate is slotted under the bolt and a lug projects into the slot and bears against a spring contained by a small casing riveted to the back of the plate the end of the bolt is beveled and its operation is similar to that of the ordinary door latch two handles are provided one of which is of sufficient length to reach through the door and a pawl or dog accompanies the bolt which may be attached to the door with a single screw and is to be used in locking the door the bolt is very simple and strong suitable for shops outbuildings such as barns stables etc and some of the doors of dwellings illustration hoeslys door bolt further information may be obtained by addressing the inventor as above chimney flues messrs w h jackson co of this city whose long experience in treating refractory flues gives weight to their opinion communicate to the american architect the following useful information to secure a good draught the chimney should be of sufficient size should be carried up above surrounding objects should be as straight as possible throughout its length and should be as smooth as possible inside to avoid friction as a draught is caused by unequal temperatures the chimney should be so arranged as to avoid a rapid radiation of heat if in an exterior wall there should be at least 8 inches of brickwork between the flue and the exterior surface for country houses it is much better to have the chimneys run up through the interior as the flue is more easily kept warm and the heat that is radiated helps to warm the house the most frequent cause of a smoky chimney is the insufficient size of the flue for the grate or fireplace connected therewith the flue should not be less than one eighth the capacity of the square of the width and height of the grate or fireplace that is if the grate has a front opening 20 inches wide and 26 inches high the flue should be 8 in 8 in or with an opening 36 inches wide and 32 inches high the flue should be 12 in 12 in and to get the best result the opening into the flue from the grate or fireplace should be of a less number of square inches than the square of the flue and never larger as no more air should be admitted at the inlet than can be carried through the flue where there is more than one inlet to the same flue the sum of all the inlets should not more than equal the size of the flue a number of stoves may be connected with the same flue one above another if this rule is observed a square flue is better than a narrow one as in two flues containing the same number of square inches the square flue would have the smallest amount of wall surface and consequently less friction for the ascending currents and less absorption of heat by the walls chimneys should be closely built having no cracks nor openings through which external air may be drawn to weaken the draught if they could be made throughout their length as impervious to air as a tube of glass with interior surface as smooth one cause of smoky chimneys would be removed a downward current of air is frequently caused by some contiguous object higher than the chimney against which the wind strikes this higher object may sometimes be quite a distance from the chimney and still affect it badly a good chimney top constructed to prevent a down draught will remedy this difficulty each grate or fireplace should have a flue to itself under very favorable conditions two grates or fireplaces might be connected with the same flue but it is not a good plan we have known grates and fireplaces connected with two flues where they have been built under a window for instance and owing to there being insufficient room for a flue of suitable size a flue has been run up on each side of the window this is a very bad plan and never can work well it requires too much heat to warm both flues and if the room in which the grate or fireplace is situated should be pretty close so that there was no other entrance for air there is danger that it would circulate down one flue and up the other forcing smoke out of the fireplace into the room improved furnace for burning garbage the refuse matter and garbage of large cities is in the main composed of animal and vegetable offal of the kitchens of the sweepings of warehouses manufactories saloons groceries public and private houses of straw sawdust old bedding tobacco stems ashes old boots shoes tin cans bottles rags and feathers dead cats dogs and other small animals of the dust and sweepings of the streets the condemned fruit vegetables meat and fish of the markets all of which compose a mass of the most obnoxious and unhealthy matter that can be deposited near human habitations the inventor of the furnace shown in the accompanying engravings aims to produce a change of form and of chemical nature and a great reduction in bulk of all such refuse and garbage within the limits of the city where it accumulates without screening separating preparing or mixing without the expense of using other fuel without any offensive odors being generated in the operation and to produce an entirely unobjectionable residuum or product that may be made useful illustration fig 1footes furnace for burning garbage as a rule organic matter largely preponderates in the refuse being as high in some instances as 94 per cent there is always more than enough to generate sufficient heat to fuse the earthy or inorganic portion which is mainly composed of sand clay and the alkalies from the coal and vegetable ashes etc by producing a high degree of heat in the combustion of the organic portion of the refuse with a forced blast or forced draught the noncombustible elements are fused and form a vitreous slag which is entirely inodorous and unobjectionable and which may be utilized for many purposes the upper section or cone of the consuming furnace is built of boiler iron and lined with fire brick resting upon an iron plate which is supported by iron columns the hearth is made of fire brick and is in the form of an inverted cone being smaller at the bottom and larger at the top as shown in fig 2 the sides of the hearth are perforated near the bottom with arches for the tuyeres or blast pipes and also in front for the special blast pipe and the tapping hole the top of the furnace is closed with an iron plate provided with a circular opening through which the hopper enters the top of the furnace at the left in the larger engraving is seen an elevator operated by a steam engine for conveying the garbage and refuse to a platform whence it is projected into the furnace by an inclined plane or chute gas or smoke conductors convey the gas from the top of the furnace to the furnace of the boiler and to the heating oven where it is used in heating air which is conveyed through the iron pipes passing through the heating oven into a wind box from which it enters the furnace at several points near the bottom by means of the tuyere pipes illustration section of furnace the consumption of the garbage is effected near the bottom of the furnace where the air is forced in and is continued as long as the blast is applied and while burning at the base it is continually sinking down at the top so that it is necessary to keep filling all the time the odoriferous gases and the hot products of such combustion are forced upward through the superimposed mass and escape to the fires of the boiler and heating oven and being largely composed of carbonic oxide and the hydrocarbon gases distilled from the animal and vegetable offal of the garbage are thoroughly consumed and it is said that by this means not only are all the offensive odors destroyed but the heat generated is utilized for making steam and heating the air used for blast the refuse in its descent through the high furnace is exposed to the drying action of the hot gases of distillation and the hot products of combustion its temperature increasing in its descent the nearer it approaches the tuyeres and becomes completely desiccated and combustible when it reaches the blast the high heat in this way obtained by the combustion of the organic portion melts all of the inorganic portion forming a vitreous slag or glass which may be allowed to run continuously or by closing the tap may be allowed to accumulate and can be drawn off at intervals if there is an adequate supply of clay and sand in the refuse to combine with the ashes the slag will run hot and free the combination of silex or alumina and an alkali in proper portions always yields a fusible easyrunning compound the molten slag as it runs from the furnace may be discharged into tanks of cold water which will pulverize or granulate it making it like fine sand or as it pours over a runner through which it flows if struck with a forcible air or steam blast it will be spun into fine threadlike wool the furnace once lighted and started may be kept running day and night continuously for days months or years if desired but if it becomes necessary to stop at any time the tuyere pipes may be removed and the holes all stopped with clay so as to entirely shut off the supply of air and it will then hold in fire for many days and will be in readiness to start again at any time the pipes are replaced and the blast turned on this furnace is the invention of mr henry r foote of stamford conn an ancient greek vase the vase shown in the accompanying engravings must not be classed with ordinary ceramic ware as it is a veritable work of art it is the celebrated cup of arcesilaus which is preserved in the collection of the library of richelieu street after having figured in the durand museum it was found at vulsei in etruria it was made by a potter of cyrene the capital of cyrenaica founded by greeks from the island of thera it is remarkable that cyrene removed from the center of grecian manufacture should possess a manufactory of painted vases from which have come so many works of art the traveler paul lucas discovered in the necropolis of cyrene in 1714 many antique vases both in the tombs and in the soil one of them is still preserved in the museum at leyden the arcesilaus who is represented on this vase is not the celebrated skeptical philosopher of that name it is arcesilaus king of cyrenaica who was sung by pindar and who was vanquished in the pythian games under the 80th olympiad 458 years bc the height of this vase is 25 centimeters its diameter 28 centimeters the paste is very fine of a pale red it is entirely coated with a black groundwork which has been generally recovered with a yellowish white clay baked on according to m brongniart this piece has been subjected to the baking process at least two or three times thus indicating that the ceramic art had made considerable progress in cyrene even at that remote epoch the following description of this vase is given in the catalogue of the durand museum the king arcesilaus is seated under a pavilion upon the deck of a ship his head is covered with a kind of hat with a large brim and his hair hangs down upon his shoulders he is clothed in a white tunic and embroidered cloak or mantle and he carries a scepter in his left hand under his seat is a leopard and his right hand he holds toward a young man who makes the same gesture and he is weighing in a large scale assafoetida which is being let down into the hold of the ship we know that he deals with assafoetida because one of the personages the one who lifts up his arm toward the beam of the scale holds in his right hand something resembling that which is in the scale and the greek word traced near it signifies that which prepares silphium assafoetida the resinous matter of the silphium is used largely by the greeks in the preparation of their food the orientals today make frequent use of it and call it the delight of the gods while in europe because of its repulsive odor it has long been designated as stircus diaboli illustration fig 1ancient greek vase illustration fig 2top of greek vase snowraised bread somebody thinks he has discovered that snow when incorporated with dough performs the same office as baking powder or yeast i have this morning for breakfast says a writer in the english mechanic partaken of a snowraised bread cake made last evening as follows the cake when baked weighed about three quarters of a pound a large tablespoonful of fine dry clean snow was intimately stirred with a spoon into the dry flour and to this was added a tablespoonful of caraways and a little butter and salt then sufficient cold water was added to make the dough of the proper usual consistence simply stirred with the spoon not kneaded by the warm hands and it was immediately put into a quick oven and baked three quarters of an hour it turned out both light and palatable the reason adds the writer appears to be this the light mass of interlaced snow crystals hold imprisoned a large quantity of condensed atmospheric air which when the snow is warmed by thawing very rapidly in the dough expands enormously and acts the part of the carbonic acid gas in either baking powder or yeast i take the precise action to be then not due in any way to the snow itself but simply to the expansion of the fixed air lodged between the interstices of the snow crystals by application of heat this theory if carefully followed out may perchance give a clew to a simple and perfectly innocuous method of raising bread and pastry and stop the discussion as to whether alum in baking powders is deleterious to health or otherwise new agricultural

harvesting cotton has been patented by r h pirtle of lowes ky this machine carries two vertical cylinders armed with teeth or spurs and two inclined endless belts provided with teeth the teeth of the cylinders and the belts remove the cotton from the plants and deliver it to a receptacle carried by the machine messrs julius fern and samuel bligh of oneonta n y have patented an improved power for churning and other purposes where little power is required it consists in the combination of a drum and weight a train of gearing and a pallet wheel arranged to oscillate a balanced beam an improvement in the class of feed cutters in which two or more knives work between parallel bars attached to the cutter box has been patented by messrs j n tatum and r c harvey of danville va the improvement consists in arranging the knives so that one begins and finishes its cut in advance of the other mr william bradberry of darrtown o has invented an improvement in reciprocating churns the aim of this inventor is to utilize the resistance of the milk as a source of power to accomplish this a peculiar combination of mechanism is required which cannot be clearly described without an engraving reading and eyesight m javel in a recent lecture tries to answer the question why is reading a specially fatiguing exercise and also suggests some remedies for this fatigue first m javel says reading requires an absolutely permanent application of eyesight resulting in a permanent tension of the organ which may be measured by the amount of fatigue or by the production of permanent myopy secondly books are printed in black on a white ground the eye is thus in presence of the most absolute contrast which can be imagined the third peculiarity lies in the arrangement of the characters in horizontal lines over which we run our eyes if we maintain during reading a perfect immobility of the book and the head the printed lines are applied successively to the same parts of the retina while the interspaces more bright also affect certain regions of the retina always the same there must result from this a fatigue analogous to that which we experience when we make experiments in accidental images and physicists will admit that there is nothing more disastrous for the sight than the prolonged contemplation of these images lastly and most important of all in m javels estimation is the continual variation of the distance of the eye from the point of fixation on the book a simple calculation demonstrates that the accommodation of the eye to the page undergoes a distinct variation in proportion as the eye passes from the beginning to the end of each line and that this variation is all the greater in proportion to the nearness of the book to the eye and the length of the line as to the rules which m javel inculcates in order that the injurious effects of reading may be avoided with reference to the permanent application of the eyes he counsels to avoid excess to take notes in reading to stop in order to reflect or even to roll a cigarette but not to go on reading for hours on end without stopping as to the contrast between the white of the paper and the black of the characters various experiments have been made in the introduction of colored papers m javel advises the adoption of a slightly yellow tint but the nature of the yellow to be used is not a matter of indifference he would desire a yellow resulting from the absence of the blue rays analogous to that of paper made from a wood paste and which is often mistakenly corrected by the addition of an ultramarine blue which produces gray and not white m javel has been led to this conclusion both from practical observation and also theoretically from the relation which must exist between the two eyes and the colors of the spectrum his third advice is to give preference to small volumes which can be held in the hand which obviates the necessity of the book being kept fixed in one place and the fatigue resulting from accidental images lastly m javel advises the avoidance of too long lines and therefore he prefers small volumes and for the same reason those journals which are printed in narrow columns of course every one knows that it is exceedingly injurious to read with insufficient light or to use too small print and other common rules m javel concludes by protesting against an invidious assertion which has recently been made in a neighboring country according to which the degree of civilization of a people is proportional to the number of the short sighted shown to exist by statistics the extreme economy of light the abuse of reading to the detriment of reflection and the observation of real facts the employment of gothic characters and of a too broad column for books and journals are the conditions which m javel believes lead to myopy especially if successive generations have been subjected to these injurious influences phosphorescence m nuesch records in a recent number of the journal de pharmacie some curious observations regarding luminous bacteria in fresh meat some pork cutlets he found illuminated his kitchen so that he could read the time on his watch the butcher who sent the meat told him the phosphorescence was first observed in a cellar where he kept scraps for making sausages by degrees all his meat became phosphorescent and fresh meat from distant towns got into the same state on scratching the surface or wiping it vigorously the phosphorescence disappears for a time and the butcher wiped carefully the meat he sent out all parts of the animal except the blood acquired the phenomenon over their whole surface the meat must be fresh when it ceases to be so the phosphorescence ceases and bacterium termo appear none of the customers had been incommoded it was remarked that if a small trace of the phosphorescent matter were put at any point on the flesh of cats rabbits etc the phosphorescence gradually spread out from the center and in three or four days covered the piece it disappeared generally on the sixth or seventh day cooked meat did not present the phenomenon but it could be had in a weak manner from cooked albumen or potatoes no other butchers shop in the place was affected the author is uncertain whether to attribute the complete disappearance of the phenomenon to the higher temperature of the season or to phenic acid or to fumigation with chlorine the charms of natural science the earl of derby in an address at the edinburgh university said of the gains derivable from natural science i do not trust myself to speak my personal knowledge is too limited and the subject is too vast but so much as this i can saythat those who have in them a real and deep love of scientific research whatever their position in other respects are so far at least among the happiest of mankind no passion is so absorbing no labor is so assuredly its own reward well that it is so for other rewards are few and they have the satisfaction of knowing that while satisfying one of the deepest wants of their own natures they are at the same time promoting in the most effectual manner the interests of mankind scientific discovery has this advantage over almost every other form of successful human efforts that its results are certain that they are permanent that whatever benefits grow out of them are worldwide not many of us can hope to extend the range of knowledge in however minute a degree but to know and to apply the knowledge that has been gained by others to have an intelligent appreciation of what is going on around us is in itself one of the highest and most enduring of pleasures the vesuvius rail waythe italian ministry of public works in union with the ministry of finance and the prefecture of naples has issued the concession for the construction of the vesuvius railway the line will run along that part of the mountain which has been proved after the experience of many years to be the least exposed to the eruptions the work is to be commenced immediately and it is believed that it will come into use during the present year a sufficient number of carriages are being built to convey 600 persons during the day the line is to be constructed upon an iron bridge built after a patented system the pottery tree among the various economic products of the vegetable kingdom scarcely any hold a more important place than barks whether for medicinal manufacturing or other purposes the structure and formation of all barks are essentially very similar being composed of cellular and fibrous tissue the cell contents of these tissues however vary much in different plants and for this reason we have fibrous or soft woody hard and even stony barks to explain everything which relates to the structure of bark would lead us into long details which our space will not permit briefly stated the bark of trees considering now those of our own climate consists of three layers the outermost called the cortical is formed of cellular tissue and differs widely in consistency in different species thus in the cork oak which furnishes man with one of his most useful commercial products the cortical layer acquires extraordinary thickness the middle layer called the cellular or green bark is a cellular mass of a very different nature the cells of which it is composed are polyhedral thicker and more loosely joined and filled with sap and chlorophyl the inner layer next the wood called the liber consists of fibers more or less long and tenacious it is from the liber that our most valuable commercial fibers are obtained in some plants the fibrous system prevails throughout the inner bark but what we wish to refer to more particularly at present is a remarkable example of the harder and more silicious barks and which is to be found in the pottery tree of para this tree known to the spaniards as el caouta to the french as bois de fer to the brazilians as caraipe is the moquilea utilis of botanists and belongs to the natural order ternstroeiace it is very large straight and slender reaching a height of 100 feet before branching its diameter is from 12 to 15 inches and its wood is exceedingly hard from containing much flinty matter although the wood of the tree is exceedingly sound and durable the great value of the tree to the natives exists in the bark for a purpose which to say the least is a novel one in the application of barksthat of the manufacture of pottery the indians employed in the manufacture of pottery from this material always keep a stock of it on hand in their huts for the purpose of drying and seasoning it as it then burns more freely and the ashes can be gathered with more ease than when fresh in the process of manufacturing the pottery the ashes of the bark are powdered and mixed with the purest clay that can be obtained from the beds of the rivers this kind being preferred as it takes up a larger quantity of the ash and thus produces a stronger kind of ware though the proportions of ash and clay are varied at the will of the maker and according to the quality of the bark a superior kind of pottery is produced by a mixture of equal parts of fine clay and ashes all sorts of vessels of small or large size for household or other purposes are made of this kind of ware as are also vases or ornamental articles many of which are painted and glazed these articles are all very durable and are able to stand almost any amount of heat they are consequently much used by the natives for boiling eggs heating milk and indeed for culinary purposes generally a brief glance at the structure of the bark will show how it comes to be so well adapted for this purpose the bark seldom grows more than half an inch thick and is covered with a skin or epidermis when fresh it cuts somewhat similar to a soft sandstone but when dry it is very brittle and flint like and often difficult to break on examination of a section under the microscope all the cells of the different layers are seen to be more or less silicated the silex forming in the cells when the bark is still very young in the inner bark the flint is deposited in a very regular manner the particles being straight and giving off branches at right angles that of the porous cells of the bark however is very much contorted and ramifies in all directions in the best varieties of the tree those growing in rich and dry soil the silex can be readily detected by the naked eye but to test the quality of the various kinds of bark the natives burn it and then try its strength between their fingers if it breaks easily it is considered of little value but if it requires a mortar and pestle to break its quality is pronounced good from an analysis of this singular bark that of old trees has been found to give 308 per cent of ash and that of young 2330 per cent of the different layers of old bark the outer gave 1715 per cent the middle 377 and the inner 31 the wood of the tree in comparison with the bark is relatively poor in silex the duramen of an old tree giving only 25 per cent of silex glass sponges the natural history of sponges had up to the middle of this century been comparatively neglected until 1856 when lieberkuhn published his treatise on sponges very little or nothing had been written on the subject later haeckel did much to determine their exact nature and it is now universally admitted that sponges form one of the connecting links between the animal and the vegetable kingdom sponges generally considered consist of fine porous tissue covered during life with viscid semiliquid protoplasm and are held in shape and strengthened by a more or less rigid skeleton consisting chiefly of lime or silica the tissue consists of a very fine network of threads formed probably by gradual solidification of the threads of protoplasm the inorganic skeleton is formed by larger and smaller crystals and crystalline threads in the various families of sponges the quantity of inorganic matter varies greatly some sponges are nearly devoid of an inorganic skeleton while other families consist chiefly of lime or silica the organic tissue being only rudimentarily developed as observed in their natural state sponges are apparently lifeless when however a live sponge is placed in water containing some finely powdered pigment in suspension it will be noticed that in regular short intervals water is absorbed through the pores of the tissue and ejected again through larger openings which are called oscul following up these into the interior we find them divided into numerous branches the walls of which are under the microscope found to be covered with minute cells fastened at one end only and oscillating continually by means of these cells the sponge receives its nourishment sponges with very rigid inorganic skeletons may be divided into two classescalcareous and siliciousaccording to whether the skeleton is chiefly composed of lime or silica our engravings represent two species of the latter kind which are on account of the peculiar appearance of their skeleton called glass sponges fig 1 represents the sprinkling pot sponge eucleptella aspergillum it is generally found in very deep water throughout the pacific specimens were found over fifty years ago but as they had to be brought up from depths between 500 and 800 fathoms they remained very scarce and sold at fabulous prices illustration fig 1sprinkling pot spongeeucleptella aspergillum the skeleton is formed by small crystals and long threads of vitreous silica cemented together during life by protoplasm they are arranged in longitudinal and annular bands so as to form a long curved cylinder about nine to twelve inches long the walls of which are about one inch in thickness the threads and bands are interwoven with the greatest regularity and when the skeleton is freed from the adhering organic matter it looks extremely beautiful the mode in which the intersecting bunches of crystals are connected is shown in fig 2 the upper end of the cylinder is closed by a perforated cover which probably has given rise to the name of the sponge the upper portion of the cylinder is surrounded by a few irregular annular masses of organic tissue which adheres loosely only to the skeleton the lower end is formed by a bunch of long threads rooting firmly in the ground illustration fig 2sponge crystals magnified up to about ten years ago the price of specimens of this sponge was very high at that time however a colony of eucleptellas was found near the cities of cebu and manila in the east indies in a depth not exceeding 100 fathoms and since they have appeared in larger quantities in the market it is remarkable that contrary to their habits these organisms have immigrated into regions to which they were totally unaccustomed yet it must be regarded as a greater curiosity that they have been accompanied to their new abode by a few animals living in equally deep water and never met with before at depths less than three or four hundred fathoms among these animals is a phormosoma water hedgehog noted for its long spines glass sponges are not confined to tropical regions they are met with in latitudes as high as the fre islands where the beautiful holtenia carpentaria abounds it is represented in fig 3 its cupshaped skeleton is similar in structure to that of the eucleptella numerous crystalline needles protrude from the surface of the upper part lately some specimens of holtenia have been found on the coast of florida illustration fig 3holtenia carpenteria glass sponges serve as dwellings for numerous animals especially crustace a small shrimp inhabits the tubes of the eucleptella a male and a female generally living together they are shut up as in a prison in their crystalline home as they are generally too large to pass through the meshes formed by the bundles of crystals it was formerly believed that these skeletons had actually been built by the shrimps and we can find no explanation for this curious circumstance other than that the shrimps entered these habitations while very small and became too large to leave them plants protected by insects mr francis darwin in a lecture on means of selfdefense among plants delivered lately at the london institution said that one of the most curious forms of defense known is afforded by a recently discovered class of plants which being stingless themselves are protected by stinging ants which make their home in the plant and defend it against its enemies of these the most remarkable is the bullshorn acacia described by the late mr belt in his book the naturalist in nicaragua a shrubby tree with gigantic curved thorns from which its name is derived these horns are hollow and tenanted by ants which bore a hole in them and the workers may be seen running about over the green leaves if a branch is shaken the ants swarm out of the thorns and attack the aggressor with their stings their chief service to the plant consists in defending it against leafcutting ants which are the great enemy of all vegetation in that part of america the latter form large underground nests and their work of destruction consists in gathering leaves which they strip to form heaps of material which become covered over with a delicate white fungus on which the larv of the ants are fed so that literally they are a colony of mushroom growers the special province of the little stinging ants which live in the thorns of the acacia is therefore to protect the leaves of the shrub from being used by the leafcutters to make mushroom beds certain varieties of the orange tree have leaves which are distasteful to the leafcutters this property of the leaves thus forming a means of defense other plants are unaccountably spared by themgrass for example which if brought to the nest is at once thrown out by some ant in authority the bullshorn acacia in return for the service rendered by the stinging ants not only affords them shelter in its thorns but provides them with nectar secreted by glands at the base of its leaves and also grows for them small yellow pearshaped bodies about one twelfth of an inch in length at the tip of some of its leaflets which they use as food these little yellow bodies are made up of cells containing protoplasm rich in oil and afford the insects an excellent food when the leaf unfolds the ants may be seen running from one leaflet to another to see if these little yellow bodies are ripe and if they are ready to be gathered they are broken up by the ants and carried away to the nest in the thorn several small birds also build their nests in the bulls horn acacia thus escaping from a predatory ant which is capable of killing young birds the trumpet tree another plant of south and central america is also protected by a standing army of ants and like the above mentioned acacia grows for its protectors small food bodies containing oil but instead of secreting nectar in its leaves it harbors a small insect coccus whose sweet secretion is much relished by the ants dr beccari mentions an epiphytal plant growing on trees in borneo the seeds of which germinate like those of the mistletoe on the branches of the tree and the seedling stem crowned by the cotyledons grows to about an inch in length remaining in that condition until a certain species of ant bites a hole in the stem which then produces a galllike growth that ultimately constitutes the home of the ants if the plant is not fortunate enough to be bitten by an ant it dies these ants then protect their plant home by rushing out fiercely on intruders and thus are preserved the sessile white flowers which in this plant are developed on the tuber like body advance in ironat a meeting of the philadelphia iron merchants association march 11 prices of all descriptions of merchant iron were advanced fully 5 per cent the aneroid barometer the aneroid barometer was invented by m vidi of paris it consists essentially of a circular box the face of which is made of thin elastic metal rendered more elastic by being stamped and pressed into concentric circular wavelike corrugations this box is nearly exhausted of air and its elastic face supports the pressure of the atmosphere and yields to it with elastic resistance in proportion to the amount of pressure thus if the atmospheric pressure increases the face is pressed inward if atmospheric pressure diminishes the elastic reaction of the metal moves the face outward these movements are communicated to an index by suitable and very delicate mechanism and registered in largely magnified dimensions by the movements of this index upon the face of the dial aneroid barometers are now made of pocket size compensated for temperature and with double scales one reading the height of the barometer column the other the elevation obtained i have says prof w m williams used one of these during many years and find it a very interesting traveling companion it is sufficiently sensitive to indicate the ascent from the ground floor to the upper rooms of a threestoried house or to enable the traveler sitting in a railway train to tell by watching its face whether he is ascending or descending an incline such slight variations are more easily observed on the aneroid than on the mercurial barometer and therefore it is commonly stated that the aneroid is the more sensitive instrument this however is a fallacious conclusion it is not the superior sensitiveness of the movements of the instrument but the greater facility of reading them that gives this advantage to the aneroid the index of which has a needle point traveling nearly in contact with the foot of the divisions the readings are further aided by a needle point register attached to a movable rim which may be brought point to point against the index thus showing the slightest movement that human vision may detect a magnifying lens may be easily used in such a case it should be understood that the aneroid barometer is not an independent instrument it is merely a device for representing the movements of the mercurial barometer it is regulated by comparison with the primary instrument and this comparison should be renewed from time to time as the elastic properties of the metal may and do vary an adjusting or regulating screw is attached to the back of the instrument and is usually movable by a watch key besides this the magnified reading of course magnifies any primary error and is largely dependent on the accuracy of the mechanism the albocarbon light we need hardly remind our readers that numerous unsuccessful attempts have been made at various times to enrich ordinary coal gas by the aid of volatile oils upon the present occasion we have to place before them particulars of a process having the same object in view but which is so far dissimilar in that it deals with a solid substance instead of a liquid oil the invention has been brought into its present practical shape by mr james livesey c e of no 9 victoria chambers westminster in conjunction with mr kidd with whom it originated the process consists in the employment of a substance called albocarbon which is the solid residuum of creosote this material is moulded into the form of candles which in large lamps are placed in a metallic vessel or receiver near the gas burner the albocarbon is warmed by the heat of the burning gas the heat being transmitted to the receiver by a metallic conductor upon the albocarbon being raised to the necessary temperature it volatilizes and as the coal gas passes over it to the burner its vapor becomes mingled with the gas and greatly raises its illuminating power of course when first lighted the coal gas only is burned but in a few minutes the albocarbon communicates its enriching vapor to it the only alteration necessary to the present gas fittings is the vaporizing chamber which is of simple construction although at present the details of the various arrangements necessary for the different kinds of lights have not yet been fully worked out this invention is now being tried experimentally in the eastern section of the westminster aquarium where we recently examined it and found it to afford a marked improvement upon the ordinary system of gas illumination although a smaller number of burners is being used tried alternately with ordinary coal gas the higher illuminating power of the albocarbon light was very remarkable it appears that there are 200 burners fitted at the aquarium with the new light and these successfully take the place of 500 ordinary gas burners previously in use the illuminating effect is stated to be doubled with an additional advantage as regards economy the reduction of cost arises from the smaller quantity of gas consumed with the albocarbon process than without it and the very small cost of the enriching material according to our information 1000 cubic feet of ordinary gas as generally used will by the albocarbon appliance give as much illumination as 3000 cubic feet without it and the cost of the material to produce this result is only 1s 6d experiments have been made with this light by mr t w keates the consulting chemist to the metropolitan board of works who reports very favorably upon it as does also dr wallace of glasgow who has obtained some very satisfactory results with it it is claimed for the albocarbon material that it is perfectly inexplosive safe and portable that it causes no obstruction and leaves no residuum and that the receivers can be replenished almost indefinitely without any accumulation taking place so perfect is the evaporation of the albocarbon on the whole the display at the aquarium speaks greatly in favor of the new process of gas enrichment which other things being equal bids fair to find its way into practiceengineering english and american hardware mr frederick smith manager of the union land and building company limited recently read a paper on the above subject before the manchester scientific and mechanical society mr h whiley superintendent of the manchester health department presided the following is the text of the paper as given in the london ironmonger the lecturer said a spectator in any of our courts of justice will generally be struck with the amount of hard swearing which is given to the court under the name of evidence he will find one set of witnesses testifying under oath to one thing and another set also under oath to the very opposite some prove too much some too little some are of a totally negative character proving nothing and some are of no character at all and therefore are willing to prove anything to some extent the same phenomena are to be observed in reference to the question of foreign competition on the one hand the manufacturers hold up to our affrighted vision the picture of our mills stopped our machine shops standing empty and idle our hardware trade slipping through our fingers our ships rotting in our own and in foreign ports and our greatness as a producing nation for ever passed away on the other hand the journalists who take the labor side of the question the tradesunion leaders and a large number of the workmen themselves hold that we have little or nothing to fear from our foreign rivals that the depression like those atmospheric ones of which our american cousins are constantly warning us will pass away and leave us with better times to follow i will therefore as far as possible keep out of the region of speculation give you a few facts show you some examples and leave you to draw your own inferences some two or three years ago ordinary axle pulleys of english make were difficult to get the price was scandalously high and the quality as scandalously low out of a dozen probably four would not turn round without sticking and the casting waswell simply vile i show you a sample rather above the average and the retail price for this inferior article was 22s per gross all at once the americans deluged the english market with the pulley which i now show to you and it needs no explanation of mine to satisfy the mechanical minds present of the superiority of the transatlantic article but when we also bear in mind that the price of the american was from 25 to 33 per cent less than the english pulley you can understand how the builders exulted and how the volscians of the birmingham district were fluttered then and not till then would the english maker condescend to believe that it was possible to improve upon the wretched things which he had foisted upon his customers and he at once commenced to copy the american pulley he has not yet succeeded in producing such a beautiful casting but i venture to say that he has improved the quality more in the last eighteen months than in the previous eighteen years now take the ordinary door furniture for generations the english builder and householder has had to be content with the stereotyped with all its aggravating propensities first the little screw so small as to be scarcely perceptible to touch or to sight shakes loose from its countersunk depression in the spindle gets lost and lets the knob go adrift or next the knob itself formed of a bit of sheet brass turns round on its shank and the door cannot be opened or the shank not having a sufficient bearing on the spindle works loose and the whole thing is out of repair it is the same thing today as it was when it tormented my grandfather for of course no improvement could be made until uncle sam sent us his cheap strong serviceable and sensible mineral knob the english maker says but look at the many devices which we have invented for door furniture granted and some of them very good but none of them so good as thisfor the money plenty of them well adapted for extraordinary use but none of them cheap enough and strong enough to be placed in competition with this in fitting up the dwelling of the ordinary englishman the spindle and furniture of a lock is the portion which is liable to and receives the most rough usage i have here an ordinary cheap set of china furniture of english make which i dare not drop lest i should break it but as you see i dare throw its yankee competitor the whole length of this room the retail price of this english set is ninepencethe price of the american is less than sixpence the english spindle is fitted with the usual little screw the knob is loose the roses are china and liable to break with the least strain or blow the american set as you see has a long shank the form of the knob is a very oblate spheroid giving a good grip and free play for the fingers between the knob and the door the rose is japanned iron and has small studs or teeth projecting on its inner side effectually preventing it from turning round with the spindle the screw is strong and is tapped through the spindle itself insuring both security and perfect steadiness several small washers are supplied with each spindle enabling the slack to be taken up perfectly and at the same time preventing the spindle from sticking with any ordinary amount of friction i will now show you a cheap american rim lock first you will notice that both sides are alike next that by pulling the latch forward it can be turned half round and is thereby converted from a right hand to a left hand or vice versa in an instant this is an important point to a builder but our lockmakers do not seem to know it several attempts have been made to introduce locks of this kind but the fancy prices put upon every article which departs in ever so slight a measure from the antediluvian patterns mostly used practically prohibits their adoption the carcass of the lock is of cast iron the casting like all the small american castings is simply perfect bosses are cast round the follower and keyholes the box staple is one piece of metal neat and strong but there is another point and to my mind the most important one whatever opinions may be held as to the relative quality of this lock whether it is better or worse than an english one it is at least an honest article it makes no pretensions to be any better than it is it does not entrap the unwary purchaser by pretending to be a firstclass article when at the same time it may be a swindle i will now show you an ordinary 6 inch rimlock of english manufacture at a short distance it looks like a superior article the follower and keyhole appear as if they were bushed with brass but let us take it to pieces and see what we can find the follower is a rough casting not turned at the bearings and is in no sense a fit the screw holes are not countersunk but merely punched in the key is of the roughest and worst fitting description the inside is as rough and cheap as possible the key is cut so as to deceive the purchaser into the belief that there are twice as many wards in the lock as is really the case and the bushes prove to be thin plates of brass riveted on and not bushes at all in short the whole article is a vile fraud and the maker was a swindler this is strong language but i think you will agree with me when i maintain that it is not stronger than the circumstances warrant but there are still its defects of bad design and useless workmanship the lock is of the usual form given to the english rimlock that is it has a flange which requires to be let into the edge of the door i have fixed hundreds of them and have never yet been able to see a use for this flange it is one great obstacle to the general introduction of a reversible lock it adds to the labor of fixing without adding to the security of the door for if the door is to be forced from the outside the box staples give way first if from the inside the unscrewing of the box staple is all that is necessary to give egress if the door requires easing it effectually prevents it being donein fact it is a nuisance and nothing but a nuisance but our lockmakers do not appear to give these things a thought their doctrine seems to be as it was in the beginning is now and ever shall be again notice that the edges of the iron which lie against the door and the sham bushes are ground bright here is labor wasted for as soon as the lock is fixed these polished portions are hidden for ever next take the box staple as is usual it is fearfully and wonderfully made up of sheet iron square iron and brass the outcome of which is that the showy brass striking piece comes unriveted the door comes unfastened and the tenants temper comes unhinged why in the name of common sense could they not substitute a neat malleable casting in our own houses i have long since discarded the ordinary box staple for drawback locks and find it cheaper to buy a cast iron staple and throw away the one supplied by the english lockmaker bear in mind that i have shown neither of these locks as samples of highclass goods but as samples of the furniture fixed in the houses of the working and middle classes of this country and when i tell you that the american lock fitted with the mineral furniture is at least 25 per cent cheaper than the english abortion i have shown to you you will begin to realize what our english markets have to fear from the americans here is a common cheap english mortise lock and you will naturally ask why the outside of this lock is ground bright when it is buried in the door and never seen except it has to be taken out for repairs i have asked the same question and for 20 years have paused for a reply this lock is not reversible the follower is not bushed and the inside is rough and cheap contrast it with this neat american lock and notice again the bosses to receive the wear notice also that the bolts are brass the latchbolt is of course reversiblei never saw an american lock which was not the body of the lock is cast iron and seeing that there are no strains upon a mortise lock it is quite as good as if it was of wrought iron there is no unnecessary grinding but the iron is japanned and the japan is as much superior to the english compound as is the lacquer ware of the japanese to that which is executed in birmingham and palmed upon the ignorant buyer as japanese work in fact as you can see for yourselves the english japan looks almost like gas tar beside the american this american lock is a twolever and there is no sham about the key which is made of some kind of white metal and is small and neat this lock is only 2 per cent higher in price than the english before leaving these locks let me say a word or two upon the relative wear upon their different portions and their relative safety the english maker appears to ignore the fact that nineteentwentieths of the wear of a lock is upon the latch spindle and follower the amount of actual wear upon the rest of the lock is comparatively slight let any of you consider the number of times you open and close a door compared with the times you lock it our drawbacks and large rim locks are used about once a day the great bulk of our mortise locks are not used except as latches once a week one argument used by our manufacturers against the american lock is that being made by machinery there is necessarily a great duplication of parts and a consequent lowering of the standard of security while their own locks being made by hand are not alike and therefore cannot be so easily opened let any of you put this argument to proof by trying how many front doors you can open with one key in a row of workmens dwellings such as are found in manchester ranging up to 25 rentals and the result will astonish you if our own manufacturers made their locks sufficiently well to give this security there would be some force in what they say but so far as security is concerned they might as well make their locks by machinery as make them in the way they do i now show you two thumb latches one of american and one of english make notice the general finish of the american latch the shape the mode of construction and everything about it proves that brains were used when it was designed and made the english norfolk latch on the other hand is ill designed uncomfortable in hand clumsily finished the japan hangs about it in lumps the latch is clumsy the catch is clumsier and the keeper a rough piece of hoop iron seems as if designed to keep the latch from doing its duty in this case the american latch is 25 per cent cheaper than the english one and the english latch is of the same pattern as the one that was in use when i was a boy only that it is a greatly inferior article i will now introduce you to the well known nuisance which we have been accustomed to use for fastening our cupboard doorsthe cupboard turnand without further comment ask you to compare it with this neat and simple latch of american make costing about 5 per cent more twice as efficacious and five times as durable in this case no improvement has been made in the english fastener it is just as it was when i went to the trade about 28 years ago and although many attempts have been made to improve it they have added so much to its cost as to prevent the improved articles from coming into general use the difference between the english and american inventor and designer seems to consist in thisthat while an englishman devotes all his energies to the improvement of an existing shape the american throws the old article under his bench and commences de novo i think i have made out a case against the english hardware manufacturer but when i have pointed these matters out to merchants and ironmongers i have been met with various reasons for this manifest inferiority i do not know how far these excuses may be valid but one man says that the reason as regards locks is somewhat as follows the locksmiths of the district wherein they are made in many cases work at their own homes one man making one part of a lock while other men make other parts this goes on generation after generation and the men become mere machines not knowing how the entire lock is constructed and not caring to know another attributes it to the influence of the tradesunions and says that if a manufacturer wants a different kind of lock the price for the work is immediately put higher even though the actual labor may not be increased a third says it is due to the drunkenness of the hands and their consequent poverty and physical and social demoralization which prevents them from rising to such an intellectual level as will enable them to see the evils of their system and adopt the right means to remove them a fourth boldly says we make these goods because our customers want them how far the reasons assigned by the first three are correct i am unable to say but for the fourth the extent to which the builders of england have patronized the americans is a complete answer this defense our customers want them is as old as the hills and has been used to cover every kind of deception and inferior article ever manufactured our lancashire manufacturers use it when they are charged with sending china clay and mildew and call it calico for the mild hindoo and the heathen chinee to dress themselves in our butter merchants use it when they make up grease and call it butter and our hardware merchants use it when they send us sham locks and call them brass bushed etc it is the duty of the manufacturer to invent for his customers and it is preposterous to say that the builder would prefer that embodiment of fraudthe english rimlock which i showed to youto the american lock which at any rate was an honest article especially when the latter had the great advantage of being considerably cheaper i am afraid that the swindling and greed of our merchants is having the effect of thrusting us out of the markets of the world including our home markets and when it is too late these men who are making the name of english goods a byword and a reproach even among the hindoos the chinese and the untutored savages of the south sea islands will find that honesty is the best policy we have been accustomed to hear a deal of buncombe talked about the honesty of the englishman and the want of honesty of the yankee about the enterprise of our manufacturers and the skill of our workmen but if what i have shown to you is to be taken as a specimen it is time we set our house in order since commencing the paper i have read the discussion between messrs chubb and hill and am at a loss to know why messrs chubb entered into the arena if all the english makers tried to reach chubbs standard we should keep our markets at least so far as high quality is concerned and to see messrs chubb acting as champions of the english lockmakers is something like seeing messrs horrocks taking up the cudgels for those people who manufacture china clay and call it calico the proportion of fiber in the material being just a little greater than that found in hair mortar in conclusion i wish it to be understood that i bring these facts before you in no exultant spirit i am an englishman and the future welfare of myself and my children depends very much upon the future of english manufactures but we cannot be blind to the fact that the apathy and conservatism of our manufacturers the greed of our merchants and the ignorance and drunkenness of our workmen are weighing us so heavily in the race for trade that a member of our own family whose leading business should be to produce food for us is outstripping us with the greatest ease our boasted supremacy as a manufacturing people is leaving us and leaving us under such humiliating circumstancesand if the men of birmingham and the district are content to dwell in their present fools paradise it is the duty of every lover of his country to speak as plainly as possible to them of course i am prepared to be told that as i am not a lockmaker my opinion is worthless but i have been about 28 years as man and boy employer and workman in the building trade and if i have not got to know something about builders hardware during that period i have made but a poor use of my time i do not know if i have added to your stock of knowledge but deeming the subject an important one i have done the best i could in the time at my disposal in the discussion which followed the opinion of the members present was

insulating material for making induction coils which will dry rapidly a alcoholic shellac varnish rosin to which a little beeswax has been added is an excellent insulator it must be applied in a melted state 6 what is the composition of the black material covering the leclanche porous cell a gutta percha 7 is the magnetoelectric machine described in the scientific american supplement patented a to which do you refer most if not all of them are patented 8 b v f writes with reference to item 8 on page 139 of scientific american march 1 1879 i think there is some mistake about the coal you think required to heat 1000 cubic feet space i burn some 8 tons coal to heat in the whole year such part of my house as must exceed 2520189000 cubic feet we keep up a moderate heat at night ventilate more than most families do take part only of the cool air and only in part of the coldest weather from the cellar which at such times is opened into the main entries house wood back plastered and stands alone if 100 lbs coal would heat 1000 feet one day i ought to burn 900 lbs a day or nearly 14 tons in december and 14 more in january a we are glad to receive these data which correspond quite closely with some obtained by recent accurate experiments the estimate given in the scientific american also agrees well with experiments on the use of hot air heaters for very small buildings or rooms of course the larger the space to be heated the more economically it can generally be done 9 w m s asks will the coil described in supplement no 160 do for the electric pen described in a recent number of the scientific american if not how must it be changed a it is too large make it one half the size given illustration 10 b gin reply to your inquiry as to mr strohs telephone experiment we give the following which we clip from the english mechanic a singular experimental effect of special interest just now from its possible bearing on the theory of the source of sound in the bell telephone has just been observed by mr stroh the well known mechanician if a telephone t with the circuit of its coil left open be held to the ear and a powerful magnet m be moved gently up and down along the length of the magnet as shown by the arrow and at a distance of an inch or two from it a faint breathing sound will be heard the recurring pulses of sound keeping time with the up and down motion of the magnet the sound may be aptly compared to the steady breathing of a child and there is a striking resemblance between it and the microphonic sounds of gases diffusing through a porous septum as heard by mr chandler roberts we understand that professor hughes is investigating the cause of this curious sound by help of the microphone 11 enterprise asks what part of its volume will iron expand in passing from a temperature of 60 to melting temperature a the cubical expansion of iron for each degree c between 0 and 100 is 000003546 of its volume its volume being 1 this ratio however increases somewhat at higher temperatures since the mean coefficient of expansion for each degree between 0 c and 300 c is 000004405 the question you ask has probably never been settled you may form an approximation by the use of the above ratios knowing the melting point of the iron 12 p l o asks for a good chemistry for a beginner to study without a teacher a fownes chemistry gorupbesanez inorganic organic and physiological chemistry 13 l e m asks what is the best method of keeping fine guns from rusting and what oil should be used a for the outside clear gum copal 1 part oil of rosemary 1 part absolute alcohol 3 parts clean and heat the metal and apply a flowing coat of the liquid by means of a camels hair brush do not handle until the coat becomes dry and hard for the inside of the barrel a trace of refined sperm oil is as good as anything but an excess should be avoided 14 a h b asks how much weight falling 10 feet will be required to produce one horse power for five hours a one horse power for 5 hours 33000 300 9900000 foot poundsso that the weight required is 9900000 10 990000 lbs 15 a d r asks 1 in renewing a leclanche battery do the zincs have to be amalgamated a they are usually amalgamated 2 will two cells large size leclanche battery give any light using the simple lamp described in supplement no 162 a no 16 h l j writes in a recent issue of the scientific american you state that the floating of solid iron on melted iron is on the same principle as the floating of ice in water i do not quite understand how it can be please explain a solid iron at an elevated temperature floats upon molten iron for the same reason that ice floats upon molten icewaterbecause it is specifically lighter you will find the subject discussed at length in tyndalls heat as a mode of motion 17 j w will find full directions for canning corn etc on p 394 4 vol 39 scientific american 18 amateur writes i wish to make some small bells that have a clear ring
