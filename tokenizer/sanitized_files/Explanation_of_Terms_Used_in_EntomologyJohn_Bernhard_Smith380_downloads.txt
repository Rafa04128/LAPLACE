september 23 2007 ebook 22748 language english credits produced by jon richfield start of the project gutenberg ebook explanation of terms used in entomology produced by jon richfield explanation of terms used in entomology prepared by john b smith scd professor of entomology in rutgers college c published by the brooklyn entomological society brooklyn n y 1906 press of the new era printing company lancaster pa scanners note this book is about a century old at the time of scanning i found it in the discard pile of a local university library i find the book to be of exceptional historical interest in the insights it gives into the development of early modern entomological science it also is of practical value as a source for terms that are obscure to modern users because they are no longer current i have edited the text as well as i could and i think it is by now very usable but do treat any really suspicious looking passages with reserve i have avoided the use of nonalphabetic symbols as far as i could for example greek letters and male female and hermaphroditic symbols but if you encounter difficulties you might find the problem there also the colour table at the end is not really much good for anything beyond general impressions not only are the paper and ink old but between my scanner and your screen or printer there is room for too much misinterpretation of precise colour for anyone to take it seriously in any case enjoy the book is a valuable product of serious workers in an age of exploration foreword when some time since in consequence of continuing demands the brooklyn entomological society resolved to publish a new edition of its explanation of terms used in entomology and entrusted the writer and two associates with the task of preparing the same it was believed that a little revision of definitions the dropping of a few obsolete terms and the addition of a few lately proposed would be all that was necessary it was to be a light task to fill idle time in summer report to be made in fall two years have passed since that time the associates have dropped by the way the manuscript contains five times the number of terms in the original explanation and if it is published now it is not because i believe it to be complete but because i do not believe it can be made complete except as the result of criticism and voluntary addition by specialists throughout the country it is twentysix years since the original list was published and nothing can better illustrate the advances made than a comparison between the old and the new glossary no one realizes better than i the fact that as students have increased in each order each has followed an independent line of research absolutely without regard to the work done elsewhere in consequence we have several terms for the same thing in many cases and in an equal number several meanings to the same term as no one man can nowadays cover the entire field of entomology it goes without saying that i was compelled to rely partly upon books and partly upon the good nature of correspondents to make the work even approximately complete the first notable contribution came from professor justus w folsom of urbana illinois who sent me over 2000 cards of terms collected by himself and his assistants and these added materially at the beginning of the work a number of correspondents were good enough to send in lists of terms in coleoptera lepidoptera orthoptera hemiptera and neuroptera and to refer me to literature where explanations of other special terms could be found after the cards were so far advanced as to warrant a preliminary manuscript dr philip p calvert of the university of pennsylvania mr nathan banks of washington dc and mr c w johnson of the boston society of natural history went carefully over the entire work and by their criticisms and additions contributed materially to such merit as it possesses to these gentlemen and to the many others not specifically mentioned i give thanks for their assistance and if there have not been more coworkers it has been only because of the time element that seems to demand the best that is ready rather than a delay to secure perfection it would be interesting to go at length into the history of the correspondence to determine what sort of terms should or should not be included and to bring out the hopeless divergencies existing but all that is important here is to state briefly what has been included and what omitted common english terms even if descriptive when used in their ordinary dictionary sense have not been included as a rule but this is subject to many exceptions latin terms and derivatives even if used in their usual sense have been generally included but compounds made up of adequately defined descriptive terms are generally omitted adverbial or adjective forms have been omitted whenever it has been considered safe and so have terms prefixed by sub supra and the like indicating degree or position in doubtful cases the terms have been included and defined all terms of venation are so far as possible reduced to the comstock system which is the only one that has been satisfactorily worked out for all orders and a series of figures is added to explain this system so far as seems necessary it has not been considered feasible to determine the proper use of terms applied differently in different orders or families that is scarcely within the scope of a work of this kind terms used in embryological and histological study have been included only so far as seemed necessary to an understanding of the general works and no attempt has been made to cover the terms applied to musculature and other details of microscopic structure this has seemed rather to be outside of the scope of the present essay all color terms are reduced so far as possible to terms of the windsor and newton system of water colors which are standard in the englishspeaking world and the color plate shows solid blocks of those colors that seem necessary to explain all modifications except metallics blacks and whites scanners note color plate may be excluded partly because it is in poor condition the figures illustrating body structures and other details have been drawn under my supervision by mr john a grossbeck and are meant to be guides merely else the glossary would exceed its scope in the admission that the work is incomplete no apology is intended for its publication it is merely a statement of fact to encourage constructive rather than destructive criticism it is hoped that those who note errors or omissions will communicate them to the writer so that when another edition is needed as it will be before many years are past a standard work may be possible john b smith scd new brunswick nj april 1906 explanatory definitions of general application are as a rule given first where more than one is necessary next those of limited use and finally the specific meaning in each order in which there is any notable difference where a word has more than one ending the difference is given after a hyphen which represents the stem word eg ametabola ous the latter in place of ametabolous which indicates the possession of the characters peculiar to the ametabola where there is an english and a latin ending the former is usually given with the word and the other is added eg aequilate us instead of aequilatus there being no difference in the application usually the singular form of the word is first given and the plural ending is added eg antenna ae cenchrus ri desideratum ata but occasionally when the plural is more commonly used eg epimera eron this is reversed and the singular ending is added when the two are different in form eg foot and feet the words are given separately and so when there is a difference in the application as in uncus and unci in the definition of color terms the words in brackets refer to the equivalent color as named on the plate or the combination needed to produce it the names in parentheses are those of the writers whose definitions are used or who have used the term in the sense defined in the terms of venation these parentheses occur most frequently most of the signs and abbreviations are those in common use equal to or the same as qv which see pl plural abb abbreviated the abbreviated names are comst for
