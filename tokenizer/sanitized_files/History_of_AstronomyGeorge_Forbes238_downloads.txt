evolution of intellectual thought in the progress of astronomical discovery and by recognising the different points of view of the different ages to give due credit even to the ancients no one can expect in a history of astronomy of limited size to find a treatise on practical or on theoretical astronomy nor a complete descriptive astronomy and still less a book on speculative astronomy something of each of these is essential however for tracing the progress of thought and knowledge which it is the object of this history to describe the progress of human knowledge is measured by the increased habit of looking at facts from new points of view as much as by the accumulation of facts the mental capacity of one age does not seem to differ from that of other ages but it is the imagination of new points of view that gives a wider scope to that capacity and this is cumulative and therefore progressive aristotle viewed the solar system as a geometrical problem kepler and newton converted the point of view into a dynamical one aristotles mental capacity to understand the meaning of facts or to criticise a train of reasoning may have been equal to that of kepler or newton but the point of view was different then again new points of view are provided by the invention of new methods in that system of logic which we call mathematics all that mathematics can do is to assure us that a statement a is equivalent to statements b c d or is one of the facts expressed by the statements b c d so that we may know if b c and d are true then a is true to many people our inability to understand all that is contained in statements b c and d without the cumbrous process of a mathematical demonstration proves the feebleness of the human mind as a logical machine for it required the new point of view imagined by newtons analysis to enable people to see that so far as planetary orbits are concerned keplers three laws b c d were identical with newtons law of gravitation a no one recognises more than the mathematical astronomer this feebleness of the human intellect and no one is more conscious of the limitations of the logical process called mathematics which even now has not solved directly the problem of only three bodies these reflections arising from the writing of this history go to explain the invariable humility of the great mathematical astronomers newtons comparison of himself to the child on the seashore applies to them all as each new discovery opens up it may be boundless oceans for investigation for wonder and for admiration the great astronomers refusing to accept mere hypotheses as true have founded upon these discoveries a science as exact in its observation of facts as in theories so it is that these men who have built up the most sure and most solid of all the sciences refuse to invite others to join them in vain speculation the writer has therefore in this short history tried to follow that great master airy whose pupil he was and the key to whose character was exactness and accuracy and he recognises that science is impotent except in her own limited sphere it has been necessary to curtail many parts of the history in the attemptperhaps a hopeless oneto lay before the reader in a limited space enough about each age to illustrate its tone and spirit the ideals of the workers the gradual addition of new points of view and of new means of investigation it would indeed be a pleasure to entertain the hope that these pages might among new recruits arouse an interest in the greatest of all the sciences or that those who have handled the theoretical or practical side might be led by them to read in the original some of the classics of astronomy many students have much compassion for the schoolboy of today who is not allowed the luxury of learning the art of reasoning from him who still remains preeminently its greatest exponent euclid these students pity also the man of tomorrow who is not to be allowed to read in the original latin of the brilliant kepler how he was ableby observations taken from a moving platform the earth of the directions of a moving object marsto deduce the exact shape of the path of each of these planets and their actual positions on these paths at any time keplers masterpiece is one of the most interesting books that was ever written combining wit imagination ingenuity and certainty lastly it must be noted that as a history of england cannot deal with the present parliament so also the unfinished researches and untested hypotheses of many wellknown astronomers of today cannot be included among the records of the history of astronomy the writer regrets the necessity that thus arises of leaving without mention the names of many who are now making history in astronomical work g f august 1st 1909 book i the geometrical period 1 primitive astronomy and astrology the growth of intelligence in the human race has its counterpart in that of the individual especially in the earliest stages intellectual activity and the development of reasoning powers are in both cases based upon the accumulation of experiences and on the comparison classification arrangement and nomenclature of these experiences during the infancy of each the succession of events can be watched but there can be no priori anticipations experience alone in both cases leads to the idea of cause and effect as a principle that seems to dominate our present universe as a rule for predicting the course of events and as a guide to the choice of a course of action this idea of cause and effect is the most potent factor in developing the history of the human race as of the individual in no realm of nature is the principle of cause and effect more conspicuous than in astronomy and we fall into the habit of thinking of its laws as not only being unchangeable in our universe but necessary to the conception of any universe that might have been substituted in its place the first inhabitants of the world were compelled to accommodate their acts to the daily and annual alternations of light and darkness and of heat and cold as much as to the irregular changes of weather attacks of disease and the fortune of war they soon came to regard the influence of the sun in connection with light and heat as a cause this led to a search for other signs in the heavens if the appearance of a comet was sometimes noted simultaneously with the death of a great ruler or an eclipse with a scourge of plague these might well be looked upon as causes in the same sense that the veering or backing of the wind is regarded as a cause of fine or foul weather for these reasons we find that the earnest men of all ages have recorded the occurrence of comets eclipses new stars meteor showers and remarkable conjunctions of the planets as well as plagues and famines floods and droughts wars and the deaths of great rulers sometimes they thought they could trace connections which might lead them to say that a comet presaged famine or an eclipse war even if these men were sometimes led to evolve laws of cause and effect which now seem to us absurd let us be tolerant and gratefully acknowledge that these astrologers when they suggested such working hypotheses were laying the foundations of observation and deduction if the ancient chaldans gave to the planetary conjunctions an influence over terrestrial events let us remember that in our own time people have searched for connection between terrestrial conditions and periods of unusual prevalence of sun spots while de la rue loewy and balfour stewart1 thought they found a connection between sunspot displays and the planetary positions thus we find scientific men even in our own time responsible for the belief that storms in the indian ocean the fertility of german vines famines in india and high or low nilefloods in egypt follow the planetary positions and again the desire to foretell the weather is so laudable that we cannot blame the ancient greeks for announcing the influence of the moon with as much confidence as it is affirmed in lord wolseleys soldiers pocket book even if the scientific spirit of observation and deduction astronomy has sometimes led to erroneous systems for predicting terrestrial events astrology we owe to the old astronomer and astrologer alike the deepest gratitude for their diligence in recording astronomical events for out of the scanty records which have survived the destructive acts of fire and flood of monarchs and mobs we have found much that has helped to a fuller knowledge of the heavenly motions than was possible without these records so hipparchus about 150 bc and ptolemy a little later were able to use the observations of chaldan astrologers as well as those of alexandrian astronomers and to make some discoveries which have helped the progress of astronomy in all ages so also mr cowell2 has examined the marks made on the baked bricks used by the chaldans for recording the eclipses of 1062 bc and 762 bc and has thereby been enabled in the last few years to correct the lunar tables of hansen and to find a more accurate value for the secular acceleration of the moons longitude and the node of her orbit than any that could be obtained from modern observations made with instruments of the highest precision so again mr hind 3 was enabled to trace back the period during which halleys comet has been a member of the solar system and to identify it in the chinese observations of comets as far back as 12 bc cowell and cromellin extended the date to 240 bc in the same way the comet 1861i has been traced back in the chinese records to 617 ad 4 the theoretical views founded on newtons great law of universal gravitation led to the conclusion that the inclination of the earths equator to the plane of her orbit the obliquity of the ecliptic has been diminishing slowly since prehistoric times and this fact has been confirmed by egyptian and chinese observations on the length of the shadow of a vertical pillar made thousands of years before the christian era in summer and winter there are other reasons why we must be tolerant of the crude notions of the ancients the historian wishing to give credit wherever it may be due is met by two difficulties firstly only a few records of very ancient astronomy are extant and the authenticity of many of these is open to doubt secondly it is very difficult to divest ourselves of present knowledge and to appreciate the originality of thought required to make the first beginnings with regard to the first point we are generally dependent upon histories written long after the events the astronomy of egyptians babylonians and assyrians is known to us mainly through the greek historians and for information about the chinese we rely upon the researches of travellers and missionaries in comparatively recent times the testimony of the greek writers has fortunately been confirmed and we now have in addition a mass of facts translated from the original sculptures papyri and inscribed bricks dating back thousands of years in attempting to appraise the efforts of the beginners we must remember that it was natural to look upon the earth as all the first astronomers did as a circular plane surrounded and bounded by the heaven which was a solid vault or hemisphere with its concavity turned downwards the stars seemed to be fixed on this vault the moon and later the planets were seen to crawl over it it was a great step to look on the vault as a hollow sphere carrying the sun too it must have been difficult to believe that at midday the stars are shining as brightly in the blue sky as they do at night it must have been difficult to explain how the sun having set in the west could get back to rise in the east without being seen if it was always the same sun it was a great step to suppose the earth to be spherical and to ascribe the diurnal motions to its rotation probably the greatest step ever made in astronomical theory was the placing of the sun moon and planets at different distances from the earth instead of having them stuck on the vault of heaven it was a transition from flatland to a space of three dimensions great progress was made when systematic observations began such as following the motion of the moon and planets among the stars and the inferred motion of the sun among the stars by observing their heliacal risingsie the times of year when a star would first be seen to rise at sunrise and when it could last be seen to rise at sunset the grouping of the stars into constellations and recording their places was a useful observation the theoretical prediction of eclipses of the sun and moon and of the motions of the planets among the stars became later the highest goal in astronomy to not one of the above important steps in the progress of astronomy can we assign the author with certainty probably many of them were independently taken by chinese indian persian tartar egyptian babylonian assyrian phoenician and greek astronomers and we have not a particle of information about the discoveries which may have been great by other peoplesby the druids the mexicans and the peruvians for example we do know this that all nations required to have a calendar the solar year the lunar month and the day were the units and it is owing to their incommensurability that we find so many calendars proposed and in use at different times the only object to be attained by comparing the chronologies of ancient races is to fix the actual dates of observations recorded and this is not a part of a history of astronomy in conclusion let us bear in mind the limited point of view of the ancients when we try to estimate their merit let us remember that the first astronomy was of two dimensions the second astronomy was of three dimensions but still purely geometrical since keplers day we have had a dynamical astronomy

difficulties the way of assigning to the ancient nations their proper place in the development of primitive notions about astronomy the fact that some alleged observations date back to a period before the chinese had invented the art of writing leads immediately to the question how far tradition can be trusted our first detailed knowledge was gathered in the far east by travellers and by the jesuit priests and was published in the eighteenth century the asiatic society of bengal contributed translations of brahmin literature the two principal sources of knowledge about chinese astronomy were supplied first by father souciet who in 1729 published observations astronomical geographical chronological and physical drawn from ancient chinese books and later by father moyriacdemailla who in 17771785 published annals of the chinese empire translated from tongkienkangmou bailly in his astronomie ancienne 1781 drew from these and other sources the conclusion that all we know of the astronomical learning of the chinese indians chaldans assyrians and egyptians is but the remnant of a far more complete astronomy of which no trace can be found delambre in his histoire de lastronomie ancienne 1817 ridicules the opinion of bailly and considers that the progress made by all of these nations is insignificant it will be well now to give an idea of some of the astronomy of the ancients not yet entirely discredited china and babylon may be taken as typical examples chinait would appear that fohi the first emperor reigned about 2952 bc and shortly afterwards yuchi made a sphere to represent the motions of the celestial bodies it is also mentioned in the book called chuking supposed to have been written in 2205 bc that a similar sphere was made in the time of yao 2357 bc1 it is said that the emperor chueni 2513 bc saw five planets in conjunction the same day that the sun and moon were in conjunction this is discussed by father martin mss of de lisle also by m desvignolles mem acad berlin vol iii p 193 and by m kirsch ditto vol v p 19 who both found that mars jupiter saturn and mercury were all between the eleventh and eighteenth degrees of pisces all visible together in the evening on february 28th 2446 bc while on the same day the sun and moon were in conjunction at 9 am and that on march 1st the moon was in conjunction with the other four planets but this needs confirmation yao referred to above gave instructions to his astronomers to determine the positions of the solstices and equinoxes and they reported the names of the stars in the places occupied by the sun at these seasons and in 2285 bc he gave them further orders if this account be true it shows a knowledge that the vault of heaven is a complete sphere and that stars are shining at midday although eclipsed by the suns brightness it is also asserted in the book called chuking that in the time of yao the year was known to have 36514 days and that he adopted 365 days and added an intercalary day every four years as in the julian calendar this may be true or not but the ancient chinese certainly seem to have divided the circle into 365 degrees to learn the length of the year needed only patient observationa characteristic of the chinese but many younger nations got into a terrible mess with their calendar from ignorance of the years length it is stated that in 2159 bc the royal astronomers hi and ho failed to predict an eclipse it probably created great terror for they were executed in punishment for their neglect if this account be true it means that in the twentysecond century bc some rule for calculating eclipses was in use here again patient observation would easily lead to the detection of the eighteenyear cycle known to the chaldeans as the saros it consists of 235 lunations and in that time the pole of the moons orbit revolves just once round the pole of the ecliptic and for this reason the eclipses in one cycle are repeated with very slight modification in the next cycle and so on for many centuries it may be that the neglect of their duties by hi and ho and their punishment influenced chinese astronomy or that the succeeding records have not been available to later scholars but the fact remains thatalthough at long intervals observations were made of eclipses comets and falling stars and of the position of the solstices and of the obliquity of the eclipticrecords become rare until 776 bc when eclipses began to be recorded once more with some approach to continuity shortly afterwards notices of comets were added biot gave a list of these and mr john williams in 1871 published observations of comets from 611 bc to 1640 ad extracted from the chinese annals with regard to those centuries concerning which we have no astronomical chinese records it is fair to state that it is recorded that some centuries before the christian era in the reign of tsinchihoang all the classical and scientific books that could be found were ordered to be destroyed if true our loss therefrom is as great as from the burning of the alexandrian library by the caliph omar he burnt all the books because he held that they must be either consistent or inconsistent with the koran and in the one case they were superfluous in the other case objectionable chaldansuntil the last half century historians were accustomed to look back upon the greeks who led the world from the fifth to the third century bc as the pioneers of art literature and science but the excavations and researches of later years make us more ready to grant that in science as in art the greeks only developed what they derived from the egyptians babylonians and assyrians the greek historians said as much in fact and modern commentators used to attribute the assertion to undue modesty since however the records of the libraries have been unearthed it has been recognised that the babylonians were in no way inferior in the matter of original scientific investigation to other races of the same era the chaldans being the most ancient babylonians held the same station and dignity in the state as did the priests in egypt and spent all their time in the study of philosophy and astronomy and the arts of divination and astrology they held that the world of which we have a conception is an eternal world without any beginning or ending in which all things are ordered by rules supported by a divine providence and that the heavenly bodies do not move by chance nor by their own will but by the determinate will and appointment of the gods they recorded these movements but mainly in the hope of tracing the will of the gods in mundane affairs ptolemy about 130 ad made use of babylonian eclipses in the eighth century bc for improving his solar and lunar tables fragments of a library at agade have been preserved at nineveh from which we learn that the starcharts were even then divided into constellations which were known by the names which they bear to this day and that the signs of the zodiac were used for determining the courses of the sun moon and of the five planets mercury venus mars jupiter and saturn we have records of observations carried on under asshurbanapal who sent astronomers to different parts to study celestial phenomena here is one to the director of observationsmy lord his humble servant nabushumiddin great astronomer of nineveh writes thus may nabu and marduk be propitious to the director of these observations my lord the fifteenth day we observed the node of the moon and the moon was eclipsed the phoenicians are supposed to have used the stars for navigation but there are no records the egyptian priests tried to keep such astronomical knowledge as they possessed to themselves it is probable that they had arbitrary rules for predicting eclipses all that was known to the greeks about egyptian science is to be found in the writings of diodorus siculus but confirmatory and more authentic facts have been derived from late explorations thus we learn from e b knobel2 about the jewish calendar dates on records of land sales in aramaic papyri at assuan translated by professor a h sayce and a e cowley 1 that the lunar cycle of nineteen years was used by the jews in the fifth century bc the present reformed jewish calendar dating from the fourth century ad a date a little more than a century after the grandfathers and greatgrandfathers of those whose business is recorded had fled into egypt with jeremiah sayce and 2 that the order of intercalation at that time was not dissimilar to that in use at the present day then again knobel reminds us of the most interesting discovery a few years ago by father strassmeier of a babylonian tablet recording a partial lunar eclipse at babylon in the seventh year of cambyses on the fourteenth day of the jewish month tammuz ptolemy in the almagest suntaxis says it occurred in the seventh year of cambyses on the night of the seventeenth and eighteenth of the egyptian month phamenoth pingr and oppolzer fix the date july 16th 533 bc thus are the relations of the chronologies of jews and egyptians established by these explorations footnotes 1 these ancient dates are uncertain 2 r a s monthly notices vol lxviii no 5 march 1908 3 ancient greek astronomy we have our information about the earliest greek astronomy from herodotus born 480 bc he put the traditions into writing thales 639546 bc is said to have predicted an eclipse which caused much alarm and ended the battle between the medes and lydians airy fixed the date may 28th 585 bc but other modern astronomers give different dates thales went to egypt to study science and learnt from its priests the length of the year which was kept a profound secret and the signs of the zodiac and the positions of the solstices he held that the sun moon and stars are not mere spots on the heavenly vault but solids that the moon derives her light from the sun and that this fact explains her phases that an eclipse of the moon happens when the earth cuts off the suns light from her he supposed the earth to be flat and to float upon water he determined the ratio of the suns diameter to its orbit and apparently made out the diameter correctly as half a degree he left nothing in writing his successors anaximander 610547 bc and anaximenes 550475 bc held absurd notions about the sun moon and stars while heraclitus 540500 bc supposed that the stars were lighted each night like lamps and the sun each morning parmenides supposed the earth to be a sphere pythagoras 569470 bc visited egypt to study science he deduced his system in which the earth revolves in an orbit from fantastic first principles of which the following are examples the circular motion is the most perfect motion fire is more worthy than earth ten is the perfect number he wrote nothing but is supposed to have said that the earth moon five planets and fixed stars all revolve round the sun which itself revolves round an imaginary central fire called the antichthon copernicus in the sixteenth century claimed pythagoras as the founder of the system which he copernicus revived anaxagoras born 499 bc studied astronomy in egypt he explained the return of the sun to the east each morning by its going under the flat earth in the night he held that in a solar eclipse the moon hides the sun and in a lunar eclipse the moon enters the earths shadowboth excellent opinions but he entertained absurd ideas of the vortical motion of the heavens whisking stones into the sky there to be ignited by the fiery firmament to form stars he was prosecuted for this unsettling opinion and for maintaining that the moon is an inhabited earth he was defended by pericles 432 bc solon dabbled like many others in reforms of the calendar the common year of the greeks originally had 360 daystwelve months of thirty days solons year was 354 days it is obvious that these erroneous years would before long remove the summer to january and the winter to july to prevent this it was customary at regular intervals to intercalate days or months meton 432 bc introduced a reform based on the nineteenyear cycle this is not the same as the egyptian and chaldean eclipse cycle called saros of 223 lunations or a little over eighteen years the metonic cycle is 235 lunations or nineteen years after which period the sun and moon occupy the same position relative to the stars it is still used for fixing the date of easter the number of the year in melons cycle being the golden number of our prayerbooks melons system divided the 235 lunations into months of thirty days and omitted every sixtythird day of the nineteen years twelve had twelve months and seven had thirteen months callippus 330 bc used a cycle four times as long 940 lunations but one day short of melons seventysix years this was more correct eudoxus 406350 bc is said to have travelled with plato in egypt he made astronomical observations in asia minor sicily and italy and described the starry heavens divided into constellations his name is connected with a planetary theory which as generally stated sounds most fanciful he imagined the fixed stars to be on a vault of heaven and the sun moon and planets to be upon similar vaults or spheres twentysix revolving spheres in all the motion of each planet being resolved into its components and a separate sphere being assigned for each component motion callippus 330 bc increased the number to thirtythree it is now generally accepted that the real existence of these spheres was not suggested but the idea was only a mathematical conception to facilitate the construction of tables for predicting the places of the heavenly bodies aristotle 384322 bc summed up the state of astronomical knowledge in his time and held the earth to be fixed in the centre of the world nicetas heraclides and ecphantes supposed the earth to revolve on its axis but to have no orbital motion the short epitome so far given illustrates the extraordinary deductive methods adopted by the ancient greeks but they went much farther in the same direction they seem to have been in great difficulty to explain how the earth is supported just as were those who invented the myth of atlas or the indians with the tortoise thales thought that the flat earth floated on water anaxagoras thought that being flat it would be buoyed up and supported on the air like a kite democritus thought it remained fixed like the donkey between two bundles of hay because it was equidistant from all parts of the containing sphere and there was no reason why it should incline one way rather than another empedocles attributed its state of rest to centrifugal force by the rapid circular movement of the heavens as water is stationary in a pail when whirled round by a string democritus further supposed that the inclination of the flat earth to the ecliptic was due to the greater weight of the southern parts owing to the exuberant vegetation for further references to similar efforts of imagination the reader is referred to sir george cornwall lewiss historical survey of the astronomy of the ancients london 1862 his list of authorities is very complete but some of his conclusions are doubtful at p 113 of that work he records the real opinions of socrates as set forth by xenophon and the reader will perhaps sympathise with socrates in his views on contemporary astronomy with regard to astronomy he socrates considered a knowledge of it desirable to the extent of determining the day of the year or month and the hour of the night but as to learning the courses of the stars to be occupied with the planets and to inquire about their distances from the earth and their orbits and the causes of their motions he strongly objected to such a waste of valuable time he dwelt on the contradictions and conflicting opinions of the physical philosophers and in fine he held that the speculators on the universe and on the laws of the heavenly bodies were no better than madmen xen mem i 1 1115 plato born 429 bc the pupil of socrates the fellowstudent of euclid and a follower of pythagoras studied science in his travels in egypt and elsewhere he was held in so great reverence by all learned men that a problem which he set to the astronomers was the keynote to all astronomical investigation from this date till the time of kepler in the sixteenth century he proposed to astronomers the problem of representing the courses of the planets by circular and uniform motions systematic observation among the greeks began with the rise of the alexandrian school aristillus and timocharis set up instruments and fixed the positions of the zodiacal stars near to which all the planets in their orbits pass thus facilitating the determination of planetary motions aristarchus 320250 bc showed that the sun must be at least nineteen times as far off as the moon which is far short of the mark he also found the suns diameter correctly to be half a degree eratosthenes 276196 bc measured the inclination to the equator of the suns apparent path in the heavensie he measured the obliquity of the ecliptic making it 23 51 confirming our knowledge of its continuous diminution during historical times he measured an arc of meridian from alexandria to syene assuan and found the difference of latitude by the length of a shadow at noon summer solstice he deduced the diameter of the earth 250000 stadia unfortunately we do not know the length of the stadium he used hipparchus 190120 bc may be regarded as the founder of observational astronomy he measured the obliquity of the ecliptic and agreed with eratosthenes he altered the length of the tropical year from 365 days 6 hours to 365 days 5 hours 53 minutesstill four minutes too much he measured the equation of time and the irregular motion of the sun and allowed for this in his calculations by supposing that the centre about which the sun moves uniformly is situated a little distance from the fixed earth he called this point the excentric the line from the earth to the excentric was called the line of apses a circle having this centre was called the equant and he supposed that a radius drawn to the sun from the excentric passes over equal arcs on the equant in equal times he then computed tables for predicting the place of the sun he proceeded in the same way to compute lunar tables making use of chaldan eclipses he was able to get an accurate value of the moons mean motion halley in 1693 compared this value with his own measurements and so discovered the acceleration of the moons mean motion this was conclusively established but could not be explained by the newtonian theory for quite a long time he determined the plane of the moons orbit and its inclination to the ecliptic the motion of this plane round the pole of the ecliptic once in eighteen years complicated the problem he located the moons excentric as he had done the suns he also discovered some of the minor irregularities of the moons motion due as newtons theory proves to the disturbing action of the suns attraction in the year 134 bc hipparchus observed a new star this upset every notion about the permanence of the fixed stars he then set to work to catalogue all the principal stars so as to know if any others appeared or disappeared here his experiences resembled those of several later astronomers who when in search of some special object have been rewarded by a discovery in a totally different direction on comparing his star positions with those of timocharis and aristillus he found no stars that had appeared or disappeared in the interval of 150 years but he found that all the stars seemed to have changed their places with reference to that point in the heavens where the ecliptic is 90 from the poles of the earthie the equinox he found that this could be explained by a motion of the equinox in the direction of the apparent diurnal motion of the stars this discovery of precession of the equinoxes which takes place at the rate of 521 every year was necessary for the progress of accurate astronomical observations it is due to a steady revolution of the earths pole round the pole of the ecliptic once in 26000 years in the opposite direction to the planetary revolutions hipparchus was also the inventor of trigonometry both plane and spherical he explained the method of using eclipses for determining the longitude in connection with hipparchus great discovery it may be mentioned that modern astronomers have often attempted to fix dates in history by the effects of precession of the equinoxes 1 at about the date when the great pyramid may have been built gamma draconis was near to the pole and must have been used as the polestar in the north face of the great pyramid is the entrance to an inclined passage and six of the nine pyramids at gizeh possess the same feature all the passages being inclined at an angle between 26 and 27 to the horizon and in the plane of the meridian it also appears that 4000 years agoie about 2100 bcan observer at the lower end of the passage would be able to see gamma draconis the then polestar at its lower culmination1 it has been suggested that the passage was made for this purpose on other grounds the date assigned to the great pyramid is 2123 bc 2 the chaldans gave names to constellations now invisible from babylon which would have been visible in 2000 bc at which date it is claimed that these people were studying astronomy 3 in the odyssey calypso directs odysseus in accordance with phoenician rules for navigating the mediterranean to keep the great bear ever on the left as he traversed the deep when sailing from the pillars of hercules gibraltar to corfu yet such a course taken now would land the traveller in africa odysseus is said in his voyage in springtime to have seen the pleiades and arcturus setting late which seemed to early commentators a proof of homers inaccuracy likewise homer both in the odyssey 2 v 2725 and in the iliad xviii 489 asserts that the great bear never set in those latitudes now it has been found that the precession of the equinoxes explains all these puzzles shows that in springtime on the mediterranean the bear was just above the horizon near the sea but not touching it between 750 bc and 1000 bc and fixes the date of the poems thus confirming other evidence and establishing homers character for accuracy 3 4 the orientation of egyptian temples and druidical stones is such that possibly they were so placed as to assist in the observation of the heliacal risings 4 of certain stars if the star were known this would give an approximate date up to the present the results of these investigations are far from being conclusive ptolemy 130 ad wrote the suntaxis or almagest which includes a cyclopedia of astronomy containing a summary of knowledge at that date we have no evidence beyond his own statement that he was a practical observer he theorised on the planetary motions and held that the earth is fixed in the centre of the universe he adopted the excentric and equant of hipparchus to explain the unequal motions of the sun and moon he adopted the epicycles and deferents which had been used by apollonius and others to explain the retrograde motions of the planets we who know that the earth revolves round the sun once in a year can understand that the apparent motion of a planet is only its motion relative to the earth if then we suppose the earth fixed and the sun to revolve round it once a year and the planets each in its own period it is only necessary to impose upon each of these an additional annual motion to enable us to represent truly the apparent motions this way of looking at the apparent motions shows why each planet when nearest to the earth seems to move for a time in a retrograde direction the attempts of ptolemy and others of his time to explain the retrograde motion in this way were only approximate let us suppose each planet to have a bar with one end centred at the earth if at the other end of the bar one end of a shorter bar is pivotted having the planet at its other end then the planet is given an annual motion in the secondary circle the epicycle whose centre revolves round the earth on the primary circle the deferent at a uniform rate round the excentric ptolemy supposed the centres of the epicycles of mercury and venus to be on a bar passing through the sun and to be between the earth and the sun the centres of the epicycles of mars jupiter and saturn were supposed to be further away than the sun mercury and venus were supposed to revolve in their epicycles in their own periodic times and in the deferent round the earth in a year the major planets were supposed to revolve in the deferent round the earth in their own periodic times and in their epicycles once in a year it did not occur to ptolemy to place the centres of the epicycles of mercury and venus at the sun and to extend the same system to the major planets something of this sort had been proposed by the egyptians we are told by cicero and others and was accepted by tycho brahe and was as true a representation of the relative motions in the solar system as when we suppose the sun to be fixed and the earth to revolve the cumbrous system advocated by ptolemy answered its purpose enabling him to predict astronomical events approximately he improved the lunar theory considerably and discovered minor inequalities which could be allowed for by the addition of new epicycles we may look upon these epicycles of apollonius and the excentric of hipparchus as the responses of these astronomers to the demand of plato for uniform circular motions their use became more and more confirmed until the seventeenth century when the accurate observations of tycho brahe enabled kepler to abolish these purely geometrical makeshifts and to substitute a system in which the sun became physically its controller footnotes 1 phil mag vol xxiv pp 4814 2 plaeiadas t esoronte kai opse duonta bootaen arkton th aen kai amaxan epiklaesin kaleousin ae t autou strephetai kai t oriona

epicyclesfrom ptolemy to copernicus after ptolemy had published his book there seemed to be nothing more to do for the solar system except to go on observing and finding more and more accurate values for the constants involvedviz the periods of revolution the diameter of the deferent1 and its ratio to that of the epicycle2 the distance of the excentric3 from the centre of the deferent and the position of the line of apses4 besides the inclination and position of the plane of the planets orbit the only object ever aimed at in those days was to prepare tables for predicting the places of the planets it was not a mechanical problem there was no notion of a governing law of forces from this time onwards all interest in astronomy seemed in europe at least to sink to a low ebb when the caliph omar in the middle of the seventh century burnt the library of alexandria which had been the centre of intellectual progress that centre migrated to baghdad and the arabs became the leaders of science and philosophy in astronomy they made careful observations in the middle of the ninth century albategnius a syrian prince improved the value of excentricity of the suns orbit observed the motion of the moons apse and thought he detected a smaller progression of the suns apse his tables were much more accurate than ptolemys abul wefa in the tenth century seems to have discovered the moons variation meanwhile the moors were leaders of science in the west and arzachel of toledo improved the solar tables very much ulugh begh grandson of the great tamerlane the tartar built a fine observatory at samarcand in the fifteenth century and made a great catalogue of stars the first since the time of hipparchus at the close of the fifteenth century king alphonso of spain employed computers to produce the alphonsine tables 1488 ad purbach translated ptolemys book and observations were carried out in germany by mller known as regiomontanus and waltherus nicolai copernicus a sclav was born in 1473 at thorn in polish prussia he studied at cracow and in italy he was a priest and settled at frauenberg he did not undertake continuous observations but devoted himself to simplifying the planetary systems and devising means for more accurately predicting the positions of the sun moon and planets he had no idea of framing a solar system on a dynamical basis his great object was to increase the accuracy of the calculations and the tables the results of his cogitations were printed just before his death in an interesting book de revolutionibus orbium celestium it is only by careful reading of this book that the true position of copernicus can be realised he noticed that nicetas and others had ascribed the apparent diurnal rotation of the heavens to a real daily rotation of the earth about its axis in the opposite direction to the apparent motion of the stars also in the writings of martianus capella he learnt that the egyptians had supposed mercury and venus to revolve round the sun and to be carried with him in his annual motion round the earth he noticed that the same supposition if extended to mars jupiter and saturn would explain easily why they and especially mars seem so much brighter in opposition for mars would then be a great deal nearer to the earth than at other times it would also explain the retrograde motion of planets when in opposition we must here notice that at this stage copernicus was actually confronted with the system accepted later by tycho brahe with the earth fixed but he now recalled and accepted the views of pythagoras and others according to which the sun is fixed and the earth revolves and it must be noted that geometrically there is no difference of any sort between the egyptian or tychonic system and that of pythagoras as revived by copernicus except that on the latter theory the stars ought to seem to move when the earth changes its positiona test which failed completely with the rough means of observation then available the radical defect of all solar systems previous to the time of kepler 1609 ad was the slavish yielding to platos dictum demanding uniform circular motion for the planets and the consequent evolution of the epicycle which was fatal to any conception of a dynamical theory copernicus could not sever himself from this obnoxious tradition5 it is true that neither the pythagorean nor the egyptotychonic system required epicycles for explaining retrograde motion as the ptolemaic theory did furthermore either system could use the excentric of hipparchus to explain the irregular motion known as the equation of the centre but copernicus remarked that he could also use an epicycle for this purpose or that he could use both an excentric and an epicycle for each planet and so bring theory still closer into accord with observation and this he proceeded to do6 moreover observers had found irregularities in the moons motion due as we now know to the disturbing attraction of the sun to correct for these irregularities copernicus introduced epicycle on epicycle in the lunar orbit this is in its main features the system propounded by copernicus but attention must to state the case fully be drawn to two points to be found in his first and sixth books respectively the first point relates to the seasons and it shows a strange ignorance of the laws of rotating bodies to use the words of delambre7 in drawing attention to the strange conception he imagined that the earth revolving round the sun ought always to show to it the same face the contrary phenomena surprised him to explain them he invented a third motion and added it to the two real motions rotation and orbital revolution by this third motion the earth he held made a revolution on itself and on the poles of the ecliptic once a year copernicus did not know that motion in a straight line is the natural motion and that motion in a curve is the resultant of several movements he believed with aristotle that circular motion was the natural one copernicus made this rotation of the earths axis about the pole of the ecliptic retrograde ie opposite to the orbital revolution and by making it perform more than one complete revolution in a year the added part being 126000 of the whole he was able to include the precession of the equinoxes in his explanation of the seasons his explanation of the seasons is given on leaf 10 of his book the pages of this book are not all numbered only alternate pages or leaves in his sixth book he discusses the inclination of the planetary orbits to the ecliptic in regard to this the theory of copernicus is unique and it will be best to explain this in the words of grant in his great work8 he says copernicus as we have already remarked did not attack the principle of the epicyclical theory he merely sought to make it more simple by placing the centre of the earths orbit in the centre of the universe this was the point to which the motions of the planets were referred for the planes of their orbits were made to pass through it and their points of least and greatest velocities were also determined with reference to it by this arrangement the sun was situate mathematically near the centre of the planetary system but he did not appear to have any physical connexion with the planets as the centre of their motions according to copernicus sixth book the planes of the planetary orbits do not pass through the sun and the lines of apses do not pass through to the sun such was the theory advanced by copernicus the earth moves in an epicycle on a deferent whose centre is a little distance from the sun the planets move in a similar way on epicycles but their deferents have no geometrical or physical relation to the sun the moon moves on an epicycle centred on a second epicycle itself centred on a deferent excentric to the earth the earths axis rotates about the pole of the ecliptic making one revolution and a twentysix thousandth part of a revolution in the sidereal year in the opposite direction to its orbital motion in view of this fanciful structure it must be noted in fairness to copernicus that he repeatedly states that the reader is not obliged to accept his system as showing the real motions that it does not matter whether they be true even approximately or not so long as they enable us to compute tables from which the places of the planets among the stars can be predicted9 he says that whoever is not satisfied with this explanation must be contented by being told that mathematics are for mathematicians mathematicis mathematica scribuntur at the same time he expresses his conviction over and over again that the earth is in motion it is with him a pious belief just as it was with pythagoras and his school and with aristarchus but as dreyer says in his most interesting book tycho brahe proofs of the physical truth of his system copernicus had given none and could give none any more than pythagoras or aristarchus there was nothing so startlingly simple in his system as to lead the cautious astronomer to accept it as there was in the later keplerian system and the absence of parallax in the stars seemed to condemn his system which had no physical basis to recommend it and no simplification at all over the egyptotychonic system to which copernicus himself drew attention it has been necessary to devote perhaps undue space to the interesting work of copernicus because by a curious chance his name has become so widely known he has been spoken of very generally as the founder of the solar system that is now accepted this seems unfair and on reading over what has been written about him at different times it will be noticed that the astronomersthose who have evidently read his great bookare very cautious in the words with which they eulogise him and refrain from attributing to him the foundation of our solar system which is entirely due to kepler it is only the more popular writers who give the idea that a revolution had been effected when pythagoras system was revived and when copernicus supported his view that the earth moves and is not fixed it may be easy to explain the association of the name of copernicus with the keplerian system but the time has long passed when the historian can support in any way this popular error which was started not by astronomers acquainted with keplers work but by those who desired to put the church in the wrong by extolling copernicus copernicus dreaded much the abuse he expected to receive from philosophers for opposing the authority of aristotle who had declared that the earth was fixed so he sought and obtained the support of the church dedicating his great work to pope paul iii in a lengthy explanatory epistle the bishop of cracow set up a memorial tablet in his honour copernicus was the most refined exponent and almost the last representative of the epicyclical school as has been already stated his successor tycho brahe supported the same use of epicycles and excentrics as copernicus though he held the earth to be fixed but tycho brahe was eminently a practical observer and took little part in theory and his observations formed so essential a portion of the system of kepler that it is only fair to include his name among these who laid the foundations of the solar system which we accept today in now taking leave of the system of epicycles let it be remarked that it has been held up to ridicule more than it deserves on reading airys account of epicycles in the beautifully clear language of his six lectures on astronomy the impression is made that the jointed bars there spoken of for describing the circles were supposed to be real this is no more the case than that the spheres of eudoxus and callippus were supposed to be real both were introduced only to illustrate the mathematical conception upon which the solar planetary and lunar tables were constructed the epicycles represented nothing more nor less than the first terms in the fourier series which in the last century has become a basis of such calculations both in astronomy and physics

the true solar systemtycho brahekepler during the period of the intellectual and aesthetic revival at the beginning of the sixteenth century the spirit of the age was fostered by the invention of printing by the downfall of the byzantine empire and the scattering of greek fugitives carrying the treasures of literature through western europe by the works of raphael and michael angelo by the reformation and by the extension of the known world through the voyages of spaniards and portuguese during that period there came to the front the founder of accurate observational astronomy tycho brahe a dane born in 1546 of noble parents was the most distinguished diligent and accurate observer of the heavens since the days of hipparchus 1700 years before tycho was devoted entirely to his science from childhood and the opposition of his parents only stimulated him in his efforts to overcome difficulties he soon grasped the hopelessness of the old deductive methods of reasoning and decided that no theories ought to be indulged in until preparations had been made by the accumulation of accurate observations we may claim for him the title of founder of the inductive method for a complete life of this great man the reader is referred to dreyers tycho brahe edinburgh 1890 containing a complete bibliography the present notice must be limited to noting the work done and the qualities of character which enabled him to attain his scientific aims and which have been conspicuous in many of his successors he studied in germany but king frederick of denmark appreciating his great talents invited him to carry out his lifes work in that country he granted to him the island of hveen gave him a pension and made him a canon of the cathedral of roskilde on that island tycho brahe built the splendid observatory which he called uraniborg and later a second one for his assistants and students called stjerneborg these he fitted up with the most perfect instruments and never lost a chance of adding to his stock of careful observations1 the account of all these instruments and observations printed at his own press on the island was published by tycho brahe himself and the admirable and numerous engravings bear witness to the excellence of design and the stability of his instruments his mechanical skill was very great and in his workmanship he was satisfied with nothing but the best he recognised the importance of rigidity in the instruments and whereas these had generally been made of wood he designed them in metal his instruments included armillae like those which had been used in alexandria and other armillae designed by himselfsextants mural quadrants large celestial globes and various instruments for special purposes he lived before the days of telescopes and accurate clocks he invented the method of subdividing the degrees on the arc of an instrument by transversals somewhat in the way that pedro nunez had proposed he originated the true system of observation and reduction of observations recognising the fact that the best instrument in the world is not perfect and with each of his instruments he set to work to find out the errors of graduation and the errors of mounting the necessary correction being applied to each observation when he wanted to point his instrument exactly to a star he was confronted with precisely the same difficulty as is met in gunnery and rifleshooting the sights and the object aimed at cannot be in focus together and a great deal depends on the form of sight tycho brahe invented and applied to the pointers of his instruments an aperturesight of variable area like the iris diaphragm used now in photography this enabled him to get the best result with stars of different brightness the telescope not having been invented he could not use a telescopicsight as we now do in gunnery this not only removes the difficulty of focussing but makes the minimum visible angle smaller helmholtz has defined the minimum angle measurable with the naked eye as being one minute of arc in view of this it is simply marvellous that when the positions of tychos standard stars are compared with the best modern catalogues his probable error in right ascension is only 24 1 and in declination only 25 9 clocks of a sort had been made but tycho brahe found them so unreliable that he seldom used them and many of his positionmeasurements were made by measuring the angular distances from known stars taking into consideration the absence of either a telescope or a clock and reading his account of the labour he bestowed upon each observation we must all agree that kepler who inherited these observations in ms was justified under the conditions then existing in declaring that there was no hope of anyone ever improving upon them in the year 1572 on november 11th tycho discovered in cassiopeia a new star of great brilliance and continued to observe it until the end of january 1573 so incredible to him was such an event that he refused to believe his own eyes until he got others to confirm what he saw he made accurate observations of its distance from the nine principal stars in casseiopeia and proved that it had no measurable parallax later he employed the same method with the comets of 1577 1580 1582 1585 1590 1593 and 1596 and proved that they too had no measurable parallax and must be very distant the startling discovery that stars are not necessarily permanent that new stars may appear and possibly that old ones may disappear had upon him exactly the same effect that a similar occurrence had upon hipparchus 1700 years before he felt it his duty to catalogue all the principal stars so that there should be no mistake in the future during the construction of his catalogue of 1000 stars he prepared and used accurate tables of refraction deduced from his own observations thus he eliminated so far as naked eye observations required the effect of atmospheric refraction which makes the altitude of a star seem greater than it really is tycho brahe was able to correct the lunar theory by his observations copernicus had introduced two epicycles on the lunar orbit in the hope of obtaining a better accordance between theory and observation and he was not too ambitious as his desire was to get the tables accurate to ten minutes tycho brahe found that the tables of copernicus were in error as much as two degrees he rediscovered the inequality called variation by observing the moon in all phasesa thing which had not been attended to it is remarkable that in the nineteenth century sir george airy established an altazimuth at greenwich observatory with this special object to get observations of the moon in all phases he also discovered other lunar equalities and wanted to add another epicycle to the moons orbit but he feared that these would soon become unmanageable if further observations showed more new inequalities but as it turned out the most fruitful work of tycho brahe was on the motions of the planets and especially of the planet mars for it was by an examination of these results that kepler was led to the discovery of his immortal laws after the death of king frederick the observatories of tycho brahe were not supported the gigantic power and industry displayed by this determined man were accompanied as often happens by an overbearing manner intolerant of obstacles this led to friction and eventually the observatories were dismantled and tycho brahe was received by the emperor rudolph ii who placed a house in prague at his disposal here he worked for a few years with kepler as one of his assistants and he died in the year 1601 it is an interesting fact that tycho brahe had a firm conviction that mundane events could be predicted by astrology and that this belief was supported by his own predictions it has already been stated that tycho brahe maintained that observation must precede theory he did not accept the copernican theory that the earth moves but for a working hypothesis he used a modification of an old egyptian theory mathematically identical with that of copernicus but not involving a stellar parallax he says de mundi etc that the ptolemean system was too complicated and the new one which that great man copernicus had proposed following in the footsteps of aristarchus of samos though there was nothing in it contrary to mathematical principles was in opposition to those of physics as the heavy and sluggish earth is unfit to move and the system is even opposed to the authority of scripture the absence of annual parallax further involves an incredible distance between the outermost planet and the fixed stars we are bound to admit that in the circumstances of the case so long as there was no question of dynamical forces connecting the members of the solar system his reasoning as we should expect from such a man is practical and sound it is not surprising then that astronomers generally did not readily accept the views of copernicus that luther luthers tischreden pp 22 60 derided him in his usual pithy manner that melancthon initia doctrinae physicae said that scripture and also science are against the earths motion and that the men of science whose opinion was asked for by the cardinals who wished to know whether galileo was right or wrong looked upon copernicus as a weaver of fanciful theories johann kepler is the name of the man whose place as is generally agreed would have been the most difficult to fill among all those who have contributed to the advance of astronomical knowledge he was born at wiel in the duchy of wurtemberg in 1571 he held an appointment at gratz in styria and went to join tycho brahe in prague and to assist in reducing his observations these came into his possession when tycho brahe died the emperor rudolph entrusting to him the preparation of new tables called the rudolphine tables founded on the new and accurate observations he had the most profound respect for the knowledge skill determination and perseverance of the man who had reaped such a harvest of most accurate data and though tycho hardly recognised the transcendent genius of the man who was working as his assistant and although there were disagreements between them kepler held to his post sustained by the conviction that with these observations to test any theory he would be in a position to settle for ever the problem of the solar system illustration portrait of johannes kepler by f wanderer from reitlingers johannes kepler original in strassburg it has seemed to many that platos demand for uniform circular motion linear or angular was responsible for a loss to astronomy of good work during fifteen hundred years for a hundred illconsidered speculative cosmogonies for dissatisfaction amounting to disgust with these priori guesses and for the relegation of the science to less intellectual races than greeks and other europeans nobody seemed to dare to depart from this fetish of uniform angular motion and circular orbits until the insight boldness and independence of johann kepler opened up a new world of thought and of intellectual delight while at work on the rudolphine tables he used the old epicycles and deferents and excentrics but he could not make theory agree with observation his instincts told him that these apologists for uniform motion were a fraud and he proved it to himself by trying every possible variation of the elements and finding them fail the number of hypotheses which he examined and rejected was almost incredible for example that the planets turn round centres at a little distance from the sun that the epicycles have centres at a little distance from the deferent and so on he says that after using all these devices to make theory agree with tychos observations he still found errors amounting to eight minutes of a degree then he said boldly that it was impossible that so good an observer as tycho could have made a mistake of eight minutes and added out of these eight minutes we will construct a new theory that will explain the motions of all the planets and he did it with elliptic orbits having the sun in a focus of each2 it is often difficult to define the boundaries between fancies imagination hypothesis and sound theory this extraordinary genius was a master in all these modes of attacking a problem his analogy between the spaces occupied by the five regular solids and the distances of the planets from the sun which filled him with so much delight was a display of pure fancy his demonstration of the three fundamental laws of planetary motion was the most strict and complete theory that had ever been attempted it has been often suggested that the revival by copernicus of the notion of a moving earth was a help to kepler no one who reads keplers great book could hold such an opinion for a moment in fact the excellence of copernicuss book helped to prolong the life of the epicyclical theories in opposition to keplers teaching all of the best theories were compared by him with observation these were the ptolemaic the copernican and the tychonic the two latter placed all of the planetary orbits concentric with one another the sun being placed a little away from their common centre and having no apparent relation to them and being actually outside the planes in which they move keplers first great discovery was that the planes of all the orbits pass through the sun his second was that the line of apses of each planet passes through the sun both were contradictory to the copernican theory he proceeds cautiously with his propositions until he arrives at his great laws and he concludes his book by comparing observations of mars of all dates with his theory his first law states that the planets describe ellipses with the sun at a focus of each ellipse his second law a far more difficult one to prove states that a line drawn from a planet to the sun sweeps over equal areas in equal times these two laws were published in his great work astronomia nova sen physica coelestis tradita commentariis de motibus stelloe martis prague 1609 it took him nine years more3 to discover his third law that the squares of the periodic times are proportional to the cubes of the mean distances from the sun these three laws contain implicitly the law of universal gravitation they are simply an alternative way of expressing that law in dealing with planets not particles only the power of the greatest human intellect is so utterly feeble that the meaning of the words in keplers three laws could not be understood until expounded by the logic of newtons dynamics the joy with which kepler contemplated the final demonstration of these laws the evolution of which had occupied twenty years can hardly be imagined by us he has given some idea of it in a passage in his work on harmonics which is not now quoted only lest someone might say it was egotisticala term which is simply grotesque when applied to such a man with such a lifes work accomplished the whole book astronomia nova is a pleasure to read the mass of observations that are used and the ingenuity of the propositions contrast strongly with the loose and imperfectly supported explanations of all his predecessors and the indulgent reader will excuse the devotion of a few lines to an example of the ingenuity and beauty of his methods it may seem a hopeless task to find out the true paths of mars and the earth at that time when their shape even was not known from the observations giving only the relative direction from night to night now kepler had twenty years of observations of mars to deal with this enabled him to use a new method to find the earths orbit observe the date at any time when mars is in opposition the earths position e at that date gives the longitude of mars m his period is 687 days now choose dates before and after the principal date at intervals of 687 days and its multiples mars is in each case in the same position now for any date when mars is at m and the earth at e3 the date of the year gives the angle e3sm and the observation of tycho gives the direction of mars compared with the sun se3m so all the angles of the triangle sem in any of these positions of e are known and also the ratios of se1 se2 se3 se4 to sm and to each other for the orbit of mars observations were chosen at intervals of a year when the earth was always in the same place illustration but kepler saw much farther than the geometrical facts he realised that the orbits are followed owing to a force directed to the sun and he guessed that this is the same force as the gravity that makes a stone fall he saw the difficulty of gravitation acting through the void space he compared universal gravitation to magnetism and speaks of the work of gilbert of colchester gilberts book de mundo nostro sublunari philosophia nova amstelodami 1651 containing similar views was published fortyeight years after gilberts death and fortytwo years after keplers book and reference his book de magnete was published in 1600 a few of keplers views on gravitation extracted from the introduction to his astronomia nova may now be mentioned 1 every body at rest remains at rest if outside the attractive power of other bodies 2 gravity is a property of masses mutually attracting in such manner that the earth attracts a stone much more than a stone attracts the earth 3 bodies are attracted to the earths centre not because it is the centre of the universe but because it is the centre of the attracting particles of the earth 4 if the earth be not round but spheroidal then bodies at different latitudes will not be attracted to its centre but to different points in the neighbourhood of that centre 5 if the earth and moon were not retained in their orbits by vital force aut alia aligua aequipollenti the earth and moon would come together 6 if the earth were to cease to attract its waters the oceans would all rise and flow to the moon 7 he attributes the tides to lunar attraction kepler had been appointed imperial astronomer with a handsome salary on paper a fraction of which was doled out to him very irregularly he was led to miserable makeshifts to earn enough to keep his family from starvation and proceeded to ratisbon in 1630 to represent his claims to the diet he arrived worn out and debilitated he failed in his appeal and died from fever contracted under and fed upon disappointment and exhaustion those were not the days when men could adopt as a profession the research of endowment before taking leave of kepler who was by no means a man of one idea it ought to be here recorded that he was the first to suggest that a telescope made with both lenses convex not a galilean telescope can have cross wires in the focus for use as a pointer to fix accurately the positions of stars an englishman gascoigne was the first to use this in practice from the all too brief epitome here given of keplers greatest book it must be obvious that he had at that time some inkling of the meaning of his lawsuniversal gravitation from that moment the idea of universal gravitation was in the air and hints and guesses were thrown out by many and in time the law of gravitation would doubtless have been discovered though probably not by the work of one man even if newton had not lived but if kepler had not lived who else could have discovered his laws footnotes 1 when the writer visited m darrest the astronomer at copenhagen in 1872 he was presented by darrest with one of several bricks collected from the ruins of uraniborg this was one of his most cherished possessions until on returning home after a prolonged absence on astronomical work he found that his treasure had been tidied away from his study 2 an ellipse is one of the plane sections of a cone it is an oval curve which may be drawn by fixing two pins in a sheet of paper at s and h

five minutes 6 galileo and the telescopenotions of gravity by horrocks etc it is now necessary to leave the subject of dynamical astronomy for a short time in order to give some account of work in a different direction originated by a contemporary of keplers his senior in fact by seven years galileo galilei was born at pisa in 1564 the most scientific part of his work dealt with terrestrial dynamics but one of those fortunate chances which happen only to really great men put him in the way of originating a new branch of astronomy the laws of motion had not been correctly defined the only man of galileos time who seems to have worked successfully in the same direction as himself was that admirable crichton of the italians leonardo da vinci galileo cleared the ground it had always been noticed that things tend to come to rest a ball rolled on the ground a boat moved on the water a shot fired in the air galileo realised that in all of these cases a resisting force acts to stop the motion and he was the first to arrive at the not very obvious law that the motion of a body will never stop nor vary its speed nor change its direction except by the action of some force it is not very obvious that a light body and a heavy one fall at the same speed except for the resistance of the air galileo proved this on paper but to convince the world he had to experiment from the leaning tower of pisa at an early age he discovered the principle of isochronism of the pendulum which in the hands of huyghens in the middle of the seventeenth century led to the invention of the pendulum clock perhaps the most valuable astronomical instrument ever produced these and other discoveries in dynamics may seem very obvious now but it is often the most everyday matters which have been found to elude the inquiries of ordinary minds and it required a high order of intellect to unravel the truth and discard the stupid maxims scattered through the works of aristotle and accepted on his authority a blind worship of scientific authorities has often delayed the progress of human knowledge just as too much instruction of a youth often ruins his education grant in his history of physical astronomy has well said that the sagacity and skill which galileo displays in resolving the phenomena of motion into their constituent elements and hence deriving the original principles involved in them will ever assure to him a distinguished place among those who have extended the domains of science but it was work of a different kind that established galileos popular reputation in 1609 galileo heard that a dutch spectaclemaker had combined a pair of lenses so as to magnify distant objects working on this hint he solved the same problem first on paper and then in practice so he came to make one of the first telescopes ever used in astronomy no sooner had he turned it on the heavenly bodies than he was rewarded by such a shower of startling discoveries as forthwith made his name the best known in europe he found curious irregular black spots on the sun revolving round it in twentyseven days hills and valleys on the moon the planets showing discs of sensible size not points like the fixed stars venus showing phases according to her position in relation to the sun jupiter accompanied by four moons saturn with appendages that he could not explain but unlike the other planets the milky way composed of a multitude of separate stars his fame flew over europe like magic and his discoveries were much discussedand there were many who refused to believe cosmo de medici induced him to migrate to florence to carry on his observations he was received by paul v the pope at rome to whom he explained his discoveries he thought that these discoveries proved the truth of the copernican theory of the earths motion and he urged this view on friends and foes alike although in frequent correspondence with kepler he never alluded to the new astronomy and wrote to him extolling the virtue of epicycles he loved to argue never shirked an encounter with any number of disputants and laughed as he broke down their arguments through some strange course of events not easy to follow the copernican theory whose birth was welcomed by the church had now been taken up by certain anticlerical agitators and was opposed by the cardinals as well as by the dignitaries of the reformed church galileoa good catholicgot mixed up in these discussions although on excellent terms with the pope and his entourage at last it came about that galileo was summoned to appear at rome where he was charged with holding and teaching heretical opinions about the movement of the earth and he then solemnly abjured these opinions there has been much exaggeration and misstatement about his trial and punishment and for a long time there was a great deal of bitterness shown on both sides but the general verdict of the present day seems to be that although galileo himself was treated with consideration the hostility of the church to the views of copernicus placed it in opposition also to the true keplerian system and this led to unprofitable controversies from the time of galileo onwards for some time opponents of religion included the theory of the earths motion in their disputations not so much for the love or knowledge of astronomy as for the pleasure of putting the church in the wrong this created a great deal of bitterness and intolerance on both sides among the sufferers was giordano bruno a learned speculative philosopher who was condemned to be burnt at the stake galileo died on christmas day 1642the day of newtons birth the further consideration of the grand field of discovery opened out by galileo with his telescopes must be now postponed to avoid discontinuity in the history of the intellectual development of this period which lay in the direction of dynamical or physical astronomy until the time of kepler no one seems to have conceived the idea of universal physical forces controlling terrestrial phenomena and equally applicable to the heavenly bodies the grand discovery by kepler of the true relationship of the sun to the planets and the telescopic discoveries of galileo and of those who followed him spread a spirit of inquiry and philosophic thought throughout europe and once more did astronomy rise in estimation and the irresistible logic of its mathematical process of reasoning soon placed it in the position it has ever since occupied as the foremost of the exact sciences the practical application of this process of reasoning was enormously facilitated by the invention of logarithms by napier he was born at merchistoun near edinburgh in 1550 and died in 1617 by this system the tedious arithmetical operations necessary in astronomical calculations especially those dealing with the trigonometrical functions of angles were so much simplified that laplace declared that by this invention the lifework of an astronomer was doubled jeremiah horrocks born 1619 died 1641 was an ardent admirer of tycho brahe and kepler and was able to improve the rudolphine tables so much that he foretold a transit of venus in 1639 which these tables failed to indicate and was the only observer of it his life was short but he accomplished a great deal and rightly ascribed the lunar inequality called evection to variations in the value of the eccentricity and in the direction of the line of apses at the same time correctly assigning the disturbing force of the sun as the cause he discovered the errors in jupiters calculated place due to what we now know as the long inequality of jupiter and saturn and measured with considerable accuracy the acceleration at that date of jupiters mean motion and indicated the retardation of saturns mean motion horrocks investigations so far as they could be collected were published posthumously in 1672 and seldom if ever has a man who lived only twentytwo years originated so much scientific knowledge at this period british science received a lasting impetus by the wise initiation of a muchabused man charles ii who founded the royal society of london and also the royal observatory of greeenwich where he established flamsteed as first astronomer royal especially for lunar and stellar observations likely to be useful for navigation at the same time the french academy and the paris observatory were founded all this within fourteen years 16621675 meanwhile gravitation in general terms was being discussed by hooke wren halley and many others all of these men felt a repugnance to accept the idea of a force acting across the empty void of space descartes 15961650 proposed an ethereal medium whirling round the sun with the planets and having local whirls revolving with the satellites as delambre and grant have said this fiction only retarded the progress of pure science it had no sort of relation to the more modern but equally misleading nebular hypothesis while many were talking and guessing a giant mind was needed at this stage to make things clear 7 sir isaac newtonlaw of universal gravitation we now reach the period which is the culminating point of interest in the history of dynamical astronomy isaac newton was born in 1642 pemberton states that newton having quitted cambridge to avoid the plague was residing at wolsthorpe in lincolnshire where he had been born that he was sitting one day in the garden reflecting upon the force which prevents a planet from flying off at a tangent and which draws it to the sun and upon the force which draws the moon to the earth and that he saw in the case of the planets that the suns force must clearly be unequal at different distances for the pull out of the tangential line in a minute is less for jupiter than for mars he then saw that the pull of the earth on the moon would be less than for a nearer object it is said that while thus meditating he saw an apple fall from a tree to the ground and that this fact suggested the questions is the force that pulled that apple from the tree the same as the force which draws the moon to the earth does the attraction for both of them follow the same law as to distance as is given by the planetary motions round the sun it has been stated that in this way the first conception of universal gravitation arose1 quite the most important event in the whole history of physical astronomy was the publication in 1687 of newtons principia philosophiae naturalis principia mathematica in this great work newton started from the beginning of things the laws of motion and carried his argument step by step into every branch of physical astronomy giving the physical meaning of keplers three laws and explaining or indicating the explanation of all the known heavenly motions and their irregularities showing that all of these were included in his simple statement about the law of universal gravitation and proceeding to deduce from that law new irregularities in the motions of the moon which had never been noticed and to discover the oblate figure of the earth and the cause of the tides these investigations occupied the best part of his life but he wrote the whole of his great book in fifteen months having developed and enunciated the true laws of motion he was able to show that keplers second law that equal areas are described by the line from the planet to the sun in equal times was only another way of saying that the centripetal force on a planet is always directed to the sun also that keplers first law elliptic orbits with the sun in one focus was only another way of saying that the force urging a planet to the sun varies inversely as the square of the distance also if these two be granted it follows that keplers third law is only another way of saying that the suns force on different planets besides depending as above on distance is proportional to their masses having further proved the for that day wonderful proposition that with the law of inverse squares the attraction by the separate particles of a sphere of uniform density or one composed of concentric spherical shells each of uniform density acts as if the whole mass were collected at the centre he was able to express the meaning of keplers laws in propositions which have been summarised as follows the law of universal gravitationevery particle of matter in the universe attracts every other particle with a force varying inversely as the square of the distance between them and directly as the product of the masses of the two particles2 but newton did not commit himself to the law until he had answered that question about the apple and the above proposition now enabled him to deal with the moon and the apple gravity makes a stone fall 161 feet in a second the moon is 60 times farther from the earths centre than the stone so it ought to be drawn out of a straight course through 161 feet in a minute newton found the distance through which she is actually drawn as a fraction of the earths diameter but when he first examined this matter he proceeded to use a wrong diameter for the earth and he found a serious discrepancy this for a time seemed to condemn his theory and regretfully he laid that part of his work aside fortunately before newton wrote the principia the french astronomer picard made a new and correct measure of an arc of the meridian from which he obtained an accurate value of the earths diameter newton applied this value and found to his great joy that when the distance of the moon is 60 times the radius of the earth she is attracted out of the straight course 161 feet per minute and that the force acting on a stone or an apple follows the same law as the force acting upon the heavenly bodies3 the universality claimed for the lawif not by newton at least by his commentatorswas bold and warranted only by the large number of cases in which newton had found it to apply its universality has been under test ever since and so far it has stood the test there has often been a suspicion of a doubt when some inequality of motion in the heavenly bodies has for a time foiled the astronomers in their attempts to explain it but improved mathematical methods have always succeeded in the end and so the seeming doubt has been converted into a surer conviction of the universality of the law having once established the law newton proceeded to trace some of its consequences he saw that the figure of the earth depends partly on the mutual gravitation of its parts and partly on the centrifugal tendency due to the earths rotation and that these should cause a flattening of the poles he invented a mathematical method which he used for computing the ratio of the polar to the equatorial diameter he then noticed that the consequent bulging of matter at the equator would be attracted by the moon unequally the nearest parts being most attracted and so the moon would tend to tilt the earth when in some parts of her orbit and the sun would do this to a less extent because of its great distance then he proved that the effect ought to be a rotation of the earths axis over a conical surface in space exactly as the axis of a top describes a cone if the top has a sharp point and is set spinning and displaced from the vertical he actually calculated the amount and so he explained the cause of the precession of the equinoxes discovered by hipparchus about 150 bc one of his grandest discoveries was a method of weighing the heavenly bodies by their action on each other by means of this principle he was able to compare the mass of the sun with the masses of those planets that have moons and also to compare the mass of our moon with the mass of the earth thus newton after having established his great principle devoted his splendid intellect to the calculation of its consequences he proved that if a body be projected with any velocity in free space subject only to a central force varying inversely as the square of the distance the body must revolve in a curve which may be any one of the sections of a conea circle ellipse parabola or hyperbola and he found that those comets of which he had observations move in parabolae round the sun and are thus subject to the universal law newton realised that while planets and satellites are chiefly controlled by the central body about which they revolve the new law must involve irregularities due to their mutual actionsuch in fact as horrocks had indicated he determined to put this to a test in the case of the moon and to calculate the suns effect from its mass compared with that of the earth and from its distance he proved that the average effect upon the plane of the orbit would be to cause the line in which it cuts the plane of the ecliptic ie the line of nodes to revolve in the ecliptic once in about nineteen years this had been a known fact from the earliest ages he also concluded that the line of apses would revolve in the plane of the lunar orbit also in about nineteen years but the observed period is only ten years for a long time this was the one weak point in the newtonian theory it was not till 1747 that clairaut reconciled this with the theory and showed why newtons calculation was not exact newton proceeded to explain the other inequalities recognised by tycho brahe and older observers and to calculate their maximum amounts as indicated by his theory he further discovered from his calculations two new inequalities one of the apogee the other of the nodes and assigned the maximum value grant has shown the values of some of these as given by observation in the tables of meyer and more modern tables and has compared them with the values assigned by newton from his theory and the comparison is very remarkable newton modern tables mean monthly motion of apses 13128 340 mean annual motion of nodes 1918123 19212250 mean value of variation 3610 3547 annual equation 1151 1114 inequality of mean motion of apogee 1943 2217 inequality of mean motion of nodes 924 90 the only serious discrepancy is the first which has been already mentioned considering that some of these perturbations had never been discovered that the cause of none of them had ever been known and that he exhibited his results if he did not also make the discoveries by the synthetic methods of geometry it is simply marvellous that he reached to such a degree of accuracy he invented the infinitesimal calculus which is more suited for such calculations but had he expressed his results in that language he would have been unintelligible to many newtons method of calculating the precession of the equinoxes already referred to is as beautiful as anything in the principia he had already proved the regression of the nodes of a satellite moving in an orbit inclined to the ecliptic he now said that the nodes of a ring of satellites revolving round the earths equator would consequently all regress and if joined into a solid ring its node would regress and it would do so only more slowly if encumbered by the spherical part of the earths mass therefore the axis of the equatorial belt of the earth must revolve round the pole of the ecliptic then he set to work and found the amount due to the moon and that due to the sun and so he solved the mystery of 2000 years when newton applied his law of gravitation to an explanation of the tides he started a new field for the application of mathematics to physical problems and there can be little doubt that if he could have been furnished with complete tidal observations from different parts of the world his extraordinary powers of analysis would have enabled him to reach a satisfactory theory he certainly opened up many mines full of intellectual gems and his successors have never ceased in their explorations this has led to improved mathematical methods which combined with the greater accuracy of observation have rendered physical astronomy of today the most exact of the sciences laplace only expressed the universal opinion of posterity when he said that to the principia is assured a preeminence above all the other productions of the human intellect the name of flamsteed first astronomer royal must here be mentioned as having supplied newton with the accurate data required for completing the theory the name of edmund halley second astronomer royal must ever be held in repute not only for his own discoveries but for the part he played in urging newton to commit to writing and present to the royal society the results of his investigations but for his friendly insistence it is possible that the principia would never have been written and but for his generosity in supplying the means the royal society could not have published the book illustration death mask of sir isaac newton photographed specially for this work from the original by kind permission of the royal society london sir isaac newton died in 1727 at the age of eightyfive his body lay in state in the jerusalem chamber and was buried in westminster abbey footnotes 1 the writer inherited from his father professor j d forbes a small box containing a bit of wood and a slip of paper which had been presented to him by sir david brewster on the paper sir david had written these words if there be any truth in the story that newton was led to the theory of gravitation by the fall of an apple this bit of wood is probably a piece of the apple tree from which newton saw the apple fall when i was on a pilgrimage to the house in which newton was born i cut it off an ancient apple tree growing in his garden when lecturing in glasgow about 1875 the writer showed it to his audience the next morning when removing his property from the lecture table he found that his precious relic had been stolen it would be interesting to know who has got it now 2 it must be noted that these words in which the laws of gravitation are always summarised in histories and textbooks do not appear in the principia but though they must have been composed by some early commentator it does not appear that their origin has been traced nor does it appear that newton ever extended the law beyond the solar system and probably his caution would have led him to avoid any statement of the kind until it should be proved with this exception the above statement of the law of universal gravitation contains nothing that is not to be found in the principia and the nearest approach to that statement occurs in the seventh proposition of book iii prop that gravitation occurs in all bodies and that it is proportional to the quantity of matter in each cor i the total attraction of gravitation on a planet arises and is composed out of the attraction on the separate parts cor ii the attraction on separate equal particles of a body is reciprocally as the square of the distance from the particles 3 it is said that when working out this final result the probability of its confirming that part of his theory which he had reluctantly abandoned years before excited him so keenly that he was forced to hand over his calculations to a friend to be completed by him 8 newtons successorshalley euler lagrange laplace etc edmund halley succeeded flamsteed as second astronomer royal in 1721 although he did not contribute directly to the mathematical proofs of newtons theory yet his name is closely associated with some of its greatest successes he was the first to detect the acceleration of the moons mean motion hipparchus having compared his own observations with those of more ancient astronomers supplied an accurate value of the moons mean motion in his time halley similarly deduced a value for modern times and found it sensibly greater he announced this in 1693 but it was not until 1749 that dunthorne used modern lunar tables to compute a lunar eclipse observed in babylon 721 bc another at alexandria 201 bc a solar eclipse observed by theon 360 ad and two later ones up to the tenth century he found that to explain these eclipses halleys suggestion must be adopted the acceleration being 10 in one century in 1757 lalande again fixed it at 10 the paris academy in 1770 offered their prize for an investigation to see if this could be explained by the theory of gravitation euler won the prize but failed to explain the effect and said it appears to be established by indisputable evidence that the secular inequality of the moons mean motion cannot be produced by the forces of gravitation the same subject was again proposed for a prize which was shared by lagrange 1 and euler neither finding a solution while the latter asserted the existence of a resisting medium in space again in 1774 the academy submitted the same subject a third time for the prize and again lagrange failed to detect a cause in gravitation laplace 2 now took the matter in hand he tried the effect of a noninstantaneous action of gravity to no purpose but in 1787 he gave the true explanation the principal effect of the sun on the moons orbit is to diminish the earths influence thus lengthening the period to a new value generally taken as constant but laplaces calculations showed the new value to depend upon the excentricity of the earths orbit which according to theory has a periodical variation of enormous period and has been continually diminishing for thousands of years thus the solar influence has been diminishing and the moons mean motion increased laplace computed the amount at 10 in one century agreeing with observation later on adams showed that laplaces calculation was wrong and that the value he found was too large so part of the acceleration is now attributed by some astronomers to a lengthening of the day by tidal friction another contribution by halley to the verification of newtons law was made when he went to st helena to catalogue the southern stars he measured the change in length of the seconds pendulum in different latitudes due to the changes in gravity foretold by newton furthermore he discovered the long inequality of jupiter and saturn whose period is 929 years for an investigation of this also the academy of sciences offered their prize this led euler to write a valuable essay disclosing a new method of computing perturbations called the instantaneous ellipse with variable elements the method was much developed by lagrange but again it was laplace who solved the problem of the inequalities of jupiter and saturn by the theory of gravitation reducing the errors of the tables from 20 down to 12 thus abolishing the use of empirical corrections to the planetary tables and providing another glorious triumph for the law of gravitation as laplace justly said these inequalities appeared formerly to be inexplicable by the law of gravitationthey now form one of its most striking proofs let us take one more discovery of halley furnishing directly a new triumph for the theory he noticed that newton ascribed parabolic orbits to the comets which he studied so that they come from infinity sweep round the sun and go off to infinity for ever after having been visible a few weeks or months he collected all the reliable observations of comets he could find to the number of twentyfour and computed their parabolic orbits by the rules laid down by newton his object was to find out if any of them really travelled in elongated ellipses practically undistinguishable in the visible part of their paths from parabol in which case they would be seen more than once he found two old comets whose orbits in shape and position resembled the orbit of a comet observed by himself in 1682 apian observed one in 1531 kepler the other in 1607 the intervals between these appearances is seventyfive or seventysix years he then examined and found old records of similar appearance in 1456 1380 and 1305 it is true he noticed that the intervals varied by a year and ahalf and the inclination of the orbit to the ecliptic diminished with successive apparitions but he knew from previous calculations that this might easily be due to planetary perturbations finally he arrived at the conclusion that all of these comets were identical travelling in an ellipse so elongated that the part where the comet was seen seemed to be part of a parabolic orbit he then predicted its return at the end of 1758 or beginning of 1759 when he should be dead but as he said if it should return according to our prediction about the year 1758 impartial posterity will not refuse to acknowledge that this was first discovered by an englishman3 synopsis astronomiae cometicae 1749 once again halleys suggestion became an inspiration for the mathematical astronomer clairaut assisted by lalande found that saturn would retard the comet 100 days jupiter 518 days and predicted its return to perihelion on april 13th 1759 in his communication to the french academy he said that a comet travelling into such distant regions might be exposed to the influence of forces totally unknown and even of some planet too far removed from the sun to be ever perceived the excitement of astronomers towards the end of 1758 became intense and the honour of first catching sight of the traveller fell to an amateur in saxony george palitsch on christmas day 1758 it reached perihelion on march 13th 1759 this fact was a startling confirmation of the newtonian theory because it was a new kind of calculation of perturbations and also it added a new member to the solar system and gave a prospect of adding many more when halleys comet reappeared in 1835 pontecoulants computations for the date of perihelion passage were very exact and afterwards he showed that with more exact values of the masses of jupiter and saturn his prediction was correct within two days after an invisible voyage of seventyfive years hind afterwards searched out many old appearances of this comet going back to 11 bc and most of these have been identified as being really halleys comet by the calculations of cowell and cromellin4 of greenwich observatory who have also predicted its next perihelion passage for april 8th to 16th 1910 and have traced back its history still farther to 240 bc already in november 1907 the astronomer royal was trying to catch it by the aid of photography footnotes 1 born 1736 died 1813 2 born 1749 died 1827 3 this sentence does not appear in the original memoir communicated to the royal society but was first published in a posthumous reprint 4 r a s monthly notices 19078 9 discovery of new planetsherschel piazzi adams and le verrier it would be very interesting but quite impossible in these pages to discuss all the exquisite researches of the mathematical astronomers and to inspire a reverence for the names connected with these researches which for two hundred years have been establishing the universality of newtons law the lunar and planetary theories the beautiful theory of jupiters satellites the figure of the earth and the tides were mathematically treated by maclaurin dalembert legendre clairaut euler lagrange laplace walmsley bailly lalande delambre mayer hansen burchardt binet damoiseau plana poisson gauss bessel bouvard airy ivory delaunay le verrier adams and others of later date by passing over these important developments it is possible to trace some of the steps in the crowning triumph of the newtonian theory by which the planet neptune was added to the known members of the solar system by the independent researches of professor jc adams and of m le verrier in 1846 it will be best to introduce this subject by relating how the eighteenth century increased the number of known planets which was then only six including the earth on march 13th 1781 sir william herschel was as usual engaged on examining some small stars and noticing that one of them appeared to be larger than the fixed stars suspected that it might be a comet to test this he increased his magnifying power from 227 to 460 and 932 finding that unlike the fixed stars near it its definition was impaired and its size increased this convinced him that the object was a comet and he was not surprised to find on succeeding nights that the position was changed the motion being in the ecliptic he gave the observations of five weeks to the royal society without a suspicion that the object was a new planet for a long time people could not compute a satisfactory orbit for the supposed comet because it seemed to be near the perihelion and no comet had ever been observed with a perihelion distance from the sun greater than four times the earths distance lexell was the first to suspect that this was a new planet eighteen times as far from the sun as the earth is in january 1783 laplace published the elliptic elements the discoverer of a planet has a right to name it so herschel called it georgium sidus after the king but lalande urged the adoption of the name herschel bode suggested uranus and this was adopted the new planet was found to rank in size next to jupiter and saturn being 43 times the diameter of the earth in 1787 herschel discovered two satellites both revolving in nearly the same plane inclined 80 to the ecliptic and the motion of both was retrograde in 1772 before herschels discovery bode1 had discovered a curious arbitrary law of planetary distances opposite each planets name write the figure 4 and in succession add the numbers 0 3 6 12 24 48 96 etc to the 4 always doubling the last numbers you then get the planetary distances mercury dist 4 4 0 4 venus 7 4 3 7 earth 10 4 6 10 mars 15 4 12 16 4 24 28 jupiter dist 52 4 48 52 saturn 95 4 96 100 uranus 192 4 192 196 4 384 388 all the five planets and the earth fitted this rule except that there was a blank between mars and jupiter when uranus was discovered also fitting the rule the conclusion was irresistible that there is probably a planet between mars and jupiter an association of twentyfour astronomers was now formed in germany to search for the planet almost immediately afterwards the planet was discovered not by any member of the association but by piazzi when engaged upon his great catalogue of stars on january 1st 1801 he observed a star which had changed its place the next night its motion was retrograde till january 11th direct after the 13th piazzi fell ill before he had enough observations for computing the orbit with certainty and the planet disappeared in the suns rays gauss published an approximate ephemeris of probable positions when the planet should emerge from the suns light there was an exciting hunt and on december 31st the day before its birthday de zach captured the truant and piazzi christened it ceres the mean distance from the sun was found to be 2767 agreeing with the 28 given by bodes law its orbit was found to be inclined over 10 to the ecliptic and its diameter was only 161 miles on march 28th 1802 olbers discovered a new seventh magnitude star which turned out to be a planet resembling ceres it was called pallas gauss found its orbit to be inclined 35 to the ecliptic and to cut the orbit of ceres whence olbers considered that these might be fragments of a brokenup planet he then commenced a search for other fragments in 1804 harding discovered juno and in 1807 olbers found vesta the next one was not discovered until 1845 from which date asteroids or minor planets as these small planets are called have been found almost every year they now number about 700 it is impossible to give any idea of the interest with which the first additions since prehistoric times to the planetary system were received all of those who showered congratulations upon the discoverers regarded these discoveries in the light of rewards for patient and continuous labours the very highest rewards that could be desired and yet there remained still the most brilliant triumph of all the addition of another planet like uranus before it had ever been seen when the analysis of adams and le verrier gave a final proof of the powers of newtons great law to explain any planetary irregularity after sir william herschel discovered uranus in 1781 it was found that astronomers had observed it on many previous occasions mistaking it for a fixed star of the sixth or seventh magnitude altogether nineteen observations of uranuss position from the time of flamsteed in 1690 had been recorded in 1790 delambre using all these observations prepared tables for computing its position these worked well enough for a time but at last the differences between the calculated and observed longitudes of the planet became serious in 1821 bouvard undertook a revision of the tables but found it impossible to reconcile all the observations of 130 years the period of revolution of uranus is eightyfour years so he deliberately rejected the old ones expressing the opinion that the discrepancies might depend upon some foreign and unperceived cause which may have been acting upon the planet in a few years the errors even of these tables became intolerable in 1835 the error of longitude was 30 in 1838 50 in 1841 70 and by comparing the errors derived from observations made before and after opposition a serious error of the distance radius vector became apparent in 1843 john couch adams came out senior wrangler at cambridge and was free to undertake the research which as an undergraduate he had set himselfto see whether the disturbances of uranus could be explained by assuming a certain orbit and position in that orbit of a hypothetical planet even more distant than uranus such an explanation had been suggested but until 1843 no one had the boldness to attack the problem bessel had intended to try but a fatal illness overtook him adams first recalculated all known causes of disturbance using the latest determinations of the planetary masses still the errors were nearly as great as ever he could now however use these errors as being actually due to the perturbations produced by the unknown planet in 1844 assuming a circular orbit and a mean distance agreeing with bodes law he obtained a first approximation to the position of the supposed planet he then asked professor challis of cambridge to procure the latest observations of uranus from greenwich which airy immediately supplied then the whole work was recalculated from the beginning with more exactness and assuming a smaller mean distance in september 1845 he handed to challis the elements of the hypothetical planet its mass and its apparent position for september 30th 1845 on september 22nd challis wrote to airy explaining the matter and declaring his belief in adamss capabilities when adams called on him airy was away from home but at the end of october 1845 he called again and left a paper with full particulars of his results which had for the most part reduced the discrepancies to about 1 as a matter of fact it has since been found that the heliocentric place of the new planet then given was correct within about 2 airy wrote expressing his interest and asked for particulars about the radius vector adams did not then reply as the answer to this question could be seen to be satisfactory by looking at the data already supplied he was a most unassuming man and would not push himself forward he may have felt after all the work he had done that airys very natural inquiry showed no proportionate desire to search for the planet anyway the matter lay in embryo for nine months meanwhile one of the ablest french astronomers le verrier experienced in computing perturbations was independently at work knowing nothing about adams he applied to his calculations every possible refinement and considering the novelty of the problem his calculation was one of the most brilliant in the records of astronomy in criticism it has been said that these were exhibitions of skill rather than helps to a solution of the particular problem and that in claiming to find the elements of the orbit within certain limits he was claiming what was under the circumstances impossible as the result proved in june 1846 le verrier announced in the comptes rendus de lacademie des sciences that the longitude of the disturbing planet for january 1st 1847 was 325 and that the probable error did not exceed 10 this result agreed so well with adamss within 1 that airy urged challis to apply the splendid northumberland equatoreal at cambridge to the search challis however had already prepared an exhaustive plan of attack which must in time settle the point his first work was to observe and make a catalogue or chart of all stars near adamss position on august 31st 1846 le verrier published the concluding part of his labours on september 18th 1846 le verrier communicated his results to the astronomers at berlin and asked them to assist in searching for the planet by good luck dr bremiker had just completed a starchart of the very part of the heavens including le verriers position thus eliminating all of challiss preliminary work the letter was received in berlin on september 23rd and the same evening galle found the new planet of the eighth magnitude the size of its disc agreeing with le verriers prediction and the heliocentric longitude agreeing within 57 by this time challis had recorded without reduction the observations of 3150 stars as a commencement for his search on reducing these he found a star observed on august 12th which was not in the same place on july 30th this was the planet and he had also observed it on august 4th the feeling of wonder admiration and enthusiasm aroused by this intellectual triumph was overwhelming in the world of astronomy reminders are met every day of the terrible limitations of human reasoning powers and every success that enables the minds eye to see a little more clearly the meaning of things has always been heartily welcomed by those who have themselves been engaged in like researches but since the publication of the principia in 1687 there is probably no analytical success which has raised among astronomers such a feeling of admiration and gratitude as when adams and le verrier showed the inequalities in uranuss motion to mean that an unknown planet was in a certain place in the heavens where it was found at the time there was an unpleasant display of international jealousy the british people thought that the earlier date of adamss work and of the observation by challis entitled him to at least an equal share of credit with le verrier the french on the other hand who on the announcement of the discovery by galle glowed with pride in the new proof of the great powers of their astronomer le verrier whose life had a long record of successes in calculation were incredulous on being told that it had all been already done by a young man whom they had never heard of these displays of jealousy have long since passed away and there is now universally an entente cordiale that to each of these great men belongs equally the merit of having so thoroughly calculated this inverse problem of perturbations as to lead to the immediate discovery of the unknown planet since called neptune it was soon found that the planet had been observed and its position recorded as a fixed star by lalande on may 8th and 10th 1795 mr lassel in the same year 1846 with his twofeet reflector discovered a satellite with retrograde motion which gave the mass of the planet about a twentieth of that of jupiter footnotes 1 bodes law or something like it had already been foreshadowed by kepler and others especially titius see monatliche correspondenz vol vii p 72 book iii observation 10 instruments of precisionstate of the solar system having now traced the progress of physical astronomy up to the time when very striking proofs of the universality of the law of gravitation convinced the most sceptical it must still be borne in mind that while gravitation is certainly the principal force governing the motions of the heavenly bodies there may yet be a resisting medium in space and there may be electric and magnetic forces to deal with there may further be cases where the effects of luminous radiative repulsion become apparent and also crookes vacuumeffects described as radiant matter nor is it quite certain that laplaces proofs of the instantaneous propagation of gravity are final and in the future as in the past tycho brahes dictum must be maintained that all theory shall be preceded by accurate observations it is the pride of astronomers that their science stands above all others in the accuracy of the facts observed as well as in the rigid logic of the mathematics used for interpreting these facts it is interesting to trace historically the invention of those instruments of precision which have led to this result and without entering on the details required in a practical handbook to note the guiding principles of construction in different ages it is very probable that the chaldeans may have made spheres like the armillary sphere for representing the poles of the heavens and with rings to show the ecliptic and zodiac as well as the equinoctial and solstitial colures but we have no record we only know that the tower of belus on an eminence was their observatory we have however distinct records of two such spheres used by the chinese about 2500 bc gnomons or some kind of sundial were used by the egyptians and others and many of the ancient nations measured the obliquity of the ecliptic by the shadows of a vertical column in summer and winter the natural horizon was the only instrument of precision used by those who determined star positions by the directions of their risings and settings while in those days the clepsydra or waterclock was the best instrument for comparing their times of rising and setting about 300 bc an observatory fitted with circular instruments for star positions was set up at alexandria the then centre of civilisation we know almost nothing about the instruments used by hipparchus in preparing his star catalogues and his lunar and solar tables but the invention of the astrolabe is attributed to him1 in more modern times nuremberg became a centre of astronomical culture waltherus of that town made really accurate observations of star altitudes and of the distances between stars and in 1484 ad he used a kind of clock tycho brahe tried these but discarded them as being inaccurate tycho brahe 15461601 ad made great improvements in armillary spheres quadrants sextants and large celestial globes with these he measured the positions of stars or the distance of a comet from several known stars he has left us full descriptions of them illustrated by excellent engravings previous to his time such instruments were made of wood tycho always used metal he paid the greatest attention to the stability of mounting to the orientation of his instruments to the graduation of the arcs by the then new method of transversals and to the aperture sight used upon his pointer there were no telescopes in his day and no pendulum clocks he recognised the fact that there must be instrumental errors he made these as small as was possible measured their amount and corrected his observations his table of refractions enabled him to abolish the error due to our atmosphere so far as it could affect nakedeye observations the azimuth circle of tychos largest quadrant had a diameter of nine feet and the quadrant a radius of six feet he introduced the mural quadrant for meridian observations2 illustration ancient chinese instruments including quadrant celestial globe and two armillae in the observatory at peking photographed in peking by the author in 1875 and stolen by the germans when the embassies were relieved by the allies in 1900 the french jesuits at peking in the seventeenth century helped the chinese in their astronomy in 1875 the writer saw and photographed on that part of the wall of peking used by the mandarins as an observatory the six instruments handsomely designed by father verbiest copied from the instruments of tycho brahe and embellished with chinese dragons and emblems cast on the supports he also saw there two old instruments which he was told were arabic of date 1279 by ko showking astronomer to koblai khan the grandson of chenghis khan one of these last is nearly identical with the armillae of tycho and the other with his armillae quatori maxim with which he observed the comet of 1585 besides fixed stars and planets3 the discovery by galileo of the isochronism of the pendulum followed by huyghenss adaptation of that principle to clocks has been one of the greatest aids to accurate observation about the same time an equally beneficial step was the employment of the telescope as a pointer not the galilean with concave eyepiece but with a magnifying glass to examine the focal image at which also a fixed mark could be placed kepler was the first to suggest this gascoigne was the first to use it huyghens used a metal strip of variable width in the focus as a micrometer to cover a planetary disc and so to measure the width covered by the planet the marquis malvasia in 1662 described the network of fine silver threads at right angles which he used in the focus much as we do now in the hands of such a skilful man as tycho brahe the old open sights even without clocks served their purpose sufficiently well to enable kepler to discover the true theory of the solar system but telescopic sights and clocks were required for proving some of newtons theories of planetary perturbations picards observations at paris from 1667 onwards seem to embody the first use of the telescope as a pointer he was also the first to introduce the use of huyghenss clocks for observing the right ascension of stars olaus romer was born at copenhagen in 1644 in 1675 by careful study of the times of eclipses of jupiters satellites he discovered that light took time to traverse space its velocity is 186000 miles per second in 1681 he took up his duties as astronomer at copenhagen and built the first transit circle on a windowsill of his house the iron axis was five feet long and one and ahalf inches thick and the telescope was fixed near one end with a counterpoise the telescopetube was a double cone to prevent flexure three horizontal and three vertical wires were used in the focus these were illuminated by a speculum near the objectglass reflecting the light from a lantern placed over the axis the upper part of the telescopetube being partly cut away to admit the light a divided circle with pointer and reading microscope was provided for reading the declination he realised the superiority of a circle with graduations over a much larger quadrant the collimation error was found by reversing the instrument and using a terrestrial mark the azimuth error by star observations the time was expressed in fractions of a second he also constructed a telescope with equatoreal mounting to follow a star by one axial motion in 1728 his instruments and observation records were destroyed by fire hevelius had introduced the vernier and tangent screw in his measurement of arc graduations his observatory and records were burnt to the ground in 1679 though an old man he started afresh and left behind him a catalogue of 1500 stars flamsteed began his duties at greenwich observatory as first astronomer royal in 1676 with very poor instruments in 1683 he put up a mural arc of 140 and in 1689 a better one seventynine inches radius he conducted his measurements with great skill and introduced new methods to attain accuracy using certain stars for determining the errors of his instruments and he always reduced his observations to a form in which they could be readily used he introduced new methods for determining the position of the equinox and the right ascension of a fundamental star he produced a catalogue of 2935 stars he supplied sir isaac newton with results of observation required in his theoretical calculations he died in 1719 halley succeeded flamsteed to find that the whole place had been gutted by the latters executors in 1721 he got a transit instrument and in 1726 a mural quadrant by graham his successor in 1742 bradley replaced this by a fine brass quadrant eight feet radius by bird and bradleys zenith sector was purchased for the observatory an instrument like this specially designed for zenith stars is capable of greater rigidity than a more universal instrument and there is no trouble with refraction in the zenith for these reasons bradley had set up this instrument at kew to attempt the proof of the earths motion by observing the annual parallax of stars he certainly found an annual variation of zenith distance but not at the times of year required by the parallax this led him to the discovery of the aberration of light and of nutation bradley has been described as the founder of the modern system of accurate observation he died in 1762 leaving behind him thirteen folio volumes of valuable but unreduced observations those relating to the stars were reduced by bessel and published in 1818 at knigsberg in his wellknown standard work fundamenta astronomiae in it are results showing the laws of refraction with tables of its amount the maximum value of aberration and other constants bradley was succeeded by bliss and he by maskelyne 1765 who carried on excellent work and laid the foundations of the nautical almanac 1767 just before his death he induced the government to replace birds quadrant by a fine new mural circle six feet in diameter by troughton the divisions being read off by microscopes fixed on piers opposite to the divided circle in this instrument the micrometer screw with a divided circle for turning it was applied for bringing the micrometer wire actually in line with a division on the circlea plan which is still always adopted pond succeeded maskelyne in 1811 and was the first to use this instrument from now onwards the places of stars were referred to the pole not to the zenith the zero being obtained from measures on circumpolar stars standard stars were used for giving the clock error in 1816 a new transit instrument by troughton was added and from this date the greenwich star places have maintained the very highest accuracy george biddell airy seventh astronomer royal4 commenced his greenwich labours in 1835 his first and greatest reformation in the work of the observatory was one he had already established at cambridge and is now universally adopted he held that an observation is not completed until it has been reduced to a useful form and in the case of the sun moon and planets these results were in every case compared with the tables and the tabular error printed airy was firmly impressed with the object for which charles ii had wisely founded the observatory in connection with navigation and for observations of the moon whenever a meridian transit of the moon could be observed this was done but even so there are periods in the month when the moon is too near the sun for a transit to be well observed also weather interferes with many meridian observations to render the lunar observations more continuous airy employed troughtons successor james simms in conjunction with the engineers ransome and may to construct an altazimuth with threefoot circles and a fivefoot telescope in 1847 the result was that the number of lunar observations was immediately increased threefold many of them being in a part of the moons orbit which had previously been bare of observations from that date the greenwich lunar observations have been a model and a standard for the whole world airy also undertook to superintend the reduction of all greenwich lunar observations from 1750 to 1830 the value of this laborious work which was completed in 1848 cannot be overestimated the demands of astronomy especially in regard to small minor planets required a transit instrument and mural circle with a more powerful telescope airy combined the functions of both and employed the same constructors as before to make a transitcircle with a telescope of eleven and ahalf feet focus and a circle of sixfeet diameter the objectglass being eight inches in diameter airy like bradley was impressed with the advantage of employing stars in the zenith for determining the fundamental constants of astronomy he devised a reflex zenith tube in which the zenith point was determined by reflection from a surface of mercury the design was so simple and seemed so perfect that great expectations were entertained but unaccountable variations comparable with those of the transit circle appeared and the instrument was put out of use until 1903 when the present astronomer royal noticed that the irregularities could be allowed for being due to that remarkable variation in the position of the earths axis included in circles of about six yards diameter at the north and south poles discovered at the end of the nineteenth century the instrument is now being used for investigating these variations and in the year 1907 as many as 1545 observations of stars were made with the reflex zenith tube in connection with zenith telescopes it must be stated that respighi at the capitol observatory at rome made use of a deep well with a level mercury surface at the bottom and a telescope at the top pointing downwards which the writer saw in 1871 the reflection of the micrometer wires and of a star very near the zenith but not quite in the zenith can be observed together his mercury trough was a circular plane surface with a shallow edge to retain the mercury the surface quickly came to rest after disturbance by street traffic sir w m h christie eighth astronomer royal took up his duties in that capacity in 1881 besides a larger altazimuth that he erected in 1898 he has widened the field of operations at greenwich by the extensive use of photography and the establishment of large equatoreals from the point of view of instruments of precision one of the most important new features is the astrographic equatoreal set up in 1892 and used for the greenwich section of the great astrographic chart just completed photography has come to be of use not only for depicting the sun and moon comets and nebulae but also to obtain accurate relative positions of neighbouring stars to pick up objects that are invisible in any telescope and most of all perhaps in fixing the positions of faint satellites thus saturns distant satellite phoebe and the sixth and seventh satellites of jupiter have been followed regularly in their courses at greenwich ever since their discovery with the thirtyinch reflector erected in 1897 and while doing so mr melotte made in 1908 the splendid discovery on some of the photographic plates of an eighth satellite of jupiter at an enormous distance from the planet from observations in the early part of 1908 over a limited arc of its orbit before jupiter approached the sun mr cowell computed a retrograde orbit and calculated the future positions of this satellite which enabled mr melotte to find it again in the autumna great triumph both of calculation and of photographic observation this satellite has never been seen and has been photographed only at greenwich heidelberg and the lick observatory greenwich observatory has been here selected for tracing the progress of accurate measurement but there is one instrument of great value the heliometer which is not used at greenwich this serves the purpose of a double image micrometer and is made by dividing the objectglass of a telescope along a diameter each half is mounted so as to slide a distance of several inches each way on an arc whose centre is the focus the amount of the movement can be accurately read thus two fields of view overlap and the adjustment is made to bring an image of one star over that of another star and then to do the same by a displacement in the opposite direction the total movement of the halfobject glass is double the distance between the star images in the focal plane such an instrument has long been established at oxford and german astronomers have made great use of it but in the hands of sir david gill late his majestys astronomer at the cape of good hope and especially in his great researches on solar and on stellar parallax it has been recognised as an instrument of the very highest accuracy measuring the distance between stars correctly to less than a tenth of a second of arc the superiority of the heliometer over all other devices except photography for measuring small angles has been specially brought into prominence by sir david gills researches on the distance of the sunie the scale of the solar system a measurement of the distance of any planet fixes the scale and as venus approaches the earth most nearly of all the planets it used to be supposed that a transit of venus offered the best opportunity for such measurement especially as it was thought that as venus entered on the solar disc the sweep of light round the dark disc of venus would enable a very precise observation to be made the transit of venus in 1874 in which the present writer assisted overthrew this delusion in 1877 sir david gill used lord crawfords heliometer at the island of ascension to measure the parallax of mars in opposition and found the suns distance 93080000 miles he considered that while the superiority of the heliometer had been proved the results would be still better with the points of light shown by minor planets rather than with the disc of mars in 18889 at the cape he observed the minor planets iris victoria and sappho and secured the cooperation of four other heliometers his final result was 92870000 miles the parallax being 8802 cape obs vol vi so delicate were these measures that gill detected a minute periodic error of theory of twentyseven days owing to a periodically erroneous position of the centre of gravity of the earth and moon to which the position of the observer was referred this led him to correct the mass of the moon and to fix its ratio to the earths mass 0012240 another method of getting the distance from the sun is to measure the velocity of the earths orbital motion giving the circumference traversed in a year and so the radius of the orbit this has been done by comparing observation and experiment the aberration of light is an angle 20 48 giving the ratio of the earths velocity to the velocity of light the velocity of light is 186000 miles a second whence the distance to the sun is 92780000 miles there seems however to be some uncertainty about the true value of the aberration any determination of which is subject to irregularities due to the seasonal errors the velocity of light was experimentally found in 1862 by fizeau and foucault each using an independent method these methods have been developed and new values found by cornu michaelson newcomb and the present writer quite lately halm at the cape of good hope measured spectroscopically the velocity of the earth to and from a star by observations taken six months apart thence he obtained an accurate value of the suns distance5 but the remarkably erratic minor planet eros discovered by witte in 1898 approaches the earth within 15000000 miles at rare intervals and with the aid of photography will certainly give us the best result a large number of observatories combined to observe the opposition of 1900 their results are not yet completely reduced but the best value deduced so far for the parallax6 is 8807 000287 footnotes 1 in 1480 martin behaim of nuremberg produced his astrolabe for measuring the latitude by observation of the sun at sea it consisted of a graduated metal circle suspended by a ring which was passed over the thumb and hung vertically a pointer was fixed to a pin at the centre this arm called the alhidada worked round the graduated circle and was pointed to the sun the altitude of the sun was thus determined and by help of solar tables the latitude could be found from observations made at apparent noon 2 see illustration on p 76 3 see dreyers article on these instruments in copernicus vol i they were stolen by the germans after the relief of the embassies in 1900 the best description of these instruments is probably that contained in an interesting volume which may be seen in the library of the r a s entitled chinese researches by alexander wyllie shanghai 1897 4 sir george airy was very jealous of this honourable title he rightly held that there is only one astronomer royal at a time as there is only one mikado one dalai lama he said that his majestys astronomer at the cape of good hope his majestys astronomer for scotland and his majestys astronomer for ireland are not called astronomers royal 5 annals of the cape observatory vol x part 3 6 the parallax of the sun is the angle subtended by the earths radius at the suns distance 7 a r hinks ras monthly notices june 1909 11 history of the telescope accounts of wonderful optical experiments by roger bacon who died in 1292 and in the sixteenth century by digges baptista porta and antonio de dominis grant hist ph ast have led some to suppose that they invented the telescope the writer considers that it is more likely that these notes refer to a kind of camera obscura in which a lens throws an inverted image of a landscape on the wall the first telescopes were made in holland the originator being either henry lipperhey1 zacharias jansen or james metius and the date 1608 or earlier in 1609 galileo being in venice heard of the invention went home and worked out the theory and made a similar telescope these telescopes were all made with a convex objectglass and a concave eyelens and this type is spoken of as the galilean telescope its defects are that it has no real focus where crosswires can be placed and that the field of view is very small kepler suggested the convex eyelens in 1611 and scheiner claimed to have used one in 1617 but it was huyghens who really introduced them in the seventeenth century telescopes were made of great length going up to 300 feet huyghens also invented the compound eyepiece that bears his name made of two convex lenses to diminish spherical aberration but the defects of colour remained although their cause was unknown until newton carried out his experiments on dispersion and the solar spectrum to overcome the spherical aberration james gregory2 of aberdeen and edinburgh in 1663 in his optica promota proposed a reflecting speculum of parabolic form but it was newton about 1666 who first made a reflecting telescope and he did it with the object of avoiding colour dispersion some time elapsed before reflectors were much used pound and bradley used one presented to the royal society by hadley in 1723 hawksbee bradley and molyneaux made some but james short of edinburgh made many excellent gregorian reflectors from 1732 till his death in 1768 newtons trouble with refractors chromatic aberration remained insurmountable until john dollond born 1706 died 1761 after many experiments found out how to make an achromatic lens out of two lensesone of crown glass the other of flint glassto destroy the colour in a way originally suggested by euler he soon acquired a great reputation for his telescopes of moderate size but there was a difficulty in making flintglass lenses of large size the first actual inventor and constructor of an achromatic telescope was chester moor hall who was not in trade and did not patent it towards the close of the eighteenth century a swiss named guinand at last succeeded in producing larger flintglass discs free from striae frauenhofer of munich took him up in 1805 and soon produced among others struves dorpat refractor of 99 inches diameter and 135 feet focal length and another of 12 inches diameter and 18 feet focal length for lamont of munich in the nineteenth century gigantic reflectors have been made lassels 2foot reflector made by himself did much good work and discovered four new satellites but lord rosses 6foot reflector 54 feet focal length constructed in 1845 is still the largest ever made the imperfections of our atmosphere are against the use of such large apertures unless it be on high mountains during the last half century excellent specula have been made of silvered glass and dr commons 5foot speculum removed since his death to harvard has done excellent work then there are the 5foot yerkes reflector at chicago and the 4foot by grubb at melbourne passing now from these large reflectors to refractors further improvements have been made in the manufacture of glass by chance of birmingham feil and mantois of paris and schott of jena while specialists in grinding lenses like alvan clark of the usa and others have produced many large refractors cooke of york made an objectglass 25inch diameter for newall of gateshead which has done splendid work at cambridge we have the washington 26inch by clark the vienna 27inch by grubb the nice 2912inch by gautier the pulkowa 30inch by clark then there was the sensation of clarks 36inch for the lick observatory in california and finally his tour de force the yerkes 40inch refractor for chicago at greenwich there is the 28inch photographic refractor and the thompson equatoreal by grubb carrying both the 26inch photographic refractor and the 30inch reflector at the cape of good hope we find mr frank mccleans 24inch refractor with an objectglass prism for spectroscopic work it would be out of place to describe here the practical adjuncts of a modern equatorealthe adjustments for pointing it the clock for driving it the positionmicrometer and various eyepieces the photographic and spectroscopic attachments the revolving domes observing seats and rising floors and different forms of mounting the siderostats and coelostats and other convenient adjuncts besides the registering chronograph and numerous facilities for aiding observation on each of these a chapter might be written but the most important part of the whole outfit is the man behind the telescope and it is with him that a history is more especially concerned spectroscope since the invention of the telescope no discovery has given so great an impetus to astronomical physics as the spectroscope and in giving us information about the systems of stars and their proper motions it rivals the telescope frauenhofer at the beginning of the nineteenth century while applying dollonds discovery to make large achromatic telescopes studied the dispersion of light by a prism admitting the light of the sun through a narrow slit in a windowshutter an inverted image of the slit can be thrown by a lens of suitable focal length on the wall opposite if a wedge or prism of glass be interposed the image is deflected to one side but as newton had shown the images formed by the different colours of which white light is composed are deflected to different extentsthe violet most the red least the number of colours forming images is so numerous as to form a continuous spectrum on the wall with all the coloursred orange yellow green blue indigo and violet but frauenhofer found with a narrow slit well focussed by the lens that some colours were missing in the white light of the sun and these were shown by dark lines across the spectrum these are the frauenhofer lines some of which he named by the letters of the alphabet the d line is a very marked one in the yellow these dark lines in the solar spectrum had already been observed by wollaston 3 on examining artificial lights it was found that incandescent solids and liquids including the carbon glowing in a white gas flame give continuous spectra gases except under enormous pressure give bright lines if sodium or common salt be thrown on the colourless flame of a spirit lamp it gives it a yellow colour and its spectrum is a bright yellow line agreeing in position with line d of the solar spectrum in 1832 sir david brewster found some of the solar black lines increased in strength towards sunset and attributed them to absorption in the earths atmosphere he suggested that the others were due to absorption in the suns atmosphere thereupon professor j d forbes pointed out that during a nearly total eclipse the lines ought to be strengthened in the same way as that part of the suns light coming from its edge passes through a great distance in the suns atmosphere he tried this with the annular eclipse of 1836 with a negative result which has never been accounted for and which seemed to condemn brewsters view in 1859 kirchoff on repeating frauenhofers experiment found that if a spirit lamp with salt in the flame were placed in the path of the light the black d line is intensified he also found that if he used a limelight instead of the sunlight and passed it through the flame with salt the spectrum showed the d line black or the vapour of sodium absorbs the same light that it radiates this proved to him the existence of sodium in the suns atmosphere4 iron calcium and other elements were soon detected in the same way extensive laboratory researches still incomplete have been carried out to catalogue according to their wavelength on the undulatory theory of light all the lines of each chemical element under all conditions of temperature and pressure at the same time all the lines have been catalogued in the light of the sun and the brighter of the stars another method of obtaining spectra had long been known by transmission through or reflection from a grating of equidistant lines ruled upon glass or metal h a rowland developed the art of constructing these gratings which requires great technical skill and for this astronomers owe him a debt of gratitude in 1842 doppler5 proved that the colour of a luminous body like the pitch or note of a sounding body must be changed by velocity of approach or recession everyone has noticed on a railway that on meeting a locomotive whistling the note is lowered after the engine has passed the pitch of a sound or the colour of a light depends on the number of waves striking the ear or eye in a second this number is increased by approach and lowered by recession thus by comparing the spectrum of a star alongside a spectrum of hydrogen we may see all the lines and be sure that there is hydrogen in the star yet the lines in the starspectrum may be all slightly displaced to one side of the lines of the comparison spectrum if towards the violet end it means mutual approach of the star and earth if to the red end it means recession the displacement of lines does not tell us whether the motion is in the star the earth or both the displacement of the lines being measured we can calculate the rate of approach or recession in miles per second in 1868 huggins6 succeeded in thus measuring the velocities of stars in the direction of the line of sight in 1873 vogel7 compared the spectra of the suns east approaching limb and west receding limb and the displacement of lines endorsed the theory this last observation was suggested by zllner footnotes 1 in the encyclopaedia britannica article telescope and in grants physical astronomy good reasons are given for awarding the honour to lipperhey 2 will the indulgent reader excuse an anecdote which may encourage some workers who may have found their mathematics defective through want of use james gregorys nephew david had a heap of ms notes by newton these descended to a miss gregory of edinburgh who handed them to the present writer when an undergraduate at cambridge to examine after perusal he lent them to his kindest of friends j c adams the discoverer of neptune for his opinion adamss final verdict was i fear they are of no value it is pretty evident that when he wrote these notes newtons mathematics were a little rusty 3 r s phil trans 4 the experiment had been made before by one who did not understand its meaning but

trans 1868 7 ast nach no 1 864 book iv the physical period we have seen how the theory of the solar system was slowly developed by the constant efforts of the human mind to find out what are the rules of cause and effect by which our conception of the present universe and its development seems to be bound in the primitive ages a mere record of events in the heavens and on the earth gave the only hope of detecting those uniform sequences from which to derive rules or laws of cause and effect upon which to rely then came the geometrical age in which rules were sought by which to predict the movements of heavenly bodies later when the relation of the sun to the courses of the planets was established the sun came to be looked upon as a cause and finally early in the seventeenth century for the first time in history it began to be recognised that the laws of dynamics exactly as they had been established for our own terrestrial world hold good with the same rigid invariability at least as far as the limits of the solar system throughout this evolution of thought and conjecture there were two types of astronomersthose who supplied the facts and those who supplied the interpretation through the logic of mathematics so ptolemy was dependent upon hipparchus kepler on tycho brahe and newton in much of his work upon flamsteed when galileo directed his telescope to the heavens when secchi and huggins studied the chemistry of the stars by means of the spectroscope and when warren de la rue set up a photoheliograph at kew we see that a progress in the same direction as before in the evolution of our conception of the universe was being made without definite expression at any particular date it came to be an accepted fact that not only do earthly dynamics apply to the heavenly bodies but that the laws we find established here in geology in chemistry and in the laws of heat may be extended with confidence to the heavenly bodies hence arose the branch of astronomy called astronomical physics a science which claims a large portion of the work of the telescope spectroscope and photography in this new development it is more than ever essential to follow the dictum of tycho brahenot to make theories until all the necessary facts are obtained the great astronomers of today still hold to sir isaac newtons declaration hypotheses non fingo each one may have his suspicions of a theory to guide him in a course of observation and may call it a working hypothesis but the cautious astronomer does not proclaim these to the world and the historian is certainly not justified in including in his record those vague speculations founded on incomplete data which may be demolished tomorrow and which however attractive they may be often do more harm than good to the progress of true science meanwhile the accumulation of facts has been prodigious and the revelations of the telescope and spectroscope entrancing 12 the sun one of galileos most striking discoveries when he pointed his telescope to the heavenly bodies was that of the irregularly shaped spots on the sun with the dark central umbra and the less dark but more extensive penumbra surrounding it sometimes with several umbrae in one penumbra he has left us many drawings of these spots and he fixed their period of rotation as a lunar month illustration solar surface as photographed at the royal observatory greenwich showing sunspots with umbrae penumbrae and faculae it is not certain whether galileo fabricius or schemer was the first to see the spots they all did good work the spots were found to be ever varying in size and shape sometimes when a spot disappears at the western limb of the sun it is never seen again in other cases after a fortnight it reappears at the eastern limb the faculae or bright areas which are seen all over the suns surface but specially in the neighbourhood of spots and most distinctly near the suns edge were discovered by galileo a high telescopic power resolves their structure into an appearance like willowleaves or ricegrains fairly uniform in size and more marked than on other parts of the suns surface speculations as to the cause of sunspots have never ceased from galileos time to ours he supposed them to be clouds scheiner1 said they were the indications of tumultuous movements occasionally agitating the ocean of liquid fire of which he supposed the sun to be composed a wilson of glasgow in 17692 noticed a movement of the umbra relative to the penumbra in the transit of the spot over the suns surface exactly as if the spot were a hollow with a black base and grey shelving sides this was generally accepted but later investigations have contradicted its universality regarding the cause of these hollows wilson said whether their first production and subsequent numberless changes depend upon the eructation of elastic vapours from below or upon eddies or whirlpools commencing at the surface or upon the dissolving of the luminous matter in the solar atmosphere as clouds are melted and again given out by our air or if the reader pleases upon the annihilation and reproduction of parts of this resplendent covering is left for theory to guess at3 ever since that date theory has been guessing at it the solar astronomer is still applying all the instruments of modern research to find out which of these suppositions or what modification of any of them is nearest the truth the obstacleone that is perhaps fatal to a real theorylies in the impossibility of reproducing comparative experiments in our laboratories or in our atmosphere sir william herschel propounded an explanation of wilsons observation which received much notice but which out of respect for his memory is not now described as it violated the elementary laws of heat sir john herschel noticed that the spots are mostly confined to two zones extending to about 35 on each side of the equator and that a zone of equatoreal calms is free from spots but it was r c carrington4 who by his continuous observations at redhill in surrey established the remarkable fact that while the rotation period in the highest latitudes 50 where spots are seen is twentysevenandahalf days near the equator the period is only twentyfive days his splendid volume of observations of the sun led to much new information about the average distribution of spots at different epochs schwabe of dessau began in 1826 to study the solar surface and after many years of work arrived at a law of frequency which has been more fruitful of results than any discovery in solar physics5 in 1843 he announced a decennial period of maxima and minima of sunspot displays in 1851 it was generally accepted and although a period of eleven years has been found to be more exact all later observations besides the earlier ones which have been hunted up for the purpose go to establish a true periodicity in the number of sunspots but quite lately schuster6 has given reasons for admitting a number of coexistent periods of which the elevenyear period was predominant in the nineteenth century in 1851 lament a scotchman at munich found a decennial period in the daily range of magnetic declination in 1852 sir edward sabine announced a similar period in the number of magnetic storms affecting all of the three magnetic elementsdeclination dip and intensity australian and canadian observations both showed the decennial period in all three elements wolf of zurich and gauthier of geneva each independently arrived at the same conclusion it took many years before this coincidence was accepted as certainly more than an accident by the oldfashioned astronomers who want rigid proof for every new theory but the last doubts have long vanished and a connection has been further traced between violent outbursts of solar activity and simultaneous magnetic storms the frequency of the aurora borealis was found by wolf to follow the same period in fact it is closely allied in its cause to terrestrial magnetism wolf also collected old observations tracing the periodicity of sunspots back to about 1700 ad spoerer deduced a law of dependence of the average latitude of sunspots on the phase of the sunspot period all modern total solar eclipse observations seem to show that the shape of the luminous corona surrounding the moon at the moment of totality has a special distinct character during the time of a sunspot maximum and another totally different during a sunspot minimum a suspicion is entertained that the total quantity of heat received by the earth from the sun is subject to the same period this would have farreaching effects on storms harvests vintages floods and droughts but it is not safe to draw conclusions of this kind except from a very long period of observations solar photography has deprived astronomers of the type of carrington of the delight in devoting a lifes work to collecting data it has now become part of the routine work of an observatory in 1845 foucault and fizeau took a daguerreotype photograph of the sun in 1850 bond produced one of the moon of great beauty draper having made some attempts at an even earlier date but astronomical photography really owes its beginning to de la rue who used the collodion process for the moon in 1853 and constructed the kew photoheliograph in 1857 from which date these instruments have been multiplied and have given us an accurate record of the suns surface gelatine dry plates were first used by huggins in 1876 it is noteworthy that from the outset de la rue recognised the value of stereoscopic vision which is now known to be of supreme accuracy in 1853 he combined pairs of photographs of the moon in the same phase but under different conditions regarding libration showing the moon from slightly different points of view these in the stereoscope exhibited all the relief resulting from binocular vision and looked like a solid globe in 1860 he used successive photographs of the total solar eclipse stereoscopically to prove that the red prominences belong to the sun and not to the moon in 1861 he similarly combined two photographs of a sunspot the perspective effect showing the umbra like a floor at the bottom of a hollow penumbra and in one case the facul were discovered to be sailing over a spot apparently at some considerable height these appearances may be partly due to a proper motion but so far as it went this was a beautiful confirmation of wilsons discovery hewlett however in 1894 after thirty years of work showed that the spots are not always depressions being very subject to disturbance the kew photographs 7 contributed a vast amount of information about sunspots and they showed that the facul generally follow the spots in their rotation round the sun the constitution of the suns photosphere the layer which is the principal lightsource on the sun has always been a subject of great interest and much was done by men with exceptionally keen eyesight like mr dawes but it was a difficult subject owing to the rapidity of the changes in appearance of the socalled ricegrains about 1 in diameter the rapid transformations and circulations of these ricegrains if thoroughly studied might lead to a much better knowledge of solar physics this seemed almost hopeless as it was found impossible to identify any ricegrain in the turmoil after a few minutes but m hansky of pulkowa whose recent death is deplored introduced successfully a scheme of photography which might almost be called a solar cinematograph he took photographs of the sun at intervals of fifteen or thirty seconds and then enlarged selected portions of these two hundred times giving a picture corresponding to a solar disc of six metres diameter in these enlarged pictures he was able to trace the movements and changes of shape and brightness of individual ricegrains some granules become larger or smaller some seem to rise out of a mist as it were and to become clearer others grow feebler some are split in two some are rotated through a right angle in a minute or less although each of the grains may be the size of great britain generally they move together in groups of very various velocities up to forty kilometres a second these movements seem to have definite relation to any sunspots in the neighbourhood from the results already obtained it seems certain that if this method of observation be continued it cannot fail to supply facts of the greatest importance it is quite impossible to do justice here to the work of all those who are engaged on astronomical physics the utmost that can be attempted is to give a fair idea of the directions of human thought and endeavour during the last halfcentury america has made splendid progress and an entirely new process of studying the photosphere has been independently perfected by professor hale at chicago and deslandres at paris8 they have succeeded in photographing the suns surface in monochromatic light such as the light given off as one of the bright lines of hydrogen or of calcium by means of the spectroheliograph the spectroscope is placed with its slit in the focus of an equatoreal telescope pointed to the sun so that the circular image of the sun falls on the slit at the other end of the spectroscope is the photographic plate just in front of this plate there is another slit parallel to the first in the position where the image of the first slit formed by the k line of calcium falls thus is obtained a photograph of the section of the sun made by the first slit only in k light as the image of the sun passes over the first slit the photographic plate is moved at the same rate and in the same direction behind the second slit and as successive sections of the suns image in the equatoreal enter the apparatus so are these sections successively thrown in their proper place on the photographic plate always in k light by using a high dispersion the facul which give off k light can be correctly photographed not only at the suns edge but all over his surface the actual mechanical method of carrying out the observation is not quite so simple as what is here described by choosing another line of the spectrum instead of calcium kfor example the hydrogen line h3we obtain two photographs one showing the appearance of the calcium floculi and the other of the hydrogen floculi on the same part of the solar surface and nothing is more astonishing than to note the total want of resemblance in the forms shown on the two this mode of research promises to afford many new and useful data the spectroscope has revealed the fact that broadly speaking the sun is composed of the same materials as the earth ngstrom was the first to map out all of the lines to be found in the solar spectrum but rowland of baltimore after having perfected the art of making true gratings with equidistant lines ruled on metal for producing spectra then proceeded to make a map of the solar spectrum on a large scale in 1866 lockyer9 threw an image of the sun upon the slit of a spectroscope and was thus enabled to compare the spectrum of a spot with that of the general solar surface the observation proved the darkness of a spot to be caused by increased absorption of light not only in the dark lines which are widened but over the entire spectrum in 1883 young resolved this continuous obscurity into an infinite number of fine lines which have all been traced in a shadowy way on to the general solar surface lockyer also detected displacements of the spectrum lines in the spots such as would be produced by a rapid motion in the line of sight it has been found that both uprushes and downrushes occur but there is no marked predominance of either in a sunspot the velocity of motion thus indicated in the line of sight sometimes appears to amount to 320 miles a second but it must be remembered that pressure of a gas has some effect in displacing the spectral lines so we must go on collecting data until a time comes when the meaning of all the facts can be made clear total solar eclipsesduring total solar eclipses the time is so short and the circumstances so impressive that drawings of the appearance could not always be trusted the red prominences of jagged form that are seen round the moons edge and the corona with its streamers radiating or interlacing have much detail that can hardly be recorded in a sketch by the aid of photography a number of records can be taken during the progress of totality from a study of these the extent of the corona is demonstrated in one case to extend to at least six diameters of the moon though the eye has traced it farther this corona is still one of the wonders of astronomy and leads to many questions what is its consistency if it extends many million miles from the suns surface how is it that it opposed no resistance to the motion of comets which have almost grazed the suns surface is this the origin of the zodiacal light the character of the corona in photographic records has been shown to depend upon the phase of the sunspot period during the sunspot maximum the corona seems most developed over the spotzonesie neither at the equator nor the poles the four great sheaves of light give it a square appearance and are made up of rays or plumes delicate like the petals of a flower during a minimum the nebulous ring seems to be made of tufts of fine hairs with aigrettes or radiations from both poles and streamers from the equator illustration solar eclipse 1882 from drawing by w h wesley secretary ras showing the prominences the corona and an unknown comet on september 19th 1868 eclipse spectroscopy began with the indian eclipse in which all observers found that the red prominences showed a bright line spectrum indicating the presence of hydrogen and other gases so bright was it that jansen exclaimed je verrai ces lignesl en dehors des clipses and the next day he observed the lines at the edge of the uneclipsed sun huggins had suggested this observation in february 1868 his idea being to use prisms of such great dispersive power that the continuous spectrum reflected by our atmosphere should be greatly weakened while a bright line would suffer no diminution by the high dispersion on october 20th lockyer10 having news of the eclipse but not of jansens observations the day after was able to see these lines this was a splendid performance for it enabled the prominences to be observed not only during eclipses but every day moreover the next year huggins was able by using a wide slit to see the whole of a prominence and note its shape prominences are classified according to their form into flame and cloud prominences the spectrum of the latter showing calcium hydrogen and helium that of the former including a number of metals the d line of sodium is a double line and in the same eclipse 1868 an orange line was noticed which was afterwards found to lie close to the two components of the d line it did not correspond with any known terrestrial element and the unknown element was called helium it was not until 1895 that sir william ramsay found this element as a gas in the mineral cleavite the spectrum of the corona is partly continuous indicating light reflected from the suns body but it also shows a green line corresponding with no known terrestrial element and the name coronium has been given to the substance causing it a vast number of facts have been added to our knowledge about the sun by photography and the spectroscope speculations and hypotheses in plenty have been offered but it may be long before we have a complete theory evolved to explain all the phenomena of the stormswept metallic atmosphere of the sun the proceedings of scientific societies teem with such facts and working hypotheses and the best of them have been collected by miss clerke in her history of astronomy during the nineteenth century as to established facts we learn from the spectroscopic researches 1 that the continuous spectrum is derived from the photosphere or solar gaseous material compressed almost to liquid consistency 2 that the reversing layer surrounds it and gives rise to black lines in the spectrum that the chromosphere surrounds this is composed mainly of hydrogen and is the cause of the red prominences in eclipses and that the gaseous corona surrounds all of these and extends to vast distances outside the suns visible surface footnotes 1 rosa ursina by c scheiner fol bracciani 1630 2 r s

while she always turns the same face to us there is periodically a slight twist to let us see a little round the eastern or western edge this was called libration and the explanation was clear when it was understood that in showing always the same face to us she makes one revolution a month on her axis uniformly and that her revolution round the earth is not uniform galileo said that the mountains on the moon showed greater differences of level than those on the earth shrter supported this opinion w herschel opposed it but beer and mdler measured the heights of lunar mountains by their shadows and found four of them over 20000 feet above the surrounding plains langrenus 1 was the first to do serious work on selenography and named the lunar features after eminent men riccioli also made lunar charts in 1692 cassini made a chart of the full moon since then we have the charts of schrter beer and mdler 1837 and of schmidt of athens 1878 and above all the photographic atlas by loewy and puiseux the details of the moons surface require for their discussion a whole book like that of neison or the one by nasmyth and carpenter here a few words must suffice mountain ranges like our andes or himalayas are rare instead of that we see an immense number of circular cavities with rugged edges and flat interior often with a cone in the centre reminding one of instantaneous photographs of the splash of a drop of water falling into a pool many of these are fifty or sixty miles across some more they are generally spoken of as resembling craters of volcanoes active or extinct on the earth but some of those who have most fully studied the shapes of craters deny altogether their resemblance to the circular objects on the moon these socalled craters in many parts are seen to be closely grouped especially in the snowwhite parts of the moon but there are great smooth dark spaces like the clear black ice on a pond more free from craters to which the equally inappropriate name of seas has been given the most conspicuous crater tycho is near the south pole at full moon there are seen to radiate from tycho numerous streaks of light or rays cutting through all the mountain formations and extending over fully half the lunar disc like the starshaped cracks made on a sheet of ice by a blow similar cracks radiate from other large craters it must be mentioned that these white rays are well seen only in full light of the sun at full moon just as the white snow in the crevasses of a glacier is seen bright from a distance only when the sun is high and disappears at sunset then there are deep narrow crooked rills which may have been watercourses also clefts about half a mile wide and often hundreds of miles long like deep cracks in the surface going straight through mountain and valley the moon shares with the sun the advantage of being a good subject for photography though the planets are not this is owing to her larger apparent size and the abundance of illumination the consequence is that the finest details of the moon as seen in the largest telescope in the world may be reproduced at a cost within the reach of all no certain changes have ever been observed but several suspicions have been expressed especially as to the small crater linn in the mare serenitatis it is now generally agreed that no certainty can be expected from drawings and that for real evidence we must await the verdict of photography no trace of water or of an atmosphere has been found on the moon it is possible that the temperature is too low in any case no displacement of a star by atmospheric refraction at occultation has been surely recorded the moon seems to be dead the distance of the moon from the earth is just now the subject of remeasurement the base line is from greenwich to cape of good hope and the new feature introduced is the selection of a definite point on a crater msting a instead of the moons edge as the point whose distance is to be measured the inferior planetswhen the telescope was invented the phases of venus attracted much attention but the brightness of this planet and her proximity to the sun as with mercury also seemed to be a bar to the discovery of markings by which the axis and period of rotation could be fixed cassini gave the rotation as twentythree hours by observing a bright spot on her surface shrter made it 23h 21m 19s this value was supported by others in 1890 schiaparelli2 announced that venus rotates like our moon once in one of her revolutions and always directs the same face to the sun this property has also been ascribed to mercury but in neither case has the evidence been generally accepted twentyfour hours is probably about the period of rotation for each of these planets several observers have claimed to have seen a planet within the orbit of mercury either in transit over the suns surface or during an eclipse it has even been named vulcan these announcements would have received little attention but for the fact that the motion of mercury has irregularities which have not been accounted for by known planets and le verrier3 has stated that an intramercurial planet or ring of asteroids would account for the unexplained part of the motion of the line of apses of mercurys orbit amounting to 38 per century marsthe first study of the appearance of mars by miraldi led him to believe that there were changes proceeding in the two white caps which are seen at the planets poles w herschel attributed these caps to ice and snow and the dates of his observations indicated a melting of these icecaps in the martian summer schroter attributed the other markings on mars to drifting clouds but beer and mdler in 183039 identified the same dark spots as being always in the same place though sometimes blurred by mist in the local winter a spot sketched by huyghens in 1672 one frequently seen by w herschel in 1783 another by arago in 1813 and nearly all the markings recorded by beer and mdler in 1830 were seen and drawn by f kaiser in leyden during seventeen nights of the opposition of 1862 ast nacht no 1468 whence he deduced the period of rotation to be 24h 37m 22s62or onetenth of a second less than the period deduced by r a proctor from a drawing by hooke in 1666 it must be noted that if the periods of rotation both of mercury and venus be about twentyfour hours as seems probable all the four planets nearest to the sun rotate in the same period while the great planets rotate in about ten hours uranus and neptune being still indeterminate the general surface of mars is a deep yellow but there are dark grey or greenish patches sir john herschel was the first to attribute the ruddy colour of mars to its soil rather than to its atmosphere the observations of that keensighted observer dawes led to the first good map of mars in 1869 in the 1877 opposition schiaparelli revived interest in the planet by the discovery of canals uniformly about sixty miles wide running generally on great circles some of them being three or four thousand miles long during the opposition of 18812 the same observer reobserved the canals and in twenty of them he found the canals duplicated4 the second canal being always 200 to 400 miles distant from its fellow the existence of these canals has been doubted mr lowell has now devoted years to the subject has drawn them over and over again and has photographed them and accepts the explanation that they are artificial and that vegetation grows on their banks thus is revived the old controversy between whewell and brewster as to the habitability of the planets the new arguments are not yet generally accepted lowell believes he has with the spectroscope proved the existence of water on mars one of the most unexpected and interesting of all telescopic discoveries took place in the opposition of 1877 when mars was unusually near to the earth the washington observatory had acquired the fine 26inch refractor and asaph hall searched for satellites concealing the planets disc to avoid the glare on august 11th he had a suspicion of a satellite this was confirmed on the 16th and on the following night a second one was added they are exceedingly faint and can be seen only by the most powerful telescopes and only at the times of opposition their diameters are estimated at six or seven miles it was soon found that the first deimos completes its orbit in 30h 18m but the other phobos at first was a puzzle owing to its incredible velocity being unsuspected later it was found that the period of revolution was only 7h 39m 22s since the martian day is twentyfour and a half hours this leads to remarkable results obviously the easterly motion of the satellite overwhelms the diurnal rotation of the planet and phobos must appear to the inhabitants if they exist to rise in the west and set in the east showing two or even three full moons in a day so that sufficiently well for the ordinary purposes of life the hour of the day can be told by its phases the discovery of these two satellites is perhaps the most interesting telescopic visual discovery made with the large telescopes of the last half century photography having been the means of discovering all the other new satellites except jupiters fifth in order of discovery illustration jupiter from a drawing by e m antoniadi showing transit of a satellites shadow the belts and the great red spot monthly notices r a s vol lix pl x jupitergalileos discovery of jupiters satellites was followed by the discovery of his belts zucchi and torricelli seem to have seen them fontana in 1633 reported three belts in 1648 grimaldi saw but two and noticed that they lay parallel to the ecliptic dusky spots were also noticed as transient hooke5 measured the motion of one in 1664 in 1665 cassini with a fine telescope 35feet focal length observed many spots moving from east to west whence he concluded that jupiter rotates on an axis like the earth he watched an unusually permanent spot during twentynine rotations and fixed the period at 9h 56m later he inferred that spots near the equator rotate quicker than those in higher latitudes the same as carrington found for the sun and w herschel confirmed this in 17789 jupiters rapid rotation ought according to newtons theory to be accompanied by a great flattening at the poles cassini had noted an oval form in 1691 this was confirmed by la hire rmer and picard pound measured the ellipticity 11325 w herschel supposed the spots to be masses of cloud in the atmospherean opinion still accepted many of them were very permanent cassinis great spot vanished and reappeared nine times between 1665 and 1713 it was close to the northern margin of the southern belt herschel supposed the belts to be the body of the planet and the lighter parts to be clouds confined to certain latitudes in 1665 cassini observed transits of the four satellites and also saw their shadows on the planet and worked out a lunar theory for jupiter mathematical astronomers have taken great interest in the perturbations of the satellites because their relative periods introduce peculiar effects airy in his delightful book gravitation has reduced these investigations to simple geometrical explanations in 1707 and 1713 miraldi noticed that the fourth satellite varies much in brightness w herschel found this variation to depend upon its position in its orbit and concluded that in the positions of feebleness it is always presenting to us a portion of its surface which does not well reflect the suns light proving that it always turns the same face to jupiter as is the case with our moon this fact had also been established for saturns fifth satellite and may be true for all satellites in 1826 struve measured the diameters of the four satellites and found them to be 2429 2180 3561 and 3046 miles in modern times much interest has been taken in watching a rival to cassinis famous spot the great red spot was first observed by niesten pritchett and tempel in 1878 as a rosy cloud attached to a whitish zone beneath the dark southern equatorial band shaped like the new war balloons 30000 miles long and 7000 miles across the next year it was brickred a white spot beside it completed a rotation in less time by 512 minutes than the red spota difference of 260 miles an hour thus they came together again every six weeks but the motions did not continue uniform the spot was feeble in 18824 brightened in 1886 and after many changes is still visible galileos great discovery of jupiters four moons was the last word in this connection until september 9th 1892 when barnard using the 36inch refractor of the lick observatory detected a tiny spot of light closely following the planet this proved to be a new satellite fifth nearer to the planet than any other and revolving round it in 11h 57m 23s between its rising and setting there must be an interval of 212 jovian days and two or three full moons the sixth and seventh satellites were found by the examination of photographic plates at the lick observatory in 1905 since which time they have been continuously photographed and their orbits traced at greenwich on examining these plates in 1908 mr melotte detected the eighth satellite which seems to be revolving in a retrograde orbit three times as far from its planet as the next one seventh in these two points agreeing with the outermost of saturns satellites phoebe saturnthis planet with its marvellous ring was perhaps the most wonderful object of those first examined by galileos telescope he was followed by dominique cassini who detected bands like jupiters belts herschel established the rotation of the planet in 177594 from observations during one hundred rotations he found the period to be 10h 16m 0s 44 herschel also measured the ratio of the polar to the equatoreal diameter as 1011 the ring was a complete puzzle to galileo most of all when the planet reached a position where the plane of the ring was in line with the earth and the ring disappeared december 4th 1612 it was not until 1656 that huyghens in his small pamphlet de saturni luna observatio nova was able to suggest in a cypher the ring form and in 1659 in his systema saturnium he gave his reasons and translated the cypher the planet is surrounded by a slender flat ring everywhere distinct from its surface and inclined to the ecliptic this theory explained all the phases of the ring which had puzzled others this ring was then and has remained ever since a unique structure we in this age have got accustomed to it but huyghenss discovery was received with amazement in 1675 cassini found the ring to be double the concentric rings being separated by a black banda fact which was placed beyond dispute by herschel who also found that the thickness of the ring subtends an angle less than 03 shrter estimated its thickness at 500 miles many speculations have been advanced to explain the origin and constitution of the ring de sejour said 6 that it was thrown off from saturns equator as a liquid ring and afterwards solidified he noticed that the outside would have a greater velocity and be less attracted to the planet than the inner parts and that equilibrium would be impossible so he supposed it to have solidified into a number of concentric rings the exterior ones having the least velocity clerk maxwell in the adams prize essay gave a physicomathematical demonstration that the rings must be composed of meteoritic matter like gravel even so there must be collisions absorbing the energy of rotation and tending to make the rings eventually fall into the planet the slower motion of the external parts has been proved by the spectroscope in keelers hands 1895 saturn has perhaps received more than its share of attention owing to these rings this led to other discoveries huyghens in 1655 and j d cassini in 1671 discovered the sixth and eighth satellites titan and japetus cassini lost his satellite and in searching for it found rhea the fifth in 1672 besides his old friend whom he lost again he added the third and fourth in 1684 tethys and dione the first and second mimas and encelades were added by herschel in 1789 and the seventh hyperion simultaneously by lassel and bond in 1848 the ninth phoebe was found on photographs by pickering in 1898 with retrograde motion and he has lately added a tenth the occasional disappearance of cassinis japetus was found on investigation to be due to the same causes as that of jupiters fourth satellite and proves that it always turns the same face to the planet uranus and neptunethe splendid discoveries of uranus and two satellites by sir william herschel in 1787 and of neptune by adams and le verrier in 1846 have been already described lassel added two more satellites to uranus in 1851 and found neptunes satellite in 1846 all of the satellites of uranus have retrograde motion and their orbits are inclined about 80 to the ecliptic the spectroscope has shown the existence of an absorbing atmosphere on jupiter and saturn and there are suspicions that they partake something of the character of the sun and emit some light besides reflecting solar light on both planets some absorption lines seem to agree with the aqueous vapour lines of our own atmosphere while one which is a strong band in the red common to both planets seems to agree with a line in the spectrum of some reddish stars uranus and neptune are difficult to observe spectroscopically but appear to have peculiar spectra agreeing together sometimes uranus shows frauenhofer lines indicating reflected solar light but generally these are not seen and six broad bands of absorption appear one is the f of hydrogen another is the redstar line of jupiter and saturn neptune is a very difficult object for the spectroscope quite lately 7 p lowell has announced that v m slipher at flagstaff observatory succeeded in 1907 in rendering some plates sensitive far into the red a reproduction is given of photographed spectra of the four outermost planets showing 1 a great number of new lines and bands 2 intensification of hydrogen f and c lines 3 a steady increase of effects 1 and 2 as we pass from jupiter and saturn to uranus and a still greater increase in neptune asteroidsthe discovery of these new planets has been described at the beginning of the last century it was an immense triumph to catch a new one since photography was called into the service by wolf they have been caught every year in shoals it is like the difference between sea fishing with the line and using a steam trawler in the 1908 almanacs nearly seven hundred asteroids are included the computation of their perturbations and ephemerides by eulers and lagranges method of variable elements became so laborious that encke devised a special process for these which can be applied to many other disturbed orbits 8 when a photograph is taken of a region of the heavens

for astronomers and a comparison of orbits has often identified the return of a comet and led to the detection of an elliptic orbit where the difference from a parabola was imperceptible in the small portion of the orbit visible to us a remarkable case in point was the comet of 1556 of whose identity with the comet of 1264 there could be little doubt hind wanted to compute the orbit more exactly than halley had done he knew that observations had been made but they were lost having expressed his desire for a search all the observations of fabricius and of heller and also a map of the comets path among the stars were eventually unearthed in the most unlikely manner after being lost nearly three hundred years hind and others were certain that this comet would return between 1844 and 1848 but it never appeared when the spectroscope was first applied to finding the composition of the heavenly bodies there was a great desire to find out what comets are made of the first opportunity came in 1864 when donati observed the spectrum of a comet and saw three bright bands thus proving that it was a gas and at least partly selfluminous in 1868 huggins compared the spectrum of winneckes comet with that of a geissler tube containing olefiant gas and found exact agreement nearly all comets have shown the same spectrum1 a very few comets have given bright band spectra differing from the normal type also a certain kind of continuous spectrum as well as reflected solar light showing frauenhofer lines have been seen illustration copy of the drawing made by paul fabricius to define the path of comet 1556 after being lost for 300 years this drawing was recovered by the prolonged efforts of mr hind and professor littrow in 1856 when wellss comet in 1882 approached very close indeed to the sun the spectrum changed to a monochromatic yellow colour due to sodium for a full account of the wonders of the cometary world the reader is referred to books on descriptive astronomy or to monographs on comets2 nor can the very uncertain speculations about the structure of comets tails be given here a new explanation has been proposed almost every time that a great discovery has been made in the theory of light heat chemistry or electricity halleys comet remained the only one of which a prediction of the return had been confirmed until the orbit of the small illdefined comet found by pons in 1819 was computed by encke and found to have a period of 3 13 years it was predicted to return in 1822 and was recognised by him as identical with many previous comets this comet called after encke has showed in each of its returns an inexplicable reduction of mean distance which led to the assertion of a resisting medium in space until a better explanation could be found3 since that date fourteen comets have been found with elliptic orbits whose aphelion distances are all about the same as jupiters mean distance and six have an aphelion distance about ten per cent greater than neptunes mean distance other comets are similarly associated with the planets saturn and uranus the physical transformations of comets are among the most wonderful of unexplained phenomena in the heavens but for physical astronomers the greatest interest attaches to the reduction of radius vector of enckes comet the splitting of bielas comet into two comets in 1846 and the somewhat similar behaviour of other comets it must be noted however that comets have a sensible size that all their parts cannot travel in exactly the same orbit under the suns gravitation and that their mass is not sufficient to retain the parts together very forcibly also that the inevitable collision of particles or else fluid friction is absorbing energy and so reducing the comets velocity in 1770 lexell discovered a comet which as was afterwards proved by investigations of lexell burchardt and laplace had in 1767 been deflected by jupiter out of an orbit in which it was invisible from the earth into an orbit with a period of 512 years enabling it to be seen in 1779 it again approached jupiter closer than some of his satellites and was sent off in another orbit never to be again recognised but our interest in cometary orbits has been added to by the discovery that owing to the causes just cited a comet if it does not separate into discrete parts like bielas must in time have its parts spread out so as to cover a sensible part of the orbit and that when the earth passes through such part of a comets orbit a meteor shower is the result a magnificent meteor shower was seen in america on november 12th13th 1833 when the paths of the meteors all seemed to radiate from a point in the constellation leo a similar display had been witnessed in mexico by humboldt and bonpland on november 12th 1799 h a newton traced such records back to october 13th ad 902 the orbital motion of a cloud or stream of small particles was indicated the period favoured by h a newton was 35412 days another suggestion was 37512 days and another 3314 years he noticed that the advance of the date of the shower between 902 and 1833 at the rate of one day in seventy years meant a progression of the node of the orbit adams undertook to calculate what the amount would be on all the five suppositions that had been made about the period after a laborious work he found that none gave one day in seventy years except the 3314year period which did so exactly h a newton predicted a return of the shower on the night of november 13th14th 1866 he is now dead but many of us are alive to recall the wonder and enthusiasm with which we saw this prediction being fulfilled by the grandest display of meteors ever seen by anyone now alive the progression of the nodes proved the path of the meteor stream to be retrograde the radiant had almost the exact longitude of the point towards which the earth was moving this proved that the meteor cluster was at perihelion the period being known the eccentricity of the orbit was obtainable also the orbital velocity of the meteors in perihelion and by comparing this with the earths velocity the latitude of the radiant enabled the inclination to be determined while the longitude of the earth that night was the longitude of the node in such a way schiaparelli was able to find first the elements of the orbit of the august meteor shower perseids and to show its identity with the orbit of tuttles comet 1862iii then in january 1867 le verrier gave the elements of the november meteor shower leonids and peters of altona identified these with oppolzers elements for tempels comet 1866schiaparelli having independently attained both of these results subsequently weiss of vienna identified the meteor shower of april 20th lyrids with comet 1861 finally that indefatigable worker on meteors a s herschel added to the number and in 1878 gave a list of seventysix coincidences between cometary and meteoric orbits cometary astronomy is now largely indebted to photography not merely for accurate delineations of shape but actually for the discovery of most of them the art has also been applied to the observation of comets at distances from their perihelia so great as to prevent their visual observation thus has wolf of heidelburg found upon old plates the position of comet 1905v as a star of the 155 magnitude 783 days before the date of its discovery from the point of view of the importance of finding out the divergence of a cometary orbit from a parabola its period and its aphelion distance this increase of range attains the very highest value the present astronomer royal appreciating this possibility has been searching by photography for halleys comet since november 1907 although its perihelion passage will not take place until april 1910 footnotes 1 in 1874 when the writer was crossing the pacific ocean in hms scout coggias comet unexpectedly appeared and while colonel tupman got its positions with the sextant he tried to use the prism out of a portable directvision spectroscope without success until it was put in front of the objectglass of a binocular when to his great joy the three band images were clearly seen 2 such as the world of comets by a guillemin history of comets by g r hind london 1859 theatrum cometicum by s de lubienietz 1667 cometographie by pingr paris 1783 donatis comet by bond 3 the investigations by von asten of st petersburg seem to support and later ones especially those by backlund also of st petersburg seem to discredit the idea of a resisting medium 15 the fixed stars and nebul passing now from our solar system which appears to be subject to the action of the same forces as those we experience on our globe there remains an innumerable host of fixed stars nebulas and nebulous clusters of stars to these the attention of astronomers has been more earnestly directed since telescopes have been so much enlarged photography also has enabled a vast amount of work to be covered in a comparatively short period and the spectroscope has given them the means not only of studying the chemistry of the heavens but also of detecting any motion in the line of sight from less than a mile a second and upwards in any star however distant provided it be bright enough illustration sir william herschel frs17381822 painted by lemuel f abbott national portrait gallery room xx in the field of telescopic discovery beyond our solar system there is no one who has enlarged our knowledge so much as sir william herschel to whom we owe the greatest discovery in dynamical astronomy among the starsviz that the law of gravitation extends to the most distant stars and that many of them describe elliptic orbits about each other w herschel was born at hanover in 1738 came to england in 1758 as a trained musician and died in 1822 he studied science when he could and hired a telescope until he learnt to make his own specula and telescopes he made 430 parabolic specula in twentyone years he discovered 2500 nebul and 806 double stars counted the stars in 3400 guagefields and compared the principal stars photometrically some of the things for which he is best known were results of those accidents that happen only to the indefatigable enthusiast such was the discovery of uranus which led to funds being provided for constructing his 40feet telescope after which in 1786 he settled at slough in the same way while trying to detect the annual parallax of the stars he failed in that quest but discovered binary systems of stars revolving in ellipses round each other just as bradleys attack on stellar parallax failed but led to the discovery of aberration nutation and the true velocity of light parallaxthe absence of stellar parallax was the great objection to any theory of the earths motion prior to keplers time it is true that keplers theory itself could have been geometrically expressed equally well with the earth or any other point fixed but in keplers case the obviously implied physical theory of the planetary motions even before newton explained the simplicity of conception involved made astronomers quite ready to waive the claim for a rigid proof of the earths motion by measurement of an annual parallax of stars which they had insisted on in respect of copernicuss revival of the idea of the earths orbital motion still the desire to measure this parallax was only intensified by the practical certainty of its existence and by repeated failures the attempts of bradley failed the attempts of piazzi and brinkley1 early in the nineteenth century also failed the first successes afterwards confirmed were by bessel and henderson both used stars whose proper motion had been found to be large as this argued proximity henderson at the cape of good hope observed alpha centauri whose annual proper motion he found to amount to 36 in 18323 and a few years later deduced its parallax 116 his successor at the cape maclear reduced this to 092 in 1835 struve assigned a doubtful parallax of 0261 to vega alpha lyr but bessels observations between 1837 and 1840 of 61 cygni a star with the large proper motion of over 5 established its annual parallax to be 03483 and this was confirmed by peters who found the value 0349 later determinations for alpha2 centauri by gill2 make its parallax 075this is the nearest known fixed star and its light takes 4 13 years to reach us the light year is taken as the unit of measurement in the starry heavens as the earths mean distance is the astronomical unit for the solar system3 the proper motions and parallaxes combined tell us the velocity of the motion of these stars across the line of sight alpha centauri 144 miles a second42 astronomical units a year 61 cygni 379 miles a second112 astronomical units a year these successes led to renewed zeal and now the distances of many stars are known more or less accurately several of the brightest stars which might be expected to be the nearest have not shown a parallax amounting to a twentieth of a second of arc among these are canopus alpha orionis alpha cygni beta centauri and gamma cassiopeia oudemans has published a list of parallaxes observed4 proper motionin 1718 halley5 detected the proper motions of arcturus and sirius in 1738 j cassinis6 showed that the former had moved five minutes of arc since tycho brahe fixed its position in 1792 piazzi noted the motion of 61 cygni as given above for a long time the greatest observed proper motion was that of a small star 1830 groombridge nearly 7 a year but others have since been found reaching as much as 10 now the spectroscope enables the motion of stars to be detected at a single observation but only that part of the motion that is in the line of sight for a complete knowledge of a stars motion the proper motion and parallax must also be known when huggins first applied the doppler principle to measure velocities in the line of sight7 the faintness of star spectra diminished the accuracy but vgel in 1888 overcame this to a great extent by long exposures of photographic plates it has often been noticed that stars which seem to belong to a group of nearly uniform magnitude have the same proper motion the spectroscope has shown that these have also often the same velocity in the line of sight thus in the great bear beta gamma delta epsilon zeta all agree as to angular proper motion delta was too faint for a spectroscopic measurement but all the others have been shown to be approaching us at a rate of twelve to twenty miles a second the same has been proved for proper motion and line of sight motion in the case of pleiades and other groups maskelyne measured many proper motions of stars from which w herschel8 came to the conclusion that these apparent motions are for the most part due to a motion of the solar system in space towards a point in the constellation hercules ra 257 n decl 25 this grand discovery has been amply confirmed and though opinions differ as to the exact direction it happens that the point first indicated by herschel from totally insufficient data agrees well with modern estimates comparing the proper motions and parallaxes to get the actual velocity of each star relative to our system cl struve found the probable velocity of the solar system in space to be fifteen miles a second or five astronomical units a year the work of herschel in this matter has been checked by comparing spectroscopic velocities in the line of sight which so far as the suns motion is concerned would give a maximum rate of approach for stars near hercules a maximum rate of recession for stars in the opposite part of the heavens and no effect for stars halfway between in this way the spectroscope has confirmed generally herschels view of the direction and makes the velocity eleven miles a second or nearly four astronomical units a year the average proper motion of a first magnitude star has been found to be 025 annually and of a sixth magnitude star 004 but that all bright stars are nearer than all small stars or that they show greater proper motion for that reason is found to be far from the truth many statistical studies have been made in this connection and interesting results may be expected from this treatment in the hands of kapteyn of groningen and others9 on analysis of the directions of proper motions of stars in all parts of the heavens kapteyn has shown10 that these indicate besides the solar motion towards hercules two general drifts of stars in nearly opposite directions which can be detected in any part of the heavens this result has been confirmed from independent data by eddington ras mn and dyson rse proc photography promises to assist in the measurement of parallax and proper motions herr pulfrich of the firm of carl zeiss has vastly extended the applications of stereoscopic vision to astronomya subject which de la rue took up in the early days of photography he has made a stereocomparator of great beauty and convenience for comparing stereoscopically two star photographs taken at different dates wolf of heidelberg has used this for many purposes his investigations depending on the solar motion in space are remarkable he photographs stars in a direction at right angles to the line of the suns motion he has taken photographs of the same region fourteen years apart the two positions of his camera being at the two ends of a baseline over 5000000000 miles apart or fiftysix astronomical units on examining these stereoscopically some of the stars rise out of the general plane of the stars and seem to be much nearer many of the stars are thus seen to be suspended in space at different distances corresponding exactly to their real distances from our solar system except when their proper motion interferes the effect is most striking the accuracy of measurement exceeds that of any other method of measuring such displacements and it seems that with a long interval of time the advantage of the method increases double starsthe large class of double stars has always been much studied by amateurs partly for their beauty and colour and partly as a test for telescopic definition among the many unexplained stellar problems there is one noticed in double stars that is thought by some to be likely to throw light on stellar evolution it is this there are many instances where one star of the pair is comparatively faint and the two stars are contrasted in colour and in every single case the general colour of the faint companion is invariably to be classed with colours more near to the blue end of the spectrum than that of the principal star binary starssir william herschel began his observations of double stars in the hope of discovering an annual parallax of the stars in this he was following a suggestion of galileos the presumption is that if there be no physical connection between the stars of a pair the largest is the nearest and has the greatest parallax so by noting the distance between the pair at different times of the year a delicate test of parallax is provided unaffected by major instrumental errors herschel did indeed discover changes of distance but not of the character to indicate parallax following this by further observation he found that the motions were not uniform nor rectilinear and by a clear analysis of the movements he established the remarkable and wholly unexpected fact that in all these cases the motion is due to a revolution about their common centre of gravity11 he gave the approximate period of revolution of some of these castor 342 years delta serpentis 375 years gamma leonis 1200 years epsilon bootis 1681 years twenty years later sir john herschel and sir james south after reexamination of these stars confirmed12 and extended the results one pair of coron having in the interval completed more than a whole revolution it is then to sir william herschel that we owe the extension of the law of gravitation beyond the limits of the solar system to the whole universe his observations were confirmed by fgw struve born 1793 died 1864 who carried on the work at dorpat but it was first to savary13 and later to encke and sir john herschel that we owe the computation of the elliptic elements of these stars also the resulting identification of their law of force with newtons force of gravitation applied to the solar system and the force that makes an apple fall to the ground as grant well says in his history this may be justly asserted to be one of the most sublime truths which astronomical science has hitherto disclosed to the researches of the human mind latterly the best work on double stars has been done by s w burnham14 at the lick observatory the shortest period he found was eleven years kappa pegasi in the case of some of these binaries the parallax has been measured from which it appears that in four of the surest cases the orbits are about the size of the orbit of uranus these being probably among the smallest stellar orbits the law of gravitation having been proved to extend to the stars a discovery like that of neptune in its origin though unlike it in the labour and originality involved in the calculation that entrances the imagination became possible and was realised by besselthe discovery of an unknown body by its gravitational disturbance on one that was visible in 1834 and 1840 he began to suspect a want of uniformity in the proper motion of sirius and procyon respectively in 1844 in a letter to sir john herschel15 he attributed these irregularities in each case to the attraction of an invisible companion the period of revolution of sirius being about half a century later he said i adhere to the conviction that procyon and sirius form real binary systems consisting of a visible and an invisible star there is no reason to suppose luminosity an essential quality of cosmical bodies the visibility of countless stars is no argument against the invisibility of countless others this grand conception led peters to compute more accurately the orbit and to assign the place of the invisible companion of sirius in 1862 alvan g clark was testing a new 18inch objectglass now at chicago upon sirius and knowing nothing of these predictions actually found the companion in the very place assigned to it in 1896 the companion of procyon was discovered by professor schaeberle at the lick observatory now by the refined parallax determinations of gill at the cape we know that of sirius to be 038 from this it has been calculated that the mass of sirius equals two of our suns and its intrinsic brightness equals twenty suns but the companion having a mass equal to our sun has only a fivehundredth part of the suns brightness spectroscopic binarieson measuring the velocity of a star in the line of sight at frequent intervals periodic variations have been found leading to a belief in motion round an invisible companion vogel in 1889 discovered this in the case of spica alpha virginis whose period is 4d 0h 19m and the diameter of whose orbit is six million miles great numbers of binaries of this type have since then been discovered all of short period also in 1889 pickering found that at regular intervals of fiftytwo days the lines in the spectrum of zeta of the great bear are duplicated indicating a relative velocity equal to one hundred miles a second of two components revolving round each other of which that apparently single star must be composed it would be interesting no doubt to follow in detail the accumulating knowledge about the distances proper motions and orbits of the stars but this must be done elsewhere enough has been said to show how results are accumulating which must in time unfold to us the various stellar systems and their mutual relationships variable starsit has often happened in the history of different branches of physical science that observation and experiment were so far ahead of theory that hopeless confusion appeared to reign and then one chance result has given a clue and from that time all differences and difficulties in the previous researches have stood forth as natural consequences explaining one another in a rational sequence so we find parallax proper motion double stars binary systems variable stars and new stars all bound together the logical and necessary explanation given of the cause of ordinary spectroscopic binaries and of irregular proper motions of sirius and procyon leads to the inference that if ever the plane of such a binary orbit were edgeon to us there ought to be an eclipse of the luminous partner whenever the nonluminous one is interposed between us this should give rise either to intermittence in the stars light or else to variability it was by supposing the existence of a dark companion to algol that its discoverer goodricke of york16 in 1783 explained variable stars of this type algol beta persei completes the period of variable brightness in 688 hours it loses threefifths of its light and regains it in twelve hours in 1889 vogel17 with the potsdam spectrograph actually found that the luminous star is receding before each eclipse and approaching us after each eclipse thus entirely supporting goodrickes opinion there are many variables of the algol type and information is steadily accumulating but all variable stars do not suffer the sudden variations of algol there are many types and the explanations of others have not proved so easy the harvard college photographs have disclosed the very great prevalence of variability and this is certainly one of the lines in which modern discovery must progress roberts in south africa has done splendid work on the periods of variables of the algol type new starsextreme instances of variable stars are the new stars such as those detected by hipparchus tycho brahe and kepler of which many have been found in the last halfcentury one of the latest great nov was discovered in auriga by a scotsman dr anderson on february 1st 1892 and with the modesty of his race he communicated the fact to his majestys astronomer for scotland on an unsigned postcard18 its spectrum was observed and photographed by huggins and many others it was full of bright lines of hydrogen calcium helium and others not identified the astounding fact was that lines were shown in pairs bright and dark on a faint continuous spectrum indicating apparently that a dark body approaching us at the rate of 550 miles a second19 was traversing a cold nebulous atmosphere and was heated to incandescence by friction like a meteor in our atmosphere leaving a luminous train behind it it almost disappeared and on april 26th it was of the sixteenth magnitude but on august 17th it brightened to the tenth showing the principal nebular band in its spectrum and no sign of approach or recession it was as if it emerged from one part of the nebula cooled down and rushed through another part of the nebula rendering the nebular gas more luminous than itself20 since 1892 one nova after another has shown a spectrum as described above like a meteor rushing towards us and leaving a train behind for this seems to be the obvious meaning of the spectra the same may be said of the brilliant nova persei brighter at its best than capella and discovered also by dr anderson on february 22nd 1901 it increased in brightness as it reached the densest part of the nebula then it varied for some weeks by a couple of magnitudes up and down as if passing through separate nebular condensations in february 1902 it could still be seen with an operaglass as with the other nov when it first dashed into the nebula it was vaporised and gave a continuous spectrum with dark lines of hydrogen and helium it showed no bright lines paired with the dark ones to indicate a train left behind but in the end its own luminosity died out and the nebular spectrum predominated the nebular illumination as seen in photographs taken from august to november seemed to spread out slowly in a gradually increasing circle at the rate of 90 in fortyeight days kapteyn put this down to the velocity of light the original outburst sending its illumination to the nebulous gas and illuminating a spherical shell whose radius increased at the velocity of light this supposition seems correct in which case it can easily be shown from the above figures that the distance of this nova was 300 light years star cataloguessince the days of very accurate observations numerous starcatalogues have been produced by individuals or by observatories bradleys monumental work may be said to head the list lacailles in the southern hemisphere was complementary then piazzi lalande groombridge and bessel were followed by argelander with his 324000 stars rumkers paramatta catalogue of the southern hemisphere and the frequent catalogues of national observatories later the astronomische gesellschaft started their great catalogue the combined work of many observatories other southern ones were goulds at cordova and stones at the cape after this we have a new departure gill at the cape having the comet 1882ii all to himself in those latitudes wished his friends in europe to see it and employed a local photographer to strap his camera to the observatory equatoreal driven by clockwork and adjusted on the comet by the eye the result with halfanhours exposure was good so he tried three hours the result was such a display of sharp star images that he resolved on the cape photographic durchmusterung which after fourteen years with kapteyns aid in reducing was completed meanwhile the brothers henry of paris were engaged in going over chacornacs zodiacal stars and were about to catalogue the milky way portion a serious labour when they saw gills comet photograph and conceived the idea of doing the rest of their work by photography gill had previously written to admiral mouchez of the paris observatory and explained to him his project for charting the heavens photographically by combining the work of many observatories this led admiral mouchez to support the brothers henry in their scheme21 gill having got his own photographic work underway suggested an international astrographic chart the materials for different zones to be supplied by observatories of all nations each equipped with similar photographic telescopes at a conference in paris 1887 this was decided on the stars on the charts going down to the fourteenth magnitude and the catalogues to the eleventh illustration great comet nov 14th 1882 exposure 2hrs 20m by kind permission of sir david gill from this photograph originated all stellar chartphotography this monumental work is nearing completion the labour involved was immense and the highest skill was required for devising instruments and methods to read off the star positions from the plates then we have the harvard college collection of photographic plates always being automatically added to and their annex at arequipa in peru such catalogues vary in their degree of accuracy and fundamental catalogues of standard stars have been compiled these require extension because the differential methods of the heliometer and the camera cannot otherwise be made absolute the number of stars down to the fourteenth magnitude may be taken at about 30000000 and that of all the stars visible in the greatest modern telescopes is probably about 100000000 nebul and starclustersour knowledge of nebul really dates from the time of w herschel in his great sweeps of the heavens with his giant telescopes he opened in this direction a new branch of astronomy at one time he held that all nebul might be clusters of innumerable minute stars at a great distance then he recognised the different classes of nebul and became convinced that there is a widelydiffused shining fluid in space though many socalled nebul could be resolved by large telescopes into stars he considered that the milky way is a great star cluster whose form may be conjectured from numerous stargaugings he supposed that the compact planetary nebul might show a stage of evolution from the diffuse nebul and that his classifications actually indicate various stages of development such speculations like those of the ancients about the solar system are apt to be harmful to true progress of knowledge unless in the hands of the ablest mathematical physicists and herschel violated their principles in other directions but here his speculations have attracted a great deal of attention and with modifications are accepted at least as a working hypothesis by a fair number of people when sir john herschel had extended his fathers researches into the southern hemisphere he was also led to the belief that some nebulae were a phosphorescent material spread through space like fog or mist then his views were changed by the revelations due to the great discoveries of lord rosse with his gigantic refractor22 when one nebula after another was resolved into a cluster of minute stars at that time the opinion gained ground that with increase of telescopic power this would prove to be the case with all nebul in 1864 all doubt was dispelled by huggins23 in his first examination of the spectrum of a nebula and the subsequent extension of this observation to other nebul thus providing a certain test which increase in the size of telescopes could never have given in 1864 huggins found that all true nebulae give a spectrum of bright lines three are due to hydrogen two discovered by copeland are helium lines others are unknown fiftyfive lines have been photographed in the spectrum of the orion nebula it seems to be pretty certain that all true nebulae are gaseous and show almost exactly the same spectrum other nebul and especially the white ones like that in andromeda which have not yet been resolved into stars show a continuous spectrum others are greenish and give no lines a great deal has to be done by the chemist before the astronomer can be on sure ground in drawing conclusions from certain portions of his spectroscopic evidence the light of the nebulas is remarkably actinic so that photography has a specially fine field in revealing details imperceptible in the telescope in 1885 the brothers henry photographed round the star maia in the pleiades a spiral nebula 3 long as bright on the plate as that star itself but quite invisible in the telescope and an exposure of four hours revealed other new nebula in the same district that painstaking and most careful observer barnard with 1014 hours exposure extended this nebulosity for several degrees and discovered to the north of the pleiades a huge diffuse nebulosity in a region almost destitute of stars by establishing a 10inch instrument at an altitude of 6000 feet barnard has revealed the wide distribution of nebular matter in the constellation scorpio over a space of 4 or 5 square barnard asserts that the nebular hypothesis would have been killed at its birth by a knowledge of these photographs later he has used still more powerful instruments and extended his discoveries the association of stars with planetary nebul and the distribution of nebul in the heavens especially in relation to the milky way are striking facts which will certainly bear fruit when the time arrives for discarding vague speculations and learning to read the true physical structure and history of the starry universe stellar spectrawhen the spectroscope was first available for stellar research the leaders in this branch of astronomy were huggins and father secchi24 of rome the former began by devoting years of work principally to the most accurate study of a few stars the latter devoted the years from 1863 to 1867 to a general survey of the whole heavens including 4000 stars he divided these into four principal classes which have been of the greatest service half of his stars belonged to the first class including sirius vega regulus altair the characteristic feature of their spectra is the strength and breadth of the hydrogen lines and the extreme faintness of the metallic lines this class of star is white to the eye and rich in ultra violet light the second class includes about threeeighths of his stars including capella pollux and arcturus these stars give a spectrum like that of our sun and appear yellowish to the eye the third class includes alpha herculis alpha orionis betelgeux mira ceti and about 500 red and variable stars the spectrum has fluted bands shaded from blue to red and sharply defined at the more refrangible edge the fourth class is a small one containing no stars over fifth magnitude of which 152 schjellerup in canes venatici is a good example this spectrum also has bands but these are shaded on the violet side and sharp on the red side they are due to carbon in some form these stars are ruby red in the telescope it would appear then that all stars are suns with continuous spectra and the classes are differentiated by the character of the absorbent vapours of their atmospheres it is very likely that after the chemists have taught us how to interpret all the varieties of spectrum it will be possible to ascribe the different spectrumclasses to different stages in the lifehistory of every star already there are plenty of people ready to lay down arbitrary assumptions about the lessons to be drawn from stellar spectra some say that they know with certainty that each star begins by being a nebula and is condensed and heated by condensation until it begins to shine as a star that it attains a climax of temperature then cools down and eventually becomes extinct they go so far as to declare that they know what class of spectrum belongs to each stage of a stars life and how to distinguish between one that is increasing and another that is decreasing in temperature the more cautious astronomers believe that chemistry is not sufficiently advanced to justify all of these deductions that until chemists have settled the lately raised question of the transmutation of elements no theory can be sure it is also held that until they have explained without room for doubt the reasons for the presence of some lines and the absence of others of any element in a stellar spectrum why the arcspectrum of each element differs from its spark spectrum what are all the various changes produced in the spectrum of a gas by all possible concomitant variations of pressure and temperature also the meanings of all the flutings in the spectra of metalloids and compounds and other equally pertinent mattersuntil that time arrives the part to be played by the astronomer is one of observation by all means they say make use of working hypotheses to add an interest to years of laborious research and to serve as a guide to the direction of further labours but be sure not to fall into the error of calling any mere hypothesis a theory nebular hypothesisthe nebular hypothesis which was first as it were tentatively put forward by laplace as a note in his systme du monde supposes the solar system to have been a flat diskshaped nebula at a high temperature in rapid rotation in cooling it condensed leaving revolving rings at different distances from the centre these themselves were supposed to condense into the nucleus for a rotating planet which might in contracting again throw off rings to form satellites the speculation can be put in a really attractive form but is in direct opposition to many of the actual facts and so long as it is not favoured by those who wish to maintain the position of astronomy as the most exact of the sciencesexact in its facts exact in its logicthis speculation must be recorded by the historian only as he records the guesses of the ancient greeksas an interesting phase in the history of human thought other hypotheses having the same end in view are the meteoritic hypothesis of lockyer and the planetesimal hypothesis that has been largely developed in the united states these can best be read in the original papers to various journals references to which may be found in the footnotes of miss clerkes history of astronomy during the nineteenth century the same can be said of bredichins hypothesis of comets tails arrheniuss book on the applications of the theory of light repulsion the speculations on radium the origin of the suns heat and the age of the earth the electron hypothesis of terrestrial magnetism and a host of similar speculations all combining to throw an interesting light on the evolution of a modern train of thought that seems to delight in conjecture while rebelling against that strict mathematical logic which has crowned astronomy as the queen of the sciences footnotes 1 r s phil trans 1810 and 181724 2 one of the most valuable contributions to our knowledge of stellar parallaxes
