home life and comfort by mrs isabella beeton nothing lovelier can be found in woman than to study household goodmilton published originally by s o beeton in 24 monthly parts 18591861 first published in a bound edition 1861 preface i must frankly own that if i had known beforehand that this book would have cost me the labour which it has i should never have been courageous enough to commence it what moved me in the first instance to attempt a work like this was the discomfort and suffering which i had seen brought upon men and women by household mismanagement i have always thought that there is no more fruitful source of family discontent than a housewifes badlycooked dinners and untidy ways men are now so well served out of doorsat their clubs wellordered taverns and dininghouses that in order to compete with the attractions of these places a mistress must be thoroughly acquainted with the theory and practice of cookery as well as be perfectly conversant with all the other arts of making and keeping a comfortable home in this book i have attempted to give under the chapters devoted to cookery an intelligible arrangement to every recipe a list of the ingredients a plain statement of the mode of preparing each dish and a careful estimate of its cost the number of people for whom it is sufficient and the time when it is seasonable for the matter of the recipes i am indebted in some measure to many correspondents of the englishwomans domestic magazine who have obligingly placed at my disposal their formulas for many original preparations a large private circle has also rendered me considerable service a diligent study of the works of the best modern writers on cookery was also necessary to the faithful fulfilment of my task friends in england scotland ireland france and germany have also very materially aided me i have paid great attention to those recipes which come under the head of cold meat cookery but in the department belonging to the cook i have striven too to make my work something more than a cookery book and have therefore on the best authority that i could obtain given an account of the natural history of the animals and vegetables which we use as food i have followed the animal from his birth to his appearance on the table have described the manner of feeding him and of slaying him the position of his various joints and after giving the recipes have described the modes of carving meat poultry and game skilful artists have designed the numerous drawings which appear in this work and which illustrate better than any description many important and interesting items the coloured plates are a novelty not without value besides the great portion of the book which has especial reference to the cooks department there are chapters devoted to those of the other servants of the household who have all i trust their duties clearly assigned to them towards the end of the work will be found valuable chapters on the management of childrenthe doctor the latter principally referring to accidents and emergencies some of which are certain to occur in the experience of every one of us and the last chapter contains legal memoranda which will be serviceable in cases of doubt as to the proper course to be adopted in the relations between landlord and tenant taxgatherer and taxpayer and tradesman and customer these chapters have been contributed by gentlemen fully entitled to confidence those on medical subjects by an experienced surgeon and the legal matter by a solicitor i wish here to acknowledge the kind letters and congratulations i have received during the progress of this work and have only further to add that i trust the result of the four years incessant labour which i have expended will not be altogether unacceptable to some of my countrymen and countrywomen isabella beeton general contents chap ithe mistress 2the housekeeper 3arrangement and economy of the kitchen 4introduction to cookery

the bread of idleness her children arise up and call her blessed her husband also and he praiseth herproverbs xxxi 2528 i as with the commander of an army or the leader of any enterprise so is it with

vice and trains up the other to virtue is a much greater character than ladies described in romances whose whole occupation is to murder mankind with shafts from their quiver or their eyes 2 pursuing this picture we may add that to be a good housewife does not necessarily imply an abandonment of proper pleasures or amusing recreation and we think it the more necessary to express this as the performance of the duties of a mistress may to some minds perhaps seem to be incompatible with the enjoyment of life let us however now proceed to describe some of those home qualities and virtues which are necessary to the proper management of a household and then point out the plan which may be the most profitably pursued for the daily regulation of its affairs 3 early rising is one of the most essential qualities which enter into good household management as it is not only the parent of health but of innumerable other advantages indeed when a mistress is an early riser it is almost certain that her house will be orderly and wellmanaged on the contrary if she remain in bed till a late hour then the domestics who as we have before observed invariably partake somewhat of their mistresss character will surely become sluggards to selfindulgence all are more or less disposed and it is not to be expected that servants are freer from this fault than the heads of houses the great lord chatham thus gave his advice in reference to this subjecti would have inscribed on the curtains of your bed and the walls of your chamber if you do not rise early you can make progress in nothing 4 cleanliness is also indispensable to health and must be studied both in regard to the person and the house and all that it contains cold or tepid baths should be employed every morning unless on account of illness or other circumstances they should be deemed objectionable the bathing of children will be treated of under the head of management of children 5 frugality and economy are home virtues without which no household can prosper dr johnson says frugality may be termed the daughter of prudence the sister of temperance and the parent of liberty he that is extravagant will quickly become poor and poverty will enforce dependence and invite corruption the necessity of practising economy should be evident to every one whether in the possession of an income no more than sufficient for a familys requirements or of a large fortune which puts financial adversity out of the question we must always remember that it is a great merit in housekeeping to manage a little well he is a good waggoner says bishop hall that can turn in a little room to live well in abundance is the praise of the estate not of the person i will study more how to give a good account of my little than how to make it more in this there is true wisdom and it may be added that those who can manage a little well are most likely to succeed in their management of larger matters economy and frugality must never however be allowed to degenerate into parsimony and meanness 6 the choice of acquaintances is very important to the happiness of a mistress and her family a gossiping acquaintance who indulges in the scandal and ridicule of her neighbours should be avoided as a pestilence it is likewise allnecessary to beware as thomson sings the whisperd tale that like the fabling nile no fountain knows fairlaced deceit whose wily conscious aye neer looks direct the tongue that licks the dust but when it safely dares as prompt to sting if the duties of a family do not sufficiently occupy the time of a mistress society should be formed of such a kind as will tend to the mutual interchange of general and interesting information 7 friendships should not be hastily formed nor the heart given at once to every newcomer there are ladies who uniformly smile at and approve everything and everybody and who possess neither the courage to reprehend vice nor the generous warmth to defend virtue the friendship of such persons is without attachment and their love without affection or even preference they imagine that every one who has any penetration is illnatured and look coldly on a discriminating judgment it should be remembered however that this discernment does not always proceed from an uncharitable temper but that those who possess a long experience and thorough knowledge of the world scrutinize the conduct and dispositions of people before they trust themselves to the first fair appearances addison who was not deficient in a knowledge of mankind observes that a friendship which makes the least noise is very often the most useful for which reason i should prefer a prudent friend to a zealous one and joanna baillie tells us that friendship is no plant of hasty growth though planted in esteems deepfixed soil the gradual culture of kind intercourse must bring it to perfection 8 hospitality is a most excellent virtue but care must be taken that the love of company for its own sake does not become a prevailing passion for then the habit is no longer hospitality but dissipation reality and truthfulness in this as in all other duties of life are the points to be studied for as washington irving well says there is an emanation from the heart in genuine hospitality which cannot be described but is immediately felt and puts the stranger at once at his ease with respect to the continuance of friendships however it may be found necessary in some cases for a mistress to relinquish on assuming the responsibility of a household many of those commenced in the earlier part of her life this will be the more requisite if the number still retained be quite equal to her means and opportunities 9 in conversation trifling occurrences such as small disappointments petty annoyances and other everyday incidents should never be mentioned to your friends the extreme injudiciousness of repeating these will be at once apparent when we reflect on the unsatisfactory discussions which they too frequently occasion and on the load of advice which they are the cause of being tendered and which is too often of a kind neither to be useful nor agreeable greater events whether of joy or sorrow should be communicated to friends and on such occasions their sympathy gratifies and comforts if the mistress be a wife never let an account of her husbands failings pass her lips and in cultivating the power of conversation she should keep the versified advice of cowper continually in her memory that it should flow like water after summer showers not as if raised by mere mechanic powers in reference to its style dr johnson who was himself greatly distinguished for his colloquial abilities says that no style is more extensively acceptable than the narrative because this does not carry an air of superiority over the rest of the company and therefore is most likely to please them for this purpose we should store our memory with short anecdotes and entertaining pieces of history almost every one listens with eagerness to extemporary history vanity often cooperates with curiosity for he that is a hearer in one place wishes to qualify himself to be a principal speaker in some inferior company and therefore more attention is given to narrations than anything else in conversation it is true indeed that sallies of wit and quick replies are very pleasing in conversation but they frequently tend to raise envy in some of the company but the narrative way neither raises this nor any other evil passion but keeps all the company nearly upon an equality and if judiciously managed will at once entertain and improve them all 10 good temper should be cultivated by every mistress as upon it the welfare of the household may be said to turn indeed its influence can hardly be overestimated as it has the effect of moulding the characters of those around her and of acting most beneficially on the happiness of the domestic circle every head of a household should strive to be cheerful and should never fail to show a deep interest in all that appertains to the wellbeing of those who claim the protection of her roof gentleness not partial and temporary but universal and regular should pervade her conduct for where such a spirit is habitually manifested it not only delights her children but makes her domestics attentive and respectful her visitors are also pleased by it and their happiness is increased 11 on the important subject of dress and fashion we cannot do better than quote an opinion from the eighth volume of the englishwomans domestic magazine the writer there says let people write talk lecture satirize as they may it cannot be denied that whatever is the prevailing mode in attire let it intrinsically be ever so absurd it will never look as ridiculous as another or as any other which however convenient comfortable or even becoming is totally opposite in style to that generally worn 12 in purchasing articles of wearing apparel whether it be a silk dress a bonnet shawl or riband it is well for the buyer to consider three things i that it be not too expensive for her purse ii that its colour harmonize with her complexion and its size and pattern with her figure iii that its tint allow of its being worn with the other garments she possesses the quaint fuller observes that the good wife is none of our dainty dames who love to appear in a variety of suits every day new as if a gown like a stratagem in war were to be used but once but our good wife sets up a sail according to the keel of her husbands estate and if of high parentage she doth not so remember what she was by birth that she forgets what she is by match to brunettes or those ladies having dark complexions silks of a grave hue are adapted for blondes or those having fair complexions lighter colours are preferable as the richer deeper hues are too overpowering for the latter the colours which go best together are green with violet goldcolour with dark crimson or lilac pale blue with scarlet pink with black or white and gray with scarlet or pink a cold colour generally requires a warm tint to give life to it gray and pale blue for instance do not combine well both being cold colours 13 the dress of the mistress should always be adapted to her circumstances and be varied with different occasions thus at breakfast she should be attired in a very neat and simple manner wearing no ornaments if this dress should decidedly pertain only to the breakfasthour and be specially suited for such domestic occupations as usually follow that meal then it would be well to exchange it before the time for receiving visitors if the mistress be in the habit of doing so it is still to be remembered however that in changing the dress jewellery and ornaments are not to be worn until the full dress for dinner is assumed further information and hints on the subject of the toilet will appear under the department of the ladysmaid the advice of polonius to his son laertes in shakspeares tragedy of hamlet is most excellent and although given to one of the male sex will equally apply to a fayre ladye costly thy habit as thy purse can buy but not expressd in fancy rich not gaudy for the apparel oft proclaims the man 14 charity and benevolence are duties which a mistress owes to herself as well as to her fellowcreatures and there is scarcely any income so small but something may be spared from it even if it be but the widows mite it is to be always remembered however that it is the spirit of charity which imparts to the gift a value far beyond its actual amount and is by far its better part true charity a plant divinely nursed fed by the love from which it rose at first thrives against hope and in the rudest scene storms but enliven its unfading green exubrant is the shadow it supplies its fruit on earth its growth above the skies visiting the houses of the poor is the only practical way really to understand the actual state of each family and although there may be difficulties in following out this plan in the metropolis and other large cities yet in country towns and rural districts these objections do not obtain great advantages may result from visits paid to the poor for there being unfortunately much ignorance generally amongst them with respect to all household knowledge there will be opportunities for advising and instructing them in a pleasant and unobtrusive manner in cleanliness industry cookery and good management 15 in marketing that the best articles are the cheapest may be laid down as a rule and it is desirable unless an experienced and confidential housekeeper be kept that the mistress should herself purchase all provisions and stores needed for the house if the mistress be a young wife and not accustomed to order things for the house a little practice and experience will soon teach her who are the best tradespeople to deal with and what are the best provisions to buy under each particular head of fish meat poultry game c will be described the proper means of ascertaining the quality of these comestibles 16 a housekeeping accountbook should invariably be kept and kept punctually and precisely the plan for keeping household accounts which we should recommend would be to make an entry that is write down into a daily diary every amount paid on that particular day be it ever so small then at the end of the month let these various payments be ranged under their specific heads of butcher baker c and thus will be seen the proportions paid to each tradesman and any one months expenses may be contrasted with another the housekeeping accounts should be balanced not less than once a month so that you may see that the money you have in hand tallies with your account of it in your diary judge haliburton never wrote truer words than when he said no man is rich whose expenditure exceeds his means and no one is poor whose incomings exceed his outgoings when in a large establishment a housekeeper is kept it will be advisable for the mistress to examine her accounts regularly then any increase of expenditure which may be apparent can easily be explained and the housekeeper will have the satisfaction of knowing whether her efforts to manage her department well and economically have been successful 17 engaging domestics is one of those duties in which the judgment of the mistress must be keenly exercised there are some respectable registryoffices where good servants may sometimes be hired but the plan rather to be recommended is for the mistress to make inquiry amongst her circle of friends and acquaintances and her tradespeople the latter generally know those in their neighbourhood who are wanting situations and will communicate with them when a personal interview with some of them will enable the mistress to form some idea of the characters of the applicants and to suit herself accordingly we would here point out an errorand a grave one it isinto which some mistresses fall they do not when engaging a servant expressly tell her all the duties which she will be expected to perform this is an act of omission severely to be reprehended every portion of work which the maid will have to do should be plainly stated by the mistress and understood by the servant if this plan is not carefully adhered to domestic contention is almost certain to ensue and this may not be easily settled so that a change of servants which is so much to be deprecated is continually occurring 18 in obtaining a servants character it is not well to be guided by a written one from some unknown quarter but it is better to have an interview if at all possible with the former mistress by this means you will be assisted in your decision of the suitableness of the servant for your place from the appearance of the lady and the state of her house negligence and want of cleanliness in her and her household generally will naturally lead you to the conclusion that her servant has suffered from the influence of the bad example the proper course to pursue in order to obtain a personal interview with the lady is thisthe servant in search of the situation must be desired to see her former mistress and ask her to be kind enough to appoint a time convenient to herself when you may call on her this proper observance of courtesy being necessary to prevent any unseasonable intrusion on the part of a stranger your first questions should be relative to the honesty and general morality of her former servant and if no objection is stated in that respect her other qualifications are then to be ascertained inquiries should be very minute so that you may avoid disappointment and trouble by knowing the weak points of your domestic 19 the treatment of servants is of the highest possible moment as well to the mistress as to the domestics themselves on the head of the house the latter will naturally fix their attention and if they perceive that the mistresss conduct is regulated by high and correct principles they will not fail to respect her if also a benevolent desire is shown to promote their comfort at the same time that a steady performance of their duty is exacted then their respect will not be unmingled with affection and they will be still more solicitous to continue to deserve her favour 20 in giving a character it is scarcely necessary to say that the mistress should be guided by a sense of strict justice it is not fair for one lady to recommend to another a servant she would not keep herself the benefit too to the servant herself is of small advantage for the failings which she possesses will increase if suffered to be indulged with impunity it is hardly necessary to remark on the other hand that no angry feelings on the part of a mistress towards her late servant should ever be allowed in the slightest degree to influence her so far as to induce her to disparage her maids character 21 the following table of the average yearly wages paid to domestics with the various members of the household placed in the order in which they are usually ranked will serve as a guide to regulate the expenditure of an establishment when not found in when found in livery livery the house steward from 10 to 80 the valet 25 to 50 from 20 to 30 the butler 25 to 50 the cook 20 to 40 the gardener 20 to 40 the footman 20 to 40 15 to 25 the under butler 15 to 30 15 to 25 the coachman 20 to 35 the groom 15 to 30 12 to 20 the under footman 12 to 20 the page or footboy 8 to 18 6 to 14 the stableboy 6 to 12 when no extra when an extra allowance is made for allowance is made for tea sugar and beer tea sugar and beer the housekeeper from 20 to 15 from 18 to 40 the ladysmaid 12 to 25 10 to 20 the head nurse 15 to 30 13 to 26 the cook 11 to 30 12 to 26 the upper housemaid 12 to 20 10 to 17 the upper laundrymaid 12 to 18 10 to 15 the maidofallwork 9 to 14 712 to 11 the under housemaid 8 to 12 612 to 10 the stillroom maid 9 to 14 8 to 13 the nursemaid 8 to 12 5 to 10 the under laundrymaid 9 to 11 8 to 12 the kitchenmaid 9 to 14 8 to 12 the scullerymaid 5 to 9 4 to 8 these quotations of wages are those usually given in or near the metropolis but of course there are many circumstances connected with locality and also having reference to the long service on the one hand or the inexperience on the other of domestics which may render the wages still higher or lower than those named above all the domestics mentioned in the above table would enter into the establishment of a wealthy nobleman the number of servants of course would become smaller in proportion to the lesser size of the establishment and we may here enumerate a scale of servants suited to various incomes commencing with about 1000 a yeara cook upper housemaid nursemaid under housemaid and a man servant about 750 a yeara cook housemaid nursemaid and footboy about 500 a yeara cook housemaid and nursemaid about 300 a yeara maidofallwork and nursemaid about 200 or 150 a yeara maidofallwork and girl occasionally 22 having thus indicated some of the more general duties of the mistress relative to the moral government of her household we will now give a few specific instructions on matters having a more practical relation to the position which she is supposed to occupy in the eye of the world to do this the more clearly we will begin with her earliest duties and take her completely through the occupations of a day 23 having risen early as we have already advised see 3 and having given due attention to the bath and made a careful toilet it will be well at once to see that the children have received their proper ablutions and are in every way clean and comfortable the first meal of the day breakfast will then be served at which all the family should be punctually present unless illness or other circumstances prevent 24 after breakfast is over it will be well for the mistress to make a round of the kitchen and other offices to see that all are in order and that the mornings work has been properly performed by the various domestics the orders for the day should then be given and any questions which the domestics desire to ask respecting their several departments should be answered and any special articles they may require handed to them from the storecloset in those establishments where there is a housekeeper it will not be so necessary for the mistress personally to perform the abovenamed duties 25 after this general superintendence of her servants the mistress if a mother of a young family may devote herself to the instruction of some of its younger members or to the examination of the state of their wardrobe leaving the later portion of the morning for reading or for some amusing recreation recreation says bishop hall is intended to the mind as whetting is to the scythe to sharpen the edge of it which would otherwise grow dull and blunt he therefore that spends his whole time in recreation is ever whetting never mowing his grass may grow and his steed starve as contrarily he that always toils and never recreates is ever mowing never whetting labouring much to little purpose as good no scythe as no edge then only doth the work go forward when the scythe is so seasonably and moderately whetted that it may cut and so cut that it may have the help of sharpening unless the means of the mistress be very circumscribed and she be obliged to devote a great deal of her time to the making of her childrens clothes and other economical pursuits it is right that she should give some time to the pleasures of literature the innocent delights of the garden and to the improvement of any special abilities for music painting and other elegant arts which she may happily possess 26 these duties and pleasures being performed and enjoyed the hour of luncheon will have arrived this is a very necessary meal between an early breakfast and a late dinner as a healthy person with good exercise should have a fresh supply of food once in four hours it should be a light meal but its solidity must of course be in some degree proportionate to the time it is intended to enable you to wait for your dinner and the amount of exercise you take in the mean time at this time also the servants dinner will be served in those establishments where an early dinner is served that will of course take the place of the luncheon in many houses where a nursery dinner is provided for the children and about one oclock the mistress and the elder portion of the family make their luncheon at the same time from the same joint or whatever may be provided a mistress will arrange according to circumstances the serving of the meal but the more usual plan is for the lady of the house to have the joint brought to her table and afterwards carried to the nursery 27 after luncheon morning calls and visits may be made and received these may be divided under three heads those of ceremony friendship and congratulation or condolence visits of ceremony or courtesy which occasionally merge into those of friendship are to be paid under various circumstances thus they are uniformly required after dining at a friends house or after a ball picnic or any other party these visits should be short a stay of from fifteen to twenty minutes being quite sufficient a lady paying a visit may remove her boa or neckerchief but neither her shawl nor bonnet when other visitors are announced it is well to retire as soon as possible taking care to let it appear that their arrival is not the cause when they are quietly seated and the bustle of their entrance is over rise from your chair taking a kind leave of the hostess and bowing politely to the guests should you call at an inconvenient time not having ascertained the luncheon hour or from any other inadvertence retire as soon as possible without however showing that you feel yourself an intruder it is not difficult for any wellbred or even goodtempered person to know what to say on such an occasion and on politely withdrawing a promise can be made to call again if the lady you have called on appear really disappointed 28 in paying visits of friendship it will not be so necessary to be guided by etiquette as in paying visits of ceremony and if a lady be pressed by her friend to remove her shawl and bonnet it can be done if it will not interfere with her subsequent arrangements it is however requisite to call at suitable times and to avoid staying too long if your friend is engaged the courtesies of society should ever be maintained even in the domestic circle and amongst the nearest friends during these visits the manners should be easy and cheerful and the subjects of conversation such as may be readily terminated serious discussions or arguments are to be altogether avoided and there is much danger and impropriety in expressing opinions of those persons and characters with whom perhaps there is but a slight acquaintance see 6 7 and 9 it is not advisable at any time to take favourite dogs into another ladys drawingroom for many persons have an absolute dislike to such animals and besides this there is always a chance of a breakage of some article occurring through their leaping and bounding here and there sometimes very much to the fear and annoyance of the hostess her children also unless they are particularly welltrained and orderly and she is on exceedingly friendly terms with the hostess should not accompany a lady in making morning calls where a lady however pays her visits in a carriage the children can be taken in the vehicle and remain in it until the visit is over 29 for morning calls it is well to be neatly attired for a costume very different to that you generally wear or anything approaching an evening dress will be very much out of place as a general rule it may be said both in reference to this and all other occasions it is better to be underdressed than overdressed a strict account should be kept of ceremonial visits and notice how soon your visits have been returned an opinion may thus be formed as to whether your frequent visits are or are not desirable there are naturally instances when the circumstances of old age or ill health will preclude any return of a call but when this is the case it must not interrupt the discharge of the duty 30 in paying visits of condolence it is to be remembered that they should be paid within a week after the event which occasions them if the acquaintance however is but slight then immediately after the family has appeared at public worship a lady should send in her card and if her friends be able to receive her the visitors manner and conversation should be subdued and in harmony with the character of her visit courtesy would dictate that a mourning card should be used and that visitors in paying condoling visits should be dressed in black either silk or plaincoloured apparel sympathy with the affliction of the family is thus expressed and these attentions are in such cases pleasing and soothing in all these visits if your acquaintance or friend be not at home a card should be left if in a carriage the servant will answer your inquiry and receive your card if paying your visits on foot give your card to the servant in the hall but leave to go in and rest should on no account be asked the form of words not at home may be understood in different senses but the only courteous way is to receive them as being perfectly true you may imagine that the lady of the house is really at home and that she would make an exception in your favour or you may think that your acquaintance is not desired but in either case not the slightest word is to escape you which would suggest on your part such an impression 31 in receiving morning calls the foregoing description of the etiquette to be observed in paying them will be of considerable service it is to be added however that the occupations of drawing music or reading should be suspended on the entrance of morning visitors if a lady however be engaged with light needlework and none other is appropriate in the drawingroom it may not be under some circumstances inconsistent with good breeding to quietly continue it during conversation particularly if the visit be protracted or the visitors be gentlemen formerly the custom was to accompany all visitors quitting the house to the door and there take leave of them but modern society which has thrown off a great deal of this kind of ceremony now merely requires that the lady of the house should rise from her seat shake hands or courtesy in accordance with the intimacy she has with her guests and ring the bell to summon the servant to attend them and open the door in making a first call either upon a newlymarried couple or persons newly arrived in the neighbourhood a lady should leave her husbands card together with her own at the same time stating that the profession or business in which he is engaged has prevented him from having the pleasure of paying the visit with her it is a custom with many ladies when on the eve of an absence from their neighbourhood to leave or send their own and husbands cards with the letters p p c in the righthand corner these letters are the initials of the french words pour prendre cong meaning to take leave 32 the morning calls being paid or received and their etiquette properly attended to the next great event of the day in most establishments is the dinner and we only propose here to make a few general remarks on this important topic as in future pages the whole art of dining will be thoroughly considered with reference to its economy comfort and enjoyment 33 in giving or accepting an invitation for dinner the following is the form of words generally made use of they however can be varied in proportion to the intimacy or position of the hosts and guests mr and mrs a present their compliments to mr and mrs b and request the honour or hope to have the pleasure of their company to dinner on wednesday the 6th of december next a street november 13th 1859 r s v p the letters in the corner imply rpondez sil vous plat meaning an answer will oblige the reply accepting the invitation is couched in the following terms mr and mrs b present their compliments to mr and mrs a and will do themselves the honour of or will have much pleasure in accepting their kind invitation to dinner on the 6th of december next b square november 18th 1859 cards or invitations for a dinnerparty should be issued a fortnight or three weeks sometimes even a month beforehand and care should be taken by the hostess in the selection of the invited guests that they should be suited to each other much also of the pleasure of a dinnerparty will depend on the arrangement of the guests at table so as to form a due admixture of talkers and listeners the grave and the gay if an invitation to dinner is accepted the guests should be punctual and the mistress ready in her drawingroom to receive them at some periods it has been considered fashionable to come late to dinner but lately nous avons chang tout cela 34 the halfhour before dinner has always been considered as the great ordeal through which the mistress in giving a dinnerparty will either pass with flying colours or lose many of her laurels the anxiety to receive her guestsher hope that all will be present in due timeher trust in the skill of her cook and the attention of the other domestics all tend to make these few minutes a trying time the mistress however must display no kind of agitation but show her tact in suggesting light and cheerful subjects of conversation which will be much aided by the introduction of any particular new book curiosity of art or article of vertu which may pleasantly engage the attention of the company waiting for dinner however is a trying time and there are few who have not felt how sad it is to sit and pine the long halfhour before we dine upon our watches oft to look then wonder at the clock and cook and strive to laugh in spite of fate but laughter forced soon quits the room and leaves it in its former gloom but lo the dinner now appears the object of our hopes and fears the end of all our pain in giving an entertainment of this kind the mistress should remember that it is her duty to make her guests feel happy comfortable and quite at their ease and the guests should also consider that they have come to the house of their hostess to be happy thus an opportunity is given to all for innocent enjoyment and intellectual improvement when also acquaintances may be formed that may prove invaluable through life and information gained that will enlarge the mind many celebrated men and women have been great talkers and amongst others the genial sir walter scott who spoke freely to every one and a favourite remark of whom it was that he never did so without learning something he didnt know before 35 dinner being announced the host offers his arm to and places on his right hand at the dinnertable the lady to whom he desires to pay most respect either on account of her age position or from her being the greatest stranger in the party if this lady be married and her husband present the latter takes the hostess to her place at table and seats himself at her right hand the rest of the company follow in couples as specified by the master and mistress of the house arranging the party according to their rank and other circumstances which may be known to the host and hostess it will be found of great assistance to the placing of a party at the dinnertable to have the names of the guests neatly and correctly written on small cards and placed at that part of the table where it is desired they should sit with respect to the number of guests it has often been said that a private dinnerparty should consist of not less than the number of the graces or more than that of the muses a party of ten or twelve is perhaps in a general way sufficient to enjoy themselves and be enjoyed white kid gloves are worn by ladies at dinnerparties but should be taken off before the business of dining commences 36 the guests being seated at the dinnertable the lady begins to help the soup which is handed round commencing with the gentleman on her right and on her left and continuing in the same order till all are served it is generally established as a rule not to ask for soup or fish twice as in so doing part of the company may be kept waiting too long for the second course when perhaps a little revenge is taken by looking at the awkward consumer of a second portion this rule however may under various circumstances not be considered as binding it is not usual where taking wine is en rgle for a gentleman to ask a lady to take wine until the fish or soup is finished and then the gentleman honoured by sitting on the right of the hostess may politely inquire if she will do him the honour of taking wine with him this will act as a signal to the rest of the company the gentleman of the house most probably requesting the same pleasure of the ladies at his right and left at many tables however the custom or fashion of drinking wine in this manner is abolished and the servant fills the glasses of the guests with the various wines suited to the course which is in progress 37 when dinner is finished the dessert is placed on the table accompanied with fingerglasses it is the custom of some gentlemen to wet a corner of the napkin but the hostess whose behaviour will set the tone to all the ladies present will merely wet the tips of her fingers which will serve all the purposes required the french and other continentals have a habit of gargling the mouth but it is a custom which no english gentlewoman should in the slightest degree imitate 38 when fruit has been taken and a glass or two of wine passed round the time will have arrived when the hostess will rise and thus give the signal for the ladies to leave the gentlemen and retire to the drawingroom the gentlemen of the party will rise at the same time and he who is nearest the door will open it for the ladies all remaining courteously standing until the last lady has withdrawn dr johnson has a curious paragraph on the effects of a dinner on men before dinner he says men meet with great inequality of understanding and those who are conscious of their inferiority have the modesty not to talk when they have drunk wine every man feels himself happy and loses that modesty and grows impudent and vociferous but he is not improved he is only not sensible of his defects this is rather severe but there may be truth in it in former times when the bottle circulated freely amongst the guests it was necessary for the ladies to retire earlier than they do at present for the gentlemen of the company soon became unfit to conduct themselves with that decorum which is essential in the presence of ladies thanks however to the improvements in modern society and the high example shown to the nation by its most illustrious personages temperance is in these happy days a striking feature in the character of a gentleman delicacy of conduct towards the female sex has increased with the esteem in which they are now universally held and thus the very early withdrawing of the ladies from the diningroom is to be deprecated a lull in the conversation will seasonably indicate the moment for the ladies departure 39 afterdinner invitations may be given by which we wish to be understood invitations for the evening the time of the arrival of these visitors will vary according to their engagements or sometimes will be varied in obedience to the caprices of fashion guests invited for the evening are however generally considered at liberty to arrive whenever it will best suit themselvesusually between nine and twelve unless earlier hours are specifically named by this arrangement many fashionable people and others who have numerous engagements to fulfil often contrive to make their appearance at two or three parties in the course of one evening 40 the etiquette of the dinnerparty table being disposed of let us now enter slightly into that of an evening party or ball the invitations issued and accepted for either of these will be written in the same style as those already described for a dinnerparty they should be sent out at least three weeks before the day fixed for the event and should be replied to within a week of their receipt by attending to these courtesies the guests will have time to consider their engagements and prepare their dresses and the hostess will also know what will be the number of her party if the entertainment is to be simply an evening party this must be specified on the card or note of invitation short or verbal invitations except where persons are exceedingly intimate or are very near relations are very far from proper although of course in this respect and in many other respects very much always depends on the manner in which the invitation is given true politeness however should be studied even amongst the nearest friends and relations for the mechanical forms of good breeding are of great consequence and too much familiarity may have for its effect the destruction of friendship 41 as the ladies and gentlemen arrive each should be shown to a room exclusively provided for their reception and in that set apart for the ladies attendants should be in waiting to assist in uncloaking and helping to arrange the hair and toilet of those who require it it will be found convenient in those cases where the number of guests is large to provide numbered tickets so that they can be attached to the cloaks and shawls of each lady a duplicate of which should be handed to the guest coffee is sometimes provided in this or an anteroom for those who would like to partake of it 42 as the visitors are announced by the servant it is not necessary for the lady of the house to advance each time towards the door but merely to rise from her seat to receive their courtesies and congratulations if indeed the hostess wishes to show particular favour to some peculiarly honoured guests she may introduce them to others whose acquaintance she may imagine will be especially suitable and agreeable it is very often the practice of the master of the house to introduce one gentleman to another but occasionally the lady performs this office when it will of course be polite for the persons thus introduced to take their seats together for the time being the custom of nonintroduction is very much in vogue in many houses and guests are thus left to discover for themselves the position and qualities of the people around them the servant indeed calls out the names of all the visitors as they arrive but in many instances mispronounces them so that it will not be well to follow this information as if it were an unerring guide in our opinion it is a cheerless and depressing custom although in thus speaking we do not allude to the large assemblies of the aristocracy but to the smaller parties of the middle classes 43 a separate room or convenient buffet should be appropriated for refreshments and to which the dancers may retire and cakes and biscuits with wine negus lemonade and ices handed round a supper is also mostly provided at the private parties of the middle classes and this requires on the part of the hostess a great deal of attention and supervision it usually takes place between the first and second parts of the programme of the dances of which there should be several prettily written or printed copies distributed about the ballroom in private parties a lady is not to refuse the invitation of a gentleman to dance unless she be previously engaged the hostess must be supposed to have asked to her house only those persons whom she knows to be perfectly respectable and of unblemished character as well as pretty equal in position and thus to decline the offer of any gentleman present would be a tacit reflection on the master and mistress of the house it may be mentioned here more especially for the young who will read this book that introductions at balls or evening parties cease with the occasion that calls them forth no introduction at these times giving a gentleman a right to address afterwards a lady she is consequently free next morning to pass her partner at a ball of the previous evening without the slightest recognition 44 the ball is generally opened that is the first place in the first quadrille is occupied by the lady of the house when anything prevents this the host will usually lead off the dance with the lady who is either the highest in rank or the greatest stranger it will be well for the hostess even if she be very partial to the amusement and a graceful dancer not to participate in it to any great extent lest her lady guests should have occasion to complain of her monopoly of the gentlemen and other causes of neglect a few dances will suffice to show her interest in the entertainment without unduly trenching on the attention due to her guests in all its parts a ball should be perfect the music and the banquet and the wine the garlands the roseodours and the flowers the hostess or host during the progress of a ball will courteously accost and chat with their friends and take care that the ladies are furnished with seats and that those who wish to dance are provided with partners a gentle hint from the hostess conveyed in a quiet ladylike manner that certain ladies have remained unengaged during several dances is sure not to be neglected by any gentleman thus will be studied the comfort and enjoyment of the guests and no lady in leaving the house will be able to feel the chagrin and disappointment of not having been invited to stand up in a dance during the whole of the evening 45 when any of the carriages of the guests are announced or the time for their departure arrived they should make a slight intimation to the hostess without however exciting any observation that they are about to depart if this cannot be done however without creating too much bustle it will be better for the visitors to retire quietly without taking their leave during the course of the week the hostess will expect to receive from every guest a call where it is possible or cards expressing the gratification experienced from her entertainment this attention is due to every lady for the pains and trouble she has been at and tends to promote social kindly feelings 46 having thus discoursed of parties of pleasure it will be an interesting change to return to the more domestic business of the house although all the details we have been giving of dinnerparties balls and the like appertain to the department of the mistress without a knowledge of the etiquette to be observed on these occasions a mistress would be unable to enjoy and appreciate those friendly pleasant meetings which give as it were a fillip to life and make the quiet happy home of an english gentlewoman appear the more delightful and enjoyable in their proper places all that is necessary to be known respecting the dishes and appearance of the breakfast dinner tea and supper tables will be set forth in this work 47 a family dinner at home compared with either giving or going to a dinnerparty is of course of much more frequent occurrence and many will say of much greater importance both however have to be considered with a view to their nicety and enjoyment and the latter more particularly with reference to economy these points will be especially noted in the following pages on household cookery here we will only say that for both mistress and servants as well in large as small households it will be found by far the better plan to cook and serve the dinner and to lay the tablecloth and the sideboard with the same cleanliness neatness and scrupulous exactness whether it be for the mistress herself alone a small family or for company if this rule be strictly adhered to all will find themselves increase in managing skill whilst a knowledge of their daily duties will become familiar and enable them to meet difficult occasions with ease and overcome any amount of obstacles 48 of the manner of passing evenings at home there is none pleasanter than in such recreative enjoyments as those which relax the mind from its severer duties whilst they stimulate it with a gentle delight where there are young people forming a part of the evening circle interesting and agreeable pastime should especially be promoted it is of incalculable benefit to them that their homes should possess all the attractions of healthful amusement comfort and happiness for if they do not find pleasure there they will seek it elsewhere it ought therefore to enter into the domestic policy of every parent to make her children feel that home is the happiest place in the world that to imbue them with this delicious homefeeling is one of the choicest gifts a parent can bestow light or fancy needlework often forms a portion of the evenings recreation for the ladies of the household and this may be varied by an occasional game at chess or backgammon it has often been remarked too that nothing is more delightful to the feminine members of a family than the reading aloud of some good standard work or amusing publication a knowledge of polite literature may be thus obtained by the whole family especially if the reader is able and willing to explain the more difficult passages of the book and expatiate on the wisdom and beauties it may contain this plan in a great measure realizes the advice of lord bacon who says read not to contradict and refute nor to believe and take for granted nor to find talk and discourse but to weigh and consider 49 in retiring for the night it is well to remember that early rising is almost impossible if late going to bed be the order or rather disorder of the house the younger members of a family should go early and at regular hours to their beds and the domestics as soon as possible after a reasonably appointed hour either the master or the mistress of a house should after all have gone to their separate rooms see that all is right with respect to the lights and fires below and no servants should on any account be allowed to remain up after the heads of the house have retired 50 having thus gone from early rising to early retiring there remain only now to be considered a few special positions respecting which the mistress of the house will be glad to receive some specific information 51 when a mistress takes a house in a new locality it will be etiquette for her to wait until the older inhabitants of the neighbourhood call upon her thus evincing a desire on their part to become acquainted with the new comer it may be that the mistress will desire an intimate acquaintance with but few of her neighbours but it is to be specially borne in mind that all visits whether of ceremony friendship or condolence should be punctiliously returned 52 you may perhaps have been favoured with letters of introduction from some of your friends to persons living in the neighbourhood to which you have just come in this case inclose the letter of introduction in an envelope with your card then if the person to whom it is addressed calls in the course of a few days the visit should be returned by you within the week if possible any breach of etiquette in this respect will not readily be excused in the event of your being invited to dinner under the above circumstances nothing but necessity should prevent you from accepting the invitation if however there is some distinct reason why you cannot accept let it be stated frankly and plainly for politeness and truthfulness should be ever allied an opportunity should also be taken to call in the course of a day or two in order to politely express your regret and disappointment at not having been able to avail yourself of their kindness 53 in giving a letter of introduction it should always be handed to your friend unsealed courtesy dictates this as the person whom you are introducing would perhaps wish to know in what manner he or she was spoken of should you receive a letter from a friend introducing to you any person known to and esteemed by the writer the letter should be immediately acknowledged and your willingness expressed to do all in your power to carry out his or her wishes 54 such are the onerous duties which enter into the position of the mistress of a house and such are happily with a slight but continued attention of by no means difficult performance she ought always to remember that she is the first and the last the alpha and the omega in the government of her establishment and that it is by her conduct that its whole internal policy is regulated she is therefore a person of far more importance in a community than she usually thinks she is on her pattern her daughters model themselves by her counsels they are directed through her virtues all are honouredher children rise up and call her blessed her husband also and he praiseth her therefore let each mistress always remember her responsible position never approving a mean action nor speaking an unrefined word let her conduct be such that her inferiors may respect her and such as an honourable and rightminded man may look for in his wife and the mother of his children let her think of the many compliments and the sincere homage that have been paid to her sex by the greatest philosophers and writers both in ancient and modern times let her not forget that she has to show herself worthy of campbells compliment when he said the world was sad the garden was a wild and man the hermit sighd till woman smiled let her prove herself then the happy companion of man and able to take unto herself the praises of the pious prelate jeremy taylor who saysa good wife is heavens last best gift to manhis angel and minister of graces innumerablehis gem of

his head cherishing then in her breast the respected utterances of the good and the great let the mistress of every house rise to the responsibility of its management so that in doing her duty to all around her she may receive the genuine reward of respect love and affection notemany mistresses have experienced the horrors of househunting and it is well known that three removes are as good or bad rather as a fire nevertheless it being quite evident that we must in these days at least live in houses and are sometimes obliged to change our residences it is well to consider some of the conditions which will add to or diminish the convenience and comfort of our homes although the choice of a house must be dependent on so many different circumstances with different people that to give any specific directions on this head would be impossible and useless yet it will be advantageous perhaps to many if we point out some of those general features as to locality soil aspect c to which the attention of all housetakers should be carefully directed regarding the locality we may say speaking now more particularly of a town house that it is very important to the health and comfort of a family that the neighbourhood of all factories of any kind producing unwholesome effluvia or smells should be strictly avoided neither is it well to take a house in the immediate vicinity of where a noisy trade is carried on as it is unpleasant to the feelings and tends to increase any existing irritation of the system referring to soils it is held as a rule that a gravel soil is superior to any other as the rain drains through it very quickly and it is consequently drier and less damp than clay upon which water rests a far longer time a clay country too is not so pleasant for walking exercise as one in which gravel predominates the aspect of the house should be well considered and it should be borne in mind that the more sunlight that comes into the house the healthier is the habitation the close fetid smell which assails one on entering a narrow court or street in towns is to be assigned to the want of light and consequently air a house with a south or southwest aspect is lighter warmer drier and consequently more healthy than one facing the north or northeast great advances have been made during the last few years in the principles of sanitary knowledge and one most essential point to be observed in reference to a house is its drainage as it has been proved in an endless number of cases that bad or defective drainage is as certain to destroy health as the taking of poisons this arises from its injuriously affecting the atmosphere thus rendering the air we breathe unwholesome and deleterious let it be borne in mind then that unless a house is effectually drained the health of its inhabitants is sure to suffer and they will be susceptible of ague rheumatism diarrhoea fevers and cholera we now come to an allimportant pointthat of the water supply the value of this necessary article has also been lately more and more recognized in connection with the question of health and life and most houses are well supplied with every convenience connected with water let it however be well understood that no house however suitable in other respects can be desirable if this grand means of health and comfort is in the slightest degree scarce or impure no caution can be too great to see that it is pure and good as well as plentiful for knowing as we do that not a single part of our daily food is prepared without it the importance of its influence on the health of the inmates of a house cannot be overrated ventilation is another feature which must not be overlooked in a general way enough of air is admitted by the cracks round the doors and windows but if this be not the case the chimney will smoke and other plans such as the placing of a plate of finelyperforated zinc in the upper part of the window must be used cold air should never be admitted under the doors or at the bottom of a room unless it be close to the fire or stove for it will flow along the floor towards the fireplace and thus leave the foul air in the upper part of the room unpurified cooling at the same time unpleasantly and injuriously the feet and legs of the inmates the rent of a house it has been said should not exceed oneeighth of the whole income of its occupier and as a general rule we are disposed to assent to this estimate although there may be many circumstances which would not admit of its being considered infallible illustration chapter ii the housekeeper 55 as second in command in the house except in large establishments where there is a house steward the housekeeper must consider herself as the immediate representative of her mistress and bring to the management of the household all those qualities of honesty industry and vigilance in the same degree as if she were at the head of her own family constantly on the watch to detect any wrongdoing on the part of any of the domestics she will overlook all that goes on in the house and will see that every department is thoroughly attended to and that the servants are comfortable at the same time that their various duties are properly performed cleanliness punctuality order and method are essentials in the character of a good housekeeper without the first no household can be said to be well managed the second is equally allimportant for those who are under the housekeeper will take their cue from her and in the same proportion as punctuality governs her movements so will it theirs order again is indispensable for by it we wish to be understood that there should be a place for everything and everything in its place method too is most necessary for when the work is properly contrived and each part arranged in regular succession it will be done more quickly and more effectually 56 a necessary qualification for a housekeeper is that she should thoroughly understand accounts she will have to write in her books an accurate registry of all sums paid for any and every purpose all the current expenses of the house tradesmens bills and other extraneous matter as we have mentioned under the head of the mistress see 16 a housekeepers accounts should be periodically balanced and examined by the head of the house nothing tends more to the satisfaction of both employer and employed than this arrangement short reckonings make long friends stands good in this case as in others it will be found an excellent plan to take an account of every article which comes into the house connected with housekeeping and is not paid for at the time the book containing these entries can then be compared with the bills sent in by the various tradesmen so that any discrepancy can be inquired into and set right an intelligent housekeeper will by this means too be better able to judge of the average consumption of each article by the household and if that quantity be at any time exceeded the cause may be discovered and rectified if it proceed from waste or carelessness 57 although in the department of the cook the housekeeper does not generally much interfere yet it is necessary that she should possess a good knowledge of the culinary art as in many instances it may be requisite for her to take the superintendence of the kitchen as a rule it may be stated that the housekeeper in those establishments where there is no house steward or man cook undertakes the preparation of the confectionary attends to the preserving and pickling of fruits and vegetables and in a general way to the more difficult branches of the art of cookery much of these arrangements will depend however on the qualifications of the cook for instance if she be an able artiste there will be but little necessity for the housekeeper to interfere except in the already noticed articles of confectionary c on the contrary if the cook be not so clever an adept in her art then it will be requisite for the housekeeper to give more of her attention to the business of the kitchen than in the former case it will be one of the duties of the housekeeper to attend to the marketing in the absence of either a house steward or man cook 58 the daily duties of a housekeeper are regulated in a great measure by the extent of the establishment she superintends she should however rise early and see that all the domestics are duly performing their work and that everything is progressing satisfactorily for the preparation of the breakfast for the household and family after breakfast which in large establishments she will take in the housekeepers room with the ladysmaid butler and valet and where they will be waited on by the stillroom maid she will on various days set apart for each purpose carefully examine the household linen with a view to its being repaired or to a further quantity being put in hand to be made she will also see that the furniture throughout the house is well rubbed and polished and will besides attend to all the necessary details of marketing and ordering goods from the tradesmen the housekeepers room is generally made use of by the ladysmaid butler and valet who take there their breakfast tea and supper the ladysmaid will also use this apartment as a sittingroom when not engaged with her lady or with some other duties which would call her elsewhere in different establishments according to their size and the rank of the family different rules of course prevail for instance in the mansions of those of very high rank and where there is a house steward there are two distinct tables kept one in the stewards room for the principal members of the household the other in the servants hall for the other domestics at the stewards dinnertable the steward and housekeeper preside and here also are present the ladysmaid butler valet and head gardener should any visitors be staying with the family their servants generally the valet and ladysmaid will be admitted to the stewards table 59 after dinner the housekeeper having seen that all the members of the establishment have regularly returned to their various duties and that all the departments of the household are in proper working order will have many important matters claiming her attention she will possibly have to give the finishing touch to some article of confectionary or be occupied with some of the more elaborate processes of the stillroom there may also be the dessert to arrange icecreams to make and all these employments call for no ordinary degree of care taste and attention the stillroom was formerly much more in vogue than at present for in days of auld lang syne the still was in constant requisition for the supply of sweetflavoured waters for the purposes of cookery scents and aromatic substances used in the preparation of the toilet and cordials in cases of accidents and illness there are some establishments however in which distillation is still carried on and in these the stillroom maid has her old duties to perform in a general way however this domestic is immediately concerned with the housekeeper for the latter she lights the fire dusts her room prepares the breakfasttable and waits at the different meals taken in the housekeepers room see 58 a stillroom maid may learn a very great deal of useful knowledge from her intimate connection with the housekeeper and if she be active and intelligent may soon fit herself for a better position in the household 60 in the evening the housekeeper will often busy herself with the necessary preparations for the next days duties numberless small but still important arrangements will have to be made so that everything may move smoothly at times perhaps attention will have to be paid to the breaking of lumpsugar the stoning of raisins the washing cleansing and drying of currants c the evening too is the best time for setting right her account of the expenditure and duly writing a statement of moneys received and paid and also for making memoranda of any articles she may require for her storeroom or other departments periodically at some convenient timefor instance quarterly or halfyearly it is a good plan for the housekeeper to make an inventory of everything she has under her care and compare this with the lists of a former period she will then be able to furnish a statement if necessary of the articles which on account of time breakage loss or other causes it has been necessary to replace or replenish 61 in concluding these remarks on the duties of the housekeeper we will briefly refer to the very great responsibility which attaches to her position like caesars wife she should be above suspicion and her honesty and sobriety unquestionable for there are many temptations to which she is exposed in a physical point of view a housekeeper should be healthy and strong and be particularly clean in her person and her hands although they may show a degree of roughness from the nature of some of her employments yet should have a nice inviting appearance in her dealings with the various tradesmen and in her behaviour to the domestics under her the demeanour and conduct of the housekeeper should be such as in neither case to diminish by an undue familiarity her authority or influence noteit will be useful for the mistress and housekeeper to know the best seasons for various occupations connected with household management and we accordingly subjoin a few hints which we think will prove valuable as in the winter months servants have much more to do in consequence of the necessity there is to attend to the number of fires throughout the household not much more than the ordinary everyday work can be attempted in the summer and when the absence of fires gives the domestics more leisure then any extra work that is required can be more easily performed the spring is the usual period set apart for housecleaning and removing all the dust and dirt which will necessarily with the best of housewives accumulate during the winter months from the smoke of the coal oil gas c this season is also well adapted for washing and bleaching linen c as the weather not being then too hot for the exertions necessary in washing counterpanes blankets and heavy things in general the work is better and more easily done than in the intense heats of july which month some recommend for these purposes winter curtains should be taken down and replaced by the summer white ones and furs and woollen cloths also carefully laid by the former should be well shaken and brushed and then pinned upon paper or linen with camphor to preserve them from the moths furs c will be preserved in the same way included under the general description of housecleaning must be understood turning out all the nooks and corners of drawers cupboards lumberrooms lofts c with a view of getting rid of all unnecessary articles which only create dirt and attract vermin sweeping of chimneys taking up carpets painting and whitewashing the kitchen and offices papering rooms when needed and generally speaking the house putting on with the approaching summer a bright appearance and a new face in unison with nature oranges now should be preserved and orange wine made the summer will be found as we have mentioned above in consequence of the diminution of labour for the domestics the best period for examining and repairing household linen and for putting to rights all those articles which have received a large share of wear and tear during the dark winter days in direct reference to this matter we may here remark that sheets should be turned sides to middle before they are allowed to get very thin otherwise patching which is uneconomical from the time it consumes and is unsightly in point of appearance will have to be resorted to in june and july gooseberries currants raspberries strawberries and other summer fruits should be preserved and jams and jellies made in july too the making of walnut ketchup should be attended to as the green walnuts will be approaching perfection for this purpose mixed pickles may also be now made and it will be found a good plan to have ready a jar of picklejuice for the making of which all information will be given in future pages into which to put occasionally some young french beans cauliflowers c in the early autumn plums of various kinds are to be bottled and preserved and jams and jellies made a little later tomato sauce a most useful article to have by you may be prepared a supply of apples laid in if you have a place to keep them as also a few keeping pears and filberts endeavour to keep also a large vegetable marrowit will be found delicious in the winter in october and november it will be necessary to prepare for the cold weather and get ready the winter clothing for the various members of the family the white summer curtains will now be carefully put away the fireplaces grates and chimneys looked to and the house put in a thorough state of repair so that no loose tile may at a future day interfere with your comfort and extract something considerable from your pocket in december the principal household duty lies in preparing for the creature comforts of those near and dear to us so as to meet old christmas with a happy face a contented mind and a full larder and in stoning the plums washing the currants cutting the citron beating the eggs and mixing the pudding a housewife is not unworthily greeting the genial season of all good things illustration chapter iii arrangement and economy of the kitchen 62 the distribution of a kitchen says count rumford the celebrated philosopher and physician who wrote so learnedly on all subjects connected with domestic economy and architecture must always depend so much on local circumstances that general rules can hardly be given respecting it the principles however on which this distribution ought in all cases to be made are simple and easy to be understood and in his estimation these resolve themselves into symmetry of proportion in the building and convenience to the cook the requisites of a good kitchen however demand something more special than is here pointed out it must be remembered that it is the great laboratory of every household and that much of the weal or woe as far as regards bodily health depends upon the nature of the preparations concocted within its walls a good kitchen therefore should be erected with a view to the following particulars 1 convenience of distribution in its parts with largeness of dimension 2 excellence of light height of ceiling and good ventilation 3 easiness of access without passing through the house 4 sufficiently remote from the principal apartments of the house that the members visitors or guests of the family may not perceive the odour incident to cooking or hear the noise of culinary operations 5 plenty of fuel and water which with the scullery pantry and storeroom should be so near it as to offer the smallest possible trouble in reaching them illustration fig 1 the kitchens of the middle ages in england are said to have been constructed after the fashion of those of the romans they were generally octagonal with several fireplaces but no chimneys neither was there any wood admitted into the building the accompanying cut fig 1 represents the turret which was erected on the top of the conical roof of the kitchen at glastonbury abbey and which was perforated with holes to allow the smoke of the fire as well as the steam from cooking to escape some kitchens had funnels or vents below the eaves to let out the steam which was sometimes considerable as the anglosaxons used their meat chiefly in a boiled state from this circumstance some of their large kitchens had four ranges comprising a boilingplace for small boiled meats and a boilinghouse for the great boiler in private houses the culinary arrangements were no doubt different for du cange mentions a little kitchen with a chamber even in a solarium or upper floor 63 the simplicity of the primitive ages has frequently been an object of poetical admiration and it delights the imagination to picture men living upon such fruits as spring spontaneously from the earth and desiring no other beverages to slake their thirst but such as fountains and rivers supply thus we are told that the ancient inhabitants of argos lived principally on pears that the arcadians revelled in acorns and the athenians in figs this of course was in the golden age before ploughing began and when mankind enjoyed all kinds of plenty without having to earn their bread by the sweat of their brow this delightful period however could not last for ever and the earth became barren and continued unfruitful till ceres came and taught the art of sowing with several other useful inventions the first whom she taught to till the ground was triptolemus who communicated his instructions to his countrymen the athenians thence the art was carried into achaia and thence into arcadia barley was the first grain that was used and the invention of breadmaking is ascribed to pan the use of fire as an instrument of cookery must have been coeval with this invention of bread which being the most necessary of all kinds of food was frequently used in a sense so comprehensive as to include both meat and drink it was by the greeks baked under the ashes 64 in the primary ages it was deemed unlawful to eat flesh and when mankind began to depart from their primitive habits the flesh of swine was the first that was eaten for several ages it was pronounced unlawful to slaughter oxen from an estimate of their great value in assisting men to cultivate the ground nor was it usual to kill young animals from a sentiment which considered it cruel to take away the life of those that had scarcely tasted the joys of existence at this period no cooks were kept and we know from homer that his ancient heroes prepared and dressed their victuals with their own hands ulysses for example we are told like a modern charwoman excelled at lighting a fire whilst achilles was an adept at turning a spit subsequently heralds employed in civil and military affairs filled the office of cooks and managed marriage feasts but this no doubt was after mankind had advanced in the art of living a step further than roasting which in all places was the ancient manner of dressing meat 65 the age of roasting we may consider as that in which the use of the metals would be introduced as adjuncts to the culinary art and amongst these iron the most useful of them all would necessarily take a prominent place this metal is easily oxidized but to bring it to a state of fusibility it requires a most intense heat of all the metals it is the widest diffused and most abundant and few stones or mineral bodies are without an admixture of it it possesses the valuable property of being welded by hammering and hence its adaptation to the numerous purposes of civilized life metallic grains of iron have been found in strawberries and a twelfth of the weight of the wood of dried oak is said to consist of this metal blood owes its colour of redness to the quantity of iron it contains and rain and snow are seldom perfectly free from it in the arts it is employed in three statesas cast iron wrought iron and steel in each of these it largely enters into the domestic economy and stoves grates and the general implements of cookery are usually composed of it in antiquity its employment was comparatively speaking equally universal the excavations made at pompeii have proved this the accompanying cuts present us with specimens of stoves both ancient and modern fig 2 is the remains of a kitchen stove found in the house of pansa at pompeii and would seem in its perfect state not to have been materially different from such as are in use at the present day fig 3 is a selfacting simple open range in modern use and may be had of two qualities ranging according to their dimensions from 3 10s and 3 18s respectively up to 4 10s and 7 5s they are completely fitted up with oven boiler sliding cheek wroughtiron bars revolving shelves and brass tap fig 4 is called the improved leamington kitchener and is said to surpass any other range in use for easy cooking by one fire it has a hot plate which is well calculated for an ironingstove and on which as many vessels as will stand upon it may be kept boiling without being either soiled or injured besides it has a perfectly ventilated and spacious wroughtiron roaster with movable shelves drawout stand double drippingpan and meatstand the roaster can be converted into an oven by closing the valves when bread and pastry can be baked in it in a superior manner it also has a large iron boiler with brass tap and steampipe round and square gridirons for chops and steaks ashpan open fire for roasting and a set of ornamental covings with platewarmer attached it took a firstclass prize and medal in the great exhibition of 1851 and was also exhibited with all the recent improvements at the dublin exhibition in 1853 fig 5 is another kitchener adapted for large families it has on the one side a large ventilated oven and on the other the fire and roaster the hot plate is over all and there is a back boiler made of wrought iron with brass tap and steampipe in other respects it resembles fig 4 with which it possesses similar advantages of construction either maybe had at varying prices according to size from 5 15s up to 23 10s they are supplied by messrs richard john slack 336 strand london illustration fig 2 illustration fig 3 illustration fig 4 illustration fig 5 66 from kitchen ranges to the implements used in cookery is but a step with these every kitchen should be well supplied otherwise the cook must not be expected to perform her office in a satisfactory manner of the culinary utensils of the ancients our knowledge is very limited but as the art of living in every civilized country is pretty much the same the instruments for cooking must in a great degree bear a striking resemblance to each other on referring to classical antiquities we find mentioned among household utensils leather bags baskets constructed of twigs reeds and rushes boxes basins and bellows breadmoulds brooms and brushes caldrons colanders cisterns and chafingdishes cheeserasps knives and ovens of the dutch kind funnels and fryingpans handmills soupladles milkpails and oiljars presses scales and sieves spits of different sizes but some of them large enough to roast an ox spoons firetongs trays trenchers and drinkingvessels with others for carrying food preserving milk and holding cheese this enumeration if it does nothing else will to some extent indicate the state of the simpler kinds of mechanical arts among the ancients illustration fig 6 illustration fig 7 illustration fig 8 in so far as regards the shape and construction of many of the kitchen utensils enumerated above they bore a great resemblance to our own this will be seen by the accompanying cuts fig 6 is an ancient stockpot in bronze which seems to have been made to hang over the fire and was found in the buried city of pompeii fig 7 is one of modern make and may be obtained either of copper or wrought iron tinned inside fig 8 is another of antiquity with a large ladle and colander with holes attached it is taken from the column of trajan the modern ones can be obtained at all prices according to size from 13s 6d up to 1 1s 67 in the manufacture of these utensils bronze metal seems to have been much in favour with the ancients it was chosen not only for their domestic vessels but it was also much used for their public sculptures and medals it is a compound composed of from six to twelve parts of tin to one hundred of copper it gives its name to figures and all pieces of sculpture made of it brass was another favourite metal which is composed of copper and zinc it is more fusible than copper and not so apt to tarnish in a pure state it is not malleable unless when hot and after it has been melted twice it will not bear the hammer to render it capable of being wrought it requires 7 lb of lead to be put to 1 cwt of its own material the corinthian brass of antiquity was a mixture of silver gold and copper a fine kind of brass supposed to be made by the cementation of copper plates with calamine is in germany hammered out into leaves and is called dutch metal in this country it is employed in the same way as gold leaf brass is much used for watchworks as well as for wire 68 the braziers ladles stewpans saucepans gridirons and colanders of antiquity might generally pass for those of the english manufacture of the present day in so far as shape is concerned in proof of this we have placed together the following similar articles of ancient and modern pattern in order that the reader may at a single view see wherein any difference that is between them consists illustration fig 9 modern illustration fig 10 ancient illustration fig 11 modern illustration fig 12 ancient

representations of a cornucopia a satyr a goat pigs and other animals any display of taste in the adornment of such utensils might seem to be useless but when we remember how much more natural it is for us all to be careful of the beautiful and costly than of the plain and cheap it may even become a question in the economy of a kitchen whether it would not in the long run be cheaper to have articles which displayed some tasteful ingenuity in their manufacture than such as are so perfectly plain as to have no attractions whatever beyond their mere suitableness to the purposes for which they are made figs 13 and 14 are saucepans the ancient one being of bronze originally copied from the cabinet of m labb charlet and engraved in the antiquities of montfaucon figs 15 and 17 are gridirons and 16 and 18 drippingpans in all these utensils the resemblance between such as were in use 2000 years ago and those in use at the present day is strikingly manifest 69 some of the ancient utensils represented in the above cuts are copied from those found amid the ruins of herculaneum and pompeii these roman cities were in the first century buried beneath the lava of an eruption of vesuvius and continued to be lost to the world till the beginning of the last century when a peasant in digging for a well gradually discovered a small temple with some statues little notice however was taken of this circumstance till 1736 when the king of naples desiring to erect a palace at portici caused extensive excavations to be made when the city of herculaneum was slowly unfolded to view pompeii was discovered about 1750 and being easier cleared from the lava in which it had so long been entombed disclosed itself as it existed immediately before the catastrophe which overwhelmed it nearly two thousand years ago it presented to the modern world the perfect picture of the form and structure of an ancient roman city the interior of its habitations shops baths theatres and temples were all disclosed with many of the implements used by the workmen in their various trades and the materials on which they were employed when the doomed city was covered with the lavian stream 70 amongst the most essential requirements of the kitchen are scales or weighingmachines for family use these are found to have existed among the ancients and must at a very early age have been both publicly and privately employed for the regulation of quantities the modern english weights were adjusted by the 27th chapter of magna charta or the great charter forced by the barons from king john at runnymede in surrey therein it is declared that the weights all over england shall be the same although for different commodities there were two different kinds troy and avoirdupois the origin of both is taken from a grain of wheat gathered in the middle of an ear the standard of measures was originally kept at winchester and by a law of king edgar was ordained to be observed throughout the kingdom illustration fig 19 illustration fig 20 fig 19 is an ancient pair of common scales with two basins and a movable weight which is made in the form of a head covered with the pileus because mercury had the weights and measures under his superintendence it is engraved on a stone in the gallery of florence fig 20 represents a modern weighingmachine of great convenience and generally in use in those establishments where a great deal of cooking is carried on 71 accompanying the scales or weighingmachines there should be spiceboxes and sugar and biscuitcanisters of either white or japanned tin the covers of these should fit tightly in order to exclude the air and if necessary be lettered in front to distinguish them the white metal of which they are usually composed loses its colour when exposed to the air but undergoes no further change it enters largely into the composition of culinary utensils many of them being entirely composed of tinned sheetiron the inside of copper and iron vessels also being usually what is called tinned this art consists of covering any metal with a thin coating of tin and it requires the metal to be covered to be perfectly clean and free from rust and also that the tin itself be purely metallic and entirely cleared from all ashes or refuse copper boilers saucepans and other kitchen utensils are tinned after they are manufactured by being first made hot and the tin rubbed on with resin in this process nothing ought to be used but pure graintin lead however is sometimes mixed with that metal not only to make it lie more easily but to adulterate ita pernicious practice which in every article connected with the cooking and preparation of food cannot be too severely reprobatedthe following list supplied by messrs richard john slack

generally but more especially to that of the saucepans stewpans and boilers inside they should be kept perfectly clean and where an open fire is used the outside as clean as possible with a leamington range saucepans stewpans c can be kept entirely free from smoke and soot on the outside which is an immense saving of labour to the cook or scullerymaid care should be taken that the lids fit tight and close so that soups or gravies may not be suffered to waste by evaporation they should be made to keep the steam in and the smoke out and should always be bright on the upper rim where they do not immediately come in contact with the fire souppots and kettles should be washed immediately after being used and dried before the fire and they should be kept in a dry place in order that they may escape the deteriorating influence of rust and thereby be destroyed copper utensils should never be used in the kitchen unless tinned and the utmost care should be taken not to let the tin be rubbed off if by chance this should occur have it replaced before the vessel is again brought into use neither soup nor gravy should at any time be suffered to remain in them longer than is absolutely necessary as any fat or acid that is in them may affect the metal so as to impregnate with poison what is intended to be eaten stone and earthenware vessels should be provided for soups and gravies not intended for immediate use and also plenty of common dishes for the larder that the tableset may not be used for such purposes it is the nature of vegetables soon to turn sour when they are apt to corrode glazed redware and even metals and frequently thereby to become impregnated with poisonous particles the vinegar also in pickles by its acidity does the same consideration therefore should be given to these facts and great care also taken that all sieves jellybags and tapes for collared articles be well scalded and kept dry or they will impart an unpleasant flavour when next used to all these directions the cook should pay great attention nor should they by any means be neglected by the mistress of the household who ought to remember that cleanliness in the kitchen gives health and happiness to home whilst economy will immeasurably assist in preserving them 73 without fuel a kitchen might be pronounced to be of little use therefore to discover and invent materials for supplying us with the means of domestic heat and comfort has exercised the ingenuity of man those now known have been divided into five classes the first comprehending the fluid inflammable bodies the second peat or turf the third charcoal of wood the fourth pitcoal charred and the fifth wood or pitcoal in a crude state with the capacity of yielding a copious and bright flame the first may be said seldom to be employed for the purposes of cookery but peat especially amongst rural populations has in all ages been regarded as an excellent fuel it is one of the most important productions of an alluvial soil and belongs to the vegetable rather than the mineral kingdom it may be described as composed of wet spongy black earth held together by decayed vegetables formerly it covered extensive tracts in england but has greatly disappeared before the genius of agricultural improvement charcoal is a kind of artificial coal used principally where a strong and clear fire is desired it is a black brittle insoluble inodorous tasteless substance and when newlymade possesses the remarkable property of absorbing certain quantities of the different gases its dust when used as a polishing powder gives great brilliancy to metals it consists of wood halfburned and is manufactured by cutting pieces of timber into nearly the same size then disposing them in heaps and covering them with earth so as to prevent communication with the air except when necessary to make them burn when they have been sufficiently charred the fire is extinguished by stopping the vents through which the air is admitted of coal there are various species as pit culm slate cannel kilkenny sulphurous bovey jet c these have all their specific differences and are employed for various purposes but are all more or less used as fuel the use of coal for burning purposes was not known to the romans in britain it was discovered about fifty years before the birth of christ in lancashire not tar from where manchester now stands but for ages after its discovery so long as forests abounded wood continued to be the fuel used for firing the first public notice of coal is in the reign of henry iii who in 1272 granted a charter to the town of newcastle permitting the inhabitants to dig for coal it took some centuries more however to bring it into common use as this did not take place till about the first quarter of the seventeenth century in the time of charles i a few years after the restoration we find that about 200000 chaldrons were consumed in london although several countries possess mines of coal the quality of their mineral is in general greatly inferior to that of great britain where it is found mostly in undulating districts abounding with valleys and interspersed with plains of considerable extent it lies usually between the strata of other substances and rarely in an horizontal position but with a dip or inclination to one side our cut fig 21 represents a section of coal as it is found in the stratum illustration fig 21 74 to be acquainted with the periods when things are in season is one of the most essential pieces of knowledge which enter into the art of cookery we have therefore compiled the

preserved with a view to its being suitably dressed more waste is often occasioned by the want of judgment or of necessary care in this particular than by any other cause in the absence of proper places for keeping provisions a hanging safe suspended in an airy situation is the best substitute a wellventilated larder dry and shady is better for meat and poultry which require to be kept for some time and the utmost skill in the culinary art will not compensate for the want of proper attention to this particular though it is advisable that annual food should be hung up in the open air till its fibres have lost some degree of their toughness yet if it is kept till it loses its natural sweetness its flavour has become deteriorated and as a wholesome comestible it has lost many of its qualities conducive to health as soon therefore as the slightest trace of putrescence is detected it has reached its highest degree of tenderness and should be dressed immediately during the sultry summer months it is difficult to procure meat that is not either tough or tainted it should therefore be well examined when it comes in and if flies have touched it the part must be cut off and the remainder well washed in very cold weather meat and vegetables touched by the frost should be brought into the kitchen early in the morning and soaked in cold water in loins of meat the long pipe that runs by the bone should be taken out as it is apt to taint as also the kernels of beef rumps and edgebones of beef when bruised should not be purchased all these things ought to enter into the consideration of every household manager and great care should be taken that nothing is thrown away or suffered to be wasted in the kitchen which might by proper management be turned to a good account the shankbones of mutton so little esteemed in general give richness to soups or gravies if well soaked and brushed before they are added to the boiling they are also particularly nourishing for sick persons roastbeef bones or shankbones of ham make excellent stock for peasoupwhen the whites of eggs are used for jelly confectionary or other purposes a pudding or a custard should be made that the yolks may be used all things likely to be wanted should be in readiness sugars of different sorts currants washed picked and perfectly dry spices pounded and kept in very small bottles closely corked or in canisters as we have already directed 72 not more of these should be purchased at a time than are likely to be used in the course of a month much waste is always prevented by keeping every article in the place best suited to it vegetables keep best on a stone floor if the air be excluded meat in a cold dry place as also salt sugar sweetmeats candles dried meats and hams rice and all sorts of seed for puddings should be closely covered to preserve them from insects but even this will not prevent them from being affected by these destroyers if they are long and carelessly kept illustration chapter iv introduction to cookery 76 as in the fine arts the progress of mankind from barbarism to civilization is marked by a gradual succession of triumphs over the rude materialities of nature so in the art of cookery is the progress gradual from the earliest and simplest modes to those of the most complicated and refined plain or rudelycarved stones tumuli or mounds of earth are the monuments by which barbarous tribes denote the events of their history to be succeeded only in the long course of a series of ages by beautifullyproportioned columns gracefullysculptured statues triumphal arches coins medals and the higher efforts of the pencil and the pen as man advances by culture and observation to the perfection of his facilities so is it with the art of cookery man in his primitive state lives upon roots and the fruits of the earth until by degrees he is driven to seek for new means by which his wants may be supplied and enlarged he then becomes a hunter and a fisher as his species increases greater necessities come upon him when he gradually abandons the roving life of the savage for the more stationary pursuits of the herdsman these beget still more settled habits when he begins the practice of agriculture forms ideas of the rights of property and has his own both defined and secured the forest the stream and the sea are now no longer his only resources for food he sows and he reaps pastures and breeds cattle lives on the cultivated produce of his fields and revels in the luxuries of the dairy raises flocks for clothing and assumes to all intents and purposes the habits of permanent life and the comfortable condition of a farmer this is the fourth stage of social progress up to which the useful or mechanical arts have been incidentally developing themselves when trade and commerce begin through these various phases only to live has been the great object of mankind but byandby comforts are multiplied and accumulating riches create new wants the object then is not only to live but to live economically agreeably tastefully and well accordingly the art of cookery commences and although the fruits of the earth the fowls of the air the beasts of the field and the fish of the sea are still the only food of mankind yet these are so prepared improved and dressed by skill and ingenuity that they are the means of immeasurably extending the boundaries of human enjoyments everything that is edible and passes under the hands of the cook is more or less changed and assumes new forms hence the influence of that functionary is immense upon the happiness of a household 77 in order that the duties of the cook may be properly performed and that he may be able to reproduce esteemed dishes with certainty all terms of indecision should be banished from his art accordingly what is known only to him will in these pages be made known to others in them all those indecisive terms expressed by a bit of this some of that a small piece of that and a handful of the other shall never be made use of but all quantities be precisely and explicitly stated with a desire also that all ignorance on this most essential part of the culinary art should disappear and that a uniform system of weights and measures should be adopted we give an account of the weights which answer to certain measures a tablespoonful is frequently mentioned in a recipe in the prescriptions of medical men and also in medical chemical and gastronomical works by it is generally meant and understood a measure or bulk equal to that which would be produced by half an ounce of water a dessertspoonful is the half of a tablespoonful that is to say by it is meant a measure or bulk equal to a quarter of an ounce of water a teaspoonful is equal in quantity to a drachm of water a dropthis is the name of a vague kind of measure and is so called on account of the liquid being dropped from the mouth of a bottle its quantity however will vary either from the consistency of the liquid or the size and shape of the mouth of the bottle the college of physicians determined the quantity of a drop to be one grain 60 drops making one fluid drachm their drop or sixtieth part of a fluid drachm is called a minim illustration fig 22 graduated class measures can be obtained at any chemists and they save much trouble one of these containing a wine pint is divided into 16 oz and the oz into 8 drachms of water by which any certain weight mentioned in a recipe can be accurately measured out homemade measures of this kind can readily be formed by weighing the water contained in any given measure and marking on any tall glass the space it occupies this mark can easily be made with a file it will be interesting to many readers to know the basis on which the french found their system of weights and measures for it certainly possesses the grandeur of simplicity the metre which is the basis of the whole system of french weights and measures is the exact measurement of one fortymillionth part of a meridian of the earth 78 excellence in the art of cookery as in all other things is only attainable by practice and experience in proportion therefore to the opportunities which a cook has had of these so will be his excellence in the art it is in the large establishments of princes noblemen and very affluent families alone that the man cook is found in this country he also superintends the kitchens of large hotels clubs and public institutions where he usually makes out the bills of fare which are generally submitted to the principal for approval to be able to do this therefore it is absolutely necessary that he should be a judge of the season of every dish as well as know perfectly the state of every article he undertakes to prepare he must also be a judge of every article he buys for no skill however great it may be will enable him to make that good which is really bad on him rests the responsibility of the cooking generally whilst a speciality of his department is to prepare the rich soups stews ragouts and such dishes as enter into the more refined and complicated portions of his art and such as are not usually understood by ordinary professors he therefore holds a high position in a household being inferior in rank as already shown 21 only to the house steward the valet and the butler in the luxurious ages of grecian antiquity sicilian cooks were the most esteemed and received high rewards for their services among them one called trimalcio was such an adept in his art that he could impart to common fish both the form and flavour of the most esteemed of the piscatory tribes a chief cook in the palmy days of roman voluptuousness had about 800 a year and antony rewarded the one that cooked the supper which pleased cleopatra with the present of a city with the fall of the empire the culinary art sank into less consideration in the middle ages cooks laboured to acquire a reputation for their sauces which they composed of strange combinations for the sake of novelty as well as singularity 79 the duties of the cook the kitchen and the scullery maids are so intimately associated that they can hardly be treated of separately the cook however is at the head of the kitchen and in proportion to her possession of the qualities of cleanliness neatness order regularity and celerity of action so will her influence appear in the conduct of those who are under her as it is upon her that the whole responsibility of the business of the kitchen rests whilst the others must lend her both a ready and a willing assistance and be especially tidy in their appearance and active in their movements in the larger establishments of the middle ages cooks with the authority of feudal chiefs gave their orders from a high chair in which they ensconced themselves and commanded a view of all that was going on throughout their several domains each held a long wooden spoon with which he tasted without leaving his seat the various comestibles that were cooking on the stoves and which he frequently used as a rod of punishment on the backs of those whose idleness and gluttony too largely predominated over their diligence and temperance 80 if as we have said 3 the quality of early rising be of the first importance to the mistress what must it be to the servant let it therefore be taken as a longproved truism that without it in every domestic the effect of all things else so far as work is concerned may in a great measure be neutralized in a cook this quality is most essential for an hour lost in the morning will keep her toiling absolutely toiling all day to overtake that which might otherwise have been achieved with ease in large establishments six is a good hour to rise in the summer and seven in the winter 81 her first duty in large establishments and where it is requisite should be to set her dough for the breakfast rolls provided this has not been done on the previous night and then to engage herself with those numerous little preliminary occupations which may not inappropriately be termed laying out her duties for the day this will bring in the breakfast hour of eight after which directions must be given and preparations made for the different dinners of the household and family 82 in those numerous households where a cook and housemaid are only kept the general custom is that the cook should have the charge of the diningroom the hall the lamps and the doorstep are also committed to her care and any other work there may be on the outside of the house in establishments of this kind the cook will after having lighted her kitchen fire carefully brushed the range and cleaned the hearth proceed to prepare for breakfast she will thoroughly rinse the kettle and filling it with fresh water will put it on the fire to boil she will then go to the breakfastroom or parlour and there make all things ready for the breakfast of the family her attention will next be directed to the hall which she will sweep and wipe the kitchen stairs if there be any will now be swept and the hall mats which have been removed and shaken will be again put in their places the cleaning of the kitchen pantry passages and kitchen stairs must always be over before breakfast so that it may not interfere with the other business of the day everything should be ready and the whole house should wear a comfortable aspect when the heads of the house and members of the family make their appearance nothing it may be depended on will so please the mistress of an establishment as to notice that although she has not been present to see that the work was done attention to smaller matters has been carefully paid with a view to giving her satisfaction and increasing her comfort 83 by the time that the cook has performed the duties mentioned above and well swept brushed and dusted her kitchen the breakfastbell will most likely summon her to the parlour to bring in the breakfast it is the cooks department generally in the smaller establishments to wait at breakfast as the housemaid by this time has gone upstairs into the bedrooms and has there applied herself to her various duties the cook usually answers the bells and single knocks at the door in the early part of the morning as the tradesmen with whom it is her more special business to speak call at these hours 84 it is in her preparation of the dinner that the cook begins to feel the weight and responsibility of her situation as she must take upon herself all the dressing and the serving of the principal dishes which her skill and ingenuity have mostly prepared whilst these however are cooking she must be busy with her pastry soups gravies ragouts c stock or what the french call consomm being the basis of most made dishes must be always at hand in conjunction with her sweet herbs and spices for seasoning a place for everything and everything in its place must be her rule in order that time may not be wasted in looking for things when they are wanted and in order that the whole apparatus of cooking may move with the regularity and precision of a welladjusted machineall must go on simultaneously the vegetables and sauces must be ready with the dishes they are to accompany and in order that they may be suitable the smallest oversight must not be made in their preparation when the dinnerhour has arrived it is the duty of the cook to dishup such dishes as may without injury stand for some time covered on the hot plate or in the hot closet but such as are of a more important or recherch kind must be delayed until the order to serve is given from the drawingroom then comes haste but there must be no hurryall must work with order the cook takes charge of the fish soups and poultry and the kitchenmaid of the vegetables sauces and gravies these she puts into their appropriate dishes whilst the scullerymaid waits on and assists the cook everything must be timed so as to prevent its getting cold whilst great care should be taken that between the first and second courses no more time is allowed to elapse than is necessary for fear that the company in the diningroom lose all relish for what has yet to come of the dinner when the dinner has been served the most important feature in the daily life of the cook is at an end she must however now begin to look to the contents of her larder taking care to keep everything sweet and clean so that no disagreeable smells may arise from the gravies milk or meat that may be there these are the principal duties of a cook in a firstrate establishment in smaller establishments the housekeeper often conducts the higher department of cooking see 58 59 60 and the cook with the assistance of a scullerymaid performs some of the subordinate duties of the kitchenmaid when circumstances render it necessary the cook engages to perform the whole of the work of the kitchen and in some places a portion of the housework also 85 whilst the cook is engaged with her morning duties the kitchenmaid is also occupied with hers her first duty after the fire is lighted is to sweep and clean the kitchen and the various offices belonging to it this she does every morning besides cleaning the stone steps at the entrance of the house the halls the passages and the stairs which lead to the kitchen her general duties besides these are to wash and scour all these places twice a week with the tables shelves and cupboards she has also to dress the nursery and servantshall dinners to prepare all fish poultry and vegetables trim meat joints and cutlets and do all such duties as may be considered to enter into the cooks department in a subordinate degree 86 the duties of the scullerymaid are to assist the cook to keep the scullery clean and all the metallic as well as earthenware kitchen utensils the position of scullerymaid is not of course one of high rank nor is the payment for her services large but if she be fortunate enough to have over her a good kitchenmaid and clever cook she may very soon learn to perform various little duties connected with cooking operations which may be of considerable service in fitting her for a more responsible place now it will be doubtless thought by the majority of our readers that the fascinations connected with the position of the scullerymaid are not so great as to induce many people to leave a comfortable home in order to work in a scullery but we are acquainted with one instance in which the desire on the part of a young girl was so strong to become connected with the kitchen and cookery that she absolutely left her parents and engaged herself as a scullerymaid in a gentlemans house here she showed herself so active and intelligent that she very quickly rose to the rank of kitchenmaid and from this so great was her gastronomical genius she became in a short space of time one of the best womencooks in england after this we think it must be allowed that a cook like a poet nascitur non fit 87 modern cookery stands so greatly indebted to the gastronomic propensities of our french neighbours that many of their terms are adopted and applied by english artists to the same as well as similar preparations of their own a vocabulary of these is therefore indispensable in a work of this kind accordingly the following will be found sufficiently complete for all ordinary purposes explanation of french terms used in modern household cookery aspica savoury jelly used as an exterior moulding for cold game poultry fish c this being of a transparent nature allows the bird

veal form the basis of all good soups therefore it is advisable to procure those pieces which afford the richest succulence and such as are freshkilled stale meat renders them bad and fat is not so well adapted for making them the principal art in composing good rich soup is so to proportion the several ingredients that the flavour of one shall not predominate over another and that all the articles of which it is composed shall form an agreeable whole to accomplish this care must be taken that the roots and herbs are perfectly well cleaned and that the water is proportioned to the quantity of meat and other ingredients generally a quart of water may be allowed to a pound of meat for soups and half the quantity for gravies in making soups or gravies gentle stewing or simmering is incomparably the best it may be remarked however that a really good soup can never be made but in a wellclosed vessel although perhaps greater wholesomeness is obtained by an occasional exposure to the air soups will in general take from three to six hours doing and are much better prepared the day before they are wanted when the soup is cold the fat may be much more easily and completely removed and when it is poured off care must be taken not to disturb the settlings at the bottom of the vessel which are so fine that they will escape through a sieve a tamis is the best strainer and if the soup is strained while it is hot let the tamis or cloth be previously soaked in cold water clear soups must be perfectly transparent and thickened soups about the consistence of cream to thicken and give body to soups and gravies potatomucilage arrowroot breadraspings isinglass flour and butter barley rice or oatmeal in a little water rubbed well together are used a piece of boiled beef pounded to a pulp with a bit of butter and flour and rubbed through a sieve and gradually incorporated with the soup will be found an excellent addition when the soup appears to be too thin or too weak the cover of the boiler should be taken off and the contents allowed to boil till some of the watery parts have evaporated or some of the thickening materials above mentioned should be added when soups and gravies are kept from day to day in hot weather they should be warmed up every day and put into fresh scalded pans or tureens and placed in a cool cellar in temperate weather every other day may be sufficient 89 various herbs and vegetables are required for the purpose of making soups and gravies of these the principal arescotch barley pearl barley wheat flour oatmeal breadraspings pease beans rice vermicelli macaroni isinglass potatomucilage mushroom or mushroom ketchup champignons parsnips carrots beetroot turnips garlic shalots and onions sliced onions fried

proportions are with other ingredients manipulated into an almost endless variety of excellent soups and gravies soups which are intended to constitute the principal part of a meal certainly ought not to be flavoured like sauces which are only designed to give a relish to some particular dish soup broth and bouillon 91 it has been asserted that english cookery is nationally speaking far from being the best in the world more than this we have been frequently told by brilliant foreign writers half philosophers half chefs that we are the worst cooks on the face of the earth and that the proverb which alludes to the divine origin of food and the precisely opposite origin of its preparers is peculiarly applicable to us islanders not however to the inhabitants of the whole island for it is stated in a work which treats of culinary operations north of the tweed that the broth of scotland claims for excellence and wholesomeness a very close second place to the bouillon or common soup of france three hot meals of broth and meat for about the price of one roasting joint our scottish brothers and sisters get they say and we hasten to assent to what we think is now a very wellascertained fact we are glad to note however that soups of vegetables fish meat and game are now very frequently found in the homes of the english middle classes as well as in the mansions of the wealthier and more aristocratic and we take this to be one evidence that we are on the right road to an improvement in our system of cookery one great cause of many of the spoilt dishes and badlycooked meats which are brought to our tables arises we think and most will agree with us from a nonacquaintance with common everyday things entertaining this view we intend to preface the chapters of this work with a simple scientific rsum of all those causes and circumstances which relate to the food we have to prepare and the theory and chemistry of the various culinary operations accordingly this is the proper place to treat of the quality of the flesh of animals and describe some of the circumstances which influence it for good or bad we will therefore commence with the circumstance of age and examine how far this affects the quality of meat 92 during the period between the birth and maturity of animals their flesh undergoes very considerable changes for instance when the animal is young the fluids which the tissues of the muscles contain possess a large proportion of what is called albumen this albumen which is also the chief component of the white of eggs possesses the peculiarity of coagulating or hardening at a certain temperature like the white of a boiled egg into a soft white fluid no longer soluble or capable of being dissolved in water as animals grow older this peculiar animal matter gradually decreases in proportion to the other constituents of the juice of the flesh thus the reason why veal lamb and young pork are white and without gravy when cooked is that the large quantity of albumen they contain hardens or becomes coagulated on the other hand the reason why beef and mutton are brown and have gravy is that the proportion of albumen they contain is small in comparison with their greater quantity of fluid which is soluble and not coagulable 93 the quality of the flesh of an animal is considerably influenced by the nature of the food on which it has been fed for the food supplies the material which produces the flesh if the food be not suitable and good the meat cannot be good either just as the paper on which these words are printed could not be good if the rags from which it is made were not of a fine quality to the experienced in this matter it is well known that the flesh of animals fed on farinaceous produce such as corn pulse c is firm wellflavoured and also economical in the cooking that the flesh of those fed on succulent and pulpy substances such as roots possesses these qualities in a somewhat less degree whilst the flesh of those whose food contains fixed oil as linseed is greasy high coloured and gross in the fat and if the food has been used in large quantities possessed of a rank flavour 94 it is indispensable to the good quality of meat that the animal should be perfectly healthy at the time of its slaughter however slight the disease in an animal may be inferiority in the quality of its flesh as food is certain to be produced in most cases indeed as the flesh of diseased animals has a tendency to very rapid putrefaction it becomes not only unwholesome but absolutely poisonous on account of the absorption of the virus of the unsound meat into the systems of those who partake of it the external indications of good and bad meat will be described under its own particular head but we may here premise that the layer of all wholesome meat when freshly killed adheres firmly to the bone 95 another circumstance greatly affecting the quality of meat is the animals treatment before it is slaughtered this influences its value and wholesomeness in no inconsiderable degree it will be easy to understand this when we reflect on those leading principles by which the life of an animal is supported and maintained these are the digestion of its food and the assimilation of that food into its substance nature in effecting this process first reduces the food in the stomach to a state of pulp under the name of chyme which passes into the intestines and is there divided into two principles each distinct from the other one a milkwhite fluidthe nutritive portionis absorbed by innumerable vessels which open upon the mucous membrane or inner coat of the intestines these vessels or absorbents discharge the fluid into a common duct or road along which it is conveyed to the large veins in the neighbourhood of the heart here it is mixed with the venous blood which is black and impure returning from every part of the body and then it supplies the waste which is occasioned in the circulating stream by the arterial or pure blood having furnished matter for the substance of the animal the blood of the animal having completed its course through all parts and having had its waste recruited by the digested food is now received into the heart and by the action of that organ it is urged through the lungs there to receive its purification from the air which the animal inhales again returning to the heart it is forced through the arteries and thence distributed by innumerable ramifications called capillaries bestowing to every part of the animal life and nutriment the other principlethe innutritive portionpasses from the intestines and is thus got rid of it will now be readily understood how flesh is affected for bad if an animal is slaughtered when the circulation of its blood has been increased by overdriving illusage or other causes of excitement to such a degree of rapidity as to be too great for the capillaries to perform their functions and causing the blood to be congealed in its minuter vessels where this has been the case the meat will be darkcoloured and become rapidly putrid so that selfinterest and humanity alike dictate kind and gentle treatment of all animals destined to serve as food for man the chemistry and economy of soupmaking 96 stock being the basis of all meat soups and also of all the principal sauces it is essential to the success of these culinary operations to know the most complete and economical method of extracting from a certain quantity of meat the best possible stock or broth the theory and philosophy of this process we will therefore explain and then proceed to show the practical course to be adopted 97 as all meat is principally composed of fibres fat gelatine osmazome and albumen it is requisite to know that the fibres are inseparable constituting almost all that remains of the meat after it has undergone a long boiling 98 fat is dissolved by boiling but as it is contained in cells covered by a very fine membrane which never dissolves a portion of it always adheres to the fibres the other portion rises to the surface of the stock and is that which has escaped from the cells which were not whole or which have burst by boiling 99 gelatine is soluble it is the basis and the nutritious portion of the stock when there is an abundance of it it causes the stock when cold to become a jelly 100 osmazome is soluble even when cold and is that part of the meat which gives flavour and perfume to the stock the flesh of old animals contains more osmazome than that of young ones brown meats contain more than white and the former make the stock more fragrant by roasting meat the osmazome appears to acquire higher properties so by putting the remains of roast meats into your stockpot you obtain a better flavour 101 albumen is of the nature of the white of eggs it can be dissolved in cold or tepid water but coagulates when it is put into water not quite at the boilingpoint from this property in albumen it is evident that if the meat is put into the stockpot when the water boils or after this is made to boil up quickly the albumen in both cases hardens in the first it rises to the surface in the second it remains in the meat but in both it prevents the gelatine and osmazome from dissolving and hence a thin and tasteless stock will be obtained it ought to be known too that the coagulation of the albumen in the meat always takes place more or less according to the size of the piece as the parts farthest from the surface always acquire that degree of heat which congeals it before entirely dissolving it 102 bones ought always to form a component part of the stockpot they are composed of an earthy substanceto which they owe their solidityof gelatine and a fatty fluid something like marrow two ounces of them contain as much gelatine as one pound of meat but in them this is so incased in the earthy substance that boiling water can dissolve only the surface of whole bones by breaking them however you can dissolve more because you multiply their surfaces and by reducing them to powder or paste you can dissolve them entirely but you must not grind them dry we have said 99 that gelatine forms the basis of stock but this though very nourishing is entirely without taste and to make the stock savoury it must contain osmazome of this bones do not contain a particle and that is the reason why stock made entirely of them is not liked but when you add meat to the broken or pulverized bones the osmazome contained in it makes the stock sufficiently savoury 103 in concluding this part of our subject the following condensed hints and directions should be attended to in the economy of soupmaking i beef makes the best stock veal stock has less colour and taste whilst mutton sometimes gives it a tallowy smell far from agreeable unless the meat has been previously roasted or broiled fowls add very little to the flavour of stock unless they be old and fat pigeons when they are old add the most flavour to it and a rabbit or partridge is also a great improvement from the freshest meat the best stock is obtained ii if the meat be boiled solely to make stock it must be cut up into the smallest possible pieces but generally speaking if it is desired to have good stock and a piece of savoury meat as well it is necessary to put a rather large piece into the stockpot say sufficient for two or three days during which time the stock will keep well in all weathers choose the freshest meat and have it cut as thick as possible for if it is a thin flat piece it will not look well and will be very soon spoiled by the boiling iii never wash meat as it deprives its surface of all its juices separate it from the bones and tie it round with tape so that its shape may be preserved then put it into the stockpot and for each pound of meat let there be one pint of water press it down with the hand to allow the air which it contains to escape and which often raises it to the top of the water iv put the stockpot on a gentle fire so that it may heat gradually the albumen will first dissolve afterwards coagulate and as it is in this state lighter than the liquid it will rise to the surface bringing with it all its impurities it is this which makes the scum the rising of the hardened albumen has the same effect in clarifying stock as the white of eggs and as a rule it may be said that the more scum there is the clearer will be the stock always take care that the fire is very regular v remove the scum when it rises thickly and do not let the stock boil because then one portion of the scum will be dissolved and the other go to the bottom of the pot thus rendering it very difficult to obtain a clear broth if the fire is regular it will not be necessary to add cold water in order to make the scum rise but if the fire is too large at first it will then be necessary to do so vi when the stock is well skimmed and begins to boil put in salt and vegetables which may be two or three carrots two turnips one parsnip a bunch of leeks and celery tied together you can add according to taste a piece of cabbage two or three cloves stuck in an onion and a tomato the latter gives a very agreeable flavour to the stock if fried onion be added it ought according to the advice of a famous french chef to be tied in a little bag without this precaution the colour of the stock is liable to be clouded vii by this time we will now suppose that you have chopped the bones which were separated from the meat and those which were left from the roast meat of the day before remember as was before pointed out that the more these are broken the more gelatine you will have the best way to break them up is to pound them roughly in an iron mortar adding from time to time a little water to prevent them getting heated it is a great saving thus to make use of the bones of meat which in too many english families we fear are entirely wasted for it is certain as previously stated no 102 that two ounces of bone contain as much gelatine which is the nutritive portion of stock as one pound of meat in their broken state tie them up in a bag and put them in the stockpot adding the gristly parts of cold meat and trimmings which can be used for no other purpose if to make up the weight you have received from the butcher a piece of mutton or veal broil it slightly over a clear fire before putting it in the stockpot and be very careful that it does not contract the least taste of being smoked or burnt viii add now the vegetables which to a certain extent will stop the boiling of the stock wait therefore till it simmers well up again then draw it to the side of the fire and keep it gently simmering till it is served preserving as before said your fire always the same cover the stockpot well to prevent evaporation do not fill it up even if you take out a little stock unless the meat is exposed in which case a little boiling water may be added but only enough to cover it after six hours slow and gentle simmering the stock is done and it should not be continued on the fire longer than is necessary or it will tend to insipidity noteit is on a good stock or first good broth and sauce that excellence in cookery depends if the preparation of this basis of the culinary art is intrusted to negligent or ignorant persons and the stock is not well skimmed but indifferent results will be obtained the stock will never be clear and when it is obliged to be clarified it is deteriorated both in quality and flavour in the proper management of the stockpot an immense deal of trouble is saved inasmuch as one stock in a small dinner serves for all purposes above all things the greatest economy consistent with excellence should be practised and the price of everything which enters the kitchen correctly ascertained the theory of this part of household management may appear trifling but its practice is extensive and therefore it requires the best attention illustration recipes chapter vi fruit and vegetable soups it will be seen by reference to the following recipes that an entirely original and most intelligible system has been pursued in explaining the preparation of each dish we would recommend the young housekeeper cook or whoever may be engaged in the important task of getting ready the dinner or other meal to follow precisely the order in which the recipes are given thus let them first place on their table all the ingredients necessary then the modus operandi or mode of preparation will be easily managed by a careful reading too of the recipes there will not be the slightest difficulty in arranging a repast for any number of persons and an accurate notion will be gained of the time the cooling of each dish will occupy of the periods at which it is seasonable as also of its average cost the addition of the natural history and the description of the various properties of the edible articles in common use in every family will be serviceable both in a practical and an educational point of view speaking specially of the recipes for soups it may be added that by the employment of the best medium or common stock the quality of the soups and their cost may be proportionately increased or lessened stocks for all kinds of soups rich strong stock 104 ingredients4 lbs of shin of beef 4 lbs of knuckle of veal 34 lb of good lean

pale jellylike substance add 4 quarts of cold water and simmer very gently for 5 hours as we have said before do not let it boil quickly skim off every particle of grease whilst it is doing and strain

few drops when required notein france burnt onions are made use of for the purpose of browning as a general rule the process of browning is to be discouraged as apt to impart a slightly unpleasant flavour to the stock and consequently all soups made from it to clarify stock 109 ingredientsthe whites of 2 eggs 12 pint of water 2 quarts of stock modesupposing that by some accident the soup is not quite clear and that its quantity is 2 quarts take the whites of 2 eggs carefully separated from their yolks whisk them well together with the water and add gradually the 2 quarts of boiling stock still whisking place the soup on the fire and when boiling and well skimmed whisk the eggs with it till nearly boiling again then draw it from the fire and let it settle until the whites of the eggs become separated pass through a fine cloth and the soup should be clear notethe rule is that all clear soups should be of a light straw colour and should not savour too strongly of the meat and that all white or brown thick soups should have no more consistency than will enable them to adhere slightly to the spoon when hot all pures should be somewhat thicker almond soup 110 ingredients4 lbs of

cultivated in europe especially in the south of france italy and spain it flowers in spring and produces its fruit in august although there are two kinds of almonds the sweet and the bitter they are considered as only varieties of the same species the best sweet almonds brought to england are called the syrian or jordan and come from malaga the inferior qualities are brought from valentia and italy bitter almonds come principally from magadore anciently the almond was much esteemed by the nations of the east jacob included it among the presents which he designed for joseph the greeks called it the greek or thasian nut and the romans believed that by eating half a dozen of them they were secured against drunkenness however deeply they might imbibe almonds however are considered as very indigestible the bitter contain too principles which produce two violent poisonsprussic acid and a kind of volatile oil it is consequently dangerous to eat them in large quantities almonds pounded together with a little sugar and water however produce a milk similar to that which is yielded by animals their oil is used for making fine soap and their cake as a cosmetic apple soup 111

sufficient for 10 persons illustration apple and blossom the applethis useful fruit is mentioned in holy writ and homer describes it as valuable in his time it was brought from the east by the romans who held it in the highest estimation indeed some of the citizens of the eternal city distinguished certain favourite apples by their names thus the manlians were called after manlius the claudians after claudius and the appians after appius others were designated after the country whence they were brought as the sidonians the epirotes and the greeks the best varieties are natives of asia and have by grafting them upon others been introduced into europe the crab found in our hedges is the only variety indigenous to britain therefore for the introduction of other kinds we are no doubt indebted to the romans in the time of the saxon heptarchy both devon and somerset were distinguished as the apple country and there are still existing in herefordshire some trees said to have been planted in the time of william the conqueror from that time to this the varieties of this precious fruit have gone on increasing and are now said to number upwards of 1500 it is peculiar to the temperate zone being found neither in lapland nor within the tropics the best baking apples for early use are the colvilles the best for autumn are the rennets and pearmains and the best for winter and spring are russets the best table or eating apples are the margarets for early use the kentish codlin and summer pearmain for summer and for autumn winter or spring the dowton golden and other pippins as the ribstone with small russets as a food the apple cannot be considered to rank high as more than the half of it consists of water and the rest of its properties are not the most nourishing it is however a useful adjunct to other kinds of food and when cooked is esteemed as slightly laxative artichoke jerusalem soup a white soup 112 ingredients3 slices of lean bacon or ham 12

species and varieties from what country it comes originally is not known but it was cultivated in the earliest ages of antiquity as the egyptians were afflicted with the loss of it in the ear in the time of moses it was a favourite grain with the athenians but it was esteemed as an ignominious food by the romans notwithstanding this however it was much used by them as it was in former times by the english and still is in the border counties in cornwall and also in wales in other parts of england it is used mostly for malting purposes it is less nutritive than wheat and in 100 parts has of starch 79 gluten 6 saccharine matter 7 husk 8 it is however a lighter and less stimulating food than wheat which renders a decoction of it well adapted for invalids whose digestion is weak bread soup

extreme economy is an object illustration quern or grindingmill breadthe origin of bread is involved in the obscurity of distant ages the greeks attributed its invention to pan but before they themselves had an existence it was no doubt in use among the primitive nations of mankind the chaldeans and the egyptians were acquainted with it and sarah the companion of abraham mixed flour and water together kneaded it and covered it with ashes on the hearth the scriptures inform us that leavened bread was known to the israelites but it is not known when the art of fermenting it was discovered it is said that the romans learnt it during their wars with perseus king of macedon and that it was introduced to the imperial city about 200 years before the birth of christ with them it no doubt found its way into britain but after their departure from the island it probably ceased to be used we know that king alfred allowed the unfermented cakes to burn in the neatherds cottage and that even in the sixteenth century unfermented cakes kneaded by the women were the only kind of bread known to the inhabitants of norway and sweden the italians of this day consume the greater portion of their flour in the form of polenta or soft pudding vermicelli and macaroni and in the remoter districts of scotland much unfermented bread is still used we give a cut of the quern grindingmill which towards the end of the last century was in use in that country and which is thus described by dr johnson in his journey to the hebridesit consists of two stones about a foot and half in diameter the lower is a little convex to which the concavity of the upper must be fitted in the middle of the upper stone is a round hole and on one side is a long handle the grinder sheds the corn gradually into the hole with one hand and works the handle round with the other the corn slides down the convexity of the lower stone and by the motion of the upper is ground in its passage such a primitive piece of machinery it may safely be said has entirely disappeared from this countryin other parts of this work we shall have opportunities of speaking of bread and breadmaking which from its great and general use in the nourishment of mankind has emphatically been called the staff of life the necessity therefore of having it both pure and good is of the first importance cabbage soup 118

cabbages nor radishes nor any other comestibles of a like nature were grown in any part of the kingdom they came from holland and flanders the original of all the cabbage tribe is the wild plant seacolewort which is to be found wasting whatever sweetness it may have on the desert air on many of the cliffs of the south coast of england in this state it scarcely weighs more than half an ounce yet in a cultivated state to what dimensions can it be made to grow however greatly the whole of the tribe is esteemed among the moderns by the ancients they were held in yet higher estimation the egyptians adored and raised altars to them and the greeks and romans ascribed many of the most exalted virtues to them cato affirmed that the cabbage cured all diseases and declared that it was to its use that the romans were enabled to live in health and without the assistance of physicians for 600 years it was introduced by that people into germany gaul and no doubt britain although in this last

garden kinds and is considered by some perhaps on that account to be the wild plant retaining still a large proportion of its original habit from the tendency of all other varieties to run away and become different to what they originally were it is very difficult to determine the races to which they belong the pea was well known to the romans and probably was introduced to britain at an early period for we find peas mentioned by lydgate a poet of the 15th century as being hawked in london they seem however for a considerable time to have fallen out of use for in the reign of queen

pods which are eaten cooked in the same way as kidneybeans they are called sugar peas and the best variety is the large crooked sugar which is also very good used in the common way as a culinary vegetable there is also a white sort which readily splits when subjected to the action of millstones set wide apart so as not to grind them these are used largely for soups and especially for

1 onion 6 cloves 4 blades of mace 14 lb of fresh butter 1 bottle of madeira 1 lump of sugar for the quenelles tortue 1 lb of veal 1 lb of bread crumbs milk 7 eggs cayenne salt spices chopped parsley the juice of 2 lemons modeto make this soup with less difficulty cut off the head of the turtle the preceding day in the morning open the turtle by leaning heavily with a knife on the shell of the animals back whilst you cut this off all round turn it upright on its end that all the water c may run out when the flesh should be cut off along the spine with the knife sloping towards the bones for fear of touching the gall which sometimes might escape the eye when all the flesh about the members is obtained wash these clean and let them drain have ready on the fire a large vessel full of boiling water into which put the shells and when you perceive that they come easily off take them out of the water and prick them all with those of the back belly fins head c boil the back and belly till the bones can be taken off without however allowing the softer parts to be sufficiently done as they will be boiled again in the soup when these latter come off easily lay them on earthen dishes singly for fear they should stick together and put them to cool keep the liquor in which you have blanched the softer parts and let the bones stew thoroughly in it as this liquor must be used to moisten all the sauces all the flesh of the interior parts the four legs and head must be drawn down in the following mannerlay the slices of ham on the bottom of a very large stewpan over them the knuckles of veal according to the size of the turtle then the inside flesh of the turtle and over the whole the members now moisten with the water in which you are boiling the shell and draw it down thoroughly it may now be ascertained if it be thoroughly done by thrusting a knife into the fleshy part of the meat if no blood appears it is time to moisten it again with the liquor in which the bones c have been boiling put in a large bunch of all such sweet herbs as are used in the cooking of a turtlesweet basil sweet marjoram lemon thyme winter savory 2 or 3 bayleaves common thyme a handful of parsley and green onions and a large onion stuck with 6 cloves let the whole be thoroughly done with respect to the members probe them to see whether they are done and if so drain and send them to the larder as they are to make their appearance only when the soup is absolutely completed when the flesh is also completely done strain it through a silk sieve and make a very thin white roux for turtle soup must not be much thickened when the flour is sufficiently done on a slow fire and has a good colour moisten it with the liquor keeping it over the fire till it boils ascertain that the sauce is neither too thick nor too thin then draw the stewpan on the side of the stove to skim off the white scum and all the fat and oil that rise to the surface of the sauce by this time all the softer parts will be sufficiently cold when they must be cut to about the size of one or two inches square and thrown into the soup which must now be left to simmer gently when done skim off all the fat and froth take all the leaves of the herbs from the stocksweet basil sweet marjoram lemon thyme winter savory 2 or 3 bayleaves common thyme a handful of parsley and green onions and a large onion cut in four pieces with a few blades of mace put these in a stewpan with about 14 lb of fresh butter and let it simmer on a slow fire till quite melted when pour in 1 bottle of good madeira adding a small bit of sugar and let it boil gently for 1 hour when done rub it through a tammy and add it to the soup let this boil till no white scum rises then take with a skimmer all the bits of turtle out of the sauce and put them in a clean stewpan when you have all out pour the soup over the bits of turtle through a tammy and proceed as follows quenelles tortuemake some quenelles tortue which being substitutes for eggs do not require to be very delicate take out the fleshy part of a leg of veal about 1 lb scrape off all the meat without leaving any sinews or fat and soak in milk about the same quantity of crumbs of bread when the bread is well soaked squeeze it and put it into a mortar with the veal a small quantity of calfs udder a little butter the yolks of 4 eggs boiled hard a little cayenne pepper salt and spices and pound the whole very fine then thicken the mixture with 2 whole eggs and the yolk of another next try this farce or stuffing in boilinghot water to ascertain its consistency if it is too thin add the yolk of an egg when the farce is perfected take half of it and put into it some chopped parsley let the whole cool in order to roll it of the size of the yolk of an egg poach it in salt and boiling water and when very hard drain on a sieve and put it into the turtle before you send up squeeze the juice of 2 or 3 lemons with a little cayenne pepper and pour that into the soup the fins may be served as a plat dentre with a little turtle sauce if not on the following day you may warm the turtle au bain marie and serve the members entire with a matelote sauce garnished with mushrooms cocks combs quenelles c when either lemonjuice or cayenne pepper has been introduced no boiling must take place noteit is necessary to observe that the turtle prepared a day before it is used is generally preferable the flavour being more uniform be particular when you dress a very large turtle to preserve the green fat be cautious not to study a very brown colourthe natural green of the fish is preferred by every epicure and true connoisseur in a separate stewpan and likewise when the turtle is entirely done to have as many tureens as you mean to serve each time you cannot put the whole in a large vessel for many reasons first it will be long in cooling secondly when you take some out it will break all the rest into rags if you warm in a bain marie the turtle will always retain the same taste but if you boil it often it becomes strong and loses the delicacy of its flavour the cost of turtle soupthis is the most expensive soup brought to table it is sold by the quartone guinea being the standard price for that quantity the price of live turtle ranges from 8d to 2s per lb according to supply and demand when live turtle is dear many cooks use the tinned turtle which is killed when caught and preserved by being put in hermeticallysealed canisters and so sent over to england the cost of a tin containing 2 quarts or 4 lbs is about 2 and for a small one containing the green fat 7s 6d from these about 6 quarts of good soup may be made illustration the turtle the green turtlethis reptile is found in large numbers on the coasts of all the islands and continents within the tropics in both the old and new worlds their length is often five feet and upwards and they range in weight from 50 to 500 or 600 lbs as turtles find a constant supply of food on the coasts which they frequent they are not of a quarrelsome disposition as the submarine meadows in which they pasture yield plenty for them all like other species of amphibia too they have the power of living many months without food so that they live harmlessly and peaceably together notwithstanding that they seem to have no common bond of association but merely assemble in the same places as if entirely by accident england is mostly supplied with them from the west indies whence they are brought alive and in tolerable health the green turtle is highly prized on account of the delicious quality of its flesh the fat of the upper and lower shields of the animal being esteemed the richest and most delicate parts the soup however is apt to disagree with weak stomachs as an article of

shores of europe the isle of wight is famous for shrimps where they are potted but both the prawns and the shrimps vended in london are too much salted for the excellence of their natural flavour to be preserved they are extremely lively little animals as seen in their native retreats illustration fish chapter vii the natural history of fishes 199 in natural history fishes form the fourth class in the system of linnaeus and are described as having long underjaws eggs without white organs of sense fins for supporters bodies covered with concave scales gills to supply the place of lungs for respiration and water for the natural element of their existence had mankind no other knowledge of animals than of such as inhabit the land and breathe their own atmosphere they would listen with incredulous wonder if told that there were other kinds of beings which existed only in the waters and which would die almost as soon as they were taken from them however strongly these facts might be attested they would hardly believe them without the operation of their own senses as they would recollect the effect produced on their own bodies when immersed in water and the impossibility of their sustaining life in it for any lengthened period of time experience however has taught them that the great deep is crowded with inhabitants of various sizes and of vastly different constructions with modes of life entirely distinct from those which belong to the animals of the land and with peculiarities of design equally wonderful with those of any other works which have come from the hand of the creator the history of these races however must remain for ever more or less in a state of darkness since the depths in which they live are beyond the power of human exploration and since the illimitable expansion of their domain places them almost entirely out of the reach of human accessibility 200 in studying the conformation of fishes we naturally conclude that they are in every respect well adapted to the element in which they have their existence their shape has a striking resemblance to the lower part of a ship and there is no doubt that the form of the fish originally suggested the form of the ship the body is in general slender gradually diminishing towards each of its extremities and flattened on each of its sides this is precisely the form of the lower part of the hull of a ship and it enables both the animal and the vessel with comparative ease to penetrate and divide the resisting medium for which they have been adapted the velocity of a ship however in sailing before the wind is by no means to be compared to that of a fish it is well known that the largest fishes will with the greatest ease overtake a ship in full sail play round it without effort and shoot ahead of it at pleasure this arises from their great flexibility which to compete with mocks the labours of art and enables them to migrate thousands of miles in a season without the slightest indications of languor or fatigue 201 the principal instruments employed by fishes to accelerate their motion are their airbladder fins and tail by means of the airbladder they enlarge or diminish the specific gravity of their bodies when they wish to sink they compress the muscles of the abdomen and eject the air contained in it by which their weight compared with that of the water is increased and they consequently descend on the other hand when they wish to rise they relax the compression of the abdominal muscles when the airbladder fills and distends and the body immediately ascends to the surface how simply yet how wonderfully has the supreme being adapted certain means to the attainment of certain ends those fishes which are destitute of the airbladder are heavy in the water and have no great alacrity in rising the larger proportion of them remain at the bottom unless they are so formed as to be able to strike their native element downwards with sufficient force to enable them to ascend when the airbladder of a fish is burst its power of ascending to the surface has for ever passed away from a knowledge of this fact the fishermen of cod are enabled to preserve them alive for a considerable time in their wellboats the means they adopt to accomplish this is to perforate the sound or airbladder with a needle which disengages the air when the fishes immediately descend to the bottom of the well into which they are thrown without this operation it would be impossible to keep the cod under water whilst they had life in swimming the fins enable fishes to preserve their upright position especially those of the belly which act like two feet without those they would swim with their bellies upward as it is in their backs that the centre of gravity lies in ascending and descending these are likewise of great assistance as they contract and expand accordingly the tail is an instrument of great muscular force and largely assists the fish in all its motions in some instances it acts like the rudder of a ship and enables it to turn sideways and when moved from side to side with a quick vibratory motion fishes are made in the same manner as the screw propeller makes a steamship to dart forward with a celerity proportioned to the muscular force with which it is employed 202 the bodies of fishes are mostly covered with a kind of horny scales but some are almost entirely without them or have them so minute as to be almost invisible as is the case with the eel the object of these is to preserve them from injury by the pressure of the water or the sudden contact with pebbles rocks or seaweeds others again are enveloped in a fatty oleaginous substance also intended as a defence against the friction of the water and those in which the scales are small are supplied with a larger quantity of slimy matter 203 the respiration of fishes is effected by means of those comblike organs which are placed on each side of the neck and which are called gills it is curious to watch the process of breathing as it is performed by the finny tribes it seems to be so continuous that it might almost pass for an illustration of the vexed problem which conceals the secret of perpetual motion in performing it they fill their mouths with water which they drive backwards with a force so great as to open the large flap to allow it to escape behind in this operation all or a great portion of the air contained in the water is left among the featherlike processes of the gills and is carried into the body there to perform its part in the animal economy in proof of this it has been ascertained that if the water in which fishes are put is by any means denuded of its air they immediately seek the surface and begin to gasp for it hence distilled water is to them what a vacuum made by an airpump is to most other animals for this reason when a fishpond or other aqueous receptacle in which fishes are kept is entirely frozen over it is necessary to make holes in the ice not so especially for the purpose of feeding them as for that of giving them air to breathe 204 the positions of the teeth of fishes are well calculated to excite our amazement for in some cases these are situated in the jaws sometimes on the tongue or palate and sometimes even in the throat they are in general sharppointed and immovable but in the carp they are obtuse and in the pike so easily moved as to seem to have no deeper hold than such as the mere skin can afford in the herring the tongue is set with teeth to enable it the better it is supposed to retain its food 205 although naturalists have divided fishes into two great tribes the osseous and the cartilaginous yet the distinction is not very precise for the first have a great deal of cartilage and the second at any rate a portion of calcareous matter in their bones it may therefore be said that the bones of fishes form a kind of intermediate substance between true bones and cartilages the backbone extends through the whole length of the body and consists of vertebrae strong and thick towards the head but weaker and more slender as it approaches the tail each species has a determinate number of vertebrae which are increased in size in proportion with the body the ribs are attached to the processes of the vertebrae and inclose the breast and abdomen some kinds as the rays have no ribs whilst others as the sturgeon and eel have very short ones between the pointed processes of the vertebrae are situated the bones which support the dorsal back and the anal below the tail fins which are connected with the processes by a ligament at the breast are the sternum or breastbone clavicles or collarbones and the scapulae or shoulderblades on which the pectoral or breast fins are placed the bones which support the ventral or belly fins are called the ossa pelvis besides these principal bones there are often other smaller ones placed between the muscles to assist their motion 206 some of the organs of sense in fishes are supposed to be possessed by them in a high degree and others much more imperfectly of the latter kind are the senses of touch and taste which are believed to be very slightly developed on the other hand those of hearing seeing and smelling are ascertained to be acute but the first in a lesser degree than both the second and third their possession of an auditory organ was long doubted and even denied by some physiologists but it has been found placed on the sides of the skull or in the cavity which contains the brain it occupies a position entirely distinct and detached from the skull and in this respect differs in the local disposition of the same sense in birds and quadrupeds in some fishes as in those of the ray kind the organ is wholly encompassed by those parts which contain the cavity of the skull whilst in the cod and salmon kind it is in the part within the skull its structure is in every way much more simple than that of the same sense in those animals which live entirely in the air but there is no doubt that they have the adaptation suitable to their condition in some genera as in the rays the external orifice or ear is very small and is placed in the upper surface of the head whilst in others there is no visible external orifice whatever however perfect the sight of fishes may be experience has shown that this sense is of much less use to them than that of smelling in searching for their food the optic nerves in fishes have this peculiaritythat they are not confounded with one another in their middle progress between their origin and their orbit the one passes over the other without any communication so that the nerve which comes from the left side of the brain goes distinctly to the right eye and that which comes from the right goes distinctly to the left in the greater part of them the eye is covered with the same transparent skin that covers the rest of the head the object of this arrangement perhaps is to defend it from the action of the water as there are no eyelids the globe in front is somewhat depressed and is furnished behind with a muscle which serves to lengthen or flatten it according to the necessities of the animal the crystalline humour which in quadrupeds is flattened is in fishes nearly globular the organ of smelling in fishes is large and is endued at its entry with a dilating and contracting power which is employed as the wants of the animal may require it is mostly by the acuteness of their smell that fishes are enabled to discover their food for their tongue is not designed for nice sensation being of too firm a cartilaginous substance for this purpose 207 with respect to the food of fishes this is almost universally found in their own element they are mostly carnivorous though they seize upon almost anything that comes in their way they even devour their own offspring and manifest a particular predilection for all living creatures those to which nature has meted out mouths of the greatest capacity would seem to pursue everything with life and frequently engage in fierce conflicts with their prey the animal with the largest mouth is usually the victor and he has no sooner conquered his foe than he devours him innumerable shoals of one species pursue those of another with a ferocity which draws them from the pole to the equator through all the varying temperatures and depths of their boundless domain in these pursuits a scene of universal violence is the result and many species must have become extinct had not nature accurately proportioned the means of escape the production and the numbers to the extent and variety of the danger to which they are exposed hence the smaller species are not only more numerous but more productive than the larger whilst their instinct leads them in search of food and safety near the shores where from the shallowness of the waters many of their foes are unable to follow them 208 the fecundity of fishes has been the wonder of every natural philosopher whose attention has been attracted to the subject they are in general oviparous or eggproducing but there are a few such as the eel and the blenny which are viviparous or produce their young alive the males have the milt and the females the roe but some individuals as the sturgeon and the cod tribes are said to contain both the greater number deposit their spawn in the sand or gravel but some of those which dwell in the depths of the ocean attach their eggs to seaweeds in every instance however their fruitfulness far surpasses that of any other race of animals according to lewenhoeck the cod annually spawns upwards of nine millions of eggs contained in a single roe the flounder produces one million the mackerel above five hundred thousand a herring of a moderate size at least ten thousand a carp fourteen inches in length according to petit contained two hundred and sixtytwo thousand two hundred and twentyfour a perch deposited three hundred and eighty thousand six hundred and forty and a female sturgeon seven millions six hundred and fiftythree thousand two hundred the viviparous species are by no means so prolific yet the blenny brings forth two or three hundred at a time which commence sporting together round their parent the moment they have come into existence 209 in reference to the longevity of fishes it is affirmed to surpass that of all other created beings and it is supposed they are to a great extent exempted from the diseases to which the flesh of other animals is heir in place of suffering from the rigidity of age which is the cause of the natural decay of those that live and move and have their being on the land their bodies continue to grow with each succeeding supply of food and the conduits of life to perform their functions unimpaired the age of fishes has not been properly ascertained although it is believed that the most minute of the species has a longer lease of life than man the mode in which they die has been noted by the rev mr white the eminent naturalist of selbourne as soon as the fish sickens the head sinks lower and lower till the animal as it were stands upon it after this as it becomes weaker it loses its poise till the tail turns over when it comes to the surface and floats with its belly upwards the reason for its floating in this manner is on account of the body being no longer balanced by the fins of the belly and the broad muscular back preponderating by its own gravity over the belly from this latter being a cavity and consequently lighter 210 fishes are either solitary or gregarious and some of them migrate to great distances and into certain rivers to deposit their spawn of seafishes the cod herring mackerel and many others assemble in immense shoals and migrate through different tracts of the ocean but whether considered in their solitary or gregarious capacity they are alike wonderful to all who look through nature up to natures god and consider with due humility yet exalted admiration the sublime variety beauty power and grandeur of his productions as manifested in the creation fish as an article of human food 211 as the nutritive properties of fish are deemed inferior to those of what is called butchers meat it would appear from all we can learn that in all ages it has held only a secondary place in the estimation of those who have considered the science of gastronomy as a large element in the happiness of mankind among the jews of old it was very little used although it seems not to have been entirely interdicted as moses prohibited only the use of such as had neither scales nor fins the egyptians however made fish an article of diet notwithstanding that it was rejected by their priests egypt however is not a country favourable to the production of fish although we read of the people when hungry eating it raw of epicures among them having dried it in the sun and of its being salted and preserved to serve as a repast on days of great solemnity the modern egyptians are in general extremely temperate in regard to food even the richest among them take little pride and perhaps experience as little delight in the luxuries of the table their dishes mostly consist of pilaus soups and stews prepared principally of onions cucumbers and other cold vegetables mixed with a little meat cut into small pieces on special occasions however a whole sheep is placed on the festive board but during several of the hottest months of the year the richest restrict themselves entirely to a vegetable diet the poor are contented with a little oil or sour milk in which they may dip their bread 212 passing from africa to europe we come amongst a people who have almost from time immemorial occupied a high place in the estimation of every civilized country yet the greeks in their earlier ages made very little use of fish as an article of diet in the eyes of the heroes of homer it had little favour for menelaus complained that hunger pressed their digestive organs and they had been obliged to live upon fish subsequently however fish became one of the principal articles of diet amongst the hellenes and both aristophanes and athenaeus allude to it and even satirize their countrymen for their excessive partiality to the turbot and mullet so infatuated were many of the greek gastronomes with the love of fish that some of them would have preferred death from indigestion to the relinquishment of the precious dainties with which a few of the species supplied them philoxenes of cythera was one of these on being informed by his physician that he was going to die of indigestion on account of the quantity he was consuming of a delicious fish be it so he calmly observed but before i die let me finish the remainder 213 the geographical situation of greece was highly favourable for the development of a taste for the piscatory tribes and the skill of the greek cooks was so great that they could impart every variety of relish to the dish they were called upon to prepare athenaeus has transmitted to posterity some very important precepts upon their ingenuity in seasoning with salt oil and aromatics at the present day the food of the greeks through the combined influence of poverty and the long fasts which their religion imposes upon them is to a large extent composed of fish accompanied with vegetables and fruit caviare prepared from the roes of sturgeons is the national ragout which like all other fish dishes they season with aromatic herbs snails dressed in garlic are also a favourite dish 214 as the romans in a great measure took their taste in the fine arts from the greeks so did they in some measure their piscine appetites the eelpout and the lotass liver were the favourite fish dishes of the roman epicures whilst the red mullet was esteemed as one of the most delicate fishes that could be brought to the table with all the elegance taste and refinement of roman luxury it was sometimes promoted or accompanied by acts of great barbarity in proof of this the mention of the red mullet suggests the mode in which it was sometimes treated for the to us horrible entertainment of the fashionable in roman circles it may be premised that as england has rome in her palmy days had her fops who had no doubt through the medium of their cooks discovered that when the scales of the red mullet were removed the flesh presented a fine pinkcolour having discovered this it was further observed that at the death of the animal this colour passed through a succession of beautiful shades and in order that these might be witnessed and enjoyed in their fullest perfection the poor mullet was served alive in a glass vessel 215 the love of fish among the ancient romans rose to a real mania apicius offered a prize to any one who could invent a new brine compounded of the liver of red mullets and lucullus had a canal cut through a mountain in the neighbourhood of naples that fish might be the more easily transported to the gardens of his villa hortensius the orator wept over the death of a turbot which he had fed with his own hands and the daughter of druses adorned one that she had with rings of gold these were surely instances of misplaced affection but there is no accounting for tastes it was but the other day that we read in the times of a wealthy living english hermit who delights in the companionship of rats the modern romans are merged in the general name of italians who with the exception of macaroni have no specially characteristic article of food 216 from rome to gaul is considering the means of modern locomotion no great way but the ancient sumptuary laws of that kingdom give us little information regarding the ichthyophagous propensities of its inhabitants louis xii engaged six fishmongers to furnish his board with freshwater animals and francis i had twentytwo whilst henry the great extended his requirements a little further and had twentyfour in the time of louis xiv the cooks had attained to such a degree of perfection in their art that they could convert the form and flesh of the trout pike or carp into the very shape and flavour of the most delicious game the french long enjoyed a european reputation for their skill and refinement in the preparing of food in place of plain joints french cookery delights in the marvels of what are called made dishes ragouts stews and fricassees in which no trace of the original materials of which they are compounded is to be found 217 from gaul we cross to britain where it has been asserted by at least one authority that the ancient inhabitants ate no fish however this may be we know that the british shores particularly those of the north sea have always been well supplied with the best kinds of fish which we may reasonably infer was not unknown to the inhabitants or likely to be lost upon them for the lack of knowledge as to how they tasted by the time of edward ii fish had in england become a dainty especially the sturgeon which was permitted to appear on no table but that of the king in the fourteenth century a decree of king john informs us that the people ate both seals and porpoises whilst in the days of the troubadours whales were fished for and caught in the mediterranean sea for the purpose of being used as human food whatever checks the ancient british may have had upon their piscatory appetites there are happily none of any great consequence upon the modern who delight in wholesome food of every kind their taste is perhaps too much inclined to that which is accounted solid and substantial but they really eat more moderately even of animal food than either the french or the germans roast beef or other viands cooked in the plainest manner are with them a sufficient luxury yet they delight in living well whilst it is easy to prove how largely their affections are developed by even the prospect of a substantial cheer in proof of this we will just observe that if a great dinner is to be celebrated it is not uncommon for the appointed stewards and committee to meet and have a preliminary dinner among themselves in order to arrange the great one and after that to have another dinner to discharge the bill which the great one cost this enjoyable disposition we take to form a very large item in the aggregate happiness of the nation 218 the general use of fish as an article of human food among civilized nations we have thus sufficiently shown and will conclude this portion of our subject with the following hints which ought to be remembered by all those who are fond of occasionally varying their dietary with a piscine dish i fish shortly before they spawn are in general best in condition when the spawning is just over they are out of season and unfit for human food ii when fish is out of season it has a transparent bluish tinge however much it may be boiled when it is in season its muscles are firm and boil white and curdy iii as food for invalids white fish such as the ling cod haddock coalfish and whiting are the best flat fish as soles skate turbot and flounders are also good iv salmon mackerel herrings and trout soon spoil or decompose after they are killed therefore to be in perfection they should be prepared for the table on the day they are caught with flat fish this is not of such consequence as they will keep longer the turbot for example is improved by being kept a day or two general directions for dressing fish 219 in dressing fish of any kind the first point to be attended to is to see that it be perfectly clean it is a common error to wash it too much as by doing so the flavour is diminished if the fish is to be boiled a little salt and vinegar should be put into the water to give it firmness after it is cleaned codfish whiting and haddock are far better if a little salted and kept a day and if the weather be not very hot they will be good for two days 220 when fish is cheap and plentiful and a larger quantity is purchased than is immediately wanted the overplus of such as will bear it should be potted or pickled or salted and hung up or it may be fried that it may serve for stewing the next day freshwater fish having frequently a muddy smell and taste should be soaked in strong salt and water after it has been well cleaned if of a sufficient size it may be scalded in salt and water and afterwards dried and dressed 221 fish should be put into cold water and set on the fire to do very gently or the outside will break before the inner part is done unless the fishes are small they should never be put into warm water nor should water either hot or cold be poured on to the fish as it is liable to break the skin if it should be necessary to add a little water whilst the fish is cooking it ought to be poured in gently at the side of the vessel the fishplate may be drawn up to see if the fish be ready which may be known by its easily separating from the bone it should then be immediately taken out of the water or it will become woolly the fishplate should be set crossways over the kettle to keep hot for serving and a clean cloth over the fish to prevent its losing its colour 222 in garnishing fish great attention is required and plenty of parsley horseradish and lemon should be used if fried parsley be used it must be washed and picked and thrown into fresh water when the lard or dripping boils throw the parsley into it immediately from the water and instantly it will be green and crisp and must be taken up with a slice when well done and with very good sauce fish is more appreciated than almost any other dish the liver and roe in some instances should be placed on the dish in order that they may be distributed in the course of serving but to each recipe will be appended the proper mode of serving and garnishing 223 if fish is to be fried or broiled it must be dried in a nice soft cloth after it is well cleaned and washed if for frying brush it over with egg and sprinkle it with some fine crumbs of bread if done a second time with the egg and bread the fish will look so much the better if required to be very nice a sheet of white blottingpaper must be placed to receive it that it may be free from all grease it must also be of a beautiful colour and all the crumbs appear distinct butter gives a bad colour lard and clarified dripping are most frequently used but oil is the best if the expense be no objection the fish should be put into the lard when boiling and there should be a sufficiency of this to cover it 224 when fish is broiled it must be seasoned floured and laid on a very clean gridiron which when hot should be rubbed with a bit of suet to prevent the fish from sticking it must be broiled over a very clear fire that it may not taste smoky and not too near that it may not be scorched 225 in choosing fish it is well to remember that it is possible it may be fresh and yet not good under the head of each particular fish in this work are appended rules for its choice and the months when it is in season nothing can be of greater consequence to a cook than to have the fish good as if this important course in a dinner does not give satisfaction it is rarely that the repast goes off well recipes chapter viii fish nothing is more difficult than to give the average prices of fish inasmuch as a few hours of bad weather at sea will in the space of one day cause such a difference in its supply that the same fisha turbot for instancewhich may be bought today for six or seven shillings will tomorrow be in the london markets worth perhaps almost as many pounds the average costs therefore which will be found appended to each recipe must be understood as about the average price for the different kinds of fish when the market is supplied upon an average and when the various sorts are of an average size and quality general rule in choosing fisha proof of freshness and goodness in most fishes is their being covered with scales for if deficient in this respect it is a sign of their being stale or having been illused fried anchovies 226 ingredients1 tablespoonful of

garum was in great estimation its extreme range is extended into the black sea the fishing for them is carried on during the night and lights are used with the nets the anchovy is common on the coasts of portugal spain and france it occurs i have no doubt at the channel islands and has been taken on the hampshire coast and in the bristol channel other fish of inferior quality but resembling the real gorgona anchovy are frequently sold for it and passed off as genuine anchovy butter or paste 227 ingredients2 dozen anchovies 12 lb of fresh butter modewash the anchovies thoroughly bone and dry

pounded into the consistency of a paste and then placed in flat pots somewhat similar in shape to those used for pomatum this paste is usually eaten spread upon toast and is said to form an excellent bonne bouche which enables gentlemen at wineparties to enjoy their port with redoubled gusto unfortunately in six cases out of ten the only portion of these preserved delicacies that contains anything

231 cod may be boiled whole but a large head and shoulders are quite sufficient for a dish and contain all that is usually helped because when the thick part is done the tail is insipid and overdone the latter cut in slices makes a very good dish for frying or it may be salted down and served with egg sauce and parsnips cod when boiled quite fresh is watery salting a little renders it firmer illustration the cod the cod tribethe jugular characterized by bony gills and ventral fins before the pectoral ones commences the second of the linnaean orders of fishes and is a numerous tribe inhabiting only the depths of the ocean and seldom visiting the fresh waters they have a smooth head and the gill membrane has seven rays the body is oblong and covered with deciduous scales the fins are all inclosed in skin whilst their rays are unarmed the ventral fins are slender and terminate in a point their habits are gregarious and they feed on smaller fish and other marine animals cods

sauce and plain melted butter should be served with this to choose codthe cod should be chosen for the table when it is plump and round near the tail when the hollow behind the head is deep and when the sides are undulated as if they were ribbed the glutinous parts about the head lose their delicate flavour after the fish has been twentyfour hours out of the water the great point by which the cod should be judged is the firmness of its flesh and although the cod is not firm when it is alive its quality may be arrived at by pressing the finger into the flesh if this rises immediately the fish is good if not it is stale another sign of its goodness is if the fish when it is cut exhibits a bronze appearance like the silver side of a round of beef when this is the case the flesh will be firm when cooked stiffness in a cod or in any other fish is a sure sign of freshness though not always of quality sometimes codfish though exhibiting signs of rough usage will eat much better than those with red gills so strongly recommended by many cookerybooks this appearance is generally caused by the fish having been knocked about at sea in the wellboats in which they are conveyed from the fishinggrounds to market salt cod commonly called saltfish 233 ingredientssufficient water to cover the fish modewash the fish and lay it all night in water with a 14 pint of vinegar when thoroughly

quantities of worms a food peculiarly grateful to it another cause of its attachment to these places has been said to be on account of the vicinity to the polar seas where it returns to spawn few are taken north of iceland and the shoals never reach so far south as the straits of gibraltar many are taken on the coasts of norway in the baltic and off the orkneys which prior to the discovery of newfoundland formed one of the principal fisheries the london market is supplied by those taken between the dogger bank the well bank and cromer on the east coast of england cod a la maitre dhotel 240

the fecundity of the codin our preceding remarks on the natural history of fishes we have spoken of the amazing fruitfulness of this fish but in this we see one more instance of the wise provision which nature has made for supplying the wants of man so extensive has been the consumption of this fish that it is surprising that it has not long ago become extinct which would certainly have been the case had it not been for its wonderful powers of reproduction so early as 1368 says dr cloquet the inhabitants of amsterdam had dispatched fishermen to the coast of sweden and in the first quarter of 1792 from the ports of france only 210 vessels went out to the codfisheries every year however upwards of 10000 vessels of all nations are employed in this trade and bring into the commercial world more than 40000000 of salted and dried cod if we add to this immense number the havoc made among the legions of cod by the larger scaly tribes of the great deep and take into account the destruction to which the young are exposed by seafowls and other inhabitants of the seas besides the myriads of their eggs destroyed by accident it becomes a miracle to find that such mighty multitudes of them are still in existence and ready to continue the exhaustless supply yet it ceases to excite our wonder when we remember that the female can every year give birth to more than 9000000 at a time baked

one that had lived there 70 years and gesner mentions an instance of one 100 years old they are besides capable of being tamed dr smith in his tour on the continent says in reference to the prince of conds seat at chantilly the most pleasing things about it were the immense shoals of very large carp silvered over with age like silverfish and perfectly tame so that when any passengers approached their watery habitation they used to come to the shore in such numbers as to heave each other out of the water begging for bread of which a quantity was always kept at hand on purpose to feed them they would even allow themselves to be handled illustration the chub illustration the char the chubthis fish takes its name from its head not only in england but in other countries it is a riverfish

the largest and best kind is found in the lakes of westmoreland and as it is considered a rarity it is often potted and preserved the dace or darethis fish is gregarious and is seldom above ten inches long although according to linnaeus it grows a foot and a half in length its haunts are in deep water near piles of bridges where the stream is gentle over gravelly sandy or clayey bottoms deep holes that are shaded waterlily leaves and under the foam caused by an eddy in the warm months they are to be found in shoals on the shallows near to streams they are in season about the end of april and

feed variously on aquatic or marine plants small fish molluscae or dead bodies the blackclawed species is found on the rocky coasts of both europe and india and is the same that is introduced to our tables being much more highly esteemed as a food than many others of the tribe the most remarkable feature in their history is the changing of their shells and the reproduction of their broken claws the former occurs once a year usually between christmas and easter when the crabs retire to cavities in the rocks or conceal themselves under great stones fishermen say that they will live confined in a pot or basket for several months together without any other food than what is collected from the seawater and that even in this situation they will not decrease in weight the hermit crab is another of the species and has the peculiarity of taking possession of the deserted shell of some other animal as it has none of its own this circumstance was known to the ancients and is alluded to in the following lines from oppian the hermit fish unarmd by nature left helpless and weak grow strong by harmless theft fearful they stroll and look with panting wish for the cast crust of some newcoverd

says dr anderson in the bee to be once on a visit to a friends house on deeside in aberdeenshire i frequently delighted to walk by the banks of the river i one day observed something like a black string moving along the edge of the water where it was quite shallow upon closer inspection i discovered that this was a shoal of young eels so closely joined together as to appear on a superficial view on continued body moving briskly up against the stream to avoid the retardment they experienced from the force of the current they kept close along the waters edge the whole of the way following all the bendings and sinuosities of the river where they were embayed and in still water the shoal dilated in breadth so as to be sometimes nearly a foot broad but when they turned a cape where the current was strong they were forced to occupy less space and press close to the shore struggling very hard till they passed it this shoal continued to move on night and day without interruption for several weeks their progress might be at the rate of about a mile an hour it was easy to catch the animals though they were very active and nimble they were eels perfectly well formed in every respect but not exceeding two inches in length i conceive that the shoal did not contain on an average less than from twelve to twenty in breadth so that the number that passed on the whole must have been very great whence they came or whither they went i know not but the place where i saw this was six miles from the sea eel pie 253 ingredients1 lb of eels a little chopped parsley 1 shalot grated

twelve or sixteen inches long and progressively increase both in number and size till about the end of july when they have become large enough to be denominated grilse early in august they become fewer in numbers but of greater size haying advanced to a weight of from six to nine pounds this rapidity of growth appears surprising and realizes the remark of walton that the salmlet becomes a

distressd or sore disease he courts the salutary fish for ease close to his scales the kind physician glides and sweats a healing balsam from his sides in our estimation however this selfdenial in the pike may be attributed to a less poetical cause namely from the mudloving disposition of the tench it is enabled to keep itself so completely concealed at the bottom of its aqueous haunts that it

roman empire it is generally mentioned by writers only on account of the beauty of its colours about the end of september they quit the deep water to which they had retired during the hot weather for the purpose of spawning this they always do on a gravelly bottom or where gravel and sand are mixed among stones towards the end or by the sides of streams at this period they become black about the head and body and become soft and unwholesome they are never good when they are large with roe but there are in all trout rivers some barren female fish which continue good throughout the winter in

turbot the turbotthis is the most esteemed of all our flat fish the northern parts of the english coast and some places off the coast of holland produce turbot in great abundance and in greater excellence than any other parts of the world the london market is chiefly supplied by dutch fishermen who bring to it nearly 90000 a year the flesh is firm white rich and gelatinous and is the better for being kept a day or two previous to cooking it in many parts of the country turbot and halibut are indiscriminately sold for each other they are however perfectly distinct the upper parts of the former being marked with large unequal and obtuse tubercles while those of the other are quite smooth and covered with oblong soft scales which firmly adhere to the body illustration turbotkettle fishkettles are made in an oblong form and have two handles with a movable bottom pierced full of holes on which the fish is laid and on which it may be lifted from the water by means of two long

head of fish that there exists in the salt ocean and freshwater rivers an abundance of aliment which the present state of gastronomic art enables the cook to introduce to the table in the most agreeable forms and oftentimes at a very moderate cost less nutritious as a food than the flesh of animals more succulent than vegetables fish may be termed a middle dish suited to all temperaments and constitutions and one which those who are recovering from illness may partake of with safety and advantage as to which is the best fish there has been much discussion the old latin proverb however de gustibus non disputandum and the more modern spanish one sobre los gustos no hai disputa declare with equal force that where taste is concerned no decision can be arrived at each persons palate may be differently affectedpleased or displeased and there is no standard by which to judge why a red mullet a sole or a turbot should be better or worse than a salmon trout pike or a tiny tench fish as we have explained is less nourishing than meat for it is lighter in weight size for size and contains no ozmazome see no 100 shellfish oysters particularly furnish but little nutriment and this is the reason why so many of the latter can be eaten without injury to the system in brillat savarins footnote brillat savarin was a french lawyer and judge of considerable eminence and great talents and wrote under the above title a book on gastronomy full of instructive information enlivened with a fund of pleasantlytold anecdote clever and amusing volume the physiology of taste he says that towards the end of the eighteenth century it was a most common thing for a wellarranged entertainment in paris to commence with oysters and that many guests were not contented without swallowing twelve dozen being anxious to know the weight of this advancedguard he ascertained that a dozen oysters fluid included weighed 4 ouncesthus the twelve dozen would weigh about 3 lbs and there can be no doubt that the same persons who made no worse a dinner on account of having partaken of the oysters would have been completely satisfied if they had eaten the same weight of chicken or mutton an anecdote perfectly well authenticated is narrated of a french gentleman m laperte residing at versailles who was extravagantly fond of oysters declaring he never had enough savarin resolved to procure him the satisfaction and gave him an invitation to dinner which was duly accepted the guest arrived and his host kept company with him in swallowing the delicious bivalves up to the tenth dozen when exhausted he gave up and let m laperte go on alone this gentleman managed to eat thirtytwo dozen within an hour and would doubtless have got through more but the person who opened them is described as not being very skilful in the interim savarin was idle and at length tired with his painful state of inaction he said to laperte whilst the latter was still in full career mon cher you will not eat as many oysters today as you meant let us dine they dined and the insatiable oystereater acted at the repast as if he had fasted for a week fish carving general directions for carving fish in carving fish

fare his chef came presenting a list adorned with vignettes and the first article of which that met the princes eye was fifty hams bertrand said the prince i think you must be extravagant fifty hams do you intend to feast my whole regiment no prince there will be but one on the table and the surplus i need for my espagnole blondes garnitures c bertrand you are robbing me this item will not do monseigneur said the artiste you do not appreciate me give me the order and i will put those fifty hams in a crystal flask no longer than my thumb the prince smiled and the hams were passed this was all very well for the prince de soubise but as we do not write for princes and nobles alone but that our british sisters may make the best dishes out of the least expensive ingredients we will also pass the hams and give a few general directions concerning sauces c 355 the preparation and appearance of sauces and gravies are of the highest consequence and in nothing does the talent and taste of the cook more display itself their special adaptability to the various viands they are to accompany cannot be too much studied in order that they may harmonize and blend with them as perfectly so to speak as does a pianoforte accompaniment with the voice of the singer 356 the general basis of most gravies and some sauces is the same stock as that used for soups see nos 104 105 106 and 107 and by the employment of these with perhaps an additional slice of ham a little spice a few herbs and a slight flavouring from some cold sauce or ketchup very nice gravies may be made for a very small expenditure a milt either of a bullock or sheep the shankend of mutton that has already been dressed and the necks and feet of poultry may all be advantageously used for gravy where much is not required it may then be established as a rule that there exists no necessity for good gravies to be expensive and that there is no occasion as many would have the world believe to buy ever so many pounds of fresh meat in order to furnish an ever so little quantity of gravy 357 brown sauces generally speaking should scarcely be so thick as white sauces and it is well to bear in mind that all those which are intended to mask the various dishes of poultry or meat should be of a sufficient consistency to slightly adhere to the fowls or joints over which they are poured for browning and thickening sauces c browned flour may be properly employed 358 sauces should possess a decided character and whether sharp or sweet savoury or plain they should carry out their names in a distinct manner although of course not so much flavoured as to make them too piquant on the one hand or too mawkish on the other 359 gravies and sauces should be sent to table very hot and there is all the more necessity for the cook to see to this point as from their being usually served in small quantities they are more liable to cool quickly than if they were in a larger body those sauces of which cream or eggs form a component part should be well stirred as soon as these ingredients are added to them and must never be allowed to boil as in that case they would instantly curdle 360 although pickles may be purchased at shops at as low a rate as they can usually be made for at home or perhaps even for less yet we would advise all housewives who have sufficient time and convenience to prepare their own the only general rules perhaps worth stating hereas in the recipes all necessary details will be explained are that the vegetables and fruits used should be sound and not over ripe and that the very best vinegar should be employed 361 for forcemeats special attention is necessary the points which cooks should in this branch of cookery more particularly observe are the thorough chopping of the suet the complete mincing of the herbs the careful grating of the breadcrumbs and the perfect mixing of the whole these are the three principal ingredients of forcemeats and they can scarcely be cut too small as nothing like a lump or fibre should be anywhere perceptible to conclude the flavour of no one spice or herb should be permitted to predominate recipes chapter x sauces

acquainted it is a powder prepared from several varieties of the capsicum annual eastindia plants of which there are three so far naturalized in this country as to be able to grow in the open air these are the guinea the cherry and the bell pepper all the pods of these are extremely pungent to the taste and in the green state are used by us as a pickle when ripe they are ground into cayenne pepper and sold as a condiment the best of this however is made in the west indies from what is called the bird pepper on account of hens and turkeys being extremely partial to it it is imported ready for use of the capiscum species of plants there are five but the principal are1 capsicum annuum the common longpodded capsicum which is cultivated in our gardens and of which there are two varieties one with red and another with yellow fruit 2 capsicum baccatum or bird pepper which rises with a shrubby stalk four or five feet high with its berries growing at the division of the branches this is

never be forgotten that even in small quantities it produces detrimental effects on inflammatory constitutions dr paris in his work on diet says foreign spices were not intended by nature for the inhabitants of temperate climes they are heating and highly stimulant i am however not anxious to give more weight to this objection than it deserves man is no longer the child of nature nor the passive inhabitant of any particular region he ranges over every part of the globe and elicits nourishment from the productions of every climate nature is very kind in favouring the growth of those productions which are most likely to answer our local wants those climates for instance which engender endemic diseases are in general congenial to the growth of plants that operate as antidotes to them but if we go to the east for tea there is no reason why we should not go to the west for sugar the dyspeptic invalid however should be cautious in their use they may afford temporary benefit at the expense of permanent mischief it has been well said that the best quality of spices is to stimulate the appetite and their worst to destroy by insensible degrees the tone of the stomach the

slice of ham 1 bayleaf a little minced parsley 2 shalots 1 clove 2 blades of mace a few mushrooms when obtainable butter the yolks of 2 eggs modesoak the crumb of the rolls in milk for about 12 hour then take it out and squeeze so as to press the milk from it put the soaked bread into a stewpan with the above quantity of white stock and set it on one side then put into a separate stewpan 1 oz of butter a slice of lean ham cut small with a bayleaf herbs mushrooms spices c in the above proportions and fry them gently over a slow fire when done moisten with 2 teacupfuls of white stock boil for 20 minutes and strain the whole through a sieve over the panada in the other stewpan place it over the fire keep constantly stirring to prevent its burning and when quite dry put in a small piece of butter let this again dry up by stirring over the fire then add the yolks of 2 eggs mix well put the panada to cool on a clean plate and use it when required panada should always be well flavoured as the forcemeat receives no taste from any of the other ingredients used in its preparation boiled calfs udder for french forcemeats 421 put the udder into a stewpan with sufficient water to cover it let it stew gently till quite done when take it out to cool trim all the upper parts cut it into small pieces and pound well in a mortar till it can be rubbed through a sieve that portion which passes through the strainer is one of the three ingredients of which french forcemeats are generally composed but many cooks substitute butter for this being a less troublesome and more expeditious mode of preparation illustration pestle and mortar pestle and mortarno cookery can be perfectly performed without the aid of the useful instruments shown in the engraving for pounding things sufficiently fine they are invaluable and the use of them will save a good deal of time besides increasing the excellence of the preparations they are made of iron and in that material can be bought cheap but as these are not available for all purposes we should recommend as more economical in the end those made of wedgwood although these are considerably more expensive than the former veal quenelles 422

another of panada no 420 the same size and another of udder no 421 taking care that these three balls be of the same size it is to be remembered that equality of size and not of weight is here necessary when the three ingredients are properly prepared pound them altogether in a mortar for some time for the more quenelles are pounded the more delicate they are now moisten with the eggs whites and yolks and continue pounding adding a seasoning of pepper spices c when the whole is well blended together mould it into balls or whatever shape is intended roll them in flour and poach in boiling water to which a little salt should have been added if the quenelles are not firm enough add the yolk of another egg but omit the white which only makes them hollow and puffy inside in the preparation of this recipe it would be well to bear in mind that the ingredients are to be well pounded and seasoned and must be made hard or soft according to the dishes they are intended for for brown or white ragots they should be firm and when the quenelles are used very small extreme delicacy will be necessary in their preparation their flavour may be varied by using the flesh of rabbit fowl hare pheasant grouse or an extra quantity of mushroom parsley c timeabout 14 hour to poach in boiling water sufficient 12 lb of veal or other meat with other ingredients in proportion for 1 entre notethe french are noted for their skill in making forcemeats one of the principal causes of their superiority in this respect being that they pound all the ingredients so diligently and thoroughly

wholesome fruit ribes grossularia is thought to be indigenous to the british isles and may be occasionally found in a wild state in some of the eastern counties although when uncultivated it is but a very small and inferior berry the high state of perfection to which it has been here brought is due to the skill of the english gardeners for in no other country does it attain the same size and flavour the humidity of the british climate however has doubtless something to do with the result and it is said that gooseberries produced in scotland as far north as inverness are of a very superior character malic and citric acid blended with sugar produce the pleasant flavour of the gooseberry and upon the proper development of these properties depends the success of all cooking operations with

sometimes stewed with mustard being seasoned with a little oil and vinegar at the present day english cookery is not much indebted to this plant rumex acetosa although the french make use of it to a considerable extent it is found in most parts of great britain and also on the continent growing wild in the grass meadows and in a few gardens it is cultivated the acid of sorrel is very prononc and

for the basis of many gravies unless these are wanted very rich indeed by the addition of various store sauces thickening and flavouring the stocks here referred to may be converted into very good gravies it should be borne in mind however that the goodness and strength of spices wines flavourings c evaporate and that they lose a great deal of their fragrance if added to the gravy a long time before they are wanted if this point is attended to a saving of one half the quantity of these ingredients will be effected as with long boiling the flavour almost entirely passes away the shankbones of mutton previously well soaked will be found a great assistance in enriching gravies a kidney or melt beef skirt trimmings of meat c c answer very well when only a small quantity is wanted and as we have before observed a good gravy need not necessarily be so very expensive for economicallyprepared dishes are oftentimes found as savoury and wholesome as dearer ones the cook should also remember that the fragrance of gravies should not be overpowered by too much spice or any strong essences and that they should always be warmed in a bain marie after they are flavoured or else in a jar or jug

celery celeryas in the above recipe the roots of celery are principally used in england for flavouring soups sauces and gravies and for serving with cheese at the termination of a dinner and as an

germany celery is very highly esteemed and it is there boiled and served up as a dish by itself as well as used in the composition of mixed dishes we ourselves think that this mild aromatic plant

his weapons his quiver and his bow and to prepare for him savoury meat such as he loved that it was venison he desired the wise solomon too delighted in this kind of fare for we learn that at his table every day were served the wild ox the roebuck and the stag xenophon informs us in his history that cyrus king of persia ordered that venison should never be wanting at his repasts and of the effeminate greeks it was the delight the romans also were devoted admirers of the flesh of the deer and our own kings and princes from the great alfred down to the prince consort have hunted although it must be confessed under vastly different circumstances the swift buck and relished their haunch all the more keenly that they had borne themselves bravely in the pursuit of the animal to dry herbs for winter use 445 on a very dry day gather the herbs just before they begin to flower if this is done when the weather is damp the herbs will not be so good a colour it is very necessary to be particular in little matters like this for trifles constitute perfection and herbs nicely dried will be found very acceptable when frost and snow are on the ground it is hardly necessary however to state that the flavour and fragrance of fresh herbs are incomparably finer they should be perfectly freed from dirt and dust and be divided into small bunches with their roots cut off dry them quickly in a very hot oven or before the fire as by this means most of their flavour will be preserved and be careful not to burn them tie them up in paper bags and keep in a dry place this is a very general way of preserving dried herbs but we would recommend the plan described in a former recipe seasonablefrom the month of july to the end of september is the proper time for storing herbs for winter use herb powder for flavouring when fresh herbs are not obtainable 446 ingredients1 oz of dried lemonthyme 1 oz of dried winter savory 1 oz of dried sweet marjoram and basil 2 oz of dried parsley 1 oz of dried lemonpeel modeprepare and dry the herbs by recipe no 445 pick the leaves from the stalks pound them and sift them through a hairsieve mix in the above proportions and keep in glass bottles carefully excluding the air this we think a far better method of keeping herbs as the flavour and fragrance do not evaporate so much as when they are merely put in paper bags preparing them in this way you have them ready for use at a moments notice mint sage parsley c dried pounded and each put into separate bottles will be found very useful in winter illustration cork with wooden top corks with wooden topsthese are the best corks to use when it is indispensable that the air should not be admitted to the ingredients contained in bottles which are in constant use the top which as will be seen by the accompanying little cut is larger than the cork is made of wood and besides effectually covering the whole top of the bottle can be easily removed and again used as no corkscrew is necessary to pull it out savorythis we find described by columella a voluminous roman writer on agriculture as an odoriferous herb which in the brave days of old entered into the seasoning of nearly every dish verily there are but few new things under the sun and we dont find that we have made many discoveries in gastronomy at least beyond what was known to the ancient inhabitants of italy we possess two varieties of this aromatic herb known to naturalists as satureja they are called summer and winter savory according to the time of the year when they are fit for gathering both sorts are

in a bain marie or a jar which place in a saucepan of boiling water make it hot but do not allow it to boil or it will curdle notethis sauce is a great improvement on the oldfashioned way of serving coldscraped horseradish with hot roast beef the mixing of the cold vinegar with the warm gravy cools and spoils everything on the plate of course with cold meat the sauce should be served cold illustration the horseradish the horseradishthis has been for many years a favourite accompaniment of roast beef and is a native of england it grows wild in wet ground but has long been cultivated in the garden and is occasionally used in winter salads and in sauces on account of the great volatility of its oil it should never be preserved by drying but should be kept moist by being buried in sand so rapidly does its volatile oil evaporate that even when scraped for the table it almost immediately spoils by exposure to the air horseradish vinegar 448 ingredients14 lb of scraped horseradish 1 oz

to a proper thickness put it into a bottle with a bruised shalot at the bottom and store away for use this makes an excellent relish and if properly prepared will keep for years illustration mustard mustardbefore the year 1729 mustard was not known at english tables about that time an old woman of the name of clements residing in durham began to grind the seed in a mill and to pass the flour through several processes necessary to free the seed from its husks she kept her secret for many years to herself during which she sold large quantities of mustard throughout the country but especially in london here it was introduced to the royal table when it received the approval of george i from the circumstance of mrs clements being a resident at durham it obtained the name of durham mustard in the county of that name it is still principally cultivated and the plant is remarkable for the rapidity of its growth it is the best stimulant employed to impart strength to the digestive organs and even in its previously coarselypounded state had a high reputation with our ancestors indian pickle very superior 451 ingredientsto each gallon of vinegar allow 6 cloves of garlic 12

be well mixed with a little cold vinegar allowing the quantities named above to each gallon of vinegar pour the vinegar boiling hot over the pickle and when cold tie down with a bladder if the pickle is wanted for immediate use the vinegar should be boiled twice more but the better way is to make it during one season for use during the next it will keep for years if care is taken that the vegetables are quite covered by the vinegar this recipe was taken from the directions of a lady whose pickle was always pronounced excellent by all who tasted it and who has for many years exactly followed the recipe given above notefor small families perhaps the above quantity of pickle will be considered too large but this may be decreased at pleasure taking care to properly proportion the various ingredients illustration india pickle keeping picklesnothing shows more perhaps the difference between a tidy thrifty housewife and a lady to whom these desirable epithets may not honestly be applied than the appearance of their respective storeclosets the former is able the moment anything is wanted to put her hand on it at once no time is lost no vexation incurred no dish spoilt for the want of just little somethingthe latter on the contrary hunts all over her cupboard for the ketchup the cook requires or the pickle the husband thinks he should like a little of with his cold roast beef or muttonchop and vainly seeks for the embden groats or arrowroot to make one of her little boys some gruel one plan then we strenuously advise all who do not follow to begin at once and that is to label all their various pickles and store sauces in the same way as the cut here shows it will occupy a little time at first but there will be economy of it in the long run vinegarthis term is derived from the two french words vin aigre sour wine and should therefore be strictly applied to that which is made only from wine as the acid is the same however it is procured that made from ale also takes the same name nearly all ancient nations were acquainted with the use of vinegar we learn in ruth that the reapers in the east soaked their bread in it to freshen it the romans kept large quantities of it in their cellars using it to a great extent in their seasonings and sauces this people attributed very beneficial qualities to it as it was supposed to be digestive antibilious and antiscorbutic as well as refreshing spartianus a latin historian tells us that mixed with water it was the drink of the soldiers and that thanks to this beverage the veterans of the roman army braved by its use the inclemency and variety of all the different seasons and climates of europe asia and africa it is said the spanish peasantry and other inhabitants of the southern parts of europe still

quantity of gravy the sediment may also be bottled for immediate use and will be found to answer for flavouring thick soups or gravies how to distinguish mushrooms from toadstoolsthe cultivated mushroom known as agaricus campestris may be distinguished from other poisonous kinds of fungi by its having pink or fleshcoloured gills or underside and by its invariably having an agreeable smell which the toadstool has not when young mushrooms are like a small round button both the stalk and head being white as they grow larger they expand their heads by degrees into a flat form the gills underneath being at first of a pale fleshcolour but becoming as they stand longer dark brown or blackish nearly all the poisonous kinds are brown and have in general a rank and putrid smell edible mushrooms are found in closelyfed pastures but seldom grow in woods where most of the poisonous sorts are to be found to dry mushrooms 473 modewipe them clean take away the brown part and peel off the skin lay them on sheets of paper to dry in a cool oven when they will shrivel considerably keep them in paper bags which hang in a dry place when wanted for use put them into cold gravy bring them

history of the onionit is not supposed that any variety of the onion is indigenous to britain as when the large and mild roots imported from warmer climates have been cultivated in these islands a few years they deteriorate both in size and sweetness it is therefore most likely that this plant was first introduced into england from continental europe and that it originally was produced in a

mankind in the art of cookery the probability being that the human race for a long period lived wholly on fruits mans means of attacking animals even if he had the desire of slaughtering them were very limited until he acquired the use of arms he however made weapons for himself and impelled by a carnivorous instinct made prey of the animals that surrounded him it is natural that man should seek to feed on flesh he has too small a stomach to be supported alone by fruit which has not sufficient nourishment to renovate him it is possible he might subsist on vegetables but their preparation needs the knowledge of art only to be obtained after the lapse of many centuries mans first weapons were the branches of trees which were succeeded by bows and arrows and it is worthy of remark that these latter weapons have been found with the natives of all climates and latitudes it is singular how this idea presented itself to individuals so differently placed 541 brillat savarin says that raw flesh has but one inconveniencefrom its viscousness it attaches itself to the teeth he goes on to say that it is not however disagreeable but when seasoned with salt that it is easily digested he tells a story of a croat captain whom he invited to dinner in 1815 during the occupation of paris by the allied troops this officer was amazed at his hosts preparations and said when we are campaigning and get hungry we knock over the first animal we find cut off a steak powder it with salt which we always have in the sabretasche put it under the saddle gallop over it for half a mile and then dine like princes again of the huntsmen of dauphiny it is said that when they are out shooting in september they take with them both pepper and salt if they kill a very fat bird they pluck and season it and after carrying it some time in their caps eat it this they declare is the best way of serving it up 542 subsequently to the croat mode which doubtless was in fashion in the earlier ages of the world fire was discovered this was an accident for fire is not although we are accustomed to call it so an element or spontaneous many savage nations have been found utterly ignorant of it and many races had no other way of dressing their food than by exposing it to the rays of the sun 543 the inhabitants of the marian islands which were discovered in 1521 had no idea of fire never was astonishment greater than theirs when they first saw it on the descent of magellan the navigator on one of their isles at first they thought it a kind of animal that fixed itself to and fed upon wood some of them who approached too near being burnt the rest were terrified and durst only look upon it at a distance they were afraid they said of being bit or lest that dreadful animal should wound with his violent respiration and dreadful breath for these were the first notions they formed of the heat and flame such too probably were the notions the greeks originally formed of them 544 fire having been discovered mankind endeavoured to make use of it for drying and afterwards for cooking their meat but they were a considerable time before they hit upon proper and commodious methods of employing it in the preparation of their food 545 meat then placed on burning fuel was found better than when raw it had more firmness was eaten with less difficulty and the ozmazome being condensed by the carbonization gave it a pleasing perfume and flavour still however the meat cooked on the coal would become somewhat befouled certain portions of the fuel adhering to it this disadvantage was remedied by passing spits through it and placing it at a suitable height above the burning fuel thus grilling was invented and it is well known that simple as is this mode of cookery yet all meat cooked in this way is richly and pleasantly flavoured in homers time the art of cookery had not advanced much beyond this for we read in the iliad how the great achilles and his friend patroclus regaled the three grecian leaders on bread wine and broiled meat it is noticeable too that homer does not speak of boiled meat anywhere in his poems later however the jews coming out of their captivity in egypt had made much greater progress they undoubtedly possessed kettles and in one of these esaus mess of pottage for which he sold his birthright must have been prepared 546 having thus briefly traced a history of gastronomical progresses we will now proceed to describe the various methods of cooking meat and make a few observations on the chemical changes which occur in each of the operations 547 in this country plain boiling roasting and baking are the usual methods of cooking animal food to explain the philosophy of these simple culinary operations we must advert to the effects that are produced by heat on the principal constituents of flesh when finelychopped mutton or beef is steeped for some time in a small quantity of clean water and then subjected to slight pressure the juice of the meat is extracted and there is left a white tasteless residue consisting chiefly of muscular fibres when this residue is heated to between 158 and 177 fahrenheit the fibres shrink together and become hard and horny the influence of an elevated temperature on the soluble extract of flesh is not less remarkable when the watery infusion which contains all the savoury constituents of the meat is gradually heated it soon becomes turbid and when the temperature reaches 133 flakes of whitish matter separate these flakes are albumen a substance precisely similar in all its properties to the white of egg see no 101 when the temperature of the watery extract is raised to 158 the colouring matter of the blood coagulates and the liquid which was originally tinged red by this substance is left perfectly clear and almost colourless when evaporated even at a gentle heat this residual liquid gradually becomes brown and acquires the flavour of roast meat 548 these interesting facts discovered in the laboratory throw a flood of light upon the mysteries of the kitchen the fibres of meat are surrounded by a liquid which contains albumen in its soluble state just as it exists in the unboiled egg during the operation of boiling or roasting this substance coagulates and thereby prevents the contraction and hardening of the fibres the tenderness of wellcooked meat is consequently proportioned to the amount of albumen deposited in its substance meat is underdone when it has been heated throughout only to the temperature of coagulating albumen it is thoroughly done when it has been heated through its whole mass to the temperature at which the colouring matter of the blood coagulates it is overdone when the heat has been continued long enough to harden the fibres 549 the juice of flesh is water holding in solution many substances besides albumen which are of the highest possible value as articles of food in preparing meat for the table great care should be taken to prevent the escape of this precious juice as the succulence and sapidity of the meat depend on its retention the meat to be cooked should be exposed at first to a quick heat which immediately coagulates the albumen on and near the surface a kind of shell is thus formed which effectually retains the whole of the juice within the meat 550 during the operations of boiling boasting and baking fresh beef and mutton when moderately fat lose according to johnston on an average about in boiling in baking in roasting 4 lbs of beef lose 1 lb 1 lb 3 oz 1 lb 5 oz 4 lbs of mutton lose 14 oz 1 lb 4 oz 1 lb 6 oz baking illustration baking dish 551 the difference between roasting meat and baking it may be generally described as consisting in the fact that in baking it the fumes caused by the operation are not carried off in the same way as occurs in roasting much however of this disadvantage is obviated by the improved construction of modern ovens and of especially those in connection with the leamington kitchener of which we give an engraving here and a full description of which will be seen at paragraph no 65 with the prices at which they can be purchased of messrs r and j slack of the strand with meat baked in the generality of ovens however which do not possess ventilators on the principle of this kitchener there is undoubtedly a peculiar taste which does not at all equal the flavour developed by roasting meat the chemistry of baking may be said to be the same as that described in roasting 552 should the oven be very brisk it will be found necessary to cover the joint with a piece of white paper to prevent the meat from being scorched and blackened outside before the heat can penetrate into the inside this paper should be removed half an hour before the time of serving dinner so that the joint may take a good colour 553 by means of a jar many dishes which will be enumerated under their special heads may be economically prepared in the oven the principal of these are soup gravies jugged hare beef tea and this mode of cooking may be advantageously adopted with a ham which has previously been covered with a common crust of flour and water 554 all dishes prepared for baking should be more highly seasoned than when intended to be roasted there are some dishes which it may be said are at least equally well cooked in the oven as by the roaster thus a shoulder of mutton and baked potatoes a fillet or breast of veal a sucking pig a hare well basted will be received by connoisseurs as well when baked as if they had been roasted indeed the bakers oven or the family oven may often as has been said be substituted for the cook and the spit with greater economy and convenience 555 a bakingdish of which we give an engraving should not be less than 6 or 7 inches deep so that the meat which of course cannot be basted can stew in its own juices in the recipe for each dish full explanations concerning any special points in relation to it will be given boiling 556 boiling or the preparation of meat by hot water though one of the easiest processes in cookery requires skilful management boiled meat should be tender savoury and full of its own juice or natural gravy but through the carelessness and ignorance of cooks it is too often sent to table hard tasteless and innutritious to insure a successful result in boiling flesh the heat of the fire must be judiciously regulated the proper quantity of water must be kept up in the pot and the scum which rises to the surface must be carefully removed 557 many writers on cookery assert that the meat to be boiled should be put into cold water and that the pot should be heated gradually but liebig the highest authority on all matters connected with the chemistry of food has shown that meat so treated loses some of its most nutritious constituents if the flesh says the great chemist be introduced into the boiler when the water is in a state of brisk ebullition and if the boiling be kept up for a few minutes and the pot then placed in a warm place so that the temperature of the water is kept at 158 to 165 we have the united conditions for giving to the flesh the qualities which best fit it for being eaten when a piece of meat is plunged into boiling water the albumen which is near the surface immediately coagulates forming an envelope which prevents the escape of the internal juice and most effectually excludes the water which by mixing with this juice would render the meat insipid meat treated thus is juicy and wellflavoured when cooked as it retains most of its savoury constituents on the other hand if the piece of meat be set on the fire with cold water and this slowly heated to boiling the flesh undergoes a loss of soluble and nutritious substances while as a matter of course the soup becomes richer in these matters the albumen is gradually dissolved from the surface to the centre the fibre loses more or less its quality of shortness or tenderness and becomes hard and tough the thinner the piece of meat is the greater is its loss of savoury constituents in order to obtain wellflavoured and eatable meat we must relinquish the idea of making good soup from it as that mode of boiling which yields the best soup gives the driest toughest and most vapid meat slow boiling whitens the meat and we suspect that it is on this account that it is in such favour with the cooks the wholesomeness of food is however a matter of much greater moment than the appearance it presents on the table it should be borne in mind that the whiteness of meat that has been boiled slowly is produced by the loss of some important alimentary properties 558 the objections we have raised to the practice of putting meat on the fire in cold water apply with equal force to the practice of soaking meat before cooking it which is so strongly recommended by some cooks fresh meat ought never to be soaked as all its most nutritive constituents are soluble in water soaking however is an operation that cannot be entirely dispensed with in the preparation of animal food salted and dried meats require to be soaked for some time in water before they are cooked 559 for boiling meat the softer the water is the better when spring water is boiled the chalk which gives to it the quality of hardness is precipitated this chalk stains the meat and communicates to it an unpleasant earthy taste when nothing but hard water can be procured it should be softened by boiling it for an hour or two before it is used for culinary purposes 560 the fire must be watched with great attention during the operation of boiling so that its heat may be properly regulated as a rule the pot should be kept in a simmering state a result which cannot be attained without vigilance 561 the temperature at which water boils under usual circumstances is 212 fahr water does not become hotter after it has begun to boil however long or with whatever violence the boiling is continued this fact is of great importance in cookery and attention to it will save much fuel water made to boil in a gentle way by the application of a moderate heat is just as hot as when it is made to boil on a strong fire with the greatest possible violence when once water has been brought to the boiling point the fire may be considerably reduced as a very gentle heat will suffice to keep the water at its highest temperature 562 the scum which rises to the surface of the pot during the operation of boiling must be carefully removed otherwise it will attach itself to the meat and thereby spoil its appearance the cook must not neglect to skim during the whole process though by far the greater part of the scum rises at first the practice of wrapping meat in a cloth may be dispensed with if the skimming be skillfully managed if the scum be removed as fast as it rises the meat will be cooked clean and pure and come out of the vessel in which it was boiled much more delicate and firm than when cooked in a cloth 563 when taken from the pot the meat must be wiped with a clean cloth or what will be found more convenient a sponge previously dipped in water and wrung dry the meat should not be allowed to stand a moment longer than necessary as boiled meat as well as roasted cannot be eaten too hot 564 the time allowed for the operation of boiling must be regulated according to the size and quality of the meat as a general rule twenty minutes reckoning from the moment when the boiling commences may be allowed for every pound of meat all the best authorities however agree in this that the longer the boiling the more perfect the operation 565 a few observations on the nutritive value of salted meat may be properly introduced in this place every housewife knows that dry salt in contact with fresh meat gradually becomes fluid brine the application of salt causes the fibres of the meat to contract and the juice to flow out from its pores as much as onethird of the juice of the meat is often forced out in this manner now as this juice is pure extract of meat containing albumen osmazome and other valuable principles it follows that meat which has been preserved by the action of salt can never have the nutritive properties of fresh meat 566 the vessels used for boiling should be made of castiron well tinned within and provided with closelyfitting lids they must be kept scrupulously clean otherwise they will render the meat cooked in them unsightly and unwholesome copper pans if used at all should be reserved for operations that are performed with rapidity as by long contact with copper food may become dangerously contaminated the kettle in which a joint is dressed should be large enough to allow room for a good supply of water if the meat be cramped and be surrounded with but little water it will be stewed not boiled 567 in stewing it is not requisite to have so great a heat as in boiling a gentle simmering in a small quantity of water so that the meat is stewed almost in its own juices is all that is necessary it is a method much used on the continent and is wholesome and economical illustration boilingpot illustration stewpan two useful culinary vessels are represented above one is a boilingpot in which large joints may be boiled the other is a stewpan with a closelyfitting lid to which is attached a long handle so that the cover can be removed without scalding the fingers illustration hotplate 568 the hotplate is a modern improvement on the old kitchen ranges being used for boiling and stewing it is a plate of cast iron having a closed fire burning beneath it by which it is thoroughly well heated on this plate are set the various saucepans stewpans c and by this convenient and economical method a number of dishes may be prepared at one time the culinary processes of braising and stewing are in this manner rendered more gradual and consequently the substance acted on becomes more tender and the gravy is not so much reduced broiling illustration revolving gridiron 569 generally speaking small dishes only are prepared by this mode of cooking amongst these the beefsteak and mutton chop of the solitary english diner may be mentioned as celebrated all the world over our beefsteak indeed has long crossed the channel and with a view of pleasing the britons there is in every carte at every french restaurant by the side of la marengo and la mayonnaisebifteck dangleterre in order to succeed in a broil the cook must have a bright clear fire so that the surface of the meat may be quickly heated the result of this is the same as that obtained in roasting namely that a crust so to speak is formed outside and thus the juices of the meat are retained the appetite of an invalid so difficult to minister to is often pleased with a broiled dish as the flavour and sapidity of the meat are so well preserved 570 the utensils used for broiling need but little description the common gridiron for which see engraving at no 68 is the same as it has been for ages past although some little variety has been introduced into its manufacture by the addition of grooves to the bars by means of which the liquid fat is carried into a small trough one point it is well to bear in mind viz that the gridiron should be kept in a direction slanting towards the cook so that as little fat as possible may fall into the fire it has been observed that broiling is the most difficult manual office the general cook has to perform and one that requires the most unremitting attention for she may turn her back upon the stewpan or the spit but the gridiron can never be left with impunity the revolving gridiron shown in the engraving possesses some advantages of convenience which will be at once apparent frying illustration saut pan 571 this very favourite mode of cooking may be accurately described as boiling in fat or oil substances dressed in this way are generally well received for they introduce an agreeable variety possessing as they do a peculiar flavour by means of frying cooks can soon satisfy many requisitions made on them it being a very expeditious mode of preparing dishes for the table and one which can be employed when the fire is not sufficiently large for the purposes of roasting and boiling the great point to be borne in mind in frying is that the liquid must be hot enough to act instantaneously as all the merit of this culinary operation lies in the invasion of the boiling liquid which carbonizes or burns at the very instant of the immersion of the body placed in it it may be ascertained if the fat is heated to the proper degree by cutting a piece of bread and dipping it in the fryingpan for five or six seconds and if it be firm and of a dark brown when taken out put in immediately what you wish to prepare if it be not let the fat be heated until of the right temperature this having been effected moderate the fire so that the action may not be too hurried and that by a continuous heat the juices of the substance may be preserved and its flavour enhanced 572 the philosophy of frying consists in this that liquids subjected to the action of fire do not all receive the same quantity of heat being differently constituted in their nature they possess different capacities for caloric thus you may with impunity dip your finger in boiling spirits of wine you would take it very quickly from boiling brandy yet more rapidly from water whilst the effects of the most rapid immersion in boiling oil need not be told as a consequence of this heated fluids act differently on the sapid bodies presented to them those put in water dissolve and are reduced to a soft mass the result being bouillon stock c see no 103 those substances on the contrary treated with oil harden assume a more or less deep colour and are finally carbonized the reason of these different results is that in the first instance water dissolves and extracts the interior juices of the alimentary substances placed in it whilst in the second the juices are preserved for they are insoluble in oil 573 it is to be especially remembered in connection with frying that all dishes fried in fat should be placed before the fire on a piece of blottingpaper or sieve reversed and there left for a few minutes so that any superfluous greasy moisture may be removed 574 the utensils used for the purposes of frying are confined to fryingpans although these are of various sizes and for small and delicate dishes such as collops fritters pancakes c the saut pan of which we give an engraving is used cooking by gas illustration gas stove 575 gascooking can scarcely now be considered a noveltymany establishments both small and large have been fitted with apparatus for cooking by this mode which undoubtedly exhibits some advantages thus the heat may be more regularly supplied to the substance cooking and the operation is essentially a clean one because there can be no cinders or other dirt to be provided for some labour and attention necessary too with a coal fire or close stove may be saved and besides this it may perhaps be said that culinary operations are reduced by this means to something like a certainty 576 there are however we think many objections to this mode of cooking more especially when applied to small domestic establishments for instance the ingenious machinery necessary for carrying it out requires cooks perfectly conversant with its use and if the gas when the cooking operations are finished be not turned off there will be a large increase in the cost of cooking instead of the economy which it has been supposed to bring for large establishments such as some of the immense london warehouses where a large number of young men have to be catered for daily it may be well adapted as it is just possible that a slight increase in the supply of gas necessary for a couple of joints may serve equally to cook a dozen dishes roasting 577 of the various methods of preparing meat roasting is that which most effectually preserves its nutritive qualities meat is roasted by being exposed to the direct influence of the fire this is done by placing the meat before an open grate and keeping it in motion to prevent the scorching on any particular part when meat is properly roasted the outer layer of its albumen is coagulated and thus presents a barrier to the exit of the juice in roasting meat the heat must be strongest at first and it should then be much reduced to have a good juicy roast therefore the fire must be red and vigorous at the very commencement of the operation in the most careful roasting some of the juice is squeezed out of the meat this evaporates on the surface of the meat and gives it a dark brown colour a rich lustre and a strong aromatic taste besides these effects on the albumen and the expelled juice roasting converts the cellular tissue of the meat into gelatine and melts the fat out of the fatcells 578 if a spit is used to support the meat before the fire it should be kept quite bright sand and water ought to be used to scour it with for brickdust and oil may give a disagreeable taste to the meat when well scoured it must be wiped quite dry with a clean cloth and in spitting the meat the prime parts should be left untouched so as to avoid any great escape of its juices 579 kitchens in large establishments are usually fitted with what are termed smokejacks by means of these several spits if required may be turned at the same time this not being of course necessary in smaller establishments a roasting apparatus more economical in its consumption of coal is more frequently in use illustration bottlejack with wheel and hook 580 the bottlejack of which we here give an illustration with the wheel and hook and showing the precise manner of using it is now commonly used in many kitchens this consists of a spring inclosed in a brass cylinder and requires winding up before it is used and sometimes also during the operation of roasting the joint is fixed to an iron hook which is suspended by a chain connected with a wheel and which in its turn is connected with the bottlejack beneath it stands the drippingpan which we have also engraved together with the bastingladle the use of which latter should not be spared as there can be no good roast without good basting spare the rod and spoil the child might easily be paraphrased into spare the basting and spoil the meat if the joint is small and light and so turns unsteadily this may be remedied by fixing to the wheel one of the kitchen weights sometimes this jack is fixed inside a screen but there is this objection to this apparatusthat the meat cooked in it resembles the flavour of baked meat this is derived from its being so completely surrounded with the tin that no sufficient current of air gets to it it will be found preferable to make use of a common meatscreen such as is shown in the woodcut this contains shelves for warming plates and dishes and with this the reflection not being so powerful and more air being admitted to the joint the roast may be very excellently cooked illustration drippingpan and bastingladle 581 in stirring the fire or putting fresh coals on it the drippingpan should always be drawn back so that there may be no danger of the coal cinders or ashes falling down into it 582 under each particular recipe there is stated the time required for roasting each joint but as a general rule it may be here given that for every pound of meat in ordinarysized joints a quarter of an hour may be allotted illustration heatscreen 583 white meats and the meat of young animals require to be very well roasted both to be pleasant to the palate and easy of digestion thus veal pork and lamb should be thoroughly done to the centre 584 mutton and beef on the other hand do not generally speaking require to be so thoroughly done and they should be dressed to the point that in carving them the gravy should just run but not too freely of course in this as in most other dishes the tastes of individuals vary and there are many who cannot partake with satisfaction of any joint unless it is what others would call overdressed illustration illustration quadrupeds chapter xii general observations on quadrupeds 585 by the general assent of mankind the empire of nature has been divided into three kingdoms the first consisting of minerals the second of vegetables and the third of animals the mineral kingdom comprises all substances which are without those organs necessary to locomotion and the due performance of the functions of life they are composed of the accidental aggregation of particles which under certain circumstances take a constant and regular figure but which are more frequently found without any definite conformation they also occupy the interior parts of the earth as well as compose those huge masses by which we see the land in some parts guarded against the encroachments of the sea the vegetable kingdom covers and beautifies the earth with an endless variety of form and colour it consists of organized bodies but destitute of the power of locomotion they are nourished by means of roots they breathe by means of leaves and propagate by means of seed dispersed within certain limits the animal kingdom consists of sentient beings that enliven the external parts of the earth they possess the powers of voluntary motion respire air and are forced into action by the cravings of hunger or the parching of thirst by the instincts of animal passion or by pain like the vegetable kingdom they are limited within the boundaries of certain countries by the conditions of climate and soil and some of the species prey upon each other linnaeus has divided them into six classesmammalia birds fishes amphibious animals insects and worms the three latter do not come within the limits of our domain of fishes we have already treated of birds we shall treat and of mammalia we will now treat 586 this class of animals embraces all those that nourish their young by means of lacteal glands or teats and are so constituted as to have a warm or red blood in it the whale is placedan order which from external habits has usually been classed with the fishes but although this animal exclusively inhabits the water and is supplied with fins it nevertheless exhibits a striking alliance to quadrupeds it has warm blood and produces its young alive it nourishes them with milk and for that purpose is furnished with teats it is also supplied with lungs and two auricles and two ventricles to the heart all of which bring it still closer into an alliance with the quadrupedal species of the animal kingdom 587 the general characteristics of the mammalia have been frequently noticed the bodies of nearly the whole species are covered with hair a kind of clothing which is both soft and warm little liable to injury and bestowed in proportion to the necessities of the animal and the nature of the climate it inhabits in all the higher orders of animals the head is the principal seat of the organs of sense it is there that the eyes the ears the nose and the mouth are placed through the last they receive their nourishment in it are the teeth which in most of the mammalia are used not only for the mastication of food but as weapons of offence they are inserted into two movable bones called jaws and the front teeth are so placed that their sharp edges may easily be brought in contact with their food in order that its fibres may readily be separated next to these on each side are situated the canine teeth or tusks which are longer than the other teeth and being pointed are used to tear the food in the back jaws are placed another form of teeth called grinders these are for masticating the food and in those animals that live on vegetables they are flattened at the top but in carnivora their upper surfaces are furnished with sharppointed protuberances from the numbers form and disposition of the teeth the various genera of quadrupeds have been arranged the nose is a cartilaginous body pierced with two holes which are called nostrils through these the animal is affected by the sense of smell and in some it is prominent whilst in others it is flat compressed turned upwards or bent downwards in beasts of prey it is frequently longer than the lips and in some other animals it is elongated into a movable trunk or proboscis whilst in the rhinoceros tribe it is armed with a horn the eyes of quadrupeds are generally defended by movable lids on the outer margins of which are fringes of hair called eyelashes the opening of the pupil is in general circular but to some species as in those of the cat and hare it is contracted into a perpendicular line whilst in the horse the ox and a few others it forms a transverse bar the ears are openings generally accompanied with a cartilage which defends and covers them called the external ears in wateranimals the latter are wanting sound in them being transmitted merely through orifices in the head which have the name of auditoryholes the most defenceless animals are extremely delicate in the sense of hearing as are likewise most beasts of prey most of the mammiferous animals walk on four feet which at the extremities are usually divided into toes or fingers in some however the feet end in a single corneous substance called a hoof the toes of a few end in broad flat nails and of most others in pointed claws some again have the toes connected by a membrane which is adapted to those that are destined to pass a considerable portion of their lives in water others again as in the bat have the digitations of the anterior feet greatly elongated the intervening space being filled by a membrane which extends round the hinder legs and tail and by means of which they are enabled to rise into the air in man the hand alone comprises fingers separate free and flexible but apes and some other kinds of animals have fingers both to the hands and feet these therefore are the only animals that can hold movable objects in a single hand others such as rats and squirrels have the fingers sufficiently small and flexible to enable them to pick up objects but they are compelled to hold them in both hands others again have the toes shorter and must rest on the forefeet as is the case with dogs and cats when they wish to hold a substance firmly on the ground with their paws there are still others that have their toes united and drawn under the skin or enveloped in corneous hoofs and are thereby enabled to exercise no prehensile power whatever 588 according to the design and end of nature mammiferous animals are calculated when arrived at maturity to subsist on various kinds of foodsome to live wholly upon flesh others upon grain herbs or fruits but in their infant state milk is the appropriate food of the whole that this food may never fail them it is universally ordained that the young should no sooner come into the world than the milk should flow in abundance into the members with which the mother is supplied for the secretion of that nutritious fluid by a wonderful instinct of nature too the young animal almost as soon as it has come into life searches for the teat and knows perfectly at the first how by the process of suction it will be able to extract the fluid necessary to its existence 589 in the general economy of nature this class of animals seems destined to preserve a constant equilibrium in the number of animated beings that hold their existence on the surface of the earth to man they are immediately useful in various ways some of their bodies afford him food their skin shoes and their fleece clothes some of them unite with him in participating the dangers of combat with an enemy and others assist him in the chase in exterminating wilder sorts or banishing them from the haunts of civilization many indeed are injurious to him but most of them in some shape or other he turns to his service of these there is none he has made more subservient to his purposes than the common ox of which there is scarcely a part that he has not been able to convert into some useful purpose of the horns he makes drinkingvessels knifehandles combs and boxes and when they are softened by means of boiling water he fashions them into transparent plates for lanterns this invention is ascribed to king alfred who is said to have been the first to use them to preserve his candle timemeasures from the wind glue is made of the cartilages gristles and the finer pieces of the parings and cuttings of the hides their bone is a cheap substitute for ivory the thinnest of the calfskins are manufactured into vellum their blood is made the basis of prussian blue and saddlers use a fine sort of thread prepared from their sinews the hair is used in various valuable manufactures the suet fat and tallow are moulded into candles and the milk and cream of the cow yield butter and cheese thus is every part of this animal valuable to man who has spared no pains to bring it to the highest state of perfection illustration shorthorn cow illustration shorthorn bull 590 among the various breeds of the ox upon which man has bestowed his highest powers of culture there is now none takes a higher place than that known by the name of shorthorns from the earliest ages great britain has been distinguished for the excellence of her native breeds of cattle and there are none in england that have obtained greater celebrity than those which have this name and which originated about seventy years ago on the banks of the tees thence they have spread into the valleys of the tweed thence to the lothians in scotland and southward into the fine pastures of england they are now esteemed the most profitable breed of cattle as there is no animal which attains sooner to maturity and none that supplies meat of a superior quality the value of some of the improved breeds is something enormous at the sale of mr charles colling a breeder in yorkshire in 1810 his bull comet sold for 1000 guineas at the sale of earl spencers herd in 1846 104 cows heifers and calves with nineteen bulls fetched 8468 5s being an average of 68 17s apiece the value of such animals is scarcely to be estimated by those who are unacquainted with the care with which they are tended and with the anxious attention which is paid to the purity of their breed a modern writer well acquainted with this subject says there are now at least five hundred herds large and small in this kingdom and from six to seven thousand head registered every alternate year in the herdbook the necessity for thus recording the breeds is greater than might at first sight be imagined as it tends directly to preserve the character of the cattle while it sometimes adds to the value and reputation of the animal thus entered besides many of the americans and large purchasers for the foreign market will not look at an animal without the breeder has taken care to qualify him for such reference of shorthorned stock there is annually sold from 40000 to 50000 worth by public auction independent of the vast numbers disposed of by private contract the brood is highly prized in belgium prussia france italy and russia it is imported into most of the british colonies and is greatly esteemed both for its meat and its dairy produce wherever it is known the quickness with which it takes on flesh and the weight which it frequently makes are well known but we may mention that it is not uncommon to tee steers of from four to five years old realize a weight of from 800 to 1000 lbs such animals command from the butcher from 30 to 40 per head according to the quality whilst others of two or three years old and of course of less weight bring as much as 20 apiece illustration longhorn bull illustration longhorn cow 591 longhornsthis is the prevailing breed in our midland counties and in ireland but they are greatly inferior to the shorthorns and are fast being supplanted by them even where they have been cultivated with the nicest care and brought to the greatest perfection they are inferior to the others and must ultimately be driven from the farm illustration alderney cow illustration alderney bull 592 the alderneyamong the dairy breeds of england the alderney takes a prominent place not on account of the quantity of milk which it yields but on account of the excellent quality of the cream and butter which are produced from it its docility is marvellous and in appearance it greatly resembles the ayrshire breed of scotland the excellence of which is supposed to be in some degree derived from a mixture of the alderney blood with that breed the distinction between them however lies both in the quantity and quality of the milk which they severally produce that of the alderney being rich in quality and that of the ayrshire abundant in quantity the merit of the former however ends with its milk for as a grazer it is worthless illustration galloway bull illustration galloway cow 593 scottish breedsof these the kyloe which belongs to the highlands of scotland the galloway which has been called the kyloe without horns and the ayrshire are the breeds most celebrated the first has kept his place and on account of the compactness of his form and the excellent quality of his flesh he is a great favourite with butchers who have a select family trade it is alike unsuitable for the dairy and the arable farm but in its native highlands it attains to great perfection thriving upon the scanty and coarse herbage which it gathers on the sides of the mountains the galloway has a larger frame and when fattened makes excellent beef but it has given place to the shorthorns in its native district where turniphusbandry is pursued with advantage the ayrshire is peculiarly adapted for the dairy and for the abundance of its milk cannot be surpassed in its native district in this it stands unrivalled and there is no other breed capable of converting the produce of a poor soil into such fine butter and cheese it is difficult to fatten however and its beef is of a coarse quality we have chosen these as among the principal representative breeds of the ox species but there are other breeds which at all events have a local if not a general celebrity illustration side of beef showing the several joints 594 the general mode of slaughtering oxen in this country is by striking them a smart blow with a hammer or poleaxe on the head a little above the eyes by this means when the blow is skilfully given the beast is brought down at one blow and to prevent recovery a cane is generally inserted by which the spinal cord is perforated which instantly deprives the ox of all sensation of pain in spain and some other countries on the continent it is also usual to deprive oxen of life by the operation of pithing or dividing the spinal cord in the neck close to the back part of the head this is in effect the same mode as is practised in the celebrated spanish bullfights by the matador and it is instantaneous in depriving the animal of sensation if the operator be skilful we hope and believe that those men whose disagreeable duty it is to slaughter the beasts of the field to provide meat for mankind inflict as little punishment and cause as little suffering as possible 595 the manner in which a side of beef is cut up in london is shown in the engraving on this page in the metropolis on account of the large number of its population possessing the means to indulge in the best of everything the demand for the most delicate joints of meat is great the price at the same time being much higher for these than for the other parts the consequence is that in london the carcass is there divided so as to obtain the greatest quantity of meat on the most esteemed joints in many places however where from a greater equality in the social condition and habits of the inhabitants the demand and prices for the different parts of the carcasses are more equalized there is not the same reason for the butcher to cut the best joints so large 596 the meat on those parts of the animal in which the muscles are least called into action is most tender and succulent as for instance along the back from the rump to the hinder part of the shoulder whilst the limbs shoulder and neck are the toughest driest and leastesteemed 597 the names of

but it is not so agreeable as that of the ox although that of a heifer is held in high estimation the flesh of the smaller breeds is much sweeter than that of the larger which is best when the animal

sufficient for 6 persons seasonable all the year but more suitable in winter notebeefsteak pudding may be very much enriched by adding a few oysters or mushrooms the above recipe was contributed to this work by a sussex lady in which county the inhabitants are noted for their savoury puddings it differs from the general way of making them as the meat is cut up into very small pieces and the basin is differently shaped on trial this pudding will be found far nicer and more full of gravy than when laid in large pieces in the dish bad meat in the flesh of animals slaughtered whilst suffering acute inflammation or fever the hollow fibres or capillaries as they are called which form the substance of the lyer are filled with congested and unassimilated animal fluid which from its impurity gives the lyer a dark colour and produces a tendency to rapid putrefaction in a more advanced stage of such disease serous and sometimes purulent matter is formed in the cellular tissues between the muscles of the flesh and when such is the case nothing can be more poisonous than such abominable carrion in the flesh of animals killed whilst under the influence of any disease of an emaciating effect the lyer adheres but slightly to the bones with its fibres contracted and dry and the little fat that there may be is friable and shrunk within its integuments the flesh of animals slaughtered whilst under considerable depression of vital energy as from previous bleeding has a diminished tendency to stiffen after death the feebleness of this tendency being in proportion to the degree of depression it presents also an unnatural blue or pallid appearance has a faint and slightly sour smell and soon becomes putrid when an animal has died otherwise than by slaughtering its flesh is flaccid and clammy emits a peculiar faint and disagreeable smell and it need scarcely be added spontaneous decomposition proceeds very rapidly beefsteaks with fried potatoes or biftek aux

it boil up quickly now draw the pot to the side of the fire and let the process be very gradual as the water must only simmer or the meat will be hard and tough carefully remove the scum from the surface of the water and continue doing this for a few minutes after it first boils carrots and turnips are served with this dish and sometimes suet dumplings which may be boiled with the beef garnish

lbs for 7 or 8 persons seasonable all the year but best from september to march notethe liquor in which the meat has been boiled may be easily converted into a very excellent peasoup it will require very few vegetables as it will be impregnated with the flavour of those boiled with the meat the action of salt on meatthe manner in which salt acts in preserving meat is not difficult to understand by its strong affinity it in the first place extracts the juices from the substance of meat in sufficient quantity to form a saturated solution with the water contained in the juice and the meat then absorbs the saturated brine in place of the juice extracted by the salt in this way matter incapable of putrefaction takes the places of that portion in the meat which is most perishable such however is not the only office of salt as a means of preserving meat it acts also by its astringency in contracting the fibres of the muscles and so excludes the action of air on the interior of the substance of the meat the lastmentioned operation of salt as an antiseptic is evinced by the diminution of the volume of meat to which it is applied the astringent action of saltpetre on meat is much greater than that of salt and thereby renders meat to which it is applied very hard but in small quantities it considerably assists the antiseptic action of salt and also prevents the destruction of the florid colour of meat which is caused by the application of salt thus it will be perceived from the foregoing statement that the application of salt and saltpetre diminishes in a considerable degree the nutritive and to some extent the wholesome qualities of meat and therefore in their use the quantity applied should be as small as possible consistent with the perfect preservation of the meat boiled round of beef 608 ingredientsbeef water modeas a whole round of beef generally speaking is too large for small families and very seldom required we here give the recipe for dressing a portion of the silver side of the round take from 12 to 16 lbs after it has been in salt about 10 days just wash off the salt skewer it up in a nice roundlooking form and bind it with tape to keep the skewers in their places put it in a saucepan of boiling water as in the preceding recipe set it upon a good fire and when it begins to boil carefully remove all scum from the surface as if this is not attended to it sinks on to the meat and when brought to table presents a very unsightly appearance when it is well skimmed draw the pot to the corner of the fire and let it simmer very gently until done remove the tape and skewers which should be replaced by a silver one pour over a little of the potliquor and garnish with carrots see coloured plate 2 carrots turnips parsnips and sometimes suet dumplings accompany this dish and these may all be boiled with the beef the potliquor should be saved and converted into peasoup and the outside slices which are generally hard and of an uninviting appearance may be out off before being sent to table and potted these make an excellent relish for the breakfast or luncheon table timepart of a round of beef weighing 12 lbs about 3 hours after the

other tub fill the first tub again with water and continue this process for about 20 minutes then set it upon a dish and let it remain until quite cold when cut the fat will be as white as possible

beating them as little as possible with a rollingpin turn them frequently with steaktongs if these are not at hand stick a fork in the edge of the fat that no gravy escapes and in from 8 to 10 minutes they will be done have ready a very hot dish into which put the ketchup and when liked a little minced shalot dish up the steaks rub them over with butter and season with pepper and salt the exact time for broiling steaks must be determined by taste whether they are liked underdone or well done more than from 8 to 10 minutes for a steak 34 inch in thickness we think would spoil and dry up the juices of the meat great expedition is necessary in sending broiled steaks to table and to have them in perfection they should not be cooked till everything else prepared for dinner has been dished up

to possess the preserving principle in a very great degree without the pungency and astringency of salt may be and is very generally used in the preserving of meat for family consumption although it acts without corrugating or contracting the fibres of meat as is the case in the action of salt and therefore does not impair its mellowness yet its use in sufficient quantities for preservative effect without the addition of other antiseptics would impart a flavour not agreeable to the taste of many persons it may be used however together with salt with the greatest advantage in imparting

matter is generally deposited in such a manner as to leave a cavity into which a fatty substance distinguished by the name of marrow is thrown hollow cylindrical bones possess the qualities of strength and lightness in a remarkable degree if bones were entirely solid they would be unnecessarily heavy and if their materials were brought into smaller compass they would be weaker because the

vertebral column or backbone presents only slight modifications and everywhere shows the same characteristics as in man who stands at the head of this division of the animal kingdom the length of this column however varies much and the number of vertebrae of which it is composed is far from being uniform these numerical differences principally depend on the unequal development of the caudal portion or tailend of the column thus the tailforming vertebrae sometimes do not exist at allamongst certain bats for example in other instances we reckon forty fifty and even upwards of sixty of these bones among the greater number of mammals the tail is of little use for locomotion except that it acts in many cases as does the rudder of a ship steadying the animal in his rapid movements and enabling him to turn more easily and quickly among some animals it becomes a very powerful instrument of progression thus in the kangaroos and jerboas the tail forms with the hind feet a kind of tripod from which the animal makes its spring with most of the american monkeys it is prehensile and serves the animal as a fifth hand to suspend itself from the branches of trees and lastly among the whales it grows to an enormous size and becomes the principal instrument for swimming a pickle for tongues or beef newmarket recipe 641 ingredients1 gallon of soft water 3 lbs of coarse salt 6 oz of coarse brown

preserved meatswhen an organic substance like the flesh of animals is heated to the boilingpoint it loses the property of passing into a state of fermentation and decay fresh animal milk as is well known coagulates after having been kept for two or three days into a gelatinous mass but it may be preserved for an indefinite period as a perfectly sweet liquid if it be heated daily to the boilingpoint the knowledge of this effect of an elevated temperature has given rise to a most important branch of industrynamely the preparation of preserved meats for the use of the navy and merchant service at leith in the neighbourhood of edinburgh at aberdeen at bordeaux at marseilles and in many parts of germany establishments of enormous magnitude exist in which soup vegetables and viands of every description are prepared in such a manner that they retain their freshness for years the prepared aliments are inclosed in canisters of tinned iron plate the covers are soldered airtight and the canisters exposed to the temperature of boiling water for three or four hours the aliments thus acquire a stability which one may almost say is eternal and when a canister is opened after the lapse of several years its contents are found to be unaltered in taste colour and smell we are indebted to the french philosopher gaylussac for this beautiful practical application of the discovery that boiling checks fermentation an exclusive saltmeat diet is extremely injurious to the health and in former times thousands of mariners lost their lives for the want of fresh aliments during long voyages we are sorry to say that the preserved meats are sometimes carelessly prepared and though the statement seems incredible sometimes adulterated dr lankester who has done so much to expose the frauds of trade that he ought to be regarded as a public benefactor says that he has seen things which were utterly unfit for food shipped as preserved meats surely as he observes there ought to be

importance in roasting a radiant fire throughout the operation is absolutely necessary to insure a good result when the article to be dressed is thin and delicate the fire may be small but when the joint is large the fire must fill the grate meat must never be put down before a hollow or exhausted fire which may soon want recruiting on the other hand if the heat of the fire becomes too fierce the meat must be removed to a considerable distance till it is somewhat abated some cooks always fail in their roasts though they succeed in nearly everything else a french writer on the culinary art says that anybody can learn how to cook but one must be born a roaster according to liebig beef or mutton cannot be said to be sufficiently roasted until it has acquired throughout the whole mass a temperature of 158 but poultry may be well cooked when the inner parts have attained a temperature of from 130 to 140 this depends on the greater amount of blood which beef and mutton contain the

the ordinary way of cooking consequently double the quantity of fuel would be consumed origin of the word sirlointhe loin of beef is said to have been knighted by king charles ii at friday hall chingford the merry monarch returned to this hospitable mansion for epping forest literally as hungry as a hunter and beheld with delight a huge loin of beef steaming upon the table a noble joint exclaimed the king by st george it shall have a title then drawing his sword he raised it above the meat and cried with mock dignity loin we dub thee knight henceforward be sir loin this anecdote is doubtless apocryphal although the oak table upon which the joint was supposed to have received its knighthood might have been seen by any one who visited fridayhill house a few years ago it is perhaps a pity to spoil so noble a story but the interests of truth demand that we declare that sirloin is probably a corruption of surloin which signifies the upper part of a loin the prefix sur being equivalent to over or above in french we find this joint called surlonge which so closely resembles our sirloin that we may safely refer the two words to a common origin to salt beef 660 ingredients12

meat which has been roasted those who have travelled in germany and france writes mr lewis one of our most popular scientific authors must have repeatedly marvelled at the singular uniformity in the flavour or want of flavour of the various roasts served up at the tabledhte the general explanation is that the german and french meat is greatly inferior in quality to that of england and holland owing to the inferiority of pasturage and doubtless this is one cause but it is not the chief cause the meat is inferior but the cooking is mainly at fault the meat is scarcely ever roasted because there is no coal and firewood is expensive the meat is therefore baked and the consequence of this baking is that no meat is eatable or eaten with its own gravy but is always accompanied by some sauce more or less piquant the germans generally believe that in england we eat our beef and mutton almost raw they shudder at our gravy as if it were so much blood stewed beef or rump steak an entree 666

clarified butter beef carving aitchbone of beef a boiled aitchbone of beef is not a difficult joint to carve as will be seen on reference to the accompanying engraving by following with the knife the direction of the line from 1 to 2 nice slices will be easily cut it may be necessary as in a round of beef to cut a thick slice off the outside before commencing to serve illustration brisket of beef there is but little description necessary to add to show the carving of a boiled brisket of beef beyond the engraving here inserted the only point to be observed is that the joint should be cut evenly and firmly quite across the bones so that on its reappearance at table it should not have a jagged and untidy look illustration ribs of beef this dish resembles the sirloin except that it has no fillet or undercut as explained in the recipes the end piece is often cut off salted and boiled the mode of carving is similar to that of the sirloin viz in the direction of the dotted line from 1 to 2 this joint will be the more easily cut if the plan be pursued which is suggested in carving the sirloin namely the inserting of the knife immediately between the bone and the moat before commencing to cut it into slices all joints of roast beef should be cut in even and thin slices horseradish finely scraped may be served as a garnish but horseradish sauce is preferable for eating with the beef illustration sirloin of beef this dish is served differently at various tables some preferring it to come to table with the fillet or as it is usually called the undercut uppermost the reverse way as shown in the cut is that most usually adopted still the undercut is best eaten when hot consequently the carver himself may raise the joint and cut some slices from the under side in the direction of from 1 to 2 as the fillet is very much preferred by some eaters the upper part of the sirloin should be cut in the direction of the line from 5 to 6 and care should be taken to carve it evenly and in thin slices it will be found a great assistance in carving this joint well if the knife be first inserted just above the bone at the bottom and run sharply along between the bone and meat and also to divide the meat from the bone in the same way at the side of the joint the slices will then come away more readily illustration some carvers cut the upper side of the sirloin across as shown by the line from 3 to 4 but this is a wasteful plan and one not to be recommended with the sirloin very finelyscraped horseradish is usually served and a little given when liked to each guest horseradish sauce is preferable however for serving on the plate although the scraped horseradish may still be used as a garnish illustration a round of beef a round of beef is not so easily carved as many other joints of beef and to manage it properly a thinbladed and very sharp knife is necessary off the outside of the joint at its top a thick slice should first be cut so as to leave the surface smooth then thin and even slices should be cleverly carved in the direction of the line 1 to 2 and with each slice of the lean a delicate morsel of the fat should be served illustration beef tongue passing the knife down in the direction of from 1 to 2 a not too thin slice should be helped and the carving of a tongue may be continued in this way until the best portions of the upper side are served the fat which lies about the root of the tongue can be served by turning the tongue and cutting in the direction of from 3 to 4 illustration illustration chapter xiv general observations on the sheep and lamb 678 of all wild or domesticated animals the sheep is without exception the most useful to man as a food and the most necessary to his health and comfort for it not only supplies him with the lightest and most nutritious of meats but in the absence of the cow its udder yields him milk cream and a sound though inferior cheese while from its fat he obtains light and from its fleece broadcloth kerseymere blankets gloves and hose its bones when burnt make an animal charcoalivory blackto polish his boots and when powdered a manure for the cultivation of his wheat the skin either split or whole is made into a mat for his carriage a housing for his horse or a lining for his hat and many other useful purposes besides being extensively employed in the manufacture of parchment and finally when oppressed by care and sorrow the harmonious strains that carry such soothing contentment to the heart are elicited from the musical strings prepared almost exclusively from the intestines of the sheep 679 this valuable animal of which england is estimated to maintain an average stock of 32000000 belongs to the class already indicated under the oxthe mammalia to the order of rumenantia or cudchewing animal to the tribe of capridae or horned quadrupeds and the genus ovis or the sheep the sheep may be either with or without horns when present however they have always this peculiarity that they spring from a triangular base are spiral in form and lateral at the side of the head in situation the fleece of the sheep is of two sorts either short and harsh or soft and woolly the wool always preponderating in an exact ratio to the care attention and amount of domestication bestowed on the animal the generic peculiarities of the sheep are the triangular and spiral form of the horns always larger in the male when present but absent in the most cultivated species having sinuses at the base of all the toes of the four feet with two rudimentary hoofs on the fore legs two inguinal teats to the udder with a short tail in the wild breed but of varying length in the domesticated have no incisor teeth in the upper jaw but in their place a hard elastic cushion along the margin of the gum on which the animal nips and breaks the herbage on which it feeds in the lower jaw there are eight incisor teeth and six molars on each side of both jaws making in all 32 teeth the fleece consists of two coats one to keep the animal warm the other to carry off the water without wetting the skin the first is of wool the weight and fineness of which depend on the quality of the pasture and the care bestowed on the flock the other of hair that pierces the wool and overlaps it and is in excess in exact proportion to the badness of the keep and inattention with which the animal is treated 680 the great object of the grazier is to procure an animal that will yield the greatest pecuniary return in the shortest time or in other words soonest convert grass and turnips into good mutton and fine fleece all sheep will not do this alike some like men are so restless and irritable that no system of feeding however good will develop their frames or make them fat the system adopted by the breeder to obtain a valuable animal for the butcher is to enlarge the capacity and functions of the digestive organs and reduce those of the head and chest or the mental and respiratory organs in the first place the mind should be tranquillized and those spaces that can never produce animal fibre curtailed and greater room afforded as in the abdomen for those that can and as nothing militates against the fattening process so much as restlessness the chief wish of the grazier is to find a dull indolent sheep one who instead of frisking himself leaping his wattles or even condescending to notice the butting gambols of his silly companions silently fills his paunch with pasture and then seeking a shady nook indolently and luxuriously chows his cud with closed eyes and blissful satisfaction only rising when his delicious repast is ended to proceed silently and without emotion to repeat the pleasing process of laying in more provender and then returning to his dreamy siesta to renew the delightful task of rumination such animals are said to have a lymphatic temperament and are of so kindly a nature that on good pasturage they may be said to grow daily the leicestershire breed is the best example of this lymphatic and contented animal and the active orkney who is half goat in his habits of the restless and unprofitable the rich pasture of our midland counties would take years in making the wiry orkney fat and profitable while one days fatigue in climbing rocks after a coarse and scanty herbage would probably cause the actual death of the pampered and shortwinded leicester 681 the more removed from the nature of the animal is the food on which it lives the more difficult is the process of assimilation and the more complex the chain of digestive organs for it must be evident to all that the same apparatus that converts flesh into flesh is hardly calculated to transmute grass into flesh as the process of digestion in carnivorous animals is extremely simple these organs are found to be remarkably short seldom exceeding the length of the animals body while where digestion is more difficult from the unassimilating nature of the aliment as in the ruminant order the alimentary canal as is the case with the sheep is twentyseven times the length of the body the digestive organ in all ruminant animals consists of four stomachs or rather a capacious pouch divided by doorways and valves into four compartments called in their order of position the paunch the reticulum the omasum and the abomasum when the sheep nibbles the grass and is ignorantly supposed to be eating he is in fact only preparing the raw material of his meal in reality only mowing the pasture which as he collects is swallowed instantly passing into the first receptacle the paunch where it is surrounded by a quantity of warm saliva in which the herbage undergoes a process of maceration or softening till the animal having filled this compartment the contents pass through a valve into the second or smaller bagthe reticulum where having again filled the paunch with a reserve the sheep lies down and commences that singular process of chewing the cud or in other words masticating the food he has collected by the operation of a certain set of muscles a small quantity of this softened food from the reticulum or second bag is passed into the mouth which it now becomes the pleasure of the sheep to grind under his molar teeth into a soft smooth pulp the operation being further assisted by a flow of saliva answering the double purpose of increasing the flavour of the aliment and promoting the solvency of the mass having completely comminuted and blended this mouthful it is swallowed a second time but instead of returning to the paunch or reticulum it passes through another valve into a side cavitythe omasum where after a maceration in more saliva for some hours it glides by the same contrivance into the fourth pouchthe abomasum an apartment in all respects analogous to the ordinary stomach of animals and where the process of digestion begun and carried on in the previous three is here consummated and the nutrient principle by means of the bile eliminated from the digested aliment such is the process of digestion in sheep and oxen 682 no other animal even of the same order possesses in so remarkable a degree the power of converting pasture into flesh as the leicestershire sheep the south down and cheviot the two next breeds in quality are in consequence of the greater vivacity of the animals nature not equal to it in that respect though in both the brain and chest are kept subservient to the greater capacity of the organs of digestion besides the advantage of increased bulk and finer fleeces the breeder seeks to obtain an augmented deposit of tissue in those parts of the carcase most esteemed as food or what are called in the trade prime joints and so far has this been effected that the comparative weight of the hind quarters over the fore has become a test of quality in the breed the butchers in some markets charging twopence a pound more for that portion of the sheep indeed so superior are the hind quarters of mutton now regarded that very many of the westend butchers never deal in any other part of the sheep 683 the difference in the quality of the flesh in various breeds is a wellestablished fact not alone in flavour but also in tenderness and that the nature of the pasture on which the sheep is fed influences the flavour of the meat is equally certain and shown in the estimation in which those flocks are held which have grazed on the thymy heath of bamstead in sussex it is also a wellestablished truth that the larger the frame of the animal the coarser is the meat and that small bones are both guarantees for the fineness of the breed and the delicacy of the flesh the sex too has much to do in determining the quality of the meat in the males the lean is closer in fibre deeper in colour harder in texture less juicy and freer from fat than in the female and is consequently tougher and more difficult of digestion but probably age and the character of the pasturage on which they are reared has more than any other cause an influence on the quality and tenderness of the meat 684 the numerous varieties of sheep inhabiting the different regions of the earth have been reduced by cuvier to three or at most four species the ovis amman or the argali the presumed parent stock of all the rest the ovis tragelaphus the bearded sheep of africa the ovis musmon the musmon of southern europe and the ovis montana the mouflon of america though it is believed by many naturalists that this last is so nearly identical with the indian argali as to be undeserving a separate place it is still a controversy to which of these three we are indebted for the many breeds of modern domestication the argali however by general belief has been considered as the most probable progenitor of the present varieties 685 the effects produced by change of climate accident and other causes must have been great to accomplish so complete a physical alteration as the primitive argali must have undergone before the musmon or mouflon of corsica the immediate progenitor of all our european breeds assumed his present appearance the argali is about a fifth larger in size than the ordinary english sheep and being a native of a tropical clime his fleece is of hair instead of wool and of a warm reddish brown approaching to yellow a thick mane of darker hair about seven inches long commences from two long tufts at the angle of the jaws and running under the throat and neck descends down the chest dividing at the fore fork into two parts one running down the front of each leg as low as the shank the horns unlike the character of the order generally have a quadrangular base and sweeping inwards terminate in a sharp point the tail about seven inches long ends in a tuft of stiff hairs from this remarkable mufflerlooking beard the french have given the species the name of mouflon manchettes from the primitive stock eleven varieties have been reared in this country of the domesticated sheep each supposed by their advocates to possess some one or more special qualities these eleven embracing the shetland or orkney the dunwoolled blackfaced or heathbred the moorland or devonshire the cheviot the horned of norfolk the ryeland southdown the merino the old leicester and the teeswater or new leicester have of late years been epitomized and for all useful and practical purposes reduced to the following four orders 686 the southdown the leicester the blackfaced and the cheviot illustration southdown ram illustration southdown ewe 687 southdownsit appears as far as our investigation can trace the fact that from the very earliest epoch of agricultural history in england the breezy range of light chalky hills running through the southwest and south of sussex and hampshire and known as the southdowns has been famous for a superior race of sheep and we find the romans early established mills and a clothfactory at winchester where they may be said to terminate which rose to such estimation from the fineness of the wool and texture of the cloth that the produce was kept as only worthy to clothe emperors from this it may be inferred that sheep have always been indigenous to this hilly tract though boasting so remote a reputation it is comparatively within late years that the improvement and present state of perfection of this breed has been effected the southdown new ranking for symmetry of shape constitution and early maturity with any stock in the kingdom the southdown has no horns is covered with a fine wool from two to three inches long has a small head and legs and face of a grey colour it is however considered deficient in depth and breadth of chest a marked peculiarity of this breed is that its hind quarters stand higher than the fore the quarters weighing from fifteen to eighteen pounds illustration leicester ram illustration leicester ewe 688 the leicesterit was not till the year 1755 that mr robert bakewell directed his attention to the improvement of his stock of sheep and ultimately effected that change in the character of his flock which has brought the breed to hold so prominent a place the leicester is regarded as the largest example of the improved breeds very productive and yielding a good fleece he has a small head covered with short white hairs a clean muzzle an open countenance full eye long thin ear tapering neck wellarched ribs and straight back the meat is indifferent its flavour not being so good as that of the southdown and there is a very large proportion of fat average weight of carcase from 90 to 100 lbs illustration heath ram illustration heath ewe 689 blackfaced on heathbred sheepthis is the most hardy of all our native breeds and originally came from ettrick forest the face and legs are black or sometimes mottled the horns spiral and on the top of the forehead it has a small round tuft of lightercoloured wool than on the face has the muzzle and lips of the same light hue and what shepherds call a mealy mouth the eye is full of vivacity and fire and well open the body long round and firm and the limbs robust the wool is thin coarse and light weight of the quarter from 10 to 16 lbs 690 the cheviotfrom the earliest traditions these hills in the north like the chalkridges in the south have possessed a race of largecarcased sheep producing a valuable fleece to these physical advantages they added a sound constitution remarkable vigour and capability to endure great privation both sexes are destitute of horns face white legs long and clean carries the head erect has the throat and neck well covered the cars long and open and the face animated the cheviot is a smallboned sheep and well covered with wool to the hough the only defect in this breed is in a want of depth in the chest weight of the quarter from 12 to 18 lbs illustration romneymarsh ram illustration romneymarsh ewe 691 though the romney marshes that wide tract of morass and lowland moor extending from the weald or ancient forest of kent into sussex has rather been regarded as a general feedingground for any kind of sheep to be pastured on it has yet from the earliest date been famous for a breed of animals almost peculiar to the locality and especially for size length thickness and quantity of wool and what is called thickness of stocking and on this account for ages held preeminence over every other breed in the kingdom so satisfied were the kentish men with the superiority of their sheep that they long resisted any crossing in the breed at length however this was effected and from the old romney and new leicester a stock was produced that proved in an eminent degree the advantage of the cross and though the breed was actually smaller than the original it was found that the new stock did not consume so much food the stocking was increased they were ready for the market a year sooner that the fat formed more on the exterior of the carcase where it was of most advantage to the grazier rather than as formerly in the interior where it went to the butcher as offal and though the wool was shorter and lighter it was of a better colour finer and possessed of superior felting properties 692 the romney marsh breed is a large animal deep close and compact with white face and legs and yields a heavy fleece of a good staple quality the general structure is however considered defective the chest being narrow and the extremities coarse nevertheless its tendency to fatten and its early maturity are universally admitted the romney marsh therefore though not ranking as a first class in respect of perfection and symmetry of breed is a highly useful profitable and generally advantageous variety of the english domestic sheep 693 different names have been given to sheep by their breeders according to their age and sex the male is called a ram or tup after weaning he is said to be a hog or hogget or a lambhog tuphog or teg later he is a wether or wetherhog after the first shearing a shearing or dinmont and after each succeeding shearing a two three or fourshear ram tup or wether according to circumstances the female is called a ewe or gimmerlamb till weaned when she becomes according to the shepherds nomenclature a gimmerewe hog or teg after shearing a gimmer or shearingewe or theave and in future a two three or fourshear ewe or theave 694 the mode of slaughtering sheep is perhaps as humane and expeditious a process as could be adopted to attain the objects sought the animal being laid on its side in a sort of concave stool the butcher while pressing the body with his knee transfixes the throat near the angle of the jaw passing his knife between the windpipe and bones of the neck thus dividing the jugulars carotids and large vessels the death being very rapid from such a hemorrhage illustration side of mutton showing the several joints 695 almost every large city has a particular manner of cutting up or as it is called dressing the carcase in london this process is very simple and as our butchers have found that much skewering back doubling one part over another or scoring the inner cuticle or fell tends to spoil the meat and shorten the time it would otherwise keep they avoid all such treatment entirely the carcase when flayed which operation is performed while yet warm the sheep when hung up and the head removed presents the profile shown in our cut the small numerals indicating the parts or joints into which one half of the animal is cut after separating the hind from the fore quarters with eleven ribs to the latter the quarters are usually subdivided in the manner shown in the sketch in which the several joins are defined by the intervening lines and figures hind quarter no 1 the leg 2 the lointhe two when cut in one piece being called the saddle fore quarter no 3 the shoulder 4 and 5 the neck no 5 being called for distinction the scrag which is generally afterwards separated from 4 the lower and better joint no 6 the breast the haunch of mutton so often served at public dinners and special entertainments comprises all the leg and so much of the loin short of the ribs or lap as is indicated on the upper part of the carcase by a dotted line 696 the gentle and timid disposition of the sheep and its defenceless condition must very early have attached it to man for motives less selfish than either its fleece or its flesh for it has been proved beyond a doubt that obtuse as we generally regard it it is susceptible of a high degree of domesticity obedience and affection in many parts of europe where the flocks are guided by the shepherds voice alone it is no unusual thing for a sheep to quit the herd when called by its name and follow the keeper like a dog in the mountains of scotland when a flock is invaded by a savage dog the rams have been known to form the herd into a circle and placing themselves on the outside line keep the enemy at bay or charging on him in a troop have despatched him with their horns 697 the value of the sheep seems to have been early understood by adam in his fallen state his skin not only affording him protection for his body but a covering for his tent and accordingly we find abel intrusted with this portion of his fathers stock for the bible tells us that abel was a keeper of sheep what other animals were domesticated at that time we can only conjecture or at what exact period the flesh of the sheep was first eaten for food by man is equally if not uncertain open to controversy for though some authorities maintain the contrary it is but natural to suppose that when abel brought firstlings of his flock and the fat thereof as a sacrifice the less dainty portions not being oblations were hardly likely to have been flung away as refuse indeed without supposing adam and his descendants to have eaten animal food we cannot reconcile the fact of jubal cain cains son and his family living in tents as they are reported to have done knowing that both their own garments and the coverings of the tents were made from the hides and skins of the animals they bred for the number of sheep and oxen slain for oblations only would not have supplied sufficient material for two such necessary purposes the opposite opinion is that animal food was not eaten till after the flood when the lord renewed his covenant with noah from scriptural authority we learn many interesting facts as regards the sheep the first that mutton fat was considered the most delicious portion of any meat and the tail and adjacent part the most exquisite morsel in the whole body consequently such were regarded as especially fit for the offer of sacrifice from this fact we may reasonably infer that the animal still so often met with in palestine and syria and known as the fattailed sheep was in use in the days of the patriarchs though probably not then of the size and weight it now attains to a supposition that gains greater strength when it is remembered that the ram abraham found in the bush when he went to offer up isaac was a horned animal being entangled in the brake by his curved horns so far proving that it belonged to the tribe of the capridae the fattailed sheep appertaining to the same family lambs 698 though the lambing season in this country usually commences in march under the artificial system so much pursued now to please the appetite of luxury lambs can be procured at all seasons when however the sheep lambs in midwinter or the inclemency of the weather would endanger the lives of mother and young if exposed to its influence it is customary to rear the lambs withindoors and under the shelter of stables or barns where foddered on soft hay and part fed on cows milk the little creatures thrive rapidly to such it is customary to give the name of house lamb to distinguish it from that reared in the open air or grassfed the ewe goes five months with her young about 152 days or close on 22 weeks the weaning season commences on poor lands about the end of the third month but on rich pasture not till the close of the fourthsometimes longer 699 from the large proportion of moisture or fluids contained in the tissues of all young animals the flesh of lamb and veal is much more prone in close damp weather to become tainted and spoil than the flesh of the more mature drier and closertextured beef and mutton among epicures the most delicious sorts of lamb are those of the southdown breed known by their black feet and of these those which have been exclusively suckled on the milk of the parent ewe are considered the finest next to these in estimation are those fed on the milk of several dams and last of all though the fattest the grassfed lamb this however implies an age much greater than either of the others illustration side of lamb 700 lamb in the early part of the season however reared is in london and indeed generally sold in quarters divided with eleven ribs to the forequarter but as the season advances these are subdivided into two and the hindquarter in the same manner the first consisting of the shoulder and the neck and breast the latter of the leg and the loinas shown in the cut illustrative of mutton as lamb from the juicy nature of its flesh is especially liable to spoil in unfavourable weather it should be frequently wiped so as to remove any moisture that may form on it 701 in the purchasing of lamb for the table there are certain signs by which the experienced judgment is able to form an accurate opinion whether the animal has been lately slaughtered and whether the joints possess that condition of fibre indicative of good and wholesome meat the first of these doubts may be solved satisfactorily by the bright and dilated appearance of the eye the quality of the forequarter can always be guaranteed by the blue or healthy ruddiness of the jugular or vein of the neck while the rigidity of the knuckle and the firm compact feel of the kidney will answer in an equally positive manner for the integrity of the hindquarter 702 mode of cutting up a side of lamb in london1 1 ribs 2 breast 3 shoulder 4 loin 5 leg 123 fore

furnished by southdown sheep is the most highly esteemed it is also the dearest on account of its scarcity and the great demand of it therefore if the housekeeper is told by the butcher that he has not any in his shop it should not occasion disappointment to the purchaser the london and other markets are chiefly supplied with sheep called halfbreeds which are a cross between the down and lincoln or leicester these halfbreeds make a greater weight of mutton than the true southdowns and for this very desirable qualification they are preferred by the great sheepmasters the legs of this mutton

he could not maintain by force of arms took with him to vienna the archives of the order the inauguration of which he solemnized there in 1713 with great magnificence but philip v of spain declared himself grand master and formally protested at the congress of cambrai 1721 against the pretensions of the emperor the dispute though subsequently settled by the intercession of france england and

told that abel was a keeper of sheep many passages in holy writ enable us to appreciate the pastoral riches of the first eastern nations and we can form an idea of the number of their flocks when we read that jacob gave the children of hamor a hundred sheep for the price of a field and that the king of israel received a hundred thousand every year from the king of moab his tributary and a like number of rams covered with their fleece the tendency which most sheep have to ramble renders it necessary for them to be attended by a shepherd to keep a flock within bounds is no easy task but the

escape the persecutions of his stepmother ino paid a visit to his friend aeetes king of colchis a ram whose fleece was of pure gold carried the youth through the air in a most obliging manner to the court of his friend when safe at colchis phryxus offered the ram on the altars of mars and pocketed the fleece the king received him with great kindness and gave him his daughter chalciope in marriage but some time after he murdered him in order to obtain possession of the precious fleece the murder of phryxus was amply revenged by the greeks it gave rise to the famous argonautic expedition undertaken by jason and fifty of the most celebrated heroes of greece the argonauts recovered the fleece by the help of the celebrated sorceress medea daughter of aeetes who fell desperately in love with the gallant but faithless jason in the story of the voyage of the argo a substratum of truth probably exists though overlaid by a mass of fiction the ram which carried phryxus to colchis is by some supposed to have been the name of the ship in which he embarked the fleece of gold is thought to represent the immense treasures he bore away from thebes the alchemists of the fifteenth century

line of cliffs which stretches from dover to ramsgate the downs are clothed with short verdant turf but the layer of soil which rests upon the chalk is too thin to support trees and shrubs the hills have rounded summits and their smooth undulated outlines are unbroken save by the sepulchral monuments of the early inhabitants of the country the coombes and furrows which ramify and extend into deep valleys appear like driedup channels of streams and rivulets from time immemorial immense flocks of sheep have been reared on these downs the herbage of these hills is remarkably nutritious and whilst the natural healthiness of the climate consequent on the dryness of the air and the moderate elevation of the land is eminently favourable to rearing a superior race of sheep the arable land in the immediate neighbourhood of the downs affords the means of a supply of other food when the natural produce of the hills fails the mutton of the southdown breed of sheep is highly valued for its

in the first place be made quite down to the bone across the knuckleend of the joint along the line 1 to 2 this will let the gravy escape and then it should be carved in not too thick slices along the whole length of the haunch in the direction of the line from 4 to 3 illustration leg of mutton leg of mutton 760 this homely but capital english joint is almost invariably served at table as shown in the engraving the carving of it is not very difficult the knife should be carried sharply down in the direction of the line from 1 to 2 and slices taken from either side as the guests may desire some liking the knuckleend as well done and others preferring the more underdone part the fat should be sought near the line 3 to 4 some connoisseurs are fond of having this joint dished with the underside uppermost so as to get at the finelygrained meat lying under that part of the meat known as the popes eye but this is an extravagant fashion and one that will hardly find favour in the eyes of many economical british housewives and housekeepers loin of mutton illustration loin of mutton 761 there is one point in connection with carving a loin of mutton which includes every other that is that the joint should be thoroughly well jointed by the butcher before it is cooked this knack of jointing requires practice and the proper tools and no one but the butcher is supposed to have these if the bones be not well jointed the carving of a loin of mutton is not a gracious business whereas if that has been attended to it is an easy and untroublesome task the knife should be inserted at fig 1 and after feeling your way between the bones it should be carried sharply in the direction of the line 1 to 2 as there are some people who prefer the outside cut while others do not like it the question as to their choice of this should be asked saddle of mutton illustration saddle of mutton 762 although we have heard at various intervals growlings expressed at the inevitable saddle of mutton at the dinnerparties of our middle classes yet we doubt whether any other joint is better liked when it has been well hung and artistically cooked there is a diversity of opinion respecting the mode of sending this joint to table but it has only reference to whether or no there shall be any portion of the tail or if so how many joints of the tail we ourselves prefer the mode as shown in our coloured illustration o but others may upon equally good grounds like the way shown in the engraving on this page some trim the tail with a paper frill the carving is not difficult it is usually cut in the direction of the line from 2 to 1 quite down to the bones in evenlysliced pieces a fashion however patronized by some is to carve it obliquely in the direction of the line from 4 to 3 in which case the joint would be turned round the other way having the tail end on the right of the carver shoulder of mutton illustration shoulder of mutton 763 this is a joint not difficult to carve the knife should be drawn from the outer edge of the shoulder in the direction of the line from 1 to 2 until the bone of the shoulder is reached as many slices as can be carved in this manner should be taken and afterwards the meat lying on either side of the bladebone should be served by carving in the direction of 3 to 4 and 3 to 4 the uppermost side of the shoulder being now finished the joint should be turned and slices taken off along its whole length there are some who prefer this underside of the shoulder for its juicy flesh although the grain of the meat is not so fine as that on the other side forequarter of lamb illustration forequarter of lamb 764 we always think that a good and practised carver delights in the manipulation of this joint for there is a little field for his judgment and dexterity which does not always occur the separation of the shoulder from the breast is the first point to be attended to this is done by passing the knife lightly round the dotted line as shown by the figures 1 2 3 4 and 5 so as to cut through the skin and then by raising with a little force the shoulder into which the fork should be firmly fixed it will come away with just a little more exercise of the knife in dividing the shoulder and breast the carver should take care not to cut away too much of the meat from the latter as that would rather spoil its appearance when the shoulder is removed the breast and shoulder being separated it is usual to lay a small piece of butter and sprinkle a little cayenne lemonjuice and salt between them and when this is melted and incorporated with the meat and gravy the shoulder may as more convenient be removed into another dish the next operation is to separate the ribs from the brisket by cutting through the meat on the line 5 to 6 the joint is then ready to be served to the guests the ribs being carved in the direction of the lines from 9 to 10 and the brisket from 7 to 8 the carver should ask those at the table what parts they preferribs brisket or a piece of the shoulder leg of lamb loin of lamb saddle of lamb shoulder of lamb are carved in the same manner as the corresponding joints of mutton see nos 760 761 762 763 illustration chapter xvi general observations on the common hog 765 the hog belongs to the order mammalia the genus sus scrofa and the species pachydermata or thickskinned and its generic characters are a small head with long flexible snout truncated 42 teeth divided into 4 upper incisors converging 6 lower incisors projecting 2 upper and 2 lower canine or tusksthe former short the latter projecting formidable and sharp and 14 molars in each jaw cloven feet furnished with 4 toes and tail small short and twisted while in some varieties this appendage is altogether wanting 766 from the number and position of the teeth physiologists are enabled to define the nature and functions of the animal and from those of the sus or hog it is evident that he is as much a grinder as a biter or can live as well on vegetable as on animal food though a mixture of both is plainly indicated as the character of food most conducive to the integrity and health of its physical system 767 thus the pig tribe though not a ruminating mammal as might be inferred from the number of its molar teeth is yet a link between the herbivorous and the carnivorous tribes and is consequently what is known as an omnivorous quadruped or in other words capable of converting any kind of aliment into nutriment 768 though the hoof in the hog is as a general rule cloven there are several remarkable exceptions as in the species native to norway illyria sardinia and formerly to the berkshire variety of the british domesticated pig in which the hoof is entire and uncleft 769 whatever difference in its physical nature climate and soil may produce in this animal his functional characteristics are the same in whatever part of the world he may be found and whether in the trackless forests of south america the coral isles of polynesia the jungles of india or the spicy brakes of sumatra he is everywhere known for his gluttony laziness and indifference to the character and quality of his food and though he occasionally shows an epicures relish for a succulent plant or a luscious carrot which he will discuss with all his salivary organs keenly excited he will the next moment turn with equal gusto to some carrion offal that might excite the forbearance of the unscrupulous cormorant it is this coarse and repulsive mode of feeding that has in every country and language obtained for him the opprobrium of being an unclean animal 770 in the mosaical law the pig is condemned as an unclean beast and consequently interdicted to the israelites as unfit for human food and the swine though he divideth the hoof and be clovenfooted yet he cheweth not the cud he is unclean to youlev xi 7 strict however as the law was respecting the cudchewing and hoofdivided animals the jews with their usual perversity and violation of the divine commands seem afterwards to have ignored the prohibition for unless they ate pork it is difficult to conceive for what purpose they kept troves of swine as from the circumstance recorded in matthew xviii 32 when jesus was in galilee and the devils cast out of the two men were permitted to enter the herd of swine that were feeding on the hills in the neighbourhood of the sea of tiberias it is very evident they did there is only one interpretation by which we can account for a prohibition that debarred the jews from so many foods which we regard as nutritious luxuries that being fat and the texture more hard of digestion than other meats they were likely in a hot dry climate where vigorous exercise could seldom be taken to produce disease and especially cutaneous affections indeed in this light as a code of sanitary ethics the book of leviticus is the most admirable system of moral government ever conceived for mans benefit 771 setting his coarse feeding and slovenly habits out of the question there is no domestic animal so profitable or so useful to man as the muchmaligned pig or any that yields him a more varied or more luxurious repast the prolific powers of the pig are extraordinary even under the restraint of domestication but when left to run wild in favourable situations as in the islands of the south pacific the result in a few years from two animals put on shore and left undisturbed is truly surprising for they breed so fast and have such numerous litters that unless killed off in vast numbers both for the use of the inhabitants and as fresh provisions for ships crews they would degenerate into vermin in this country the pig has usually two litters or farrows in a year the breeding seasons being april and october and the period the female goes with her young is about four months16 weeks or 122 days the number produced at each litter depends upon the character of the breed 12 being the average number in the small variety and 10 in the large in the mixed breeds however the average is between 10 and 15 and in some instances has reached as many as 20 but however few or however many young pigs there may be to the farrow there is always one who is the dwarf of the family circle a poor little shrivelled halfstarved anatomy with a small melancholy voice a staggering gait a woebegone countenance and a thread of a tail whose existence the complacent mother ignores his plethoric brothers and sisters repudiate and for whose emaciated jaws there is never a spare or supplemental teat till one of the favoured gormandizers overtaken by momentary oblivion drops the lacteal fountain and gives the little squeaking straggler the chance of a momentary mouthful this miserable little object which may be seen bringing up the rear of every litter is called the tony pig or the anthony so named it is presumed from being the one always assigned to the church when tithe was taken in kind and as st anthony was the patron of husbandry his name was given in a sort of bitter derision to the starveling that constituted his dues for whether there are ten or fifteen farrows to the litter the anthony is always the last of the family to come into the world 772 from the grossness of his feeding the large amount of aliment he consumes his gluttonous way of eating it from his slothful habits laziness and indulgence in sleep the pig is particularly liable to disease and especially indigestion heartburn and affections of the skin 773 to counteract the consequence of a violation of the physical laws a powerful monitor in the brain of the pig teaches him to seek for relief and medicine to open the pores of his skin blocked up with mud and excite perspiration he resorts to a tree a stump or his troughanything rough and angular and using it as a currycomb to his body obtains the luxury of a scratch and the benefit of cuticular evaporation he next proceeds with his long supple snout to grub up antiscorbutic roots cooling salads of mallow and dandelion and greatest treat of all he stumbles on a piece of chalk or a mouthful of delicious cinder which he knows by instinct is the most sovereign remedy in the world for that hot unpleasant sensation he has had all the morning at his stomach 774 it is a remarkable fact that though every one who keeps a pig knows how prone he is to disease how that disease injures the quality of the meat and how eagerly he pounces on a bit of coal or cinder or any coarse dry substance that will adulterate the rich food on which he lives and by affording soda to his system correct the vitiated fluids of his bodyyet very few have the judgment to act on what they see and by supplying the pig with a few shovelfuls of cinders in his sty save the necessity of his rooting for what is so needful to his health instead of this however and without supplying the animal with what its instinct craves for his nostril is bored with a redhot iron and a ring clinched in his nose to prevent rooting for what he feels to be absolutely necessary for his health and ignoring the fact that in a domestic state at least the pig lives on the richest of all foodscraps of cooked animal substances boiled vegetables bread and other items given in that concentrated essence of aliment for a quadruped called wash and that he eats to repletion takes no exercise and finally sleeps all the twentyfour hours he is not eating and then when the animal at last seeks for those medicinal aids which would obviate the evil of such a forcing diet his keeper instead of meeting his animal instinct by human reason and giving him what he seeks has the inhumanity to torture him by a ring that keeping up a perpetual raw in the pigs snout prevents his digging for those corrective drugs which would remove the evils of his artificial existence 775 though subject to so many diseases no domestic animal is more easily kept in health cleanliness and comfort and this without the necessity of ringing or any excessive desire of the hog to roam break through his sty or plough up his pound whatever the kind of food may be on which the pig is being fed or fattened a teaspoonful or more of salt should always be given in his mess of food and a little heap of wellburnt cinders with occasional bits of chalk should always be kept by the side of his trough as well as a vessel of clean water his pound or the front part of his sty should be totally free from straw the brick flooring being every day swept out and sprinkled with a layer of sand his lair or sleeping apartment should be well sheltered by roof and sides from cold wet and all changes of weather and the bed made up of a good supply of clean straw sufficiently deep to enable the pig to burrow his unprotected body beneath it all the refuse of the garden in the shape of roots leaves and stalks should be placed in a corner of his pound or feedingchamber for the delectation of his leisure moments and once a week on the family washingday a pail of warm soapsuds should be taken into his sty and by means of a scrubbingbrush and soap his back shoulders and flanks should be well cleaned a pail of clean warm water being thrown over his body at the conclusion before he is allowed to retreat to his clean straw to dry himself by this means the excessive nutrition of his aliment will be corrected a more perfect digestion insured and by opening the pores of the skin a more vigorous state of health acquired than could have been obtained under any other system 776 we have already said that no other animal yields man so many kinds and varieties of luxurious food as is supplied to him by the flesh of the hog differently prepared for almost every part of the animal either fresh salted or dried is used for food and even those viscera not so employed are of the utmost utility in a domestic point of view 777 though destitute of the hide horns and hoofs constituting the offal of most domestic animals the pig is not behind the other mammalia in its usefulness to man its skin especially that of the boar from its extreme closeness of texture when tanned is employed for the seats of saddles to cover powder shot and drinkingflasks and the hair according to its colour flexibility and stubbornness is manufactured into tooth nail and hairbrushesothers into hat clothes and shoebrushes while the longer and finer qualities are made into long and short brooms and painters brushes and a still more rigid description under the name of bristles are used by the shoemaker as needles for the passage of his waxend besides so many benefits and useful services conferred on man by this valuable animal his fat in a commercial sense is quite as important as his flesh and brings a price equal to the best joints in the carcase this fat is rendered or melted out of the caul or membrane in which it is contained by boiling water and while liquid run into prepared bladders when under the name of lard it becomes an article of extensive trade and value 778 of the numerous varieties of the domesticated hog the following list of breeds may be accepted as the best presenting severally all those qualities aimed at in the rearing of domestic stock as affecting both the breeder and the consumer nativeberkshire essex york and cumberland foreignthe chinese before however proceeding with the consideration of the different orders in the series we have placed them it will be necessary to make a few remarks relative to the pig generally in the first place the black pig is regarded by breeders as the best and most eligible animal not only from the fineness and delicacy of the skin but because it is less affected by the heat in summer and far less subject to cuticular disease than either the white or brindled hog but more particularly from its kindlier nature and greater aptitude to fatten 779 the great quality first sought for in a hog is a capacious stomach and next a healthy power of digestion for the greater the quantity he can eat and the more rapidly he can digest what he has eaten the more quickly will he fatten and the faster he can be made to increase in flesh without a material increase of bone the better is the breed considered and the more valuable the animal in the usual order of nature the development of flesh and enlargement of bone proceed together but here the object is to outstrip the growth of the bones by the quicker development of their fleshy covering 780 the chief points sought for in the choice of a hog are breadth of chest depth of carcase width of loin chine and ribs compactness of form docility cheerfulness and general beauty of appearance the head in a wellbred hog must not be too long the forehead narrow and convex cheeks full snout fine mouth small eyes small and quick ears short thin and sharp pendulous and pointing forwards neck full and broad particularly on the top where it should join very broad shoulders the ribs loin and haunch should be in a uniform line and the tail well set neither too high nor too low at the same time the back is to be straight or slightly curved the chest deep broad and prominent the legs short and thick the belly when well fattened should nearly touch the ground the hair be long thin fine and having few bristles and whatever the colour uniform either white black or blue but not spotted speckled brindled or sandy such are the features and requisites that among breeders and judges constitute the beau idal of a perfect pig illustration berkshire sow 781 the berkshire pig is the best known and most esteemed of all our english domestic breeds and so highly is it regarded that even the varieties of the stock are in as great estimation as the parent breed itself the characteristics of the berkshire hog are that it has a tawny colour spotted with black large ears hanging over the eyes a thick close and wellmade body legs short and small in the bone feeds up to a great weight fattens quickly and is good either for pork or bacon the new or improved berkshire possesses all the above qualities but is infinitely more prone to fatten while the objectionable colour has been entirely done away with being now either all white or completely black illustration essex sow 782 next to the former the essex takes place in public estimation always competing and often successfully with the berkshire the peculiar characters of the essex breed are that it is tipeared has a long sharp head is roachbacked with a long flat body standing high on the legs is rather bare of hair is a quick feeder has an enormous capacity of stomach and belly and an appetite to match its receiving capability its colour is white or else black and white and it has a restless habit and an unquiet disposition the present valuable stock has sprung from a cross between the common native animal and either the white chinese or black neapolitan breeds illustration yorkshire sow 783 the yorkshire called also the old lincolnshire was at one time the largest stock of the pig family in england and perhaps at that time the worst it was longlegged weak in the loins with coarse white curly hair and flabby flesh now however it has undergone as great a change as any breed in the kingdom and by judicious crossing has become the most valuable we possess being a very wellformed pig throughout with a good head a pleasant docile countenance with moderatesized drooping ears a broad back slightly curved large chine and loins with deep sides full chest and well covered with long thicklyset white hairs besides these qualities of form he is a quick grower feeds fast and will easily make from 20 to 25 stone before completing his first year the quality of the meat is also uncommonly good the fat and lean being laid on in almost equal proportions so capable is this species of development both in flesh and stature that examples of the yorkshire breed have been exhibited weighing as much as a scotch ox illustration cumberland sow 784 though almost every country in england can boast some local variety or other of this useful animal obtained from the native stock by crossing with some of the foreign kinds cumberland and the northwest parts of the kingdom have been celebrated for a small breed of white pigs with a thick compact and wellmade body short in the legs the head and back well formed ears slouching and a little downwards and on the whole a hardy profitable animal and one well disposed to fatten 785 there is no variety of this useful animal that presents such peculiar features as the species known to us as the chinese pig and as it is the general belief that to this animal and the neapolitan hog we are indebted for that remarkable improvement which has taken place in the breeds of the english pig it is necessary to be minute in the description of this in all respects singular animal the chinese in the first place consists of many varieties and presents as many forms of body as differences of colour the best kind however has a beautiful white skin of singular thinness and delicacy the hair too is perfectly white and thinly set over the body with here and there a few bristles he has a broad snout short head eyes bright and fiery very small fine pink ears wide cheeks high chine with a neck of such immense thickness that when the animal is fat it looks like an elongated carcasea mass of fat without shape or form like a feather pillow the belly is dependent and almost trailing on the ground the legs very short and the tail so small as to be little more than a rudiment it has a ravenous appetite and will eat anything that the wonderful assimilating powers of its stomach can digest and to that capability there seems no limit in the whole range of animal or vegetable nature the consequence of this perfect and singularly rapid digestion is an unprecedented proneness to obesity a process of fattening that once commenced goes on with such rapid development that in a short time it loses all form depositing such an amount of fat that it in fact ceases to have any refuse part or offal and beyond the hair on its back and the callous extremity of the snout the whole carcase is eatable illustration chinese sow 786 when judiciously fed on vegetable diet and this obese tendency checked the flesh of the chinese pig is extremely delicate and delicious but when left to gorge almost exclusively on animal food it becomes oily coarse and unpleasant perhaps there is no other instance in nature where the effect of rapid and perfect digestion is so well shown as in this animal which thrives on everything and turns to the benefit of its physical economy food of the most opposite nature and of the most unwholesome and offensive character when fully fattened the thin cuticle that is one of its characteristics cracks from the adipose distension beneath exposing the fatty mass which discharges a liquid oil from the adjacent tissues the great fault in this breed is the remarkably small quantity of lean laid down to the immense proportion of fat some idea of the growth of this species may be inferred from the fact of their attaining to 18 stone before two years and when further advanced as much as 40 stone in its pure state except for roasters the chinese pig is too disproportionate for the english market but when crossed with some of our lean stock the breed becomes almost invaluable illustration westphalian boar 787 the wild boar is a much more cleanly and sagacious animal than the domesticated hog he is longer in the snout has his ears shorter and his tusks considerably longer very frequently measuring as much as 10 inches they are extremely sharp and are bent in an upward circle unlike his domestic brother who roots up here and there or wherever his fancy takes the wild boar ploughs the ground in continuous lines or furrows the boar when selected as the parent of a stock should have a small head be deep and broad in the chest the chine should be arched the ribs and barrel well rounded with the haunches falling full down nearly to the hock and he should always be more compact and smaller than the female the colour of the wild boar is always of a uniform hue and generally of an iron grey shading off into a black the hair of the boar is of considerable length especially about the head and mane he stands in general from 20 to 30 inches in height at the shoulders though instances have occurred where he has reached 42 inches the young are of a pale yellowish tint irregularly brindled with light brown the boar of germany is a large and formidable animal and the hunting of him with a small species of mastiff is still a national sport from living almost exclusively on acorns and nuts his flesh is held in great esteem and in westphalia his legs are made into hams by a process which it is said enhances the flavour and quality of the meat in a remarkable degree 788 there are two points to be taken into consideration by all breeders of pigsto what ultimate use is the flesh to be put for if meant to be eaten fresh or simply salted the small breed of pigs is host suited for the purpose if for hams or bacon the large variety of the animal is necessary pigs are usually weaned between six and eight weeks after birth after which they are fed on soft food such as mashed potatoes in skimmed or buttermilk the general period at which the small hogs are killed for the market is from 12 to 16 weeks from 4 to 5 mouths they are called store pigs and are turned out to graze till the animal has acquired its full stature as soon as this point has been reached the pig should be forced to maturity as quickly as possible he should therefore be taken from the fields and farmyard and shut up on boiled potatoes buttermilk and peasmeal after a time to be followed by grains oilcake wash barley and indian meal supplying his sty at the same time with plenty of water cinders and a quantity of salt in every mess of food presented to him 789 the estimated number of pigs in great britain is supposed to exceed 20 millions and considering the third of the number as worth 2 apiece and the remaining twothirds as of the relative value of 10s each would give a marketable estimate of over 20000000 for this animal alone 790 the best and most humane mode of killing all large hogs is to strike them down like a bullock with the pointed end of a poleaxe on the forehead which has the effect of killing the animal at once all the butcher has then to do is to open the aorta and great arteries and laying the animals neck over a trough let out the blood as quickly as possible the carcase is then to be scalded either on a board or by immersion in a tub of very hot water and all the hair and dirt rapidly scraped off till the skin is made perfectly white when it is hung up opened and dressed as it is called in the usual way it is then allowed to cool a sheet being thrown around the carcase to prevent the air from discolouring the newlycleaned skin when meant for bacon the hair is singed instead of being scalded off 791 in the country where for ordinary consumption the pork killed for sale is usually both larger and fatter than that supplied to the london consumer it is customary to remove the skin and fat down to the lean and salting that roast what remains of the joint pork goes further and is consequently a more economical food than other meats simply because the texture is closer and there is less waste in the cooking either in roasting or boiling 792 in fresh pork the leg is the most economical family joint and the loin the richest 793 comparatively speaking very little difference exists between the weight of the live and dead pig and this simply because there is neither the head nor the hide to be removed it has been proved that pork loses in cooking 1312 per cent of its weight a salted hand weighing 4 lbs 5 oz lost in the cooking 11 oz after cooking the meat weighing only 3 lbs 1 oz and the bone 9 oz the original cost was 712d a pound but by this deduction the cost rose to 9d per pound with the bone and 1014d without it 794 pork to be preserved is cured in several wayseither by covering it with salt or immersing it in readymade brine where it is kept till required or it is only partially salted and then hung up to dry when the meat is called white bacon or after salting it is hung in wood smoke till the flesh is impregnated with the aroma from the wood the wiltshire bacon which is regarded as the finest in the kingdom is prepared by laying the sides of a hog in large wooden troughs and then rubbing into the flesh quantities of powdered baysalt made hot in a fryingpan this process is repeated for four days they are then left for three weeks merely turning the flitches every other day after that time they are hung up to dry the hogs usually killed for purposes of bacon in england average from 18 to 20 stone on the other hand the hogs killed in the country for farmhouse purposes seldom weigh less than 26 stone the legs of boars hogs and in germany those of bears are prepared differently and called hams 795 the practice in vogue formerly in this country was to cut out the hams and cure them separately then to remove the ribs which were roasted as spareribs and curing the remainder of the side call it a gammon of bacon small pork to cut for table in joints is cut up in most places throughout the kingdom as represented in the engraving the sale is divided with nine ribs to the fore quarter and the following is an enumeration of the joints in the two respective quarters 1 the leg hind quarter 2 the loin 3 the spring or belly 4 the hand fore quarter 5 the foreloin 6 the cheek illustration side of a pig showing

interior of hungary and spreading over the vast steppes of that country droves of swine form a great portion of the wealth of the people who chiefly live on a coarse bread and winddried bacon in german switzerland the tyrol and other mountainous districts of continental europe though the inhabitants almost everywhere as in england keep one or more pigs they are at little or no trouble in feeding them one or more men being employed by one or several villages as swineherds who at a certain hour every morning call for the pig or pigs and driving them to their feedinggrounds on the mountainside and in the wood take custody of the herd till on the approach of night they are collected into a compact body and driven home for a nights repose in their several sties the amount of intelligence and docility displayed by the pigs in these mountain regions is much more considerable than that usually allowed to this animal and the manner in which these immense herds of swine are collected and again distributed without an accident or mistake is a sight both curious and interesting for it is all done without the assistance of a dog or the aid even of the human voice and solely by the crack of the longlashed and heavilyloaded whip which the swineherd carries and cracks much after the fashion of the french postilion and which though he frequently cracks waking a hundred sharp echoes from the woods and rocks he seldom has to use correctionally the animal soon acquiring a thorough knowledge of the meaning of each crack and once having felt its leaded thong a lasting remembrance of its power at early dawn the swineherd takes his stand at the outskirts of the first village and begins flourishing through the misty air his immensely long lash keeping a sort of rude time with the crack crack crack crack crack crack of his whip the nearest pigs hearing the wellremembered sound rouse from their straw and rush from their sties into the road followed by all their litters as soon as a sufficient number are collected the drove is set in motion receiving right and left as they advance fresh numbers whole communities or solitary individuals streaming in from all quarters and taking their place without distinction in the general herd and as if conscious where their breakfast lay without wasting a moment on idle investigation all eagerly push on to the mountains in this manner village after village is collected till the drove not unfrequently consists of several thousands the feedingground has of course often to be changed and the drove have sometimes to be driven many miles and to a considerable height up the mountain before the whip gives the signal for the dispersion of the body and the order to feed when the herdsman proceeds to form himself a shelter and look after his own comfort for the rest of the day as soon as twilight sets in the whip is again heard echoing the signal for muster and in the same order in which they were collected the swine are driven back each group tailing off to its respective sty as the herd approaches the villages till the last grunter having found his home the drover seeks his cottage and repose

hunting of the wild boar has been in all times and in all countries a pastime of the highest interest and excitement and from the age of nimrod has only been considered second to the more dangerous sport of lionhunting the buried treasures of nineveh restored to us by mr layard show us on their sculptured annals the kings of assyria in their royal pastime of boarhunting that the greeks were passionately attached to this sport we know both from history and the romantic fables of the poets marc antony at one of his breakfasts with cleopatra had eight wild boars roasted whole and though the romans do not appear to have been addicted to hunting wildboar fights formed part of their gladiatorial shows in the amphitheatre in france germany and britain from the earliest time the boarhunt formed one of the most exciting of sports but it was only in this country that the sport was conducted without dogsa real handtohand contest of man and beast the hunter armed only with a boarspear a weapon about four feet long the ash staff guarded by plates of steel and terminating in a long narrow and very sharp blade this with a huntingknife or hanger completed his offensive arms thus equipped the hunter would either encounter his enemy face to face confront his desperate charge as with erect tail depressed head and flaming eyes he rushed with his foamy tusks full against him who either sought to pierce his vitals through his counter or driving his spear through his chine transfix his heart or failing those more difficult aims plunge it into his flank and without withdrawing the weapon strike his ready hanger into his throat but expert as the hunter might be it was not often the formidable brute was so quickly dispatched for he would sometimes seize the spear in his powerful teeth and nip it off like a reed or coming full tilt on his enemy by his momentum and weight bear him to the earth ripping up with a horrid gash his leg or side and before the writhing hunter could draw his knife the infuriated beast would plunge his snout in the wound and rip with savage teeth the bowels of his victim at other times he would suddenly swerve from his charge and doubling on his opponent attack the hunter in the rear from his speed great weight and savage disposition the wild boar is always a dangerous antagonist and requires great courage coolness and agility on the part of the hunter the continental sportsman rides to the chase in a cavalcade with music and dogsa kind of small hound or mastiff and leaving all the honorary part of the contest to them when the boar is becoming weary and while beset by the dogs rides up and drives his lance home in the beasts back or side boarhunting has been for some centuries obsolete in england the animal no longer existing in a wild state among us but in our indian empire and especially in bengal the pastime is pursued by our countrymen with all the daring of the national character and as the animal which inhabits the canebrakes and jungles is a formidable foe the sport is attended with great excitement the hunters mounted on small active horses and armed only with long lances ride at early daylight to the skirts of the jungle and having sent in their attendants to beat the cover wait till the tusked monster comes crashing from among the canes when chase is immediately given till he is come up with and transfixed by the first weapon instead of flight however he often turns to bay and by more than one dead horse and wounded hunter shows how formidable he is and what those polished tusks sharp as pitchforks can effect when the enraged animal defends his life to glaze hamsee recipe no 430 hashed pork 801 ingredientsthe remains of cold roast pork 2 onions 1 teaspoonful of flour 2 blades of

peasant having one or more of that useful animal in feudal times immense droves of pigs were kept by the franklings and barons in those days the swineherds being a regular part of the domestic service of every feudal household their duty consisted in daily driving the herd of swine from the castleyard or outlying farm to the nearest woods chase or forest where the frankling or vavasour had either by right or grant what was called free warren or the liberty to feed his hogs off the acorns beech and chestnuts that lay in such abundance on the earth and far exceeded the power of the royal or privileged game to consume indeed it was the license granted the nobles of free warren especially for their swine that kept up the iniquitous forest laws to so late a date and covered so large a portion of the land with such immense tracts of wood and brake to the injury of agriculture and the misery of the people some idea of the extent to which swine were grazed in the feudal times may be formed by observing the number of pigs still fed in epping forest the forest of dean and the new forest in hampshire where for several months of the year the beechnuts and acorns yield them so plentiful a diet in germany where the chestnut is so largely cultivated the amount of food shed every autumn is enormous and consequently the pig both wild and domestic has for a considerable portion of the year an unfailing supply of admirable nourishment impressed with the value of this fruit for the food of pigs the prince consort has with great judgment of late encouraged the collection of chestnuts in windsor park and by giving a small reward to old people and children for every bushel collected has not only found an occupation for many of the unemployed poor but by providing a gratuitous food for their pig encouraged a feeling of providence and economy for curing bacon and keeping it free from rust cobbetts recipe 806 the two sides that remain and which are called flitches are to be cured for bacon they are first rubbed with salt on their insides or flesh sides then placed one on the other the flesh sides uppermost in a saltingtrough which has a gutter round its edges to drain away the brine for to have sweet and fine bacon the flitches must not be sopping in brine which gives it the sort of vile taste that barrel and sea pork have every one knows how different is the taste of fresh dry salt from that of salt in a dissolved state therefore change the salt oftenonce in 4 or 5 days let it melt and sink in but not lie too long twice change the flitches put that at bottom which was first on the top this mode will cost you a great deal more in salt than the sopping mode but without it your bacon will not be so sweet and fine nor keep so well as for the time required in making your flitches sufficiently salt it depends on circumstances it takes a longer time for a thick than a thin flitch and longer in dry than in damp weather or in a dry than in a damp place but for the flitches of a hog of five score in weather not very dry or damp about 6 weeks may do and as yours is to be fat which receives little injury from oversalting give time enough for you are to have bacon until christmas comes again 807 the place for salting should like a dairy always be cool but well ventilated confined air though cool will taint meat sooner than the midday day sun accompanied by a breeze with regard to smoking the bacon two precautions are necessary first to hang the flitches where no rain comes down upon them and next that the smoke must proceed from wood not peat turf or coal as to the time required to smoke a flitch it depends a good deal upon whether there be a constant fire beneath and whether the fire be large or small a month will do if the fire be pretty constant and rich as a farmhouse fire usually is but oversmoking or rather too long hanging in the air makes the bacon rust great attention should therefore be paid to this matter the flitch ought not to be dried up to the hardness of a board and yet it ought to be perfectly dry before you hang it up lay it on the floor scatter the flesh side pretty thickly over with bran or with some fine sawdust not of deal or fir rub it on the flesh or pat it well down upon it this keeps the smoke from getting into the little openings and makes a sort of crust to be dried on 808 to keep the bacon sweet and good and free from hoppers sift fine some clean and dry wood ashes put some at the bottom of a box or chest long enough to hold a flitch of bacon lay in one flitch and then put in more ashes then another flitch and cover this with six or eight inches of the ashes the place where the box or chest is kept ought to be dry and should the ashes become damp they should be put in the fireplace to dry and when cold put back again with these precautions the bacon will be as good at the end of the year as on the first day 809 for simple general rules these may be safely taken as a guide and those who implicitly follow the directions given will possess at the expiration of from 6 weeks to 2 months wellflavoured and wellcured bacon hog not bacon anecdote of lord baconas lord

reduced for many years to great indigence the expelled owner only living in the hope of wreaking a terrible vengeance which agreeably to the motto of his house he was content to bide his time for the

lost an interesting member of his household in the form of a promising young porker consulted his priest on the occasion and having hinted at the person he suspected of purloining the illegant slip of a pig he was advised to take no further notice of the matter but leave the issue to his spiritual adviser next sunday his reverence after mass came to the front of the altarrails and looking very hard at the supposed culprit exclaimed who stole pat doolans pig to this inquiry there was of course no answerthe priest did not expect there would be any the following sunday the same query was propounded a little strongerwho of you was it i say who stole poor pat doolans pig it now became evident that the culprit was a hardened sinner so on the third sunday instead of repeating the unsatisfactory inquiry the priest after as usual eyeing the obdurate offender said in a tone of pious sorrow mike regan mike regan you treat me with contempt that night when the family was all asleep the latch of

fortnight to 3 weeks the following is from mortons cyclopaedia of agriculture and will be found fully worthy of the high character of that publication curing of hams and bacon 822 the carcass of the hog after hanging overnight to cool is laid on a strong bench or stool and the head is separated from the body at the neck close behind the ears the feet and also the internal fat are removed the carcass is next divided into two sides in the following mannerthe ribs are divided about an inch from the spine on each side and the spine with the ends of the ribs attached together with the internal flesh between it and the kidneys and also the flesh above it throughout the whole length of the sides are removed the portion of the carcass thus cut out is in the form of a wedgethe breadth of the interior consisting of the breadth of the spine and about an inch of the ribs on each side being diminished to about half an inch at the exterior or skin along the back the breastbone and also the first anterior rib are also dissected from the side sometimes the whole of the ribs are removed but this for reasons afterwards to be noticed is a very bad practice when the hams are cured separately from the sides which is generally the case they are cut out so as to include the hockbone in a similar manner to the london mode of cutting a haunch of mutton the carcass of the hog thus cut up is ready for being salted which process in large caring establishments is generally as follows the skin side of the pork is rubbed over with a mixture of fifty parts by weight of salt and one part of saltpetre in powder and the incised parts of the ham or flitch and the inside of the flitch covered with the same the salted bacon in pairs of flitches with the insides to each other is piled one pair of flitches above another on benches slightly inclined and furnished with spouts or troughs to convey the brine to receivers in the floor of the saltinghouse to be afterwards used for pickling pork for navy purposes in this state the bacon remains a fortnight which is sufficient for flitches cut from nogs of a carcass weight less than 15 stone 14 lbs to the stone flitches of a larger size at the expiration of that time are wiped dry and reversed in their place in the pile having at the same time about half the first quantity of fresh dry common salt sprinkled over the inside and incised parts after which they remain on the benches for another week hams being thicker than flitches will require when less than 20 lbs weight 3 weeks and when above that weight 4 weeks to remain under the abovedescribed process the next and last process in the preparation of bacon and hams previous to being sent to market is drying this is effected by hanging the flitches and hams for 2 or 3 weeks in a room heated by stoves or in a smokehouse in which they are exposed for the same length of time to the smoke arising from the slow combustion of the sawdust of oak or other hard wood the latter mode of completing the curing process has some advantages over the other as by it the meat is subject to the action of creosote a volatile oil produced by the combustion of the sawdust which is powerfully antiseptic the process also furnishing a thin covering of a resinous varnish excludes the air not only from the muscle but also from the fat thus effectually preventing the meat from becoming rusted and the principal reasons for condemning the practice of removing the ribs from the flitches of pork are that by so doing the meat becomes unpleasantly hard and pungent in the process of salting and by being more opposed to the action of the air becomes sooner and more extensively rusted notwithstanding its superior efficacy in completing the process of curing the flavour which smokedrying imparts to meat is disliked by many persons and it is therefore by no means the most general mode of drying adopted by mercantile curers a very impure variety of pyroligneous acid or vinegar made from the destructive distillation of wood is sometimes used on account of the highly preservative power of the creosote which it contains and also to impart the smokeflavour in which latter object however the coarse flavour of tar is given rather than that derived from the smoke from combustion of wood a considerable portion of the bacon and hams salted in ireland is exported from that country packed amongst salt in bales immediately from the salting process without having been in any degree dried in the process of salting above described pork loses from eight to ten per cent of its weight according to the size and quality of the meat and a further diminution of weight to the extent of five to six per cent takes place in drying during the first fortnight after being taken out of salt so that the total loss in weight occasioned by the preparation of bacon and hams in a proper state for market is not less on an average than fifteen per cent on the weight of the fresh pork collared pigs

of the hoga singular circumstance in the domestic history of the hog is the extent of its distribution over the surface of the earth being found even in insulated places where the inhabitants are semibarbarous and where the wild species is entirely unknown the southsea islands for example were found on their discovery to be well stocked with a small black hog and the traditionary belief of the people was that these animals were coeval with the origin of themselves yet they possessed no knowledge of the wild boar or any other animal of the hog kind from which the domestic breed might be supposed to be derived in these islands the hog is the principal quadruped and the fruit of the breadtree is its principal food although it is also fed with yams eddoes and other vegetables this nutritious diet which it has in great abundance is according to foster the reason of its flesh being so delicious so full of juice and so rich in fat which is not less delicate to the taste than the

in the deepest obscurity so far back as we have any records of history we find notices of this animal and of its flesh being used as the food of man by some nations however its flesh was denounced as unclean and therefore prohibited to be used whilst by others it was esteemed as a great delicacy by the mosaic law it was forbidden to be eaten by the jews and the mahometans hold it in utter abhorrence dr kitto however says that there does not appear to be any reason in the law of moses why the hog should be held in such peculiar abomination there seems nothing to have prevented the jews if they had been so inclined to rear pigs for sale or for the use of the land in the talmud there are some indications that this was actually done and it was probably for such purposes that the herds of swine mentioned in the new testament were kept although it is usual to consider that they were kept by the foreign settlers in the land indeed the story which accounts for the peculiar aversion of the hebrews to the hog assumes that it did not originate until about 130 years before christ and that previously some jews were in the habit of rearing hogs for the purposes indicated pork pies

occupation of keeping swine the swineherd is never introduced into the idyls of theocritus nor has virgil admitted him into his eclogues the eumaeus of homer is the only exception that we have of a swineherd meeting with favour in the eyes of a poet of antiquity this may be accounted for on the supposition that the prejudices of the egyptians relative to this class of men extended to both greece

caresses and kindness has been shown from very remote time the best modern evidence of his docility however is the instance of the learned pig first exhibited about a century since but which has been continued down to our own time by repeated instances of an animal who will put together all the letters or figures that compose the day month hour and date of the exhibition besides many other unquestioned evidences of memory the instance already given of breaking a sow into a pointer till she became more stanch even than the dog itself though surprising is far less wonderful than that evidence of education where so generally obtuse an animal may be taught not only to spell but couple figures and give dates correctly roast suckingpig 841 ingredientspig 6 oz of bread crumbs 16 sageleaves pepper and salt to taste a piece of butter the size of an egg salad oil or butter to baste with about 12 pint of gravy 1 tablespoonful of lemonjuice illustration roast suckingpig modea suckingpig to be eaten in perfection should not be more than three weeks old and should be dressed the same day that it is killed after preparing the pig for cooking as in the preceding recipe stuff it with finelygrated bread crumbs minced sage pepper salt and a piece of butter the size of an egg all of which should be well mixed together and put into the body of the pig sew up the slit neatly and truss the legs back to allow the inside to be roasted and the under part to be crisp put the pig down to a bright clear fire not too near and let it lay till thoroughly dry then have ready some butter tied up in a piece of thin cloth and rub the pig with this in every part keep it well rubbed with the butter the whole of the time it is roasting and do not allow the crackling to become blistered or burnt when halfdone hang a pigiron before the middle part if this is not obtainable use a flat iron to prevent its being scorched and dried up before the ends are done before it is taken from the fire cut off the head and part that and the body down the middle chop the brains and mix them with the stuffing add 12 pint of good gravy a tablespoonful of lemonjuice and the gravy that flowed from the pig put a little of this on the dish with the pig and the remainder send to table in a tureen place the pig back to back in the dish with one half of the head on each side and one of the ears at each end and send it to table as hot as possible instead of butter many cooks take salad oil for basting which makes the crackling crisp and as this is one of the principal things to be considered perhaps it is desirable to use it but be particular that it is very pure or it will impart an unpleasant flavour to the meat the brains and stuffing may be stirred into a tureen of melted butter instead of gravy when the latter is not liked apple sauce and the oldfashioned currant sauce are not yet quite obsolete as an accompaniment to roast pig time112 to 2 hours for a small pig average cost 5s to 6s sufficient for 9 or 10 persons seasonable from september to february how roast pig was discoveredcharles lamb who in the early part of this century delighted the reading public by his quaint prose sketches written under the title of essays of elia has in his own quiet humorous way devoted one paper to the subject of roast pig and more especially to that luxurious and toothsome dainty known as crackling and shows in a manner peculiarly his own how crackling first came into the world according to this erudite authority man in the golden age or at all events the primitive age eat his pork and bacon raw as indeed he did his beef and mutton unless as hudibras tells us he was an epicure when he used to make a saddle of his saddle of mutton and after spreading it on his horses back and riding on it for a few hours till thoroughly warmed he sat down to the luxury of a dish cooked to a turn at the epoch of the story however a citizen of some scythian community had the misfortune to have his hut or that portion of it containing his live stock of pigs burnt down in going over the dbris on the following day and picking out all the available salvage the proprietor touched something unusually or unexpectedly hot which caused him to shake his hand with great energy and clap the tips of his suffering fingers to his mouth the act was simple and natural but the result was wonderful he rolled his eyes in ecstatic pleasure his frame distended and conscious of a celestial odour his nostrils widened and while drawing in deep inspirations of the ravishing perfume he sucked his fingers with a gusto he had never in his most hungry moments conceived clearing away the rubbish from beneath him he at last brought to view the carcase of one of his pigs roasted to death stooping down to examine this curious object and touching its body a fragment of the burnt skin was detached which with a sort of superstitious dread he at length and in a spirit of philosophical inquiry put into his mouth ye gods the felicity he then enjoyed no pen can chronicle then it was that hethe worldfirst tasted crackling like a miser with his gold the scythian hid his treasure from the prying eyes of the world and feasted in secret more sumptuously than the gods when he had eaten up all his pig the poor man fell into a melancholy he refused the most tempting steak though cooked on the horses back and turned every halfhour after his own favourite recipe he fell in fact from his appetite and was reduced to a shadow till unable longer to endure the torments of memory he hourly suffered he rose one night and secretly set fire to his hut and once more was restored to flesh and manhood finding it impossible to live in future without roastpig he set fire to his house every time his larder became empty till at last his neighbours scandalized by the frequency of these incendiary acts brought his conduct before the supreme council of the nation to avert the penalty that awaited him he brought his judges to the smouldering ruins and discovering the secret invited them to eat which having done with tears of gratitude the august synod embraced him and with an overflowing feeling of ecstasy dedicated a statue to the memory of the man who first instituted roast pork pork carving suckingpig illustration suckingpig 842 a suckingpig seems at first sight rather an elaborate dish or rather animal to carve but by carefully mastering the details of the business every difficulty will vanish and if a partial failure be at first made yet all embarrassment will quickly disappear on a second trial a suckingpig is usually sent to table in the manner shown in the engraving and also in coloured plate s and the first point to be attended to is to separate the shoulder from the carcase by carrying the knife quickly and neatly round the circular line as shown by the figures 1 2 3the shoulder will then easily come away the next step is to take off the leg and this is done in the same way by cutting round this joint in the direction shown by the figures 1 2 3 in the same way as the shoulder the ribs then stand fairly open to the knife which should be carried down in the direction of the line 4 to 5 and two or three helpings will dispose of these the other half of the pig is served of course in the same manner different parts of the pig are variously esteemed some preferring the flesh of the neck others the ribs and others again the shoulders the truth is the whole of a suckingpig is delicious delicate eating but in carving it the host should consult the various tastes and fancies of his guests keeping the larger joints generally for the gentlemen of the party ham illustration ham 843 in cutting a ham the carver must be guided according as he desires to practise economy or have at once fine slices out of the prime part under the first supposition he will commence at the knuckle end and cut off thin slices towards the thick part of the ham to reach the choicer portion the knife which must be very sharp and thin should be carried quite down to the bone in the direction of the line 1 to 2 the slices should be thin and even and always cut down to the bone there are some who like to carve a ham by cutting a hole at the top and then slicing pieces off inside the hole gradually enlarging the circle but we think this a plan not to be recommended a ham when hot is usually sent to table with a paper ruffle round the knuckle when cold it is served in the manner shown by coloured plate p leg of pork illustration leg of pork 844 this joint which is such a favourite one with many people is easy to carve the knife should be carried sharply down to the bone clean through the crackling in the direction of the line 1 to 2 sago and onion and apple sauce are usually sent to table with this dishsometimes the leg of pork is stuffedand the guests should be asked if they will have either or both a frequent plan and we think a good one is now pursued of sending sage and onion to table separately from the joint as it is not everybody to whom the flavour of this stuffing is agreeable notethe other dishes of pork do not call for any special remarks as to their carving or helping chapter xviii general observations on the calf 845 any remarks made on the calf or the lamb must naturally be in a measure supplementary to the more copious observations made on the parent stock of either as the calf at least as far as it is identified with veal is destined to die youngto be indeed cut off in its comparative infancyit may at first sight appear of little or no consequence to inquire to what particular variety or breed of the general stock his sire or dam may belong the great art however in the modern science of husbandry has been to obtain an animal that shall not only have the utmost beauty of form of which the species is capable but at the same time a constitution free from all taint a frame that shall rapidly attain bulk and stature and a disposition so kindly that every quantum of food it takes shall without drawback or procrastination be eliminated into fat and muscle the breed then is of very considerable consequence in determining not only the quality of the meat to the consumer but its commercial value to the breeder and butcher 846 under the artificial system adopted in the rearing of domestic cattle and stock in general to gratify the arbitrary mandates of luxury and fashion we can have veal like lamb at all seasons in the market though the usual time in the metropolis for veal to make its appearance is about the beginning of february 847 the cow goes with young for nine months and the affection and solicitude she evinces for her offspring is more human in its tenderness mid intensity than is displayed by any other animal and her distress when she hears its bleating and is not allowed to reach it with her distended udders is often painful to witness and when the calf has died or been accidentally killed her grief frequently makes her refuse to give down her milk at such times the breeder has adopted the expedient of flaying the dead carcase and distending the skin with hay lays the effigy before her and then taking advantage of her solicitude milks her while she is caressing the skin with her tongue 848 in a state of nature the cow like the deer hides her young in the tall ferns and brakes and the most secret places and only at stated times twice or thrice a day quits the herd and hastening to the secret cover gives suck to her calf and with the same circumspection returns to the community 849 in some countries to please the epicurean taste of vitiated appetites it is the custom to kill the calf for food almost immediately after birth and any accident that forestalls that event is considered to enhance its value we are happy to say however that in this country as far as england and scotland are concerned the taste for very young veal has entirely gone out and staggering bob as the poor little animal was called in the language of the shambles is no longer to be met with in such a place 850 the weaning of calves is a process that requires a great amount of care and judgment for though they are in reality not weaned till between the eighth and the twelfth week the process of rearing them by hand commences in fact from the birth the calf never being allowed to suck its dam as the rearing of calves for the market is a very important and lucrative business the breeder generally arranges his stock so that ten or a dozen of his cows shall calve about the same time and then by setting aside one or two to find food for the entire family gets the remaining eight or ten with their full fountains of milk to carry on the operations of his dairy some people have an idea that skimmed milk if given in sufficient quantity is good enough for the weaning period of calffeeding but this is a very serious mistake for the cream of which it has been deprived contained nearly all the oleaginous principles and the azote or nitrogen on which the vivifying properties of that fluid depends indeed so remarkably correct has this fact proved to be that a calf reared on one part of new milk mixed with five of water will thrive and look well while another treated with unlimited skimmed milk will be poor thin and miserable 851 it is sometimes a matter of considerable trouble to induce the blundering calfwhose instinct only teaches him to suck and that he will do at anything and with anythingacquire the knowledge of imbibition that for the first few days it is often necessary to fill a bottle with milk and opening his mouth pour the contents down his throat the manner however by which he is finally educated into the mystery of suction is by putting his allowance of milk into a large wooden bowl the nurse then puts her hand into the milk and by bending her fingers upwards makes a rude teat for the calf to grasp in his lips when the vacuum caused by his suction of the fingers causes the milk to rise along them into his mouth in this manner one by one the whole family are to be fed three times a day care being taken that newborn calves are not at first fed on milk from a cow who has some days calved 852 as the calf progresses towards his tenth week his diet requires to be increased in quantity and quality for these objects his milk can be thickened with flour or meal and small pieces of softened oilcake are to be slipped into his mouth after sucking that they may dissolve there till he grows familiar with and to like the taste when it may be softened and scraped down into his milkandwater after a time sliced turnips softened by steam are to be given to him in tolerable quantities then succulent grasses and finally hay may be added to the others some farmers desirous of rendering their calves fat for the butcher in as short a time as possible forget both the natural weakness of the digestive powers and the contracted volume of the stomach and allow the animals either to suck ad libitum or give them if brought up at the pail or by hand a larger quantity of milk than they can digest the idea of overloading the stomach never suggests itself to their minds they suppose that the more food the young creature consumes the sooner it will be fat and they allow it no exercise whatever for fear it should denude its very bones of their flesh under such circumstances the stomach soon becomes deranged its functions are no longer capable of acting the milk subjected to the acid of the stomach coagulates and forms a hardened mass of curd when the muscles become affected with spasms and death frequently ensues 853 there was no species of slaughtering practised in this country so inhuman and disgraceful as that till very lately employed in killing this poor animal when under the plea of making the flesh white the calf was bled day by day till when the final hour came the animal was unable to stand this inhumanity is we believe now everywhere abolished and the calf is at once killed and with the least amount of pain a sharppointed knife is run through the neck severing all the large veins and arteries up to the vertebrae the skin is then taken off to the knee which is disjointed and to the head which is removed it is then reflected backwards and the carcase having been opened and dressed is kept apart by stretchers and the thin membrane the caul extended over the organs left in the carcase as the kidneys and sweetbread some melted fat is then scattered suddenly over the whole interior giving that white and frosted appearance to the meat that is thought to add to its beauty the whole is then hung up to cool and harden 854 the manner of cutting up veal for the english market is to divide the carcase into four quarters with eleven ribs to each fore quarter which are again subdivided into joints as exemplified on the cut illustration side of a calf showing the several joints hind quarter 1 the loin 2 the chump consisting of the rump and hockbone 3 the fillet 4 the hock or hind knuckle fore quarter 5 the shoulder 6 the neck 7 the breast 8 the fore knuckle 855 the several parts of a moderatelysized wellfed calf about eight weeks old are nearly of the following weightsloin and chump 18 lbs fillet 1212 lbs hind knuckle 512 lbs shoulder 11 lbs neck 11 lbs breast 9 lbs and fore knuckle 5 lbs making a total of 144 lbs weight the london mode of cutting the carcase is considered better than that pursued in edinburgh as giving three roasting joints and one boiling in each quarter besides the pieces being more equally divided as regards flesh and from the handsomer appearance they make on the table recipes chapter xix baked veal cold meat cookery 856

to maturity whether intended to be reared for stock or brought to an early market as veal is always a subject of great importance and requires a considerable amount of intelligence in the selection of the best course to adopt for either end when meant to be reared as stock the breeding should be so arranged that the cow shall calve about the middle of may as our subject however has more immediate reference to the calf as meat than as stock we shall confine our remarks to the mode of procedure adopted in the former case and here the first process adopted is that of weaning which consists in separating the calf entirely from the cow but at the same time rearing it on the mothers milk as the business of the dairy would be suspended if every cow were allowed to rear its young and butter cheese and cream become desideratathings to be desired but not possessed a system of economical husbandry becomes necessary so as to retain our dairy produce and yet for some weeks at least nourish

the impatient people to make them an image to worship and that aaron instead of using his delegated power to curb this sinful expression of the tribes and appease the discontented jews at once complied with their demand and telling them to bring to him their rings and trinkets fashioned out of their willing contributions a calf of gold before which the multitude fell down and worshipped whether this image was a solid figure of gold or a wooden effigy merely coated with metal is uncertain to suppose the formerknowing the size of the image made from such trifling articles as rings we must presuppose the israelites to have spoiled the egyptians most unmercifully the figure however is of more consequence than the weight or size of the idol that the israelite brought away more from goshen than the plunder of the egyptians and that they were deeply imbued with egyptian superstition the golden calf is only one out of many instances of proof for a gilded ox covered with a pall was in that country an emblem of osiris one of the gods of the egyptian trinity besides having a sacred cow and many varieties of the holy bull this priestridden people worshipped the ox as a symbol of the sun and offered to it divine honours as the emblem of frugality industry and husbandry it is therefore probable that in borrowing so familiar a type the israelites in their calfworship meant under a wellunderstood cherubic symbol to acknowledge the full force of those virtues under an emblem of divine power and goodness the prophet hosea is full of denunciations against calfworship in israel

considered equally solemn and sacred by jew or nazarene and the breaking of it a soulstaining perjury on themselves and an insult and profanation directly offered to the almighty to render the oath

the severed limbs on the marble pavement the one or all the party if there were many individuals to be bound by the oath repeating the words of the compact threaded their way in and out through the

army hastily raised the siege and removing to a distance took up a position where they could intercept the egyptians and still cover the city no sooner did the jews behold the retreat of the enemy

farmers of the adjacent districts in order to be prepared for the butcher the mode of feeding them is very simple milk is the chief article of their diet and of this the calves require a sufficient supply from first to last added to this they must be kept in a wellaired place neither too hot nor too cold and freely supplied with dry litter it is usual to exclude the lightat all events to a great degree and to put within their reach a lump of chalk which they are very fond of licking thus fed calves at the end of 8 or 9 weeks often attain a very large size viz 18 to 20 stone exclusive of the offal far heavier weights have occurred and without any deterioration in the delicacy and richness of the flesh this mode of feeding upon milk alone at first appears to be very expensive but it is not so when all things are taken into consideration for at the age of 9 or 10 weeks a calf originally purchased for 8 shillings will realize nearly the same number of pounds for 4 or even 6 weeks the milk of one cow is sufficientindeed half that quantity is enough for the first fortnight but after the 5th or 6th week it will consume the greater portion of the milk of two moderate cows but then it requires neither oilcake nor linseed nor any other food usually however the calves are not kept beyond the age of 6 weeks and will then sell for 5 or 6 pounds each the milk of the cow is then ready for a successor in this manner a relay of calves may be prepared for the markets from early spring to the end of summer a plan more advantageous than that of overfeeding one to a useless degree of

the carving of a breast of veal is not dissimilar to that of a forequarter of lamb when the shoulder has been taken off the breast of veal consists of two partsthe ribbones and the gristly brisket these two parts should first be separated by sharply passing the knife in the direction of the lines 1 2 when they are entirely divided the ribbones should be carved in the direction of the lines 5 to 6 and the brisket can be helped by cutting pieces in the direction 3 to 4 the carver should ask the guests whether they have a preference for the brisket or ribs and if there be a sweetbread served with the dish as it often is with roast breast of veal each person should receive a piece calfs head illustration calfs head 913 this is not altogether the most easylooking dish to cut when it is put before a carver for the first time there is not much real difficulty in the operation however when the head has been attentively examined and after the manner of a phrenologist you get to know its bumps good and bad in the first place inserting the knife quite down to the bone cut slices in the direction of the line 1 to 2 with each of these should be helped a piece of what is called the throat sweetbread cut in the direction of from 3 to 4 the eye and the flesh round are favourite morsels with many and should be given to those at the table who are known to be the greatest connoisseurs the jawbone being removed there will then be found some nice lean and the palate which is reckoned by some a titbit lies under the head on a separate dish there is always served the tongue and brains and each guest should be asked to take some of these fillet of veal illustration fillet of veal 914 the carving of this joint is similar to that of a round of beef slices not too thick in the direction of the line 1 to 2 are cut and the only point to be careful about is that the veal be evenly carved between the flap and the meat the stuffing is inserted and a small portion of this should be served to every guest the persons whom the host wishes most to honour should be asked if they like the delicious brown outside slice as this by many is exceedingly relished knuckle of veal illustration knuckle of veal 915 the engraving showing the dotted line from 1 to 2 sufficiently indicates the direction which should be given to the knife in carving this dish the best slices are those from the thickest part of the knuckle that is outside the line 1 to 2 loin of veal illustration loin of veal 916 as is the case with a loin of mutton the careful jointing of a loin of veal is more than half the battle in carving it if the butcher be negligent in this matter he should be admonished for there is nothing more annoying or irritating to an inexperienced carver than to be obliged to turn his knife in all directions to find the exact place where it should be inserted in order to divide the bones when the jointing is properly performed there is little difficulty in carrying the knife down in the direction of the line 1 to 2 to each guest should be given a piece of the kidney and kidney fat which lie underneath and are considered great delicacies illustration illustration chapter xx general observations on birds birds the free tenants of land air and ocean their forms all symmetry their motions grace in plumage delicate and beautiful thick without burthen close as fishes scales or loose as fullblown poppies to the breeze the pelican island 917 the divisions of birds are founded principally on their habits of life and the natural resemblance which their external parts especially their bills bear to each other according to mr vigors there are five orders each of which occupies its peculiar place on the surface of the globe so that the air the forest the land the marsh and the water has each its appropriate kind of inhabitants these are respectively designated as birds of prey perchers walkers waders and swimmers and in contemplating their variety lightness beauty and wonderful adaptation to the regions they severally inhabit and the functions they are destined to perform in the grand scheme of creation our hearts are lifted with admiration at the exhaustless ingenuity power and wisdom of him who has in producing them so strikingly manifested his handiwork not only these however but all classes of animals have their peculiar ends to fulfil and in order that this may be effectually performed they are constructed in such a manner as will enable them to carry out their conditions thus the quadrupeds that are formed to tread the earth in common with man are muscular and vigorous and whether they have passed into the servitude of man or are permitted to range the forest or the field they still retain in a high degree the energies with which they were originally endowed birds on the contrary are generally feeble and therefore timid accordingly wings have been given them to enable them to fly through the air and thus elude the force which by nature they are unable to resist notwithstanding the natural tendency of all bodies towards the centre of the earth birds when raised in the atmosphere glide through it with the greatest ease rapidity and vigour there they are in their natural element and can vary their course with the greatest promptitudecan mount or descend with the utmost facility and can light on any spot with the most perfect exactness and without the slightest injury to themselves 918 the mechanism which enables birds to wing their course through the air is both singular and instructive their bodies are covered with feathers which are much lighter than coverings of hair with which quadrupeds are usually clothed the feathers are so placed as to overlap each other like the slates or the tiles on the roof of a house they are also arranged from the forepart backwards by which the animals are enabled the more conveniently to cut their way through the air their bones are tubular or hollow and extremely light compared with those of terrestrial animals this greatly facilitates their rising from the earth whilst their heads being comparatively small their bills shaped like a wedge their bodies slender sharp below and round aboveall these present a union of conditions favourable in the last degree to cutting their way through the arial element to which they are considered as more peculiarly to belong with all these conditions however birds could not fly without wings these therefore are the instruments by which they have the power of rapid locomotion and are constructed in such a manner as to be capable of great expansion when struck in a downward direction if we except in this action the slight hollow which takes place on the underside they become almost two planes in order that the downward action may be accomplished to the necessary extent the muscles which move the wings have been made exceedingly large so large indeed that in some instances they have been estimated at not less than a sixth of the weight of the whole body therefore when a bird is on the ground and intends to fly it takes a leap and immediately stretching its wings strikes them out with great force by this act these are brought into an oblique direction being turned partly upwards and partly horizontally forwards that part of the force which has the upward tendency is neutralized by the weight of the bird whilst the horizontal force serves to carry it forward the stroke being completed it moves upon its wings which being contracted and having their edges turned upwards obviate in a great measure the resistance of the air when it is sufficiently elevated it makes a second stroke downwards and the impulse of the air again moves it forward these successive strokes may be regarded as so many leaps taken in the air when the bird desires to direct its course to the right or the left it strikes strongly with the opposite wing which impels it to the proper side in the motions of the animal too the tail takes a prominent part and acts like the rudder of a ship except that instead of sideways it moves upwards and downwards if the bird wishes to rise it raises its tail and if to fall it depresses it and whilst in a horizontal position it keeps it steady there are few who have not observed a pigeon or a crow preserve for some time a horizontal flight without any apparent motion of the wings this is accomplished by the bird having already acquired sufficient velocity and its wings being parallel to the horizon meeting with but small resistance from the atmosphere if it begins to fall it can easily steer itself upward by means of its tail till the motion it had acquired is nearly spent when it must be renewed by a few more strokes of the wings on alighting a bird expands its wings and tail fully against the air as a ship in tacking round backs her sails in order that they may meet with all the resistance possible 919 in the construction of the eyes of birds there is a peculiarity necessary to their condition as they pass a great portion of their lives among thickets and hedges they are provided for the defence of their eyes from external injuries as well as from the effects of the light when flying in opposition to the rays of the sun with a nictating or winking membrane which can at pleasure be drawn over the whole eye like a curtain this covering is neither opaque nor wholly pellucid but is somewhat transparent and it is by its means that the eagle is said to be able to gaze at the sun in birds says a writer on this subject we find that the sight is much more piercing extensive and exact than in the other orders of animals the eye is much larger in proportion to the bulk of the head than in any of these this is a superiority conferred upon them not without a corresponding utility it seems even indispensable to their safety and subsistence were this organ in birds dull or in the least degree opaque they would be in danger from the rapidity of their motion of striking against various objects in their flight in this case their celerity instead of being an advantage would become an evil and their flight be restrained by the danger resulting from it indeed we may consider the velocity with which an animal moves as a sure indication of the perfection of its vision among the quadrupeds the sloth has its sight greatly limited whilst the hawk as it hovers in the air can espy a lark sitting on a clod perhaps at twenty times the distance at which a man or a dog could perceive it 920 amongst the many peculiarities in the construction of birds not the least is the mode by which their respiration is accomplished this is effected by means of airvessels which extend throughout the body and adhere to the undersurface of the bones these by their motion force the air through the true lungs which are very small and placed in the uppermost part of the chest and closely braced down to the back and ribs the lungs which are never expanded by air are destined to the sole purpose of oxidizing the blood in the experiments made by mr john hunter to discover the use of this general diffusion of air through the bodies of birds he found that it prevents their respiration from being stopped or interrupted by the rapidity of their motion through a resisting medium it is well known that in proportion to celerity of motion the air becomes resistive and were it possible for a man to move with the swiftness of a swallow as he is not provided with an internal construction similar to that of birds the resistance of the air would soon suffocate him 921 birds are distributed over every part of the globe being found in the coldest as well as the hottest regions although some species are restricted to particular countries whilst others are widely dispersed at certain seasons of the year many of them change their abodes and migrate to climates better adapted to their temperaments or modes of life for a time than those which they leave many of the birds of britain directed by an unerring instinct take their departure from the island before the commencement of winter and proceed to the more congenial warmth of africa to return with the next spring the causes assigned by naturalists for this peculiarity are either a deficiency of food or the want of a secure asylum for the incubation and nourishment of their young their migrations are generally performed in large companies and in the day they follow a leader which is occasionally changed during the night many of the tribes send forth a continual cry to keep themselves together although one would think that the noise which must accompany their flight would be sufficient for that purpose the flight of birds across the mediterranean was noticed three thousand years ago as we find it said in the book of numbers in the scriptures that there went forth a wind from the lord and brought quails from the sea and let them fall upon the camp and a days journey round about it to the height of two cubits above the earth 922 if the beauty of birds were not a recommendation to their being universally admired their general liveliness gaiety and song would endear them to mankind it appears however from accurate observations founded upon experiment that the notes peculiar to different kinds of birds are altogether acquired and that they are not innate any more than language is to man the attempt of a nestling bird to sing has been compared to the endeavour of a child to talk the first attempts do not seem to possess the slightest rudiments of the future song but as the bird grows older and becomes stronger it is easily perceived to be aiming at acquiring the art of giving utterance to song whilst the scholar is thus endeavouring to form his notes when he is once sure of a passage he usually raises his tone but drops it again when he finds himself unequal to the voluntary task he has undertaken many wellauthenticated facts says an ingenious writer seem decisively to prove that birds have no innate notes but that like mankind the language of those to whose care they have been committed at their birth will be their language in afterlife it would appear however somewhat unaccountable why in a wild state they adhere so steadily to the song of their own species only when the notes of so many others are to be heard around them this is said to arise from the attention paid by the nestling bird to the instructions of its own parent only generally disregarding the notes of all the rest persons however who have an accurate ear and who have given their attention to the songs of birds can frequently distinguish some which have their notes mixed with those of another species but this is in general so trifling that it can hardly be considered as more than the mere varieties of provincial dialects 923 in reference to the food of birds we find that it varies as it does in quadrupeds according to the species some are altogether carnivorous others as so many of the webfooted tribes subsist on fish others again on insects and worms and others on grain and fruit the extraordinary powers of the gizzard of the granivorous tribes in comminuting their food so as to prepare it for digestion would were they not supported by incontrovertible facts founded on experiment appear to exceed all credibility tin tubes full of grain have been forced into the stomachs of turkeys and in twentyfour hours have been found broken compressed and distorted into every shape twelve small lancets very sharp both at the point and edges have been fixed in a ball of lead covered with a case of paper and given to a turkeycock and left in its stomach for eight hours after that time the stomach was opened when nothing appeared except the naked ball the twelve lancets were broken to pieces whilst the stomach remained perfectly sound and entire from these facts it is concluded that the stones so frequently found in the stomachs of the feathered tribes are highly useful in assisting the gastric juices to grind down the grain and other hard substances which constitute their food the stones themselves being also ground down and separated by the powerful action of the gizzard are mixed with the food and no doubt contribute very greatly to the health as well as to the nourishment of the animals 924 all birds being oviparous the eggs which they produce after the process of incubation or sitting for a certain length of time are in the various species different both in figure and colour as well as in point of number they contain the elements of the future young for the perfecting of which in the incubation a bubble of air is always placed at the large end between the shell and the inside skin it is supposed that from the heat communicated by the sitting bird to this confined air its spring is increased beyond its natural tenor and at the same time its parts are put into motion by the gentle rarefaction by this means pressure and motion are communicated to the parts of the egg which in some inscrutable way gradually promote the formation and growth of the young till the time comes for its escaping from the shell to preserve an egg perfectly fresh and even fit for incubation for 5 or 6 months after it has been laid raumur the french naturalist has shown that it is only necessary to stop up its pores with a slight coating of varnish or muttonsuet 925 birds however do not lay eggs before they have some place to put them accordingly they construct nests for themselves with astonishing art as builders they exhibit a degree of architectural skill niceness and propriety that would seem even to mock the imitative talents of man however greatly these are marked by his own high intelligence and ingenuity each circumstance most artfully contrived to favour warmth here read the reason of the vaulted roof how providence compensates ever kind the enormous disproportion that subsists between the mother and the numerous brood which her small bulk must quicken into life in building their nests the male and female generally assist each other and they contrive to make the outside of their tenement bear as great a resemblance as possible to the surrounding foliage or branches so that it cannot very easily be discovered even by those who are in search of it this art of nidification is one of the most wonderful contrivances which the wide field of nature can show and which of itself ought to be sufficient to compel mankind to the belief that they and every other part of the creation are constantly under the protecting power of a superintending being whose benign dispensations seem as exhaustless as they are unlimited illustration recipes chapter xxi chicken

bantam hen and as many as fifteen under a dorking the odd number is considered preferable as more easily packed it will be as well to mark the eggs you give the hen to sit on so that you may know if she lays any more if she does you must remove them for if hatched at all they would be too late for the brood if during incubation an egg should be broken remove it and take out the remainder and cleanse them in lukewarm water or it is probable the sticky nature of the contents of the broken egg will make the others cling to the hens feathers and they too may be fractured hens sittingsome hens are very capricious as regards sitting they will make a great fuss and keep pining for the nest and when they are permitted to take to it they will sit just long enough to addle the eggs and then theyre off again the safest way to guard against such annoyance is to supply the hen with some hardboiled eggs if she sits on them a reasonable time and seems steadily inclined like a good matron you may then give her proper eggs and let her set about the business in earnest chicken or fowl patties 928 ingredientsthe remains of cold roast chicken or fowl to every 14 lb of meat allow 2 oz of ham 3

seasonable at any time hatchingsometimes the chick within the shell is unable to break away from its prison for the white of the egg will occasionally harden in the air to the consistence of joiners clue when the poor chick is in a terrible fix an able writer says assistance in hatching must not be rendered prematurely and thence unnecessarily but only in the case of the chick being plainly unable to release itself then indeed an addition may probably be made to the brood as great numbers are always lost in this way the chick makes a circular fracture at the big end of the egg and a section of about onethird of the length of the shell being separated delivers the prisoner provided there is no obstruction from adhesion of the body to the membrane which lines the shell between the body of the chick and the membrane of the shell there exists a viscous fluid the white of the egg thickened with the intense heat of incubation until it becomes a positive glue when this happens the feathers stick fast to the shell and the chicks remain confined and must perish if not released the method of assistance to be rendered to chicks which have a difficulty in releasing themselves from the shell is to take the egg in the hand and dipping the finger or a piece of linen rag in warm water to apply it to the fastened parts until they are loosened by the gluey substance becoming dissolved and separated from the feathers the chick then being returned to the nest will extricate itselfa mode generally to be observed since if violence were used it would prove fatal nevertheless breaking the shell may sometimes be necessary and separating with the fingers as gently as may be the membrane from the feathers which are still to be moistened as mentioned above to facilitate the operation the points of small scissors may be useful and when there is much resistance as also apparent pain to the bird the process must be conducted in the gentlest manner and the shell separated into a number of small pieces the signs of a need of assistance are the egg being partly pecked and chipped and the cluck discontinuing its efforts for five of six hours weakness from cold may disable the chicken from commencing the operation of pecking the shell which must then be artificially performed with a circular fracture such as is made by the bird itself chicken or fowl pie 929

delicate and easy to digest of all animal food it is less alkalescent than the flesh of any other animal and its entire freedom from any irritating quality renders it a fit dish for the ailing or those whose stomachs are naturally weak in no animal however does age work such a change in regard to the quality of its flesh as it does in domestic fowls in their infancy cocks and hens are equally tender and toothsome but as time overtakes them it is the cock whose flesh toughens first a yearold cock indeed is fit for little else than to be converted into soup while a hen at the same age although sufficiently substantial is not callous to the insinuations of a carvingknife as regards capons however the rule respecting age does not hold good there is scarcely to be found a more delicious animal than a wellfed welldressed capon age does not dry up his juices indeed like wine he seems but to mellow at three years old even he is as tender as a chick with the additional advantage of his proper chicken flavour being fully developed the above remarks however concerning the capon only apply to such as are naturally fed and not crammed the latter process may produce a handsomelooking bird and it may weigh enough to satisfy the whim or avarice of its stuffer but when before the fire it will reveal the cruel treatment to which it has been subjected and will weep a

handsome variety of french extraction the plumage of the rouen duck is somewhat sombre its flesh is also much darker and though of higher flavour not near so delicate as that of our own aylesbury it is with this latter breed that the rouen duck is generally mated and the result is said to be increase of size and strength in normandy and brittany these ducks as well as other sorts greatly abound and the duckliver pts are there almost as popular as the pt de foie gras of strasburg in order to bring the livers of the wretched duck to the fashionable and unnatural size the same diabolical cruelty is resorted to as in the case of the strasburg goose the poor birds are nailed by the feet to a board placed close to a fire and in that position plentifully supplied with food and water in a few days the carcase is reduced to a mere shadow while the liver has grown monstrously we would rather abstain from the acquaintance of a man who ate pt de foie gras knowing its component parts ducks eggsthe ancient notion that ducks whose beaks have a tendency to curve upwards are better layers than those whose beaks do not thus point is we need hardly say simply absurd all ducks are good layers if they are carefully fed and tended ducks generally lay at night or early in the morning while they are in perfect health they will do this and one of the surest signs of indisposition among birds of this class is irregularity in laying the eggs laid will approach nearly the colour of the layerlightcoloured ducks laying white eggs and brown ducks greenishblue eggs darkcoloured birds laying the largest eggs one time of day the notion was prevalent that a duck would hatch no other eggs than her own and although this is not true it will be nevertheless as well to match the ducks own eggs as closely as possible for we have known instances wherein the duck has turned out of the nest and destroyed eggs differing from her own in size and colour ducksthe mallard or wild duck from which is derived the domestic species is prevalent throughout europe asia and america the mallards most remarkable characteristic is one which sets at defiance the speculations of the most profound ornithologist the female bird is extremely plain but the males plumage is a splendour of greens and browns and browns and blues in the spring however the plumage of the male begins to fade and in two months every vestige of his finery has departed and he is not to be distinguished from his soberlygarbed wife then the greens and the blues and the browns begin to bud out again and by october he is once more a gorgeous drake it is to be regretted that domestication has seriously deteriorated the moral character of the duck in a wild state he is a faithful husband desiring but one wife and devoting himself to her but no sooner is he domesticated than he becomes polygamous and makes nothing of owning ten or a dozen wives at a time as regards the females they are much more solicitous for the welfare of their progeny in a wild state than a tame should a tame ducks duckling get into mortal trouble its mother will just signify her sorrow by an extra quack or so and a flapping of her wings but touch a wild ducks little one if you dare she will buffet you with her broad wings and dash boldly at your face with her stout beak if you search for her nest amongst the long grass she will try no end of manoeuvres to lure you from it her favourite ruse being to pretend lameness to delude you into the notion that you have only to pursue her vigorously and her capture is certain so you persevere for half a mile or so and then she is up and away leaving you to find your way back to the nest if you can among the ancients opinion was at variance respecting the wholesomeness and digestibility of goose flesh but concerning the excellence of the duck all parties were agreed indeed they not only assigned to duckmeat the palm for exquisite flavour and delicacy they even attributed to it medicinal powers of the highest order not only the roman medical writers of the time make mention of it but likewise the philosophers of the period plutarch assures us that cato

food on hatching there is not often a necessity for taking away any of the brood and having hatched let the mother retain her young ones upon the nest her own time on her moving with her brood let a coop be prepared upon the short grass if the weather be fine and under shelter if otherwise cooping and feeding ducklingsbrood ducks should be cooped at some distance from any other a wide and flat dish of water to be often renewed should stand just outside the coop and barley or any other meal be the first food of the ducklings it will be needful if it be wet weather to clip their tails lest these draggle and so weaken the bird the period of the ducks confinement to the coop will depend on the weather and on the strength of the ducklings a fortnight is usually the extent of time necessary and they may even be sometimes permitted to enjoy the luxury of a swim at the end of a week they should not however be allowed to stay too long in the water at first for they will then become ill their feathers get rough and looseness of the bowels ensue in the latter case let them be closely cooped for a few days and beanmeal or oatmeal be mixed with their ordinary food illustration aylesbury ducks the aylesbury duckthe white aylesbury duck is and deservedly a universal favourite its snowy plumage and comfortable comportment make it a credit to the poultryyard while its broad and deep breast and its ample back convey the assurance that your satisfaction will not cease at its death in parts of buckinghamshire this member of the duck family is bred on an extensive scale not on plains and commons however as might be naturally imagined but in the abodes of the cottagers round the walls of the livingrooms and of the bedroom even are fixed rows of wooden boxes lined with hay and it is the business of the wife and children to nurse and comfort the feathered lodgers to feed the little ducklings and to take the old ones out for an airing sometimes the stock ducks are the cottagers own

for themselves and they will seem to get fat even upon this precarious feeding unless however ducks are supplied with besides chance food a liberal feed of solid corn or grain morning and evening their flesh will become flabby and insipid the simple way to fatten ducks is to let them have as much substantial food as they will eat bruised oats and peameal being the standard fattening food for them no cramming is required as with the turkey and some other poultry they will cram themselves to the very verge of suffocation at the same time plenty of exercise and clean water should be at their service american mode of capturing duckson the american rivers the modes of capture are various sometimes half a dozen artificial birds are fastened to a little raft and which is so weighted that the sham birds squat naturally on the water this is quite sufficient to attract the notice of a passing flock who descend to cultivate the acquaintance of the isolated few when the concealed hunter with his fowlingpiece scatters a deadly leaden shower amongst them in the winter when the water is covered with rubble ice the fowler of the delaware paints his canoe entirely white lies flat in the bottom of it and floats with the broken ice from which the aquatic inhabitants fail to distinguish it so floats the canoe till he within it understands by the quacking and fluttering and whirring of wings that he is in the midst of a flock when he is up in a moment with the murderous piece and dying quacks and lamentations rend the still air illustration bowbill ducks bowbill ducks cevery one knows how awkward are the anatidae waddling along on their unelastic webbed toes and their short legs which being placed considerably backward make the fore part of the body preponderate some however are formed more adapted to terrestrial habits than others and notably amongst these may be named dendronessa sponsa the summer duck of america this beautiful bird rears her young in the holes of trees generally overhanging the water when strong enough the young scramble to the mouth of the hole launch into the air with their little wings and feet spread out and drop into their favourite element whenever their birthplace is at some distance from the water the mother carries them to it one by one in her bill holding them so as not to injure their yet tender frame on several occasions however when the hole was 30 40 or more yards from a piece of water audubon observed that the mother suffered the young to fall on the grass and dried leaves beneath the tree and afterwards led them directly to the nearest edge of the next pool or creek there are some curious varieties of the domestic duck which only appear interesting from their singularity for there does not seem to be anything of use or value in the unusual characteristics which distinguish them thus the bowbill duck as shown in the engraving called by some writers the hookbill is remarkable for the peculiarly strange distortion of its beak and the tuft on the top of its head the penguin duck again waddles in an upright position like the penguin on account of the unnatural situation of its legs these odd peculiarities add nothing of value to the various breeds and may be set down as only the result of accidental malformation transmitted from generation to generation stewed duck and turnips cold meat cookery 937 ingredientsthe

wild duckin many parts of england the wild duck is to be found especially in those desolate fenny parts where water abounds in lincolnshire they are plentiful and are annually taken in the decoys which consist of ponds situate in the marshes and surrounded with wood or reeds to prevent the birds which frequent them from being disturbed in these the birds sleep during the day and as soon as evening sets in the decoy rises and the wild fowl feed during the night now is the time for the decoy ducks to entrap the others from the ponds diverge in different directions certain canals at the end of which funnel nets are placed along these the decoy ducks trained for the purpose lead the others in search of food after they have got a certain length a decoyman appears and drives them further on until they are finally taken in the nets it is from these decoys in lincolnshire that the london market is mostly supplied the chinese have a singular mode of catching these ducks a person wades in the water up to the chin and having his head covered with an empty calabash approaches the place where the ducks are as the birds have no suspicion of the nature of the object which is concealed under the calabash they suffer its approach and allow it to move at will among their flock the man accordingly walks about in the midst of his game and whenever he pleases pulls them by the legs under the water and fixes them to his belt until he has secured as many as he requires and then moves off as he went amongst them without exciting the slightest suspicion of the trick he has been playing them this singular mode of duckhunting is also practised on the ganges the earthen vessels of the hindoos being used instead of calabashes these vessels being those in which the inhabitants boil their rice are considered after once being used as defiled and are accordingly thrown into the river the ducktakers finding them suitable for their purpose put them on their heads and as the ducks from seeing them constantly floating down the stream are familiar with their appearance they regard them as objects from which no danger is to be expected illustration callducks ducksnares in the lincolnshire fensthe following interesting account of how ducksnaring used to be managed in the lincolnshire fens was published some years ago in a work entitled the feathered tribesin the lakes to which they resorted their favourite haunts were observed and in the most sequestered part of a haunt a pipe or ditch was cut across the entrance decreasing gradually in width from the entrance to the further end which was not more than two feet wide the ditch was of a circular form but did not bend much for the first ten yards the banks of the lake on each side of the ditch were kept clear of weeds and close herbage in order that the ducks might get on them to sit and dress themselves along the ditch poles were driven into the ground close to the edge on each side and the tops were bent over across the ditch and tied together the poles then bent forward at the entrance to the ditch and formed an arch the top of which was tea feet distant from the surface of the water the arch was made to decrease in height as the ditch decreased in width so that the remote end was not more than eighteen inches in height the poles were placed about six feet from each other and connected by poles laid lengthwise across the arch and tied together over the whole was thrown a net which was made fast to a reed fence at the entrance and nine or ten yards up the ditch and afterwards strongly pegged to the ground at the end of the ditch furthest from the entrance was fixed what was called a tunnelnet of about four yards in length of a round form and kept open by a number of hoops about eighteen inches in diameter placed at a small distance from each other to keep it distended supposing the circular bend of the ditch to be to the right when one stands with his back to the lake then on the lefthand side a number of reed fences were constructed called shootings for the purpose of screening the decoyman from observation and in such a manner that the fowl in the decoy would not be alarmed while he was driving those that were in the pipe these shootings which were ten in number were about four yards in length and about six feet high from the end of the last shooting a person could not see the lake owing to the bend of the ditch and there was then no further occasion for shelter were it not for these shootings the fowl that remained about the mouth of the ditch would have been alarmed if the person driving the fowl already under the net should have been exposed and would have become so shy as entirely to forsake the place the decoy man dog and ducksthe first thing the decoyman did on approaching the ditch was to take a piece of lighted peat or turf and to hold it near his mouth to prevent the birds from smelling him he was attended by a dog trained to render him

were any fowl within if not he walked to see if any were about the entrance to the ditch if there were he stopped made a motion to his dog and gave him a piece of cheese to eat when the dog went directly to a hole through the reed fence and the birds immediately flew off the back into the water the dog returned along the bank between the reed fences and came out to his master at another hole the man then gave the dog something more to encourage him and the dog repeated his rounds till the birds were attracted by his motions and followed him into the mouth of the ditchan operation which was called working them the man now retreated further back working the dog at different holes until the ducks were sufficiently under the net he then commanded his dog to lie down under the fence and going himself forward to the end of the ditch next the lake he took off his hat and gave it a wave between the shootings all the birds that were under the net could then see him but none that were in the lake could the former flew forward and the man then ran to the next shooting and waved his hat and so on driving them along until they came into the tunnelnet into which they crept when they were

history is silent there is little doubt however that like the dog it has been attached to mankind ever since mankind were attached to civilization although the social position of this bird is at the present time highly respectable it is nothing to what it was when rome was mistress of the world writing at that period pliny says respecting the domestic cock the gait of the cock is proud and

divinations by means of this bird supposing there to be a doubt in the camp as to the fittest day to fight a battle the letter of every day in the week would be placed face downwards and a grain of corn placed on each then the sacred cock would be let loose and according to the letters he pecked his corn from so would the battletime be regulated on one momentous occasion however a person inimical to priestly interest officiously examined the grain and found that those lying on the letters not wanted were made of wax and the birds preferring the true grain left these untouched it is needless to add that after this divination through the medium of cocks and grain fell out of fashion whether or no the learned fowl above alluded to were of the game breed is unknown but that the birds were bred for the inhuman sport of fighting many hundred years before the christian era there can be no doubt themistocles the athenian king who flourished more than two thousand years ago took advantage of the sight of a pitched battle between two cocks to harangue his soldiers on courage observe said he with what intrepid valour they fight inspired by no other motive than lore of victory whereas you have to contend for your religion and your liberty for your wives and children and for the tombs of your ancestors and to this day his courage has not degenerated he still preserves his bold and elegant gait his sparkling eye while his wedgeshaped beak and cruel spurs are ever ready to support his defiant crow it is no wonder that the breed is not plentifulfirst on account of the few

fierce bullterrier was kennelled the hen had chicks and when about three weeks old one of them strayed into the dogkennel the grim beast within took no notice of the tiny fledgling but when the anxious mother ventured in to fetch out the truant with a growl the dog woke and nearly snapped her asunder in his great jaws the cock bird saw the tragic fate of its partner but nothing daunted flew at the dog with a fierce cry and pecked savagely at its face the odds however were too great and when the terrier had sufficiently recovered from the astonishment caused by the sudden and unexpected attack he seized the audacious bantam and shook him to death and in five minutes the devoted couple were entombed in pinchers capacious maw boiled fowl and rice 940 ingredients1 fowl mutton broth 2

he has five claws on each foot the extra claw however is never of sufficient length to encumber the foot or to cause it to drag its nest or scratch out the eggs the colour of the true dorking is pure white long in the body short in the legs and a prolific layer thirty years ago there was much controversy respecting the origin of the dorking the men of sussex declared that the bird belonged to them and brought birds indigenous to their weald and possessing all the dorking fine points and peculiarities in proof of the declaration others inclined to the belief that the poland bird was the father of the dorking and not without at least a show of reason as the former bird much resembles the latter in shape and despite its sombre hue it is well known that the poland cock will occasionally beget

other hens the amount of nutriment contained in them is not nearly so great mr mowbray once kept an account of the number of eggs produced by this prolific bird with the following resultfrom the 25th of october to the 25th of the following september five hens laid 503 eggs the average weight of each egg was one ounce five drachms and the total weight of the whole exclusive of the shells 5014 pounds taking the weight of the birds at the fair average of five pounds each we thus see them producing within a year double their weight of egg alone and supposing every egg to contain a chick and

modes of fattening fowlsit would i think be a difficult matter to find among the entire fraternity of fowlkeepers a dozen whose mode of fattening stock is the same some say that the grand f secret is to give them abundance of saccharine food others say nothing beats heavy corn steeped in milk while another breeder celebrated in his day and the recipient of a gold medal from a learned society says the best method is as followsthe chickens are to be taken from the hen the night after they are hatched and fed with eggs hardboiled chopped and mixed with crumbs of bread as larks and other small birds are fed for the first fortnight after which give them oatmeal and treacle mixed so as to crumble of which the chickens are very fond and thrive so fast that at the end of two months they will be as large as fullgrown fowls others there are who insist that nothing beats oleaginous diet and cram their birds with ground oats and suet but whatever the course of diet favoured on one point they seem agreed and that is that while fattening the fowls should be kept in the dark supposing the reader to be a dealera breeder of gross chicken meat for the market against which supposition the chances are 10000 to 1 and beset with as few scruples as generally trouble the huckster the advice is valuable laugh and grow fat is a good maxim enough but sleep and grow fat is as is well known to folks of porcine attributes a better the poor birds immured in their dark dungeons ignorant that there is life and sunshine abroad tuck their heads under their wings and make a long night of it while their digestive organs having no harder work than to pile up fat have an easy time enough but unless we are mistaken he who breeds poultry for his own eating bargains for a more substantial reward

likely to fatten well are those first hatched in the brood and those with the shortest legs longlegged fowls as a rule are by far the most difficult to fatten the most delicate sort are those which are put up to fatten as soon as the hen forsakes them for as says an old writer then they will be in fine condition and full of flesh which flesh is afterwards expended in the exercise of foraging for food and in the increase of stature and it may be a work of some weeks to recover itespecially with young cocks but whether you take them in hand as chicks or not till they are older the three prime rules to be observed are sound and various food warmth and cleanliness there is nothing that a fatting fowl grows so fastidious about as his water if water any way foul be offered him he will not drink it but sulk with his food and pine and you all the while wondering the reason why keep them separate allowing to each bird as much space as you can spare spread the ground with sharp sandy

and little apt to stray consequently it is calculated to induce more restless birds to fettle down and make themselves comfortable if you wish to breed pouters you cannot do worse than intrust them with the care of their own eggs roast pigeons 974 ingredientspigeons 3 oz of butter pepper and salt to taste trussingpigeons to be good should be eaten fresh if kept a little the flavour goes off and they should be drawn as soon as killed cut off the heads and necks truss the wings over the backs and cut off the toes at the first joint previous to trussing they should be carefully cleaned as no bird requires so much washing illustration roast pigeon modewipe the birds very dry season them inside with pepper and salt and put about 34 oz of butter into the body of each this makes them moist put them down to a bright fire and baste them well the whole of the time they are cooking they will be done enough in from 20 to 30 minutes garnish with fried parsley and serve with a tureen of parsley and butter breadsauce and gravy the same as for roast fowl are exceedingly nice accompaniments to roast pigeons as also eggsauce timefrom 20 minutes to 12 hour average cost 6d to 9d each seasonable from april to september but in the greatest perfection from midsummer to michaelmas the pigeonthe pigeon tribe forms a connecting ling between the passerine birds and poultry they are widely distributed over the world some of the species being found even in the arctic regions their chief food is grain and they drink much not at intervals like other birds but by a continuous draught like quadrupeds the wild pigeon or stockdove is the parent whence all the varieties of the domestic pigeon are derived in the wild state it is still found in many parts of this island making its nest in the holes of rocks in the hollows of trees or in old towers but never like the ringdove on branches the blue housepigeon is the variety principally reared for the table in this country and is produced from our farmyards in great numbers when young and still fed by their parents they are most preferable for the table and are called squabs under six months they are denominated squeakers and at six months they begin to breed their flesh is accounted savoury delicate and stimulating and the darkcoloured birds are considered to have the highest flavour whilst the light are esteemed to have the more delicate flesh the pigeonhouse or dovecotthe first thing to be done towards keeping pigeons is to provide a commodious place for their reception and the next is to provide the pigeons themselves the situation or size of the dovecot will necessarily depend on convenience but there is one point which must invariably be observed and that is that every pair of pigeons has two holes or rooms to nest in this is indispensable as without it there will be no security but the constant prospect of confusion breaking of eggs and the destruction of young the proper place for the pigeonhouse is the poultryyard but it does very well near dwellings stables brewhouses bakehouses or such offices some persons keep pigeons in rooms and have them making their nests on the floor the object is to escape the danger of the young falling out but in such cases there is a great risk of rats or other vermin getting at the pigeons aspect of the pigeonhousethe front of the pigeonhouse should have a southwest aspect and if a room be selected for the purpose it is usual to break a hole in the roof of the building for the passage of the pigeons but which can be closed at convenience a platform ought to be laid at the entrance for the pigeons to perch upon with some kind of defence against strange cats which will frequently depopulate a whole dovecot yet although cats are dangerous neighbours for the birds they are necessary to defend them from the approach of rats and mice which will not only suck the eggs but destroy the birds the platform should be painted white and renewed as the paint wears off white being a favourite colour with pigeons and also most conspicuous as a mark to enable them to find their house the boxes ought also to be similarly painted and renewed when necessary for which purpose lime and water will do very well the necessity of cleanlinessas cleanliness in human habitations is of the first importance so is it in the pigeonhouse there the want of it will soon render the place a nuisance not to be approached and the birds both young and old will be so covered with vermin and filth that they will neither enjoy health nor comforts whilst early mortality amongst them will be almost certain in some cases the pigeonhouse is cleaned daily but it should always be done at any rate once a week and the floor covered with sifted gravel frequently renewed pigeons being exceedingly fond of water and having a prescience of the coming of rain they may be seen upon the housetops waiting upon it until late in the evening and then spreading their wings to receive the luxury of the refreshing shower when they are confined in a room therefore they should be allowed a wide pan of water to be often renewed this serves them for a bath which cools refreshes and assists them to keep their bodies clear of vermin breeding pigeonsin breeding pigeons it is necessary to match a cock and hen and shut them up together or place them near to each other and in the course of a day or two there is little doubt of their mating various rules have been laid down for the purpose of assisting to distinguish the cock from the hen pigeon but the masculine forwardness and action of the cock is generally so remarkable that he is easily ascertained the pigeon being monogamous the male attaches and confines himself to one female and the attachment is reciprocal and the fidelity of the dove to its mate is proverbial at the age of six months young pigeons are termed squeakers and then begin to breed when properly managed their courtship and the wellknown tone of voice in the cock just then acquired and commencing are indications of their approaching union nestlings while fed by cock and hen are termed squabs and are at that age sold and used for the table the dovehouse pigeon is said to breed monthly when well supplied with food at all events it may be depended on that pigeons of almost any healthy and wellestablished variety will breed eight or nine times in the year whence it may readily be conceived how vast are the numbers that may be raised illustration carrier pigeons the carrier pigeonwithout doubt the carrier is entitled to rank first in the pigeon family with the exception perhaps of the bluerock pigeons no domestic fowl can be traced to so remote an antiquity when greece was in its glory carrier pigeons were used to convey to distant parts the names of the victors at the olympian games during the holy war when acre was besieged by king richard saladin habitually corresponded with the besieged by means of carrier pigeons a shaft from an english crossbow however happened to bring one of those feathered messengers to the ground and the stratagem was discovered the design of the saracens revealed and so turned against the designers that acre was in the hands of the christians before the wily saladin dreamt of such a thing pigeon pie epsom grandstand recipe 975 ingredients112 lb of rumpsteak 2 or 3 pigeons 3

smaller the size of this variety the greater its value the head should be round and smooth the neck thin and the tail similar to that of the turbit highlybred birds of this variety will attain an elevation in their flight beyond that of any other pigeons and it is in seeing these little birds wing themselves so far into the skies that the fanciers take such delight for four or five hours tumblers have been known to keep on the wing and it is when they are almost lost to the power of human vision that they exhibit those pantomimic feats which give them their name and which are marked by a tumbling overandover process which suggests the idea of their having suddenly become giddy been deprived of their selfcontrol or overtaken by some calamity this acrobatic propensity in these pigeons has been ascribed by some to the absence of a proper power in the tail but is nothing more than a natural habit for which no adequate reason can be assigned of this variety the almond tumbler is the most beautiful and the greater the variation of the colour in the flight and tail the greater their value illustration runt pigeons the runt pigeonthis is generally esteemed among the largest of the pigeon varieties and being possessed of proportionate strength with a strong propensity to exercise it they keep the dovecot in a state of almost continual commotion by domineering over the weaker inmates they breed tolerably well however and are valuable for the table there is both the leghorn and the spanish runt variously plumaged but when red white or black mottled are most highly esteemed one of the great advantages connected with the runt is that he is not likely to fly away from home being heavy birds they find it difficult when well fed to mount even to a low housetop again they require no loft or special dwellingplace but if properly tended will be perfectly satisfied and thrive as well in a rabbithutch as any where their flavour is very good and it is not an uncommon thing for a squeaker runt to exceed a pound and a quarter in weight illustration nun pigeons the nun pigeonthe tumbler bears a strong resemblance to this variety which is characterized by a tuft of feathers rising from the back of the head and which on the whole is an extremely pretty little bird according to the colour of the head it is called the red black or yellowheaded nun to be a perfect bird it should have a small head and beak and the larger the tuft at the back of his head the handsomer the bird is esteemed and proportionately valuable in the eyes of pigeonfanciers illustration trumpeter pigeons the trumpeter pigeonfrom the circumstance of this bird imitating the sound of a trumpet instead of cooing like other pigeons it has received its designation it is of the middle size having its legs and feet covered with feathers and its plumage generally of a mottled blackandwhite it has a tuft springing from the root of its beak and the larger this topknot is the higher the estimation in which the breed is held in their powers of trumpeting some are more expert than others and whether this has any effect in influencing their own estimate of themselves we cannot say but they are rather select in the choice of their company if two of them are put in a pigeonhouse with other doves it will be found that they confine their association almost entirely to each other as much as two guineas have been paid for a welltrained docile bird of this kind illustration woodpigeon the wood or wild pigeonbuffon enumerates upwards of thirty varieties of the pigeon which he derives from one rootviz the stockdove or common wild pigeon all the varieties of colour and form which we witness he attributes to human contrivance and fancy nevertheless there exist essentially specific differences in these birds which would appear to be attributable rather to the nature of the region soil and climate to which they are indigenous than to the art and ingenuity of man the stockdove in its wild state is still found in some parts of britain forming its nest in the holes of rocks old towers and in the hollows of trees it never however like the ringdove nestles in the branches multitudes of wild pigeons still visit our shores in the winter coming from their more northerly retreats making their appearance about november and retiring again in the spring when forests of beechwood covered large tracts of the ground of this country these birds used to haunt them in myriads frequently covering a mile of ground in extent when they went out in the morning to feed

seasonable from april to september illustration fantail pigeons the fantail pigeonthis curious variety is inferior in point of size to most of the other varieties and is characterized by having a short slender bill pendent wings and naked legs and feet it has the power of erecting its tail in the manner of a turkeycock during which action especially when paying court to its mate it trembles or shakes like the peacock when moving about with his train expanded and in full display this power of erecting and spreading the tail is not confined to the male bird alone the female possesses the same power to an equal extent and otherwise resembles the male in every respect it is not very prolific and seldom succeeds so well in the aviary or pigeonhouse as most of the other kinds illustration jacobin pigeons the jacobin pigeonthis variety having the power to transmit to posterity a form precisely similar with all its peculiar characters undiminished is among pigeonfanciers designated as of a pure or permanent race it is distinguished by a remarkable ruff or frill of raised feathers which commencing behind the head and proceeding down the neck and breast forms a kind of hood not unlike that worn by a monk from this circumstance it has obtained its gallic name of nonnain capuchin in size it is one of the smallest of the domestic pigeons and its form is light and elegant it is a very productive species and having its flight considerably impeded by the size and form of its hooded frill keeps much at home and is well adapted for the aviary or other buildings where pigeons are confined illustration turbit pigeons the turbit pigeonthis variety bears a strong resemblance to the jacobin having a kind of frill in the fore part of its neck occasioned by the breastfeathers lying contrariwise and standing straight out the species is classed in accordance with the colour of the shoulders similarly as the nuns are by the colour of their heads their characteristics of excellence are a full frill short bill and small round head in germany it is called the ruffle pigeon in allusion to the feathers on its breast and it has rarely any feathers on its feet there is a peculiarity connected with this bird which somewhat lowers it in the estimation of fanciers it seldom rears more than one at a time which therefore marks it as a bird rather for amusement than profit illustration barb pigeons the barb pigeonthe name of this variety is a contraction of barbary from which country it originally comes it is both prolific and has excellent qualities as a nurse the kind most esteemed is that of one uniform colour that of blueblack being preferable to any other speckled or mottled barbs are esteemed the most common of all pigeons it is not unlike the carrier pigeon and at a small distance might easily be mistaken for the latter it has a short beak and a small wattle a spongy pinky skin round the eyes is its chief characteristic however and this increases in size till the bird is three or four years old this peculiarity is hardly distinguishable in very young birds illustration blue rockpigeon the rock pigeonthis variety in its wild state is found upon the rocky parts of the west of scotland and the bold shores of the western isles more abundant than in any other parts of the british islands as the shores of the mainland are exposed to the muds of the atlantic and the comparatively small islands are surrounded by that ocean the low grounds exposed to the west are seldom covered with snow for any length of time and thus the birds easily find a supply of food the numbers which there congregate are often very great and the din of their united cry is sometimes very loud and even alarming the love of home and the certainty of returning to it is very conspicuous in the rockpigeon or biset as it is called by the french flocks from different parts of the coasts often meet on the feedinggrounds but when the time of returning to rest comes round each one keeps to its own party illustration owl pigeons the owl pigeonthis pigeon does not seem to be so well known as it formerly was if we may judge from the fact that few modern writers mention it like the turbit pigeon the owl has a remarkable tuft of feathers on the breast it having been compared by some to the frill of a shirt and by others to a fullblown white rose in size it is not quite so large a pigeon as the jacobin it is said to be preferred in france above other varieties as a bird to rear and kill for the table in england it is very far from being common indeed we have applied to several keepers of pigeons who have fancied themselves acquainted with all the varieties of this bird and they have been able to tell us nothing of it mr harrison weir our artist however has made his portrait from the life boiled rabbit illustration boiled rabbit 977 ingredientsrabbit water modefor boiling choose rabbits with smooth and sharp claws as that denotes they are young should these be blunt and rugged the ears dry and tough the animal is old after emptying and skinning it wash it well in cold water and let it soak for about 14 hour in warm water to draw out the blood bring the head round to the side and fasten it there by means of a skewer run through that and the body put the rabbit into sufficient hot water to cover it let it boil very gently until tender which will be in from 12 to 34 hour according to its size and age dish it and smother it either with onion mushroom or liver sauce or parsleyandbutter the former is however generally preferred to any of the lastnamed sauces when liversauce is preferred the liver should be boiled for a few minutes and minced very finely or rubbed through a sieve before it is added to the sauce timea very young rabbit 12 hour a

temperate climates it does not reach so far north as the hare the wild rabbit is a native of great britain and is found in large numbers in the sandy districts of norfolk and cambridgeshire its flesh is by some considered to have a higher flavour than that of the tame rabbit although it is neither so white nor so delicate the animal however becomes larger and fatter in the tame than in the wild state but it is not desirable to have it so fat as it can be made curried rabbit 978 ingredients1 rabbit 2 oz of butter 3 onions 1 pint of stock no 104 1 tablespoonful of curry powder 1 tablespoonful

frequently made in favourable localities and some of them are so large as to comprise 2000 acres the common wild rabbit is of a grey colour and is esteemed the best for the purposes of food its skin is valuable as an article of commerce being used for the making of hats another variety of the rabbit however called the silvergrey has been lately introduced to this country and is still more valuable its colour is a black ground thickly interspersed with grey hairs and its powers as a destroyer and consumer of vegetable food are well known to be enormous especially by those who have

varieties in rabbitsalmost everybody knows that a rabbit is a furry animal that lives on plants and burrows in the ground that it has its varieties as well as other animals and that it is frequently an especial favourite with boys among its varieties the shortlegged with width and substance of loin is the most hardy and fattens the most expeditiously it has besides the soundest liver rabbits generally being subject to defects of that part it is also the smallest variety there is a very large species of the harecolour having much bone length and depth of carcase large and long ears with full eyes resembling those of the hare it might readily be taken for a hybrid or mule but for the objection to its breeding its flesh is highcoloured substantial and more savoury than that of the common rabbit and cooked like the hare it makes a good dish the large white and yellow and white species have whiter and more delicate flesh and cooked in the same way will rival the turkey rabbits are divided into four kinds distinguished as warreners parkers hedgehogs and sweethearts the warrener as his name implies is a member of a subterranean community and is less effeminate than his kindred who dwell upon the earth and have the world at their will and his fur is the most esteemed after him comes the parker whose favourite resort is a gentlemans pleasureground where he usually breeds in great numbers and from which he frequently drives away the hares the hedgehog is a sort of vagabond rabbit that tinker like roams about the country and would have a much better coat on his back if he was more settled in his habits and remained more at home the sweetheart is a tame rabbit with its fur so sleek soft and silky that it is also used to some extent in the important branch of

fecundity of the rabbitthe fruitfulness of this animal has been the subject of wonder to all naturalists it breeds seven times in the year and generally begets seven or eight young ones at a time if we suppose this to happen regularly for a period of four years the progeny that would spring from a single pair would amount to more than a million as the rabbit however has many enemies it can never be permitted to increase in numbers to such an extent as to prove injurious to mankind for it not only furnishes man with an article of food but is by carnivorous animals of every description

however have ceased to exist and london receives the supply of tame as well as wild rabbits chiefly from the country where they are kept however the rabbithouse should be placed upon a dry foundation and be well ventilated exposure to rain whether externally or internally is fatal to rabbits which like sheep are liable to the rot springing from the same causes thorough ventilation and good air are indispensable where many rabbits are kept or they will neither prosper nor remain healthy for any length of time a thorough draught or passage for the air is therefore absolutely necessary and should

of the hutches intended for breeding should have two roomsa feeding and a bedroom those are single for the use of the weaned rabbits or for the bucks which are always kept separate the floors should

seasonable from september to february illustration lopeared rabbit fancy rabbitsthe graceful fall of the ears is the first thing that is looked to by the fancier next the dewlap if the animal is in its prime then the colours and marked points and lastly the shape and general appearance the ears of a fine rabbit should extend not less than seven inches measured from tip to tip in a line across the skull but even should they exceed this length they are admitted with reluctance into a fancy stock unless they have a uniform and graceful droop the dewlap which is a fold of skin under the neck and throat is only seen in fancy rabbits after they have attained their full growth it commences immediately under the jaw and adds greatly to the beauty of their appearance it goes down the throat and between the fore legs and is so broad that it projects beyond the chin the difference between the fancy and common rabbit in the back independent of the ears is sufficient to strike the common observer fancy rabbits fetch a very high price so much as five and ten guineas and even more is sometimes given for a firstrate doe if young ones are first procured from a good family the foundation of an excellent stock can be procured for a much smaller sum sometimes the ears instead of drooping down slope backwards a rabbit with this characteristic is scarcely admitted into a fancy lot and is not considered worth more than the common variety the next position is when one ear lops outwards and the other stands erect rabbits of this kind possess but little value however fine the shape and beautiful the colour although they sometimes breed as good specimens as finer ones the forward or hornlop is one degree nearer perfection than the halflop the ears in this case slope forward and down over the forehead rabbits with this peculiarity are often perfect in other respects with the exception of the droop of the ears and often become the parents of perfect young ones does of this kind often have the power of lifting an ear erect in the earlop the ears spread out in an horizontal position like the wings of a bird in flight or the arms of a man swimming a great many excellent does have this characteristic and some of the bestbred bucks in the fancy are entirely so sometimes a rabbit drops one ear completely but raises the other so neatly horizontally as to constitute an earlop this is superior to all others except the perfect fall which is so rarely to be met with that those which are merely earlopped are considered as valuable rabbits if well bred and with other good qualities the real lop has ears that hang down by the side of the cheek slanting somewhat outward in their descent with the open part of the ear inward and sometimes either backwards or forwards instead of perpendicular when the animals stand in an easy position the tips of the ears touch the ground the hollows of the ears in a fancy rabbit of a firstrate kind should be turned so completely backwards that only the outer part of them should remain in front they should match exactly in their descent and should slant outwards as little as possible the same authority asserts that perfect lops are so rare that a breeder possessing twenty of the handsomest and most perfect does would consider himself lucky if in the course of a year he managed to raise twelve fulllopped rabbits out of them all as regards variety and purity of colour an experienced breeder says the fur of fancy rabbits may be blue or rather leadcolour and white or black and white or tawny and white that is tortoiseshellcoloured but it is not of so much importance what colours the coat of a rabbit displays as it is that those colours shall be arranged in a particular manner forming imaginary figures or fancied resemblances to certain objects hence the peculiarities of their markings have been denoted by distinctive designations what is termed the blue butterfly smut was for some time considered the most valuable of fancy rabbits it is thus named on account of having bluish or leadcoloured spots on either side of the nose having some resemblance to the spread wings of a butterfly what may be termed the groundwork of the rabbits face being white a black and white rabbit may also have the face marked in a similar manner constituting a black butterfly smut but a good fancy rabbit must likewise have other marks without which it cannot be considered a perfect model of its kind there should be a black or blue patch on its back called the saddle the tail must be of the same colour with the back and snout while the legs should be all white and there ought to be dark stripes on both sides of the body in front passing backwards to meet the saddle and uniting on the top of the shoulders at the part called the withers in a horse these stripes form what is termed the chain having somewhat the appearance of a chain or collar hanging round the neck among thoroughbred fancy rabbits perhaps not one in a hundred will have all these markings clearly and exactly displayed on the coat but the more nearly the figures on the coat of a rabbit approach to the pattern described the greater will be its value so far at least as relates to colour the beauty and consequent worth of a fancy rabbit however depends a good deal on its shape or what is styled its carriage a rabbit is said to have a good carriage when its back is finely arched rising full two inches above the top of its head which must be held so low as for the muzzle and the points of the ears to reach almost to

introduced to french tables an animal called the harerabbit partaking of the nature characteristics and qualifications of both the hare and the rabbit it is highly spoken of both as regards flesh and flavour and it is said to be the only hybrid which is able to perpetuate its race we hope that some enterprising individual will soon secure for english tables what would seem to be a really valuable addition to our other game and poultry dishes although it will be rather difficult to exactly assign its proper position as within or without the meaning of game as by law established only a few

as an article of commerce is highly esteemed we are not aware whether it is eaten by the inhabitants and but few specimens have been introduced into england where doubtless the beauty of its coat

proves its origin that the form of the bird is altogether foreign and that it is found in america alone in a wild state there is but little doubt from the information which has been gained at considerable trouble that it appeared generally in europe about the end of the 17th century that it was first imported into france by jesuits who had been sent out missionaries to the west and that from france it spread over europe to this day in many localities in france a turkey is called a jesuit on the farms of n america where turkeys are very common they are raised either from eggs which have been found or from young ones caught in the woods they thus preserve almost entirely their original plumage the turkey only became gradually acclimated both on the continent and in england in the

the birds which was generally near a field of nettles or where grain of any kind was plentiful they would send a welltrained dog into the midst of the flock the turkeys no sooner perceived their enemy than they would run off at full speed and with such swiftness that they would leave the dog far behind he however would follow in their wake and as they could not for a great length of time continue at their speed they were at last forced to seek shelter in the trees there they would sit spent with fatigue till the hunters would approach and with long poles knock them down one after the other

the one remaining bone is removed draw the wings and legs back to their proper form and turn the fowl right side outwards 993 a turkey is boned exactly in the same manner but as it requires a very large proportion of forcemeat to fill it entirely the logs and wings are sometimes drawn into the body to diminish the expense of this if very securely trussed and sewn the bird may be either boiled

from july to october and are taken in large numbers on the south downs in the neighbourhood of eastbourne brighton and other parts of sussex they are taken by means of snares and nets and numbers of them are eaten on the spot by the inhabitants the larger ones are sent to london and potted where they are by many as much esteemed as the ortolans of the continent mr pennant assigns as the reason of their abounding on the downs about eastbourne the existence of a species of fly which forms their favourite food and which feeds on the wild thyme on the adjacent hills illustration the guineapig 997 the guineapigthis common hutchcompanion of the rabbit although originally a native of brazil propagates freely in england and other european countries were it not that they suffer cruelly from cats and numerous other enemies and that it is the habit of the males to devour their own offspring their numbers would soon become overwhelming rats however it is said carefully avoid them and for this reason they are frequently bred by rabbitfanciers by way of protection for their young stock against those troublesome vermin the lower tier of a rabbithutch is esteemed excellent quarters by the guineapig here as he runs loose he will devour the waste food of his more admired companion home naturalists assert that the guineapig will breed at two months old the litter varying from four to twelve at a time it is varied in colourwhite fawn and black and a mixture of the three colours forming a tortoiseshell which is the more generally admired hue occasionally the white ones have red eyes like those of the ferret and the white rabbit their flesh although eatable is decidedly unfit for food they have been tasted however we presume by some enthusiast eager to advance the cause of science or by some eccentric epicure in search of a new pleasure for his palate unless it has been that they deter rats from intruding within the rabbithutch they are as useless as they are harmless the usual ornament of an animals hind quarters is denied them and were it not for this fact and also for their difference in colour the shaksperean locution a rat without a tail would designate them very

it is not still fattened in norwich for the corporation of that place persons who have property on the river there take the young birds and send them to some one who is employed by the corporation to be fed and for this trouble he is paid or was wont to be paid about half a guinea a bird it is as the future bird of elegance and grace that the young swan is mostly admired when it has become old enough to grace the waters then it is that all admire her when she with archd neck between her white wings mantling proudly rows her state with oary feet poultry carving roast duck illustration roast duck 999 no dishes require so much knowledge and skill in their carving as do game and poultry for it is necessary to be well acquainted with the anatomy of the bird and animal in order to place the knife at exactly the proper point a tough fowl and an old goose are sad triers of a carvers powers and temper and indeed sometimes of the good humour of those in the neighbourhood of the carver for a sudden tilt of the dish may eventuate in the placing a quantity of the gravy in the lap of the right or lefthand supporter of the host we will endeavour to assist those who are unacquainted with the gentle art of carving and also those who are but slightly acquainted with it by simply describing the rules to follow and referring to the distinctlymarked illustrations of each dish which will further help to bring light to the minds of the uninitiated if the bird be a young duckling it may be carved like a fowl viz by first taking off the leg and the wing on either side as described at no 1000 but in cases where the duckling is very small it will be as well not to separate the leg from the wing as they will not then form too large a portion for a single serving after the legs and wings are disposed of the remainder of the duck will be also carved in the same manner as a fowl and not much difficulty will be experienced as ducklings are tender and the joints are easily broken by a little gentle forcing or penetrated by the knife in cases where the duck is a large bird the better plan to pursue is then to carve it like a goose that is by cutting pieces from the breast in the direction indicated by the lines marked from 1 to 2 commencing to carve the slices close to the wing and then proceeding upwards from that to the breastbone if more should be wanted than can be obtained from both sides of the breast then the legs and wings must be attacked in the same way as is described in connection with carving a fowl it may be here remarked that as the legs of a duck are placed far more backward than those of a fowl their position causing the waddling motion of the bird the thighbones will be found considerably nearer towards the backbone than in a chicken this is the only difference worth mentioning the carver should ask each guest if a portion of stuffing would be agreeable and in order to get at this a cut should be made below the breast as shown by the line from 3 to 4 at the part called the apron and the spoon inserted as described in the recipe it is an excellent plan when a couple of ducks are served to have one with and the other without stuffing as to the prime parts of a duck it has been said that the wing of a flier and the leg of a swimmer are severally the best portions some persons are fond of the feet of the duck and in trussing these should never be taken off the leg wing and neckbone are here shown so that it will be easy to see the shape they should be when cut off illustration leg wing and neckbone of duck boiled fowl illustration boiled fowl illustration leg wing and neckbone of fowl 1000 this will not be found a very difficult member of the poultry family to carve unless as may happen a very old farmyard occupant useless for egglaying purposes has by some unlucky mischance been introduced info the kitchen as a fine young chicken skill however and the application of a small amount of strength combined with a fine keeping of the temper will even get over that difficulty fixing the fork firmly in the breast let the knife be sharply passed along the line shown from 1 to 2 then cut downwards from that line to fig 3 and the wing it will be found can be easily withdrawn the shape of the wing should be like the accompanying engraving let the fork be placed inside the leg which should be gently forced away from the body of the fowl and the joint being thus discovered the carver can readily cut through it and the leg can be served when the leg is displaced it should be of the same shape as that shown in the annexed woodcut the legs and wings on either side having been taken off the carver should draw his knife through the flesh in the direction of the line 4 to 5 by this means the knife can be slipped underneath the merrythought which being lifted up and pressed backward will immediately come off the collaror neckbones are the next to consider these lie on each side of the merrythought close under the upper part of the wings and in order to free these from the fowl they must also be raised by the knife at their broad end and turned from the body towards the breastbone until the shorter piece of the bone as shown in the cut breaks off there will now be left only the breast with the ribs the breast can be without difficulty disengaged from the ribs by cutting through the latter which will offer little impediment the sidebones are now to be taken off and to do this the lower end of the back should be turned from the carver who should press the point of the knife through the top of the backbone near the centre bringing it down towards the end of the back completely through the bone if the knife is now turned in the opposite direction the joint will be easily separated from the vertebra the backbone being now uppermost the fork should be pressed firmly down on it whilst at the same time the knife should be employed in raising up the lower small end of the fowl towards the fork and thus the back will be dislocated about its middle the wings breast and merrythought are esteemed the prime parts of a fowl and are usually served to the ladies of the company to whom legs except as a matter of paramount necessity should not be given byron gave it as one reason why he did not like dining with ladies that they always had the wings of the fowls which he himself preferred we heard a gentleman who when he might have had a wing declare his partiality for a leg saying that he had been obliged to eat legs for so long a time that he had at last come to like them better than the other more prized parts if the fowl is caponlike very large slices maybe carved from its breast in the same manner as from a turkeys roast fowl illustration roast fowl 1001 generally speaking it is not necessary so completely to cut up a fowl as we have described in the preceding paragraphs unless indeed a large family party is assembled and there are a number of little mouths to be filled or some other such circumstances prevail a roast fowl is carved in the same manner as a boiled fowl no 1000 viz by cutting along the line from 1 to 2 and then round the leg between it and the wing the markings and detached pieces as shown in the engravings under the heading of boiled fowl supersede the necessity of our lengthily again describing the operation it may be added that the liver being considered a delicacy should be divided and one half served with each wing in the case of a fowl being shifted it will be proper to give each guest a portion unless it be not agreeable to some one of the party roast goose illustration roast goose illustration leg wing and neckbone of goose 1002 it would not be fair to say that this dish bodes a great deal of happiness to an inexperienced carver especially if there is a large party to serve and the slices off the breast should not suffice to satisfy the desires and cravings of many wholesome appetites produced may be by the various sports in vogue at michaelmas and christmas the beginning of the task however is not in any way difficult evenlycut slices not too thick or too thin should be carved from the breast in the direction of the line from 2 to 3 after the first slice has been cut a hole should be made with the knife in the part called the apron passing it round the line as indicated by the figures 1 1 1 here the stuffing is located and some of this should be served on each plate unless it is discovered that it is not agreeable to the taste of some one guest if the carver manages cleverly he will be able to cut a very large number of fine slices off the breast and the more so if he commences close down by the wing and carves upwards towards the ridge of the breastbone as many slices as can be taken from the breast being carved the wings should be cut off and the same process as described in carving boiled fowl is made use of in this instance only more dexterity and greater force will most probably be required the shape of the leg when disengaged from the body of the goose should be like that shown in the accompanying engraving it will be necessary perhaps in taking off the leg to turn the goose on its side and then pressing down the small end of the leg the knife should be passed under it from the top quite down to the joint the leg being now turned back by the fork the knife must cut through the joint loosening the thighbone from its socket the merrythought which in a goose is not so large as might be expected is disengaged in the same way as that of a fowlby passing the knife under it and pressing it backwards towards the neck the neckbones of which we give a cut are freed by the same process as are those of a fowl and the same may be said of all the other parts of this bird the breast of a goose is the part most esteemed all parts however are good and full of juicy flavour pigeon illustration pigeon 1003 a very straightforward plan is adopted in carving a pigeon the knife is carried sharply in the direction of the line as shown from 1 to 2 entirely through the bird cutting it into two precisely equal and similar parts if it is necessary to make three pieces of it a small wing should be cut off with the leg on either side thus serving two guests and by this means there will be sufficient meat left on the breast to send to the third guest rabbits illustration boiled rabbit 1004 in carving a boiled rabbit let the knife be drawn on each side of the backbone the whole length of the rabbit as shown by the dotted line 3 to 4 thus the rabbit will be in three parts now let the back be divided into two equal parts in the direction of the line from 1 to 2 then let the leg be taken off as shown by the line 5 to 6 and the shoulder as shown by the line 7 to 8 this in our opinion is the best plan to carve a rabbit although there are other modes which are preferred by some illustration roast rabbit a roast rabbit is rather differently trussed from one that is meant to be boiled but the carving is nearly similar as will be seen by the cut the back should be divided into as many pieces as it will give and the legs and shoulders can then be disengaged in the same manner as those of the boiled animal roast turkey illustration roast turkey 1005 a noble dish is a turkey roast or boiled a christmas dinner with the middle classes of this empire would scarcely be a christmas dinner without its turkey and we can hardly imagine an object of greater envy than is presented by a respected portly paterfamilias carving at the season devoted to good cheer and genial charity his own fat turkey and carving it well the only art consists as in the carving of a goose in getting from the breast as many fine slices as possible and all must have remarked the very great difference in the large number of people whom a good carver will find slices for and the comparatively few that a bad carver will succeed in serving as we have stated in both the carving of a duck and goose the carver should commence cutting slices close to the wing from 2 to 3 and then proceed upwards towards the ridge of the breastbone this is not the usual plan but in practice will be found the best the breast is the only part which is looked on as fine in a turkey the legs being very seldom cut off and eaten at table they are usually removed to the kitchen where they are taken off as here marked to appear only in a form which seems to have a special attraction at a bachelors suppertablewe mean devilled served in this way they are especially liked and relished a boiled turkey is carved in the same manner as when roasted illustration chapter xxii general observations on game 1006 the common law of england has a maxim that goods in which no person can claim any property belong by his or her prerogative to the king or queen accordingly those animals those ferae naturae which come under the denomination of game are in our laws styled his or her majestys and may therefore as a matter of course be granted by the sovereign to another in consequence of which another may prescribe to possess the same within a certain precinct or lordship from this circumstance arose the right of lords of manors or others to the game within their respective liberties and to protect these species of animals the game laws were originated and still remain in force there are innumerable acts of parliament inflicting penalties on persons who may illegally kill game and some of them are very severe but they cannot be said to answer their end nor can it be expected that they ever will whilst there are so many persons of great wealth who have not otherwise the means of procuring game except by purchase and who will have it these must necessarily encourage poaching which to a very large extent must continue to render all game laws nugatory as to their intended effects upon the rustic population 1007 the object of these laws however is not wholly confined to the restraining of the illegal sportsman even qualified or privileged persons must not kill game at all seasons during the day the hours allowed for sporting are from one hour before sunrise till one hour after sunset whilst the time of killing certain species is also restricted to certain seasons for example the season for bustardshooting is from december 1 to march 1 for grouse or red grouse from august 12 to december 10 heathfowl or blackgame from august 20 to december 20 partridges from september 1 to february 12 pheasants from october 1 to february 1 widgeons wild ducks wild geese wild fowls at any time but in june july august and september hares may be killed at any time of the year under certain restrictions defined by an act of parliament of the 10th of george iii 1008 the exercise or diversion of pursuing fourfooted beasts of game is called hunting which to this day is followed in the field and the forest with gun and greyhound birds on the contrary are not hunted but shot in the air or taken with nets and other devices which is called fowling or they are pursued and taken by birds of prey which is called hawking a species of sport now fallen almost entirely into desuetude in england although in some parts showing signs of being revived 1009 in pursuing fourfooted beasts such as deer boars and hares properly termed hunting mankind were from the earliest ages engaged it was the rudest and the most obvious manner of acquiring human support before the agricultural arts had in any degree advanced it is an employment however requiring both art and contrivance as well as a certain fearlessness of character combined with the power of considerable physical endurance without these success could not be very great but at best the occupation is usually accompanied with rude and turbulent habits and when combined with these it constitutes what is termed the savage state of man as culture advances and as the soil proportionably becomes devoted to the plough or to the sustenance of the tamer or more domesticated animals the range of the huntsman is proportionably limited so that when a country has attained to a high state of cultivation hunting becomes little else than an amusement of the opulent in the case of furbearing animals however it is somewhat different for these continue to supply the wants of civilization with one of its most valuable materials of commerce 1010 the themes which form the minstrelsy of the earliest ages either relate to the spoils of the chase or the dangers of the battlefield even the sacred writings introduce us to nimrod the first mighty hunter before the lord and tell us that ishmael in the solitudes of arabia became a skilful bowman and that david when yet young was not afraid to join in combat with the lion or the bear the greek mythology teems with hunting exploits hercules overthrows the nemaean lion the erymanthean boar and the hydra of lerna diana descends to the earth and pursues the stag whilst aesculapius nestor theseus ulysses and achilles are all followers of the chase aristotle sage as he was advises young men to apply themselves early to it and plato finds in it something divine horace exalts it as a preparative exercise for the path of glory and several of the heroes of homer are its ardent votaries the romans followed the hunting customs of the greeks and the ancient britons were hunters before julius caesar invaded their shores 1011 although the ancient britons followed hunting however they did not confine themselves solely to its pursuit they bred cattle and tilled the ground and to some extent indicated the rudimentary state of a pastoral and agricultural life but in every social change the sports of the field maintained their place after the expulsion of the danes and during the brief restoration of the saxon monarchy these were still followed even edward the confessor who would join in no other secular amusements took the greatest delight says william of malmesbury to follow a pack of swift hounds in pursuit of game and to cheer them with his voice 1012 nor was edward the only english sovereign who delighted in the pleasures of the chase william the norman and his two sons who succeeded him were passionately fond of the sport and greatly circumscribed the liberties of their subjects in reference to the killing of game the privilege of hunting in the royal forests was confined to the king and his favourites and in order that these umbrageous retreats might be made more extensive whole villages were depopulated places of worship levelled with the ground and every means adopted that might give a sufficient amplitude of space in accordance with the royal pleasure for the beasts of the chase king john was likewise especially attached to the sports of the field whilst edward iii was so enamoured of the exercise that even during his absence at the wars in france he took with him sixty couples of staghounds and as many harehounds and every day amused himself either with hunting or hawking great in wisdom as the scotch solomon james i conceited himself to be he was much addicted to the amusements of hunting hawking and shooting yea it is oven asserted that his precious time was divided between hunting the bottle and his standish to the first he gave his fair weather to the second his dull and to the third his cloudy from his days down to the present the sports of the field have continued to hold their high reputation not only for the promotion of health but for helping to form that manliness of character which enters so largely into the composition of the sons of the british soil that it largely helps to do this there can be no doubt the late duke of grafton when hunting was on one occasion thrown into a ditch a young curate engaged in the same chase cried out lie still my lord leapt over him and pursued his sport such an apparent want of feeling might be expected to have been resented by the duke but not so on his being helped up by his attendant he said that man shall have the first good living that falls to my disposal had he stopped to have given me his sympathy i never would have given him anything such was the manly sentiment of the duke who delighted in the exemplification of a spirit similarly ardent as his own in the sport and above the baseness of an assumed sorrow 1013 that hunting has in many instances been carried to an excess is well known and the match given by the prince esterhazy regent of hungary on the signing of the treaty of peace with france is not the least extraordinary upon record on that occasion there were killed 160 deer 100 wild boars 300 hares and 80 foxes this was the achievement of one day enormous however as this slaughter may appear it is greatly inferior to that made by the contemporary king of naples on a hunting expedition that sovereign had a larger extent of ground at his command and a longer period for the exercise of his talents consequently his sport if it can so be called was proportionably greater it was pursued during his journey to vienna in austria bohemia and moravia when he killed 5 bears 1820 boars 1950 deer 1145 does 1625 roebucks 11121 rabbits 13 wolves 17 badgers 16354 hares and 354 foxes in birds during the same expedition he killed 15350 pheasants and 12335 partridges such an amount of destruction can hardly be called sport it resembles more the indiscriminate slaughter of a battlefield where the scientific engines of civilized warfare are brought to bear upon defenceless savages 1014 deer and hares may be esteemed as the only fourfooted animals now hunted in britain for the table and even those are not followed with the same ardour as they were wont to be still there is no country in the world where the sport of hunting on horseback is carried to such an extent as in great britain and where the pleasures of the chase are so well understood and conducted on such purely scientific principles the fox of all the beasts of the field is now considered to afford the best sport for this it is infinitely superior to the stag for the real sportsman can only enjoy that chase when the deer is sought for and found like other game which are pursued with hounds in the case of finding an outlying fallowdeer which is unharboured in this manner great sport is frequently obtained but this is now rarely to be met with in britain in reference to harehunting it is much followed in many parts of this and the sister island but by the true foxhunter it is considered as a sport only fit to be pursued by women and old men although it is less dangerous and exciting than the foxchase however it has great charms for those who do not care for the hard riding which the other requires 1015 the art of taking or killing birds is called fowling and is either practised as an amusement by persons of rank or property or for a livelihood by persons who use nets and other apparatus when practised as an amusement it principally consists of killing them with a light firearm called a fowlingpiece and the sport is secured to those who pursue it by the game laws the other means by which birds are taken consist in imitating their voices or leading them by other artifices into situations where they become entrapped by nets birdlime or otherwise for taking large numbers of birds the pipe or call is the most common means employed and this is done during the months of september and october we will here briefly give a description of the modus operandi pursued in this sport a thin wood is usually the spot chosen and under a tree at a little distance from the others a cabin is erected and there are only such branches left on the tree as are necessary for the placing of the birdlime and which are covered with it around the cabin are placed avenues with twisted perches also covered with birdlime having thus prepared all that is necessary the birdcatcher places himself in the cabin and at sunrise and sunset imitates the cry of a small bird calling the others to its assistance supposing that the cry of the owl is imitated immediately different kinds of birds will flock together at the cry of their common enemy when at every instant they will be seen falling to the ground their wings being of no use to them from their having come in contact with the birdlime the cries of those which are thus situated now attract others and thus are large numbers taken in a short space of time if owls were themselves desired to be taken it is only during the night that this can be done by counterfeiting the squeak of the mouse larks other birds and waterfowl are sometimes taken by nets but to describe fully the manner in which this is done would here occupy too much space 1016 feathered game have from time immemorial given gratification to the palate of man with the exception of birds of prey and some other species moses permitted his people to eat them and the egyptians made offerings to their priests of their most delicate birds the ancient greeks commenced their repasts with little roasted birds and feathered game amongst the romans was served as the second course indeed several of the ancient gourmands of the imperial city were so fond of game that they brought themselves to ruin by eating flamingoes and pheasants some modern nations the french among others says monsieur soyer formerly ate the heron crane crow stork swan cormorant and bittern the first three especially were highly esteemed and laillevant cook of charles vii teaches us how to prepare these meagre tough birds belon says that in spite of its revolting taste when unaccustomed to it the bittern is however among the delicious treats of the french this writer also asserts that a falcon or a vulture either roasted or boiled is excellent eating and that if one of these birds happened to kill itself in flying after game the falconer instantly cooked it lebaut calls the heron a royal viand 1017 the heron was hunted by the hawk and the sport of hawking is usually placed at the head of those amusements that can only be practised in the country this precedency it probably obtained from its being a pastime to generally followed by the nobility not in great britain only but likewise on the continent in former times persons of high rank rarely appeared in public without their dogs and their hawks the latter they carried with them when they journeyed from one country to another and sometimes even took them to battle with them and would not part with them when taken prisoners even to obtain their own liberty such birds were esteemed as the ensigns of nobility and no action was reckoned more dishonourable in a man of rank than that of giving up his hawk we have already alluded to the hunting propensities of our own edward iii and we may also allude to his being equally addicted to hawking according to froissart when this sovereign invaded france he took with him thirty falconers on horseback who had charge of his hawks and every day as his royal fancy inclined him he either hunted or went to the river for the purpose of hawking in the great and powerful the pursuit of game as a sport is allowable but in those who have to earn their bread by the sweat of their brow it is to be condemned in burtons anatomy of melancholy we find a humorous story told by poggius the florentine who reprobates this folly in such persons it is this a physician of milan that cured madmen had a pit of water in his house in which he kept his patients some up to the knees some to the girdle some to the chin pro modo insaniae as they were more or less affected one of them by chance that was well recovered stood in the door and seeing a gallant pass by with a hawk on his fist well mounted with his spaniels after him would needs know to what use all this preparation served he made answer to kill certain fowl the patient demanded again what his fowl might be worth which he killed in a year he replied five or ten crowns and when he urged him further what his dogs horse and hawks stood him in he told him four hundred crowns with that the patient bade him begone as he loved his life and welfare for if our master come and find thee here he will put thee in the pit amongst the madmen up to the chin thus reproving the madness of such men as will spend themselves in those vain sports to the neglect of their business and necessary affairs 1018 as the inevitable result of social progress is at least to limit if not entirely to suppress such sports as we have here been treating of much of the romance of country life has passed away this is more especially the case with falconry which had its origin about the middle of the fourth century although lately some attempts have been rather successfully made to institute a revival of the gentle art of hawking julius firmicus who lived about that time is so far as we can find the first latin author who speaks of falconers and the art of teaching one species of birds to fly after and catch others the occupation of these functionaries has now however all but ceased new and nobler efforts characterize the aims of mankind in the development of their civilization and the sports of the field have to a large extent been superseded by other exercises it may be less healthful and invigorating but certainly more elegant intellectual and humanizing illustration recipes

of some brook or stream where if the old bird is sprung it may be taken as a certainty that its brood is not far off when once found flappers are easily killed as they attain their full growth before their wings are fledged consequently the sport is more like hunting waterrats than shooting birds when the flappers take wing they assume the name of wild ducks and about the month of august repair to the cornfields where they remain until they are disturbed by the harvestpeople they then frequent the rivers pretty early in the evening and give excellent sport to those who have patience to wait for

as large as the turkey being about two feet nine inches in length and weighing from twelve to fifteen pounds the female is considerably less than the male and in the colour of her feathers differs widely from the other this beautiful species is found principally in lofty mountainous regions and is very rare in great britain but in the pine forests of russia sweden and other northern countries it is very common in these it has its habitat feeding on the cones of the trees and the fruits of various kinds of plants especially the berry of the jumper black grouse is also distinguished as blackgame or the blackcock it is not larger than the common hen and weighs only about four pounds the female is about onethird less than the male and also differs considerably from him in point of colour like the former they are found chiefly in high situations and are common in russia siberia and other northern countries they are also found in the northern parts of great britain feeding in winter on the various berries and fruits belonging to mountainous countries and in summer frequently descending to the lower lands to feed upon corn the red grouse gorcock or moorcock weighs about nineteen ounces and the female somewhat less in the wild heathy tracts of the northern counties of england it is plentiful also in wales and the highlands of scotland mr pennant considered it peculiar to britain those found in the mountainous parts of spain france and italy being only varieties of the same bird white grouse white game or ptarmigan is nearly the same size as the red grouse and is found in lofty situations where it supports itself in the severest weather it is to be met with in most of the northern countries of europe and appears even in greenland in the hebrides orkneys and the highlands of scotland it is also found and sometimes though rarely among the fells of northumberland and cumberland in winter they fly in flocks and are so little familiar with the sight of man that they are easily shot and even snared they feed on the wild produce of the hills which sometimes imparts to their flesh a bitter but not unpalatable taste according to buffon it is darkcoloured

separate from the females except in the breeding season its manners and habits are very like those of black grouse except that it seems to be wholly confined to forests of pine on the tender shoots of which it feeds it is by no means uncommon in the woods of norway whence we received it it is also found abundant in russia siberia italy and in some portions of the alps it was in 1760 last seen in scotland in the woods of strathglass recent attempts have been made to reintroduce it into that country but without success principally owing as we should imagine to the want of sufficient food suitable for its sustenance grouseunder this general term are included several species of game birds called black red woodland and white grouse the black is larger than the red see no 1025 and is not so common and therefore held in higher estimation the red however is a bird of exquisite flavour and is a native of the mountainous districts of scotland and the north of england it feeds on the tops of the heath and the berries that grow amongst them its colour is a rich chestnut striped with black the woodland or cock of the wood is the largest among the bird tribes which pass under the denomination of game it is smaller than the turkey and was originally common in our mountains but it is now to be found only in the mountains of scotland though it still abounds in the north of europe germany and in the alps it is esteemed as delicious eating and its plumage is extremely beautiful the white grouse or ptarmigan is not a plentiful bird in britain but it is still found in the islands

migratory in its habits yet from its formation it seems ill adapted for long arial passages its wings being short and placed so forward out of the centre of gravity that it flies in an extremely heavy and embarrassed manner and with its legs hanging down when it alights it can hardly be sprung a second time as it runs very fast and seems to depend for its safety more on the swiftness of its feet than the celerity of its wings it makes its appearance in england about the same time as the quail that is in the months of april and may and frequents the same places its singular cry is first heard when the grass becomes long enough to shelter it and it continues to be heard until the grass is cut the bird however is seldom seen for it constantly skulks among the thickest portions of the herbage and runs so nimbly through it doubling and winding in every direction that it is difficult to get near it it leaves this island before the winter and repairs to other countries in search of its food which principally consists of slugs large numbers of which it destroys it is very common in ireland and whilst migrating to this country is seen in great numbers in the island of anglesea on its first

when she took wing and flew still further off but not out of the field on this the dog returned to me near the place where the young ones lay concealed in the grass which the old bird no sooner perceived than she flew back to us settled just before the dogs nose again and by rolling and tumbling about drew off his attention from her young and thus preserved her brood a second time i have also seen when a kite has been hovering over a covey of young partridges the old birds fly up at the bird of prey screaming and fighting with all their might to preserve their brood partridges should

the warmest and most woody counties of england it is very common in france indeed so common as to be esteemed a nuisance by the farmers although it has been domesticated this is not easily accomplished nor is its flesh so palatable then as it is in the wild state mr ude saysit is not often that pheasants are met with possessing that exquisite taste which is acquired only by long keeping as the damp of this climate prevents their being kept as long as they are in other countries the hens in general are the most delicate the cocks show their age by their spurs they are only fit to be eaten when the blood begins to run from the bill which is commonly six days or a week after they have been killed the flesh is white tender and has a good flavour if you keep it long enough if not it

peas and partridges are best when young perfection in others is only reached when they attain maturity let us say for example melons and nearly all fruits we must except perhaps the medlar with the majority of those animals whose flesh we eat but others again are not good until decomposition is about to set in and here we may mention particularly the snipe and the pheasant if the latter bird be

hebrides and other parts of scotland and in the winter large numbers are sent to the london market which is sometimes so much glutted with them that they are sold very cheap previous to dressing they are kept till they have a game flavour and although their flesh is a favourite with many it is not universally relished the green is preferred to the grey but both are inferior to the woodcock their

they appear in such multitudes that so many as sixty or seventy are frequently taken at once in a net as they are as tame as chickens this is done without difficulty buffon says that the ptarmigan avoids the solar heat and prefers the frosts of the summits of the mountains for as the snow melts on the sides of the mountains it ascends till it gains the top where it makes a hole and burrows in the snow in winter it flies in flocks and feeds on the wild vegetation of the hills which imparts to its flesh a bitter but not altogether an unpalatable taste it is darkcoloured and has something of

or five miles as many as a hundred thousand have been taken in a day from these circumstances says a writer on natural history it appears highly probable that the quails which supplied the israelites with food during their journey through the wilderness were sent thither on their passage to the north by a wind from the southwest sweeping over egypt and ethiopia towards the shores of the red sea in

scarcer than it formerly was but in the highlands of scotland herds of four or five hundred may still be seen ranging over the vast mountains of the north and some of the stags of a great size in former times the great feudal chieftains used to hunt with all the pomp of eastern sovereigns assembling some thousands of their clans who drove the deer into the toils or to such stations as were occupied by their chiefs as this sport however was occasionally used as a means for collecting their vassals together for the purpose of concocting rebellion an act was passed prohibitory of such assemblages in the waverley of sir walter scott a deerhunting scene of this kind is admirably described venisonthis is the name given to the flesh of some kinds of deer and is esteemed as very

have been originally introduced into this country from france about a century back he was to be found wild in some of the rough and mountainous parts of wales as well as in the forests of exmoor in devonshire and the woods on the banks of the tamar in the middle ages the deer formed food for the not over abstemious monks as represented by friar tucks larder in the admirable fiction of ivanhoe

animals can make a nearer approach to each other than the stag and it and yet no two animals keep more distinct or avoid each other with a more inveterate animosity they never herd or intermix together and consequently never give rise to an intermediate race it is even rare unless they have been transported thither to find fellowdeer in a country where stags are numerous he is very easily tamed and feeds upon many things which the stag refuses he also browzes closer than the stag and preserves his venison better the doe produces one fawn sometimes two but rarely three in short they resemble the stag in all his natural habits and the greatest difference between them is the duration of their lives the stag it is said lives to the age of thirtyfive or forty years and the fallowdeer

or hart is the male of the red deer and the hind is the female he is much larger than the fallowdeer and his age is indicated by his horns which are round instead of being palmated like those of the fallowdeer during the first year he has no horns but a horny excrescence which is short and rough and covered with a thin hairy skin the next year the horns are single and straight and in the third they have two antlers three the fourth four the fifth and five the sixth year although this number is not always certain for sometimes they are more and often less after the sixth year the antlers do not always increase and although in number they may amount to six or seven on each side yet the animals age is then estimated rather by the size of the antlers and the thickness of the branch which sustains them than by their variety large as these horns seem however they are shed every year and their place supplied by new ones this usually takes place in the spring when the old horns have fallen off the new ones do not make their appearance immediately but the bones of the skull ore seen covered with a transparent periosteum or skin which enwraps the bones of all animals after a short time however the skin begins to swell and to form a sort of tumour from this byandby rising from the head shoot forth the antlers from each side and in a short time in proportion as the animal is in condition the entire horns are completed the solidity of the extremities however is not perfect until the horns have arrived at their full growth old stags usually shed their horns first which generally happens towards the latter end of february or the beginning of march such as are between five and six years old shed them about the middle or latter end of march those still younger in the month of april and the youngest of all not till the middle or latter end of may these rules though generally true are subject to variations for a severe winter will retard the shedding of the hornsthe hind has no horns and is less fitted for being hunted than the male she takes the greatest care of her young and secretes them in the most obscure thickets lest they become a prey to their numerous enemies all the rapacious family of the cat kind with the wolf the dog the eagle and the falcon are continually endeavouring to find her retreat whilst the stag himself is the foe of his own offspring when she has young therefore it would seem that the courage of the male is transferred to the female for she defends them with the most resolute bravery if pursued by the hunter she will fly before the hounds for half the day and then return to her young whose life she has thus preserved at the hazard of her own illustration eland bull eland cow the new venisonthe deer population of our splendid english parks was until a few years since limited to two species the fallow and the red but as the fallowdeer itself was an acclimated animal of comparatively recent introduction it came to be a question why might not the proprietor of any deerpark in england have the luxury of at least half a dozen species of deer and antelopes to adorn the hills dales ferny brakes and rich pastures of his domain the temperate regions of the whole world might be made to yield specimens of the noble ruminant valuable either for their individual beauty or for their availability to gastronomic purposes during the last four or live years a few spirited english noblemen have made the experiment of breeding foreign deer in their parks and have obtained such a decided success that it may be hoped their example will induce others to follow in a course which will eventually give to englands rural scenery a new element of beauty and to english tables a fresh viand of the choicest character a practical solution of this interesting question was made by viscount hill at hawkestone park salop in january 1809 on that occasion a magnificent eland an acclimated scion of the species whose native home is the south african wilderness was killed for the table the noble beast was thus describedhe weighed 1176 lbs as he dropped huge as a shorthorn but with bone not half the size active as a deer stately in all his paces perfect in form bright in colour with a vast dewlap and strong sculptured horn this eland in his lifetime strode majestic on the hillside where he dwelt with his mates and their progeny all englishborn like himself three pairs of the same species of deer were left to roam at large on the picturesque elopes throughout the day and to return to their home at pleasure here during winter they are assisted with roots and hay but in summer they have nothing but the pasture of the park so that in point of expense they cost no more than cattle of the best description travellers and

seasonable from november to february illustration the woodcock the woodcockthis bird being migratory in its habits has consequently no settled habitation it cannot be considered as the property of any one and is therefore not game by law it breeds in high northern latitudes and the time of its appearance and disappearance in sweden coincides exactly with that of its arrival in and return from great britain on the coast of suffolk its vernal and autumnal visits have been accurately observed in the first week of october it makes its appearance in small numbers but in november and december it appears in larger numbers and always after sunset and most gregariously in the same manner as woodcocks take their leave of us they quit france germany and italy making the northern and colder climates their summer rendezvous they visit burgundy in the latter part of october but continue there only a few weeks the country being hard and unable to supply them with such sustenance as they require in the winter they are found as far south as smyrna and aleppo and during the same season in barbary where the africans name them the ass of the partridge it has been asserted that they have been seen as far south as egypt which is the most remote region to which they can be traced on that side of the eastern world on the other side they are common in japan those which resort to the countries of the levant are supposed to come from the mountains of armenia or the deserts of tartary or siberia the flesh of the woodcock is held in high estimation hence the bird is eagerly sought after by the sportsman game carving blackcock illustration blackcock 1054 skilful carving of game undoubtedly adds to the pleasure of the guests at a dinnertable for game seems preeminently to be composed of such delicate limbs and tender flesh that an inapt practitioner appears to more disadvantage when mauling these pretty and favourite dishes than larger and more robust pices de rsistance as described at recipe no 1019 this bird is variously served with or without the head on and although we do not personally object to the appearance of the head as shown in the woodcut yet it seems to be more in vogue to serve it without the carving is not difficult but should be elegantly and deftly done slices from the breast cut in the direction of the dotted line from 2 to 1 should be taken off the merrythought displaced and the leg and wing removed by running the knife along from 3 to 4 and following the directions given under the head of boiled fowl no 1000 reserving the thigh which is considered a great delicacy for the most honoured guests some of whom may also esteem the brains of this bird wild duck illustration wild duck 1055 as game is almost universally served as a dainty and not as a dish to stand the assaults of an altogether fresh appetite these dishes are not usually cut up entirely but only those parts are served of each which are considered the bestflavoured and the primest of wildfowl the breast alone is considered by epicures worth eating and slices are cut from this in the direction indicated by the lines from 1 to 2 if necessary the leg and wing can be taken off by passing the knife from 3 to 4 and by generally following the directions described for carving boiled fowl no 1000 roast hare illustration roast hare 1056 the grand carver of olden times a functionary of no ordinary dignity was pleased when he had a hare to manipulate for his skill and grace had an opportunity of display diners la russe may possibly erewhile save modern gentlemen the necessity of learning the art which was in auld lang syne one of the necessary accomplishments of the youthful squire but until sidetables become universal or till we see the office of grand carver once more instituted it will be well for all to learn how to assist at the carving of this dish which if not the most elegant in appearance is a very general favourite the hare having its head to the left as shown in the woodcut should be first served by cutting slices from each side of the backbone in the direction of the lines from 3 to 4 after these prime parts are disposed of the leg should next be disengaged by cutting round the line indicated by the figures 5 to 6 the shoulders will then be taken off by passing the knife round from 7 to 8 the back of the hare should now be divided by cutting quite through its spine as shown by the line 1 to 2 taking care to feel with the point of the knife for a joint where the back may be readily penetrated it is the usual plan not to serve any bone in helping hare and thus the flesh should be sliced from the legs and placed alone on the plate in large establishments and where mencooks are kept it is often the case that the backbone of the hare especially in old animals is taken out and then the process of carving is of course considerably facilitated a great point to be remembered in connection with carving hare is that plenty of gravy should accompany each helping otherwise this dish which is naturally dry will lose half its flavour and so become a failure stuffing is also served with it and the ears which should be nicely crisp and the brains of the hare are esteemed as delicacies by many connoisseurs partridges illustration roast partridges 1057 there are several ways of carving this most familiar game bird the more usual and summary mode is to carry the knife sharply along the top of the breastbone of the bird and cut it quite through thus dividing it into two precisely equal and similar parts in the same manner as carving a pigeon no 1003 another plan is to cut it into three pieces viz by severing a small wing and leg on either side from the body by following the line 1 to 2 in the upper woodcut thus making 2 helpings when the breast will remain for a third plate the most elegant manner is that of thrusting back the body from the legs and then cutting through the breast in the direction shown by the line 1 to 2 this plan will give 4 or more small helpings a little breadsauce should be served to each guest grouse illustration 1058 grouse may be carved in the way first described in carving partridge the backbone of the grouse is highly esteemed by many and this part of many game birds is considered the finest flavoured pheasant illustration roast pheasant 1059 fixing the fork in the breast let the carver cut slices from it in the direction of the lines from 2 to 1 these are the prime pieces if there be more guests to satisfy than these slices will serve then let the legs and wings be disengaged in the same manner as described in carving boiled fowl no 1000 the point where the wing joins the neckbone being carefully found the merrythought will come off in the same way as that of a fowl the most valued parts are the same as those which are most considered in a fowl snipe illustration snipe 1060 one of these small but delicious birds may be given whole to a gentleman but in helping a lady it will be better to cut them quite through the centre from 1 to 2 completely dividing them into equal and like portions and put only one half on the plate haunch of venison illustration haunch of venison 1061 here is a grand dish for a knight of the carvingknife to exercise his skill upon and what will be pleasant for many to know there is but little difficulty in the performance an incision being made completely down to the bone in the direction of the line 1 to 2 the gravy will then be able easily to flow when slices not too thick should be cut along the haunch as indicated by the line 4 to 3 that end of the joint marked 3 having been turned towards the carver so that he may have a more complete command over the joint although some epicures affect to believe that some parts of the haunch are superior to others yet we doubt if there is any difference between the slices cut above and below the line it should be borne in mind to serve each guest with a portion of fat and the most expeditious carver will be the best carver as like mutton venison soon begins to chill when it loses much of its charm woodcock illustration woodcock 1062 this bird like a partridge may be carved by cutting it exactly into two like portions or made into three helpings as described in carving partridge no 1057 the backbone is considered the titbit of a woodcock and by many the thigh is also thought a great delicacy this bird is served in the manner advised by brillat savarin in connection with the pheasant viz on toast which has received its drippings whilst roasting and a piece of this toast should invariably accompany each plate landrail 1063 landrail being trussed like snipe with the exception of its being drawn may be carved in the same mannersee no 1060 ptarmigan 1064 ptarmigan

illustration illustration chapter xxiv general observations on vegetables strange there should be found who selfimprisond in their proud saloons renounce the odours of the open field for the unscented fictions of the loom who satisfied with only pencilled scenes prefer to the performance of a god th inferior wonders of an artists hand lovely indeed the mimic works of art but natures works far loveliercowper 1069 the animal and vegetable kingdoms says hogg in his natural history of the vegetable kingdom may be aptly compared to the primary colours of the prismatic spectrum which are so gradually and intimately blended that we fail to discover where the one terminates and where the other begins if we had to deal with yellow and blue only the eye would easily distinguish the one from the other but when the two are blended and form green we cannot tell where the blue ends and the yellow begins and so it is in the animal and vegetable kingdoms if our powers of observation were limited to the highest orders of animals and plants if there were only mammals birds reptiles fishes and insects in the one and trees shrubs and herbs in the other we should then be able with facility to define the bounds of the two kingdoms but as we descend the scale of each and arrive at the lowest forms of animals and plants we there meet with bodies of the simplest structure sometimes a mere cell whose organization modes of development and reproduction are so anomalous and partake so much of the character of both that we cannot distinguish whether they are plants or whether they are animals 1070 whilst it is difficult to determine where the animal begins and the vegetable ends it is as difficult to account for many of the singularities by which numbers of plants are characterized this however can hardly be regarded as a matter of surprise when we recollect that so far as it is at present known the vegetable kingdom is composed of upwards of 92000 species of plants of this amazing number the lichens and the mosses are of the simplest and hardiest kinds these indeed may be considered as the very creators of the soil they thrive in the coldest and most sterile regions many of them commencing the operations of nature in the growth of vegetables on the barest rocks and receiving no other nourishment than such as may be supplied to them by the simple elements of air and rain when they have exhausted their period in such situations as have been assigned them they pass into a state of decay and become changed into a very fine mould which in the active spontaneity of nature immediately begins to produce other species which in their turn become food for various mosses and also rot this process of growth and decay being from time to time continued byandby forms a soil sufficient for the maintenance of larger plants which also die and decay and so increase the soil until it becomes deep enough to sustain an oak or even the weight of a tropical forest to create soil amongst rocks however must not be considered as the only end of the lichen different kinds of it minister to the elegant arts in the form of beautiful dyes thus the lichen rocella is used to communicate to silk and wool various shades of purple and crimson which greatly enhance the value of these materials this species is chiefly imported from the canary islands and when scarce as an article of commerce has brought as much as 1000 per ton 1071 in the vicinity of lichens the musci or mosses are generally to be found indeed wherever vegetation can be sustained there they are affording protection to the roots and seeds of more delicate vegetables and by their spongy texture retaining a moisture which preserves other plants from the withering drought of summer but even in winter we find them enlivening by their verdure the cold bosom of nature we see them abounding in our pastures and our woods attaching themselves to the living and still more abundantly to the dead trunks and branches of trees in marshy places they also abound and become the medium of their conversion into fruitful fields this is exemplified by the manner in which peatmosses are formed on the surface of these we find them in a state of great life and vigour immediately below we discover them more or less in a state of decomposition and still deeper we find their stems and branches consolidated into a light brown peat thus are extensive tracts formed ultimately to be brought into a state of cultivation and rendered subservient to the wants of man 1072 when nature has found a soil her next care is to perfect the growth of her seeds and then to disperse them whilst the seed remains confined in its capsule it cannot answer its purpose hence when it is sufficiently ripe the pericardium opens and lets it out what must strike every observer with surprise is how nuts and shells which we can hardly crack with our teeth or even with a hammer will divide of themselves and make way for the little tender sprout which proceeds from the kernel there are instances it is said such as in the touchmenot impatiens and the cuckooflower cardamine in which the seedvessels by an elastic jerk at the moment of their explosion cast the seeds to a distance we are all aware however that many seedsthose of the most composite flowers as of the thistle and dandelionare endowed with what have not been inappropriately called wings these consist of a beautiful silklooking down by which they are enabled to float in the air and to be transported sometimes to considerable distances from the parent plant that produced them the swelling of this downy tuft within the seedvessel is the means by which the seed is enabled to overcome the resistance of its coats and to force for itself a passage by which it escapes from its little prisonhouse illustration beetons book of household management edited by mrs isabella beeton illustration the free fair homes of england 1073 birds as well as quadrupeds are likewise the means of dispersing the seeds of plants and placing them in situations where they ultimately grow amongst the latter is the squirrel which is an extensive planter of oaks nay it may be regarded as having in some measure been one of the creators of the british navy we have read of a gentleman who was walking one day in some woods belonging to the duke of beaufort near troy house in monmouthshire when his attention was arrested by a squirrel sitting very composedly upon the ground he stopped to observe its motions when in a short time the little animal suddenly quitted its position and darted to the top of the tree beneath which it had been sitting in an instant it returned with an acorn in its mouth and with its paws began to burrow in the earth after digging a small hole it therein deposited an acorn which it hastily covered and then darted up the tree again in a moment it was down with another which it buried in the same manner and so continued its labour gathering and burying as long as the gentleman had patience to watch it this industry in the squirrel is an instinct which directs it to lay up a store of provision for the winter and as it is probable that its memory is not sufficiently retentive to enable it to recollect all the spots in which it deposits its acorns it no doubt makes some slips in the course of the season and loses some of them these few spring up and are in time destined to supply the place of the parent tree thus may the sons of britain in some degree consider themselves to be indebted to the industry and defective memory of this little animal for the production of some of those wooden walls which have for centuries been the national pride and which have so long braved the battle and the breeze on the broad bosom of the great deep in every quarter of the civilized globe as with the squirrel so with jays and pies which plant among the grass and moss horsebeans and probably forget where they have secreted them mr white the naturalist says that both horsebeans and peas sprang up in his fieldwalks in the autumn and he attributes the sowing of them to birds bees he also observes are much the best setters of cucumbers if they do not happen to take kindly to the frames the best way is to tempt them by a little honey put on the male and female bloom when they are once induced to haunt the frames they set all the fruit and will hover with impatience round the lights in a morning till the glasses are opened 1074 some of the acorns planted by the squirrel of monmouthshire may be now in a fair way to become at the end of some centuries venerable trees for not the least remarkable quality of oaks is the strong principle of life with which they are endued in major rookes sketch of the forest of sherwood we find it stated that on some timber cut down in berkland and bilhaugh letters were found stamped in the bodies of the trees denoting the kings reign in which they were marked the bark appears to have been cut off and then the letters to have been cut in and the next years wood to have grown over them without adhering to where the bark had been cut out the ciphers were found to be of james i william and mary and one of king john one of the ciphers of james was about one foot within the tree and one foot from the centre it was cut down in 1786 the tree must have been two feet in diameter or two yards in circumference when the mark was cut a tree of this size is generally estimated at 120 years growth which number being subtracted from the middle year of the reign of james would carry the year back to 1492 which would be about the period of its being planted the tree with the cipher of william and mary displayed its mark about nine inches within the tree and three feet three inches from the centre this tree was felled in 1786 the cipher of john was eighteen inches within the tree and rather more than a foot from the centre the middle year of the reign of that monarch was 1207 by subtracting from this 120 the number of years requisite for a trees growth to arrive at the diameter of two feet the date of its being planted would seem to have been 1085 or about twenty years after the conquest illustration cellular development 1075 considering the great endurance of these trees we are necessarily led to inquire into the means by which they are enabled to arrive at such strength and maturity and whether it may be considered as a humiliation we will not determine but with all the ingenious mechanical contrivances of man we are still unable to define the limits of the animal and vegetable kingdoms plants have been described by naturalists who would determine the limits of the two kingdoms as organized living bodies without volition or locomotion destitute of a mouth or intestinal cavity which when detached from their place of growth die and in decay ferment but do not putrefy and which on being subjected to analysis furnish an excess of carbon and no nitrogen the powers of chemistry and of the microscope however instead of confirming these views tend more and more to show that a still closer affinity exists between plants and animals for it is now ascertained that nitrogen which was believed to be present only in animals enters largely into the composition of plants also when the microscope is brought to aid our powers of observation we find that there are organized bodies belonging to the vegetable kingdom which possess very evident powers of locomotion and which change about in so very remarkable a manner that no other cause than that of volition can be assigned to it thus it would seem that in this particular at least some vegetables bear a very close resemblance to animal life and when we consider the manner in which they are supplied with nourishment and perform the functions of their existence the resemblance would seem still closer if for example we take a thin transverse slice of the stem of any plant or a slice cut across its stem and immerse it in a little pure water and place it under a microscope we will find that it consists principally of cells more or less regular and resembling those of a honeycomb or a network of cobweb the size of these varies in different plants as it does in different parts of the same plant and they are sometimes so minute as to require a million to cover a square inch of surface this singular structure besides containing water and air is the repository or storehouse of various secretions through it the sap when produced is diffused sideways through the plant and by it numerous changes are effected in the juices which fill its cells the forms of the cells are various they are also subject to various transformations sometimes a number of cylindrical cells are laid end to end and by the absorption of the transverse partitions form a continuous tube as in the sapvessels of plants or in muscular and nervous fibre and when cells are thus woven together they are called cellular tissue which in the human body forms a fine netlike membrane enveloping or connecting most of its structures in pulpy fruits the cells may be easily separated one from the other and within the cells are smaller cells commonly known as pulp among the cellcontents of some plants are beautiful crystals called raphides the term is derived from greek rhaphis a needle on account of the resemblance of the crystal to a needle they are composed of the phosphate and oxalate of lime but there is great difference of opinion as to their use in the economy of the plant and one of the french philosophers endeavoured to prove that crystals are the possible transition of the inorganic to organic matter the differences however between the highest form of crystal and the lowest form of organic life known viz a simple reproductive cell are so manifold and striking that the attempt to make crystals the bridge over which inorganic matter passes into organic is almost totally regarded as futile in a layer of an onion a fig a section of garden rhubarb in some species of aloe in the bark of many trees and in portions of the cuticle of the medicinal squill bundles of these needleshaped crystals are to be found some of them are as large as 140th of an inch others are as small as the 11000th they are found in all parts of the plantin the stem bark leaves stipules petals fruit roots and even in the pollen with some few exceptions and they are always situated in the interior of cells some plants as many of the cactus tribe are made up almost entirely of these needlecrystals in some instances every cell of the cuticle contains a stellate mass of crystals in others the whole interior is full of them rendering the plant so exceedingly brittle that the least touch will occasion a fracture so much so that some specimens of cactus senilis said to be a thousand years old which were sent a few years since to kew from south america were obliged to be packed in cotton with all the care of the most delicate jewellery to preserve them during transport illustration siliceous cuticle from underside of leaf of deutzia scabra illustration siliceous cuticle of grass 1076 besides the cellular tissue there is what is called a vascular system which consists of another set of small vessels if for example we early in the spring cut a branch transversely we will perceive the sap oozing out from numerous points over the whole of the divided surface except on that part occupied by the pith and the bark and if a twig on which the leaves are already unfolded be cut from the tree and placed with its cut end in a watery solution of brazilwood the colouring matter will be found to ascend into the leaves and to the top of the twig in both these cases a close examination with a powerful microscope will discover the sap perspiring from the divided portion of the stem and the colouring matter rising through real tubes to the top of the twig these are the sap or conducting vessels of the plant if however we examine a transverse section of the vine or of any other tree at a later period of the season we find that the wood is apparently dry whilst the bark particularly that part next the wood is swelled with fluid this is contained in vessels of a different kind from those in which the sap rises they are found in the bark only in trees and may be called returning vessels from their carrying the sap downwards after its preparation in the leaf it is believed that the passage of the sap in plants is conducted in a manner precisely similar to that of the blood in man from the regular contraction and expansion of the vessels but on account of their extreme minuteness it is almost an impossibility to be certain upon this point numerous observations made with the microscope show that their diameter seldom exceeds a 290th part of a line or a 3000th part of an inch leuwenhoeck reckoned 20000 vessels in a morsel of oak about one nineteenth of an inch square 1077 in the vascular system of a plant we at once see the great analogy which it bears to the veins and arteries in the human system but neither it nor the cellular tissue combined is all that is required to perfect the production of a vegetable there is besides a tracheal system which is composed of very minute elastic spiral tubes designed for the purpose of conveying air both to and from the plant there are also fibres which consist of collections of these cells and vessels closely united together these form the root and the stem if we attempt to cut them transversely we meet with difficulty because we have to force our way across the tubes and break them but if we slit the wood lengthwise the vessels are separated without breaking the layers of wood which appear in the stem or branch of a tree cut transversely consist of different zones of fibres each the produce of one years growth and separated by a coat of cellular tissue without which they could not be well distinguished besides all these there is the cuticle which extends over every part of the plant and covers the bark with three distinct coats the liber or inner bark is said to be formed of hollow tubes which convey the sap downwards to increase the solid diameter of the tree 1078 the root and the stem now demand a slight notice the former is designed not only to support the plant by fixing it in the soil but also to fulfil the functions of a channel for the conveyance of nourishment it is therefore furnished with pores or spongioles as they are called from their resemblance to a sponge to suck up whatever comes within its reach it is found in a variety of forms and hence its adaptation to a great diversity of soils and circumstances we have heard of a willowtree being dug up and its head planted where its roots were and these suffered to spread out in the air like naked branches in course of time the roots became branches and the branches roots or rather roots rose from the branches beneath the ground and branches shot from the roots above some roots last one year others two and others like the shrubs and trees which they produce have an indefinite period of existence but they all consist of a collection of fibres composed of vascular and cellular tissue without tracheae or breathingvessels the stem is the grand distributor of the nourishment taken up by the roots to the several parts of the plant the seat of its vitality is said to be in the point or spot called the neck which separates the stem from the root if the root of a young plant be cut off it will shoot out afresh if even the stem be taken away it will be renewed but if this part be injured the plant will assuredly die 1079 in accordance with the plan of this work special notices of culinary vegetables will accompany the various recipes in which they are spoken of but here we cannot resist the opportunity of declaring it as our conviction that he or she who introduces a useful or an ornamental plant into our island ought justly to be considered to a large extent a benefactor to the country no one can calculate the benefits which may spring from this very vegetable after its qualities have become thoroughly known if viewed in no other light it is pleasing to consider it as bestowing upon us a share of the blessings of other climates and enabling us to participate in the

considerable time the best way is to place them in thin layers on a platform suspended in an icecellar there the temperature being always below that of active vegetation they will not sprout while not being above one or two degrees below the freezingpoint the tubers will not be frostbitten another mode is to scoop out the eyes with a very small scoop and keep the roots buried in earth a third mode

sorts of vegetables without inconvenience save of course in excess the digestive functions possess great energy during the period of youth the body to develop itself needs nourishment physical exercise gives an appetite which it is necessary to satisfy and vegetables cannot resist the vigorous action of the gastric organs as old proverb says at twenty one can digest iron but for aged persons the sedentary or the delicate it is quite otherwise then the gastric power has considerably diminished the digestive organs have lost their energy the process of digestion is consequently slower and the least excess at table is followed by derangement of the stomach for several days those who generally digest vegetables with difficulty should eat them reduced to a pulp or pure that is to say with their skins and tough fibres removed subjected to this process vegetables which when entire would create flatulence and wind are then comparatively harmless experience has established the rule that nourishment is not complete without the alliance of meat with vegetables we would also add that the regime most favourable to health is found in variety variety pleases the senses monotony

indian corn from america in hermeticallysealed cases and the publisher of this work remembers with considerable satisfaction his introduction to a dish of this vegetable when in america he found it to combine the excellences of the young green pea and the finest asparagus but he felt at first slightly awkward in holding the large ear with one hand whilst the other had to be employed in cutting off with a knife the delicate green grains illustration illustration chapter xxvi general observations on puddings and pastry 1175 puddings and pastry familiar as they may be and unimportant as they may be held in the estimation of some are yet intimately connected with the development of agricultural resources in reference to the cereal grasses when they began to be made is uncertain but we may safely presume that a simple form of pudding was amongst the first dishes made after discovering a mode of grinding wheat into flour traditional history enables us to trace man back to the time of the deluge after that event he seems to have recovered himself in the central parts of asia and to have first risen to eminence in the arts of civilization on the banks of the nile from this region greece carthage and some other parts along the shores of the mediterranean sea were colonized in process of time greece gave to the romans the arts which she had thus received from egypt and these subsequently diffused them over europe how these were carried to or developed in india and china is not so well ascertained and in america their ancient existence rests only on very indistinct traditions as to who was the real discoverer of the use of corn we have no authentic knowledge the traditions of different countries ascribe it to various fabulous personages whose names it is here unnecessary to introduce in egypt however corn must have grown abundantly for abraham and after him jacob had recourse to that country for supplies during times of famine 1176 the habits of a people to a great extent are formed by the climate in which they live and by the native or cultivated productions in which their country abounds thus we find that the agricultural produce of the ancient egyptians is pretty much the same as that of the present day and the habits of the people are not materially altered in greece the products cultivated in antiquity were the same kinds of grains and legumes as are cultivated at present with the vine the fig the olive the apple and other fruits so with the romans and so with other nations as to the different modes of artificially preparing those to please the taste it is only necessary to say that they arise from the universal desire of novelty characteristic of man in the development of his social conditions thus has arisen the whole science of cookery and thus arose the art of making puddings the porridge of the scotch is nothing more than a species of hasty pudding composed of oatmeal salt and water and the red pottage for which esau sold his birthright must have been something similar the barleygruel of the lacedaemonians of the athenian gladiators and common people was the same with the exception of the slight seasoning it had beyond the simplicity of scottish fare here is the ancient recipe for the athenian national dishdry near the fire in the oven twenty pounds of barleyflour then parch it add three pounds of linseedmeal half a pound of corianderseed two ounces of salt and the quantity of water necessary to this sometimes a little millet was added in order to give the paste greater cohesion and delicacy 1177 oatmeal amongst the greeks and romans was highly esteemed as was also rice which they considered as beneficial to the chest they also held in high repute the irion or indian wheat of the moderns the flour of this cereal was made into a kind of hasty pudding and parched or roasted as eaten with a little salt the spelt or red wheat was likewise esteemed and its flour formed the basis of the carthaginian pudding for which we here give the scientific recipeput a pound of redwheat flour into water and when it has steeped some time transfer it to a wooden bowl add three pounds of cream cheese half a pound of honey and one egg beat the whole together and cook it on a slow fire in a stewpan should this be considered unpalatable another form has been recommended sift the flour and with some water put it into a wooden vessel and for ten days renew the water twice each day at the end of that period press out the water and place the paste in another vessel it is now to be reduced to the consistence of thick lees and passed through a piece of new linen repeat this last operation then dry the mass in the sun and boil it in milk season according to taste these are specimens of the puddings of antiquity and this last recipe was held in especial favour by the romans 1178 however great may have been the qualifications of the ancients however in the art of puddingmaking we apprehend that such preparations as gave gratification to their palates would have generally found little favour amongst the insulated inhabitants of great britain here from the simple suet dumpling up to the most complicated christmas production the grand feature of substantiality is primarily attended to variety in the ingredients we think is held only of secondary consideration with the great body of the people provided that the whole is agreeable and of sufficient abundance 1179 although from puddings to pastry is but a step it requires a higher degree of art to make the one than to make the other indeed pastry is one of the most important branches of the culinary science it unceasingly occupies itself with ministering pleasure to the sight as well as to the taste with erecting graceful monuments miniature fortresses and all kinds of architectural imitations composed of the sweetest and most agreeable products of all climates and countries at a very early period the orientals were acquainted with the art of manipulating in pastry but they by no means attained to the taste variety and splendour of design by which it is characterized amongst the moderns at first it generally consisted of certain mixtures of flour oil and honey to which it was confined for centuries even among the southern nations of the european continent at the commencement of the middle ages a change began to take place in the art of mixing it eggs butter and salt came into repute in the making of paste which was forthwith used as an inclosure for meat seasoned with spices this advance attained the next step was to inclose cream fruit and marmalades and the next to build pyramids and castles when the summit of the art of the pastrycook may be supposed to have been achieved directions in connection with the making of puddings and pastry 1180 a few general remarks respecting the various ingredients of which puddings and pastry are composed may be acceptable as preliminary to the recipes in this department of household management 1181 flour should be of the best quality and perfectly dry and sifted before being used if in the least damp the paste made from it will certainly be heavy 1182 butter unless fresh is used should be washed from the salt and well squeezed and wrung in a cloth to get out all the water and buttermilk which if left in assists to make the paste heavy 1183 lard should be perfectly sweet which may be ascertained by cutting the bladder through and if the knife smells sweet the lard is good 1184 suet should be finely chopped perfectly free from skin and quite sweet during the process of chopping it should be lightly dredged with flour which prevents the pieces from sticking together beef suet is considered the best but veal suet or the outside fat of a loin or neck of mutton makes good crusts as also the skimmings in which a joint of mutton has been boiled but without vegetables 1185 clarified beef dripping directions for which will be found in recipes nos 621 and 622 answers very well for kitchen pies puddings cakes or for family use a very good short crust may be made by mixing with it a small quantity of moist sugar but care must be taken to use the dripping sparingly or a very disagreeable flavour will be imparted to the paste 1186 strict cleanliness must be observed in pastrymaking all the utensils used should be perfectly free from dust and dirt and the things required for pastry kept entirely for that purpose illustration pasteboard and rollingpin 1187 in mixing paste add the water very gradually work the whole together with the knifeblade and knead it until perfectly smooth those who are inexperienced in pastrymaking should work the butter in by breaking it in small pieces and covering the paste rolled out it should then be dredged with flour and the ends folded over and rolled out very thin again this process must be repeated until all the butter is used illustration pastepincers and jagger for ornamenting the edges of piecrusts 1188 the art of making paste requires much practice dexterity and skill it should be touched as lightly as possible made with cool hands and in a cool place a marble slab is better than a board for the purpose and the coolest part of the house should be selected for the process during warm weather 1189 to insure rich paste being light great expedition must be used in the making and baking for if it stand long before it is put in the oven it becomes flat and heavy illustration pastecutter and cornercutter illustration ornamentalpaste cutter 1190 puffpaste requires a brisk oven but not too hot or it would blacken the crust on the other hand if the oven be too slack the paste will be soddened and will not rise nor will it have any colour

mixture 1193 when the freshness of eggs is doubtful break each one separately in a cup before mixing them altogether should there be a bad one amongst them it can be thrown away whereas if mixed with the good ones the entire quantity would be spoiled the yolks and whites beaten separately make the articles they are put into much lighter 1194 raisins and dried fruits for puddings should be carefully picked and in many cases stoned currants should be well washed pressed in a cloth and placed on a dish before the fire to get thoroughly dry they should then be picked carefully over and every piece of grit or stone removed from amongst them to plump them some cooks pour boiling water over them and then dry them before the fire 1195 batter pudding should be smoothly mixed and free from lumps to insure this first mix the flour with a very small proportion of milk and add the remainder by degrees should the pudding be very lumpy it may be strained through a hair sieve 1196 all boiled puddings should be put on in boiling water which must not be allowed to stop simmering and the pudding must always be covered with the water if requisite the saucepan should be kept filled up illustration boiledpudding mould 1197 to prevent a pudding boiled in a cloth from sticking to the bottom of the saucepan place a small plate or saucer underneath it and set the pan on a trivet over the fire if a mould is used this precaution is not necessary but care must be taken to keep the pudding well covered with water 1198 for dishing a boiled pudding as soon as it comes out of the pot dip it into a basin of cold water and the cloth will then not adhere to it great expedition is necessary in sending puddings to table as by standing they quickly become heavy batter puddings particularly illustration boiledpudding mould 1199 for baked or boiled puddings the moulds cups or basins should be always buttered before the mixture is put in them and they should be put into the saucepan directly they are filled 1200 scrupulous attention should be paid to the cleanliness of puddingcloths as from neglect in this particular the outsides of boiled puddings frequently taste very disagreeably as soon as possible after it is taken off the pudding it should be soaked in water and then well washed without soap unless it be very greasy it should be dried out of doors then folded up and kept in a dry place when wanted for use dip it in boiling water and dredge it slightly with flour illustration puddingbasin 1201 the dry ingredients for puddings are better for being mixed some time before they are wanted the liquid portion should only be added just before the pudding is put into the saucepan 1202 a pinch of salt is an improvement to the generality of puddings but this ingredient should be added very sparingly as the flavour should not be detected 1203 when baked puddings are sufficiently solid turn them out of the dish they were baked in bottom uppermost and strew over them fine sifted sugar 1204 when pastry or baked puddings are not done through and yet the outside is sufficiently brown cover them over with a piece of white paper until thoroughly cooked this prevents them from getting burnt illustration recipes chapter xxvii very good puffpaste 1205 ingredientsto every lb of flour allow 1 lb of butter and not quite 12 pint of water modecarefully weigh the

perfectly dry and proceed in the following manner to make the paste using a very clean pasteboard and rollingpinsupposing the quantity to be 1 lb of flour work the whole into a smooth paste with not quite 12 pint of water using a knife to mix it with the proportion of this latter ingredient must be regulated by the discretion of the cook if too much be added the paste when baked will be tough roll it out until it is of an equal thickness of about an inch break 4 oz of the butter into small pieces place these on the paste sift over it a little flour fold it over roll out again and put another 4 oz of butter repeat the rolling and buttering until the paste has been rolled out 4 times or equal quantities of flour and butter have been used do not omit every time the paste is rolled out to dredge a little flour over that and the rollingpin to prevent both from sticking handle the paste as lightly as possible and do not press heavily upon it with the rollingpin the next thing to be considered is the oven as the baking of pastry requires particular attention do not put it into the oven until it is sufficiently hot to raise the paste for the bestprepared paste if not properly baked will be good for nothing brushing the paste as often as rolled out and the pieces of butter placed thereon with the white of an egg assists it to rise in leaves or flakes as this is the great beauty of puffpaste it is as well to try this method average cost 1s 4d per lb butterabout the second century of the christian era butter was placed by galen amongst the useful medical agents and about a century before him dioscorides mentioned that he had noticed that fresh butter made of ewes and goats milk was served at meals instead of oil and that it took the place of fat in making pastry thus we have undoubted authority that eighteen hundred years ago there existed a knowledge of the useful qualities of butter the romans seem to have set about making it much as we do for pliny tells us butter is made from milk and the use of this element so much sought after by barbarous nations distinguished the rich from the common people it is obtained principally from cows milk that from ewes

only necessary in summer to put new milk into a bottle some hours after it has been taken from the cow and shake it briskly the clots which are thus formed should be thrown into a sieve washed and

pasteboard work lightly into it 2 oz of the butter and then make a hole in the centre into this well put the yolks of 2 eggs the salt and about 14 pint of water the quantity of this latter ingredient must be regulated by the cook as it is impossible to give the exact proportion of it knead up the paste quickly and lightly and when quite smooth roll it out square to the thickness of about 12 inch presuming that the butter is perfectly free from moisture and as cool as possible roll it into a ball and place this ball of butter on the paste fold the paste over the butter all round and secure it by wrapping it well all over flatten the paste by rolling it lightly with the rollingpin until it is quite thin but not thin enough to allow the butter to break through and keep the board and paste dredged lightly with flour during the process of making it this rolling gives it the first turn now fold the paste in three and roll out again and should the weather be very warm put it in a cold place on the ground to cool between the several turns for unless this is particularly attended to the paste will be spoiled roll out the paste again twice put it by to cool then roll it out twice more which will make 6 turnings in all now fold the paste in two and it will be ready for use if properly baked and well made this crust will be delicious and should rise in the oven about 5 or 6 inches the paste should be made rather firm in the first instance as the ball of butter is liable to break through great attention must also be paid to keeping the butter very cool as if this is in a liquid and soft state the paste will not answer at all should the cook be dexterous enough to succeed in making this the paste will have a much better appearance than that made by the process of dividing the butter into 4 parts and placing it over the rolledout paste but until experience has been acquired we recommend puffpaste made by recipe no 1205 the above paste is used for volsauvent small articles of pastry and in fact everything that requires very light crust average cost 1s 6d per lb what to do with rancid butterwhen butter has become very rancid it should be melted several times by a moderate heat with or without the addition of water and as soon as it has been well kneaded after the cooling in order to extract any water it may have retained it should be put into brown freestone pots sheltered from the contact of the air the french often add to it after it has been melted a piece of toasted bread which helps to destroy the tendency of the batter to rancidity soyers recipe for

yellow variety is met with beetroot contains twenty parts sugar everybody knows that the beet has competed with the sugarcane and a great part of the french sugar is manufactured from beet beetroot has a refreshing composing and slightly purgative quality the young leaves when cooked are a substitute for spinach they are also useful for mixing with sorrel to lessen its acidity the large ribs of the leaves are serviceable in various culinary preparations the root also may be prepared in several ways but its most general use is in salad some writers upon the subject have expressed their opinion that beetroot is easily digested but those who have taken pains to carefully analyze its qualities make quite a contrary statement youth of course can digest it but to persons of a certain age beet is very indigestible or rather it does not digest at all it is not the sugary pulp which is indigestible but its fibrous network that resists the action of the gastric organs thus when the root is reduced to a puree almost any person may eat it french sugarit had long been thought that tropical heat was not necessary to form sugar and about 1740 it was discovered that many plants of the temperate zone and amongst others the beet contained it towards the beginning of the 19th century circumstances having in france made sugar scarce and consequently dear the government caused inquiries to be instituted as to the possibility of finding a substitute for it accordingly it was ascertained that sugar exists in the whole vegetable kingdom that it is to be found in the grape chestnut potato but that far above all the beet contains it in a large proportion thus the beet became an object of the most careful culture and many experiments went to prove that in this respect the old world was independent of the new many manufactories came into existence in all parts of france and the making of sugar became naturalized in that country common short crust 1212 ingredientsto every

the nile was an especial object of their adoration the persians would not wash their hands the scythians honoured the danube the greeks and romans erected altars to the fountains and rivers and some of the architectural embellishments executed for fountains in greece were remarkable for their beauty and delicacy the purity of the water was a great object of the care of the ancients and we learn that the athenians appointed four officers to keep watch and ward over the water in their city these men had to keep the fountains in order and clean the reservoirs so that the water might be

nero there were constructed nine principal aqueducts the pipes of which were of bricks baked tiles stone lead or wood according to the calculation of vigenerus half a million hogsheads of water were conveyed into rome every day by upwards of 10000 small pipes not onethird of an inch in diameter the water was received in large closed basins above which rose splendid monuments these basins supplied other subterranean conduits connected with various quarters of the city and these conveyed water to small reservoirs furnished with taps for the exclusive use of certain streets the water which was

those of roquevaire they are very large and very sweet this sort is rarely eaten by any but the most wealthy the dried malaga or muscatel raisins which come to this country packed in small boxes and

produces the sultana raisin it has been called sultana from its delicate qualities and unique growth the finest are those of smyrna they have not sufficient flavour and sugary properties to serve alone for puddings and cakes but they are peculiarly valuable for mixing that is to say for introducing in company with the richer sorts of valencias or muscatels in white puddings or cakes too where

brandy of cognac a town in the department of charente and that brought from andraye seem to owe their excellence from being made from white wine like other spirit brandy is colourless when recently distilled by mere keeping however owing probably to some change in the soluble matter contained in it it acquires a slight colour which is much increased by keeping in casks and is made of the required intensity by the addition of burnt sugar or other colouring matter what is called british brandy is not in fact brandy which is the name as we have said of a spirit distilled from wine but is

sugar white clayed brown clayed brown raw and molasses the sugarcane grows to the height of six twelve or even sometimes twenty feet it is propagated from cuttings requires much hoeing and weeding giving employment to thousands upon thousands of slaves in the slave countries and attains maturity in twelve or thirteen months when ripe it is cut down close to the stole the stems are divided into lengths of about three feet which are made up into bundles and carried to the mill to be crushed between rollers in the process of crushing the juice runs down into a reservoir from which after a while it is drawn through a siphon that is to say the clear fluid is taken from the scum this fluid undergoes several processes of drying and refining the methods varying in different manufactories

sensible properties to gluten and when new or fresh it is inflated and rendered frothy by a large quantity of carbonic acid when mixed with wort this substance acts upon the saccharine matter the temperature rises carbonic acid is disengaged and the result is ale which always contains a considerable proportion of alcohol or spirit the quantity of yeast employed in brewing ale being small the saccharine matter is but imperfectly decomposed hence a considerable portion of it remains in the liquor and gives it that viscid quality and body for which it is remarkable the fermenting property of yeast is weakened by boiling for ten minutes and is entirely destroyed by continuing the boiling alcohol poured upon it likewise renders it inert on which account its power lessens as the alcohol is formed during fermentation yorkshire pudding to serve with hot roast beef 1384 ingredients112 pint of milk 6 large tablespoonfuls of flour 3 eggs 1 saltspoonful of salt illustration yorkshire pudding

the touch which separates itself from new milk and forms a layer on its surface when removed by skimming is employed in a variety of culinary preparations the analyses of the contents of cream have been decided to be in 100 partsbutter 35 curd or matter of cheese 35 whey 920 that cream contains an oil is evinced by its staining clothes in the manner of oil and when boiled for some time a little oil floats upon the surface the thick animal oil which it contains the wellknown butter is separated only by agitation as in the common process of churning and the cheesy matter remains blended with the whey in the state of buttermilk of the several kinds of cream the principal are the devonshire and dutch clotted creams the costorphin cream and the scotch sour cream the devonshire cream is produced by nearly boiling the milk in shallow tin vessels over a charcoal fire and kept in that state until the whole of the cream is thrown up it is used for eating with fruits and tarts the cream from costorphin a village of that name near edinburgh is accelerated in its separation from three or four days old milk by a certain degree of heat and the dutch clotted creama coagulated mass in which a spoon will stand uprightis manufactured from freshdrawn milk which is put into a pan and stirred with a spoon two or three times a day to prevent the cream from separating from the milk the scotch sour cream is a misnomer for it is a material produced without cream a small tub filled with skimmed milk is put into a larger one containing hot water and after remaining there all night the thin milk called wigg is drawn off and the remainder of the contents of the smaller vessel is sour cream 1386 jellies are not the nourishing food they were at one time considered to be and many eminent physicians are of opinion that they are less digestible than the flesh or muscular part of animals still when acidulated with lemonjuice and flavoured with wine they are very suitable for some convalescents vegetable jelly is a distinct principle existing in fruits which possesses the property of gelatinizing when boiled and cooled but it is a principle entirely different from the gelatine of animal bodies although the name of jelly common to both sometimes leads to an erroneous idea on that subject animal jelly or gelatine is glue whereas vegetable jelly is rather analogous to gum liebig places gelatine very low indeed in the scale of usefulness he says gelatine which by itself is tasteless and when eaten excites nausea possesses no nutritive value that even when accompanied by the savoury constituents of flesh it is not capable of supporting the vital process and when added to the usual diet as a substitute for plastic matter does not increase but on the contrary diminishes the nutritive value of the food which it renders insufficient in quantity and inferior in quality it is this substance which is most frequently employed in the manufacture of the jellies supplied by the confectioner but those prepared at home from calves feet do possess some nutrition and are the only sort that should be given to invalids isinglass is the purest variety of gelatine and is prepared from the sounds or swimmingbladders of certain fish chiefly the sturgeon from its whiteness it is mostly used for making blancmange and similar dishes 1387 the white of eggs is perhaps the best substance that can be employed in clarifying jelly as well as some other fluids for the reason that when albumen and the white of eggs is nearly pure albumen is put into a liquid that is muddy from substances suspended in it on boiling the liquid the albumen coagulates in a flocculent manner and entangling with it the impurities rises with them to the surface as a scum or sinks to the bottom according to their weight 1388 souffles omelets and sweet dishes in which eggs form the principal ingredient demand for their successful manufacture an experienced cook they are the prettiest

let them cool arrange them in the flanc or case and boil down the syrup until reduced to a thick jelly pour it over the apples and garnish them with a few slices of candied citron 1392 a more simple flanc may be made by rolling out the paste cutting the bottom of a round or oval shape and then a narrow strip for the sides these should be stuck on with the white of an egg to the bottom piece and the flanc then filled with raw fruit with sufficient sugar to sweeten it nicely it will not require so long baking as in a mould but the crust must be made everywhere of an equal thickness and so perfectly joined that the juice does not escape this dish may also be served hot and should be garnished in the same manner or a little melted apricot jam may be poured over the apples which very much

required for use as the liquor has time to cool and the fat can be so much more easily and effectually removed when thoroughly set procure from the butchers 2 nice calfs feet scald them to take off the hair slit them in two remove the fat from between the claws and wash the feet well in warm water put them into a stewpan with the above proportion of cold water bring it gradually to boil and remove every particle of scum as it rises when it is well skimmed boil it very gently for 6 or 7 hours or until the liquor is reduced rather more than half then strain it through a sieve into a basin and put it in a cool place to set as the liquor is strained measure it to ascertain the proportion for the jelly allowing something for the sediment and fat at the top to clarify it carefully remove all the fat from the top pour over a little warm water to wash away any that may remain and wipe the jelly with a clean cloth remove the jelly from the sediment put it into a saucepan and supposing the quantity to be a quart add to it 6 oz of loaf sugar the shells and wellwhisked whites of 5 eggs and stir these ingredients together cold set the saucepan on the fire but do not stir the jelly after it begins to warm let it boil about 10 minutes after it rises to a head then throw in a teacupful of cold water let it boil 5 minutes longer then take the saucepan off cover it closely and let it remain 12 hour near the fire dip the jellybag into hot water wring it out quite dry and fasten it on to a stand or the back of a chair which must be placed near the fire to prevent the jelly from setting before it has run through the bag place a basin underneath to receive the jelly then pour it into the bag and should it not be clear the first time run it through the bag again this stock is the foundation of all really good jellies which may be varied in innumerable ways by colouring and flavouring with liqueurs and by moulding it with fresh and preserved fruits to insure the jelly being firm when turned out 12 oz of isinglass clarified might be added to the above proportion of stock substitutes for calfs feet are now frequently used in making jellies which lessen the expense and trouble in preparing this favourite dish isinglass and gelatine being two of the principal materials employed but although they may look as nicely as jellies made from good stock they are never so delicate having very often an unpleasant flavour somewhat resembling glue particularly when made with gelatine timeabout 6 hours to boil the feet for the stock to clarify it14 hour to boil 12 hour to

seasonable from march to october but may be had all the year how to make a jellybagthe very stout flannel called doublemill used for ironingblankets is the best material for a jellybag those of home manufacture are the only ones to be relied on for thoroughly clearing the jelly care should be taken that the seam of the bag be stitched twice to secure it against unequal filtration the most convenient mode of using the big is to tie it upon a hoop the exact size of the outside of its mouth and to do this strings should be sewn round it at equal distances the jellybag may of coarse be made any size but one of twelve or fourteen inches deep and seven or eight across the mouth will be sufficient for ordinary use the form of a jellybag is the fools cap cowheel stock for jellies more

run through a bag rather more than 12 oz of isinglass is about the proper quantity to use for a quart of strong calfsfeet stock and rather more than 2 oz for the same quantity of fruit juice as isinglass varies so much in quality and strength it is difficult to give the exact proportions the larger the mould the stiffer should be the jelly and where there is no ice more isinglass must be used than if the mixture were frozen this forms a stock for all kinds of jellies which may be flavoured in many ways time112 hour sufficient with wine syrup fruit c to fill two moderatesized moulds

russia some of an inferior kind is brought from north and south america and the east indies the several varieties may be had from the wholesale dealers in isinglass in london in choosing isinglass for domestic use select that which is whitest has no unpleasant odour and which dissolves most readily in water the inferior kinds are used for fining beer and similar purposes isinglass is much adulterated to test its purity take a few threads of the substance drop some into boiling water some into cold water and some into vinegar in the boiling water the isinglass will dissolve in cold water it will become white and cloudy and in vinegar it will swell and become jellylike if the isinglass is adulterated with gelatine that is to say the commoner sorts of gelatinefor isinglass is classed amongst gelatines of all which varieties it is the very purest and best in boiling water the gelatine will not so completely dissolve as the isinglass in cold water it becomes clear and jellylike and in vinegar it will harden how to mould bottled jellies 1414 uncork the bottle place it in a saucepan of hot water until the jelly is reduced to a liquid state taste it to ascertain whether it is sufficiently flavoured and if not add a little wine pour the jelly into moulds which have been soaked in water let it set and turn it out by placing the mould in hot water for a minute

may be carefully removed as it rises but particular attention must be given to the jelly that it be not stirred in the slightest degree after it is heated the isinglass should be added when the jelly begins to boil this assists to clear it and makes it firmer for turning out wring out a jellybag in hot water fasten it on to a stand or the back of a chair place it near the fire with a basin underneath it and run the jelly through it should it not be perfectly clear the first time repeat the process until the desired brilliancy is obtained soak the moulds in water drain them for half a second pour in the jelly and put it in a cool place to set if ice is at hand surround the moulds with it and the jelly will set sooner and be firmer when turned out in summer it is necessary to have ice in which to put the moulds or the cook will be very likely disappointed by her jellies being in too liquid a state to turn out properly unless a great deal of isinglass is used when wanted for table dip the moulds in hot water for a minute wipe the outside with a cloth lay a dish on the top of the mould turn it quickly over and the jelly should slip out easily it is sometimes served broken into square lumps and piled high in glasses earthenware moulds are preferable to those of pewter or tin for red jellies the colour and transparency of the composition being often spoiled by using the

and even a single fruit has had down on one side and the other smooth the trees are almost exactly alike as well as the blossoms pliny states that the peach was originally brought from persia where it grows naturally from which the name of persica was bestowed upon it by the romans and some modern botanists apply this as the generic name separating them from amygdalus or almond to which linnaeus had united them although they are not tropical they require a great deal of warmth to bring them to perfection hence they seldom ripen in this country in ordinary seasons without the use of walls or glass consequently they bear a high price in a good peach the flesh is firm the skin thin of a deep bright colour next the sun and of a yellowish green next to the wall the pulp is yellowish full of

and cooked so to speak to a hairsbreadth as the spoon entered the omelet a thick rich juice issued from it pleasant to the eye as well as to the smell the dish became full of it and our fair friend owns that between the perfume and the sight it made her mouth water it is an omelette au thon that is to say a tunny omelet said the cur noticing with the greatest delight the emotion of madame rcamier and few people taste it without lavishing praises on it it surprises me not at all returned the beauty never has so enticing an omelet met my gaze at any of our lay tables my cook understands them well i think yes added madame i never ate anything so delightful then came the salad which savarin recommends to all who place confidence in him it refreshes without exciting and he has a theory that it makes people younger amidst pleasant converse the dessert arrived it consisted of three apples cheese and a plate of preserves and then upon a little round table was served the mocha coffee for which france has been and is so justly famous i never said the cur take spirits i always offer liqueurs to my guests but reserve the use of them myself to my old age if it should please providence to grant me that finally the charming madame rcamier took her leave and told all her friends of the delicious omelet which she had seen and partaken of and brillat savarin in his capacity as the layard of the concealed treasures of gastronomia has succeeded in withdrawing from obscurity the details of the preparation of which so much had been said and which he imagines to be as wholesome as it was agreeable here follows the recipe omelette au thon 1494 take for 6 persons the roes of 2 carp footnote an american writer says he has followed this recipe substituting pike shad c in the place of carp and can recommend all these also with a quiet conscience any fish indeed may be used with success bleach them by putting them for 5 minutes in boiling water slightly salted take a piece of fresh tunny about the size of a hens egg to which add a small shalot already chopped hash up together the roe and the tunny so as to mix them well and throw the whole into a saucepan with a sufficient quantity of very good butter whip it up until the butter is melted this constitutes the specialty of the omelet take a second piece of butter discrtion mix it with parsley and herbs place it in a longshaped dish destined to receive the omelet squeeze the juice of a lemon over it and place it on hot embers beat up 12 eggs the fresher the better throw up the saut of roe and tunny stirring it so as to mix all well together then make your omelet in the usual manner endeavouring to turn it out long thick and soft spread it carefully on the dish prepared for it and serve at once this dish ought to be reserved for recherch djeners or for assemblies where amateurs meet who know how to eat well washed down with a good old wine it will work wonders notethe roe and the tunny must be beaten up saut without allowing them to boil to prevent their hardening which would prevent them mixing well with the eggs your dish should be hollowed towards the centre to allow the gravy to concentrate that it may be helped with a spoon the dish ought to be slightly heated otherwise the cold china will extract all the heat from the omelet illustration illustration chapter xxx general observations on preserves confectionary ices and dessert dishes preserves 1495 from the nature of vegetable substances and chiefly from their not passing so rapidly into the putrescent state as animal bodies the mode of preserving them is somewhat different although the general principles are the same all the means of preservation are put in practice occasionally for fruits and the various parts of vegetables according to the nature of the species the climate the uses to which they are applied c some are dried as nuts raisins sweet herbs c others are preserved by means of sugar such as many fruits whose delicate juices would be lost by drying some are preserved by means of vinegar and chiefly used as condiments or pickles a few also by salting as french beans while others are preserved in spirits we have however in this place to treat of the best methods of preserving fruits fruit is a most important item in the economy of health the epicurean can scarcely be said to have any luxuries without it therefore as it is so invaluable when we cannot have it fresh we must have it preserved it has long been a desideratum to preserve fruits by some cheap method yet by such as would keep them fit for the various culinary purposes as making tarts and other similar dishes the expense of preserving them with sugar is a serious objection for except the sugar is used in considerable quantities the success is very uncertain sugar also overpowers and destroys the subacid taste so desirable in many fruits these which are preserved in this manner are chiefly intended for the dessert fruits intended for preservation should be gathered in the morning in dry weather with the morning sun upon them if possible they will then have their fullest flavour and keep in good condition longer than when gathered at any other time until fruit can be used it should be placed in the dairy an icehouse or a refrigerator in an icehouse it will remain fresh and plump for several days fruit gathered in wet or foggy weather will soon be mildewed and be of no service for preserves 1496 having secured the first and most important contribution to the manufacture of preservesthe fruit the next consideration is the preparation of the syrup in which the fruit is to be suspended and this requires much care in the confectioners art there is a great nicety in proportioning the degree of concentration of the syrup very exactly to each particular case and they know this by signs and express it by certain technical terms but to distinguish these properly requires very great attention and considerable experience the principal thing to be acquainted with is the fact that in proportion as the syrup is longer boiled its water will become evaporated and its consistency will be thicker great care must be taken in the management of the fire that the syrup does not boil over and that the boiling is not carried to such an extent as to burn the sugar 1497 the first degree of consistency is called the thread which is subdivided into the little and great thread if you dip the finger into the syrup and apply it to the thumb the tenacity of the syrup will on separating the finger and thumb afford a thread which shortly breaks this is the little thread if the thread from the greater tenacity and consequently greater strength of the syrup admits of a greater extension of the finger and thumb it is called the great thread there are half a dozen other terms and experiments for testing the various thickness of the boiling sugar towards the consistency called caramel but that degree of sugarboiling belongs to the confectioner a solution of sugar prepared by dissolving two parts of doublerefined sugar the best sugar is the most economical for preserves in one of water and boiling this a little affords a syrup of the right degree of strength and which neither ferments nor crystallizes this appears to be the degree called smooth by the confectioners and is proper to be used for the purposes of preserves the syrup employed should sometimes be clarified which is done in the following mannerdissolve 2 lbs of loaf sugar in a pint of water add to this solution the white of an egg and beat it well put the preservingpan upon the fire with the solution stir it with a wooden spatula and when it begins to swell and boil up throw in some cold water or a little oil to damp the boiling for as it rises suddenly if it should boil over it would take fire being of a very inflammable nature let it boil up again then take it off and remove carefully the scum that has risen boil the solution again throw in a little more cold water remove the scum and so on for three or four times successively then strain it it is considered to be sufficiently boiled when some taken up in a spoon pours out like oil 1498 although sugar passes so easily into the state of fermentation and is in fact the only substance capable of undergoing the vinous stage of that process yet it will not ferment at all if the quantity be sufficient to constitute a very strong syrup hence syrups are used to preserve fruits and other vegetable substances from the changes they would undergo if left to themselves before sugar was in use honey was employed to preserve many vegetable productions though this substance has now given way to the juice of the sugarcane 1499 the fruits that are the most fit for preservation in syrup are apricots peaches nectarines apples greengages plums of all kinds and pears as an example take some apricots not too ripe make a small slit at the stem end and push out the stone simmer them in water till they are softened and about half done and afterwards throw them into cold water when they have cooled take them out and drain them put the apricots into the pieservingpan with sufficient syrup to cover them let them boil up three or four times and then skim them remove them from the fire pour them into an earthen pan and let them cool till next day boil them up three days successively skimming each time and they will then be finished and in a state fit to be put into pots for use after each bailing it is proper to examine into the state of the syrup when cold if too thin it will bear additional boiling if too thick it may be lowered with more syrup of the usual standard the reason why the fruit is emptied out of the preservingpan into an earthen pan is that the acid of the fruit acts upon the copper of which the preservingpans are usually made from this example the process of preserving fruits by syrup will be easily comprehended the first object is to soften the fruit by blanching or boiling it in water in order that the syrup by which it is preserved may penetrate through its substance 1500 many fruits when preserved by boiling lose much of their peculiar and delicate flavour as for instance pineapples and this inconvenience may in some instances be remedied by preserving them without heat cut the fruit in slices about one fifth of an inch thick strew powdered loaf sugar an eighth of an inch thick on the bottom of a jar and put the slices on it put more sugar on this and then another layer of the slices and so on till the jar is full place the jar with the fruit up to the neck in boiling water and keep it there till the sugar is completely dissolved which may take half an hour removing the scum as it rises lastly tie a wet bladder over the mouth of the jar or cork and wax it 1501 any of the fruits that have been preserved in syrup may be converted into dry preserves by first draining them from the syrup and then drying them in a stove or very moderate oven adding to them a quantity of powdered loaf sugar which will gradually penetrate the fruit while the fluid parts of the syrup gently evaporate they should be dried in the stove or oven on a sieve and turned every six or eight hours fresh powdered sugar being sifted over them every time they are turned afterwards they are to be kept in a dry situation in drawers or boxes currants and cherries preserved whole in this manner in bunches are extremely elegant and have a fine flavour in this way it is also that orange and lemon chips are preserved 1502 marmalades jams and fruit pastes are of the same nature and are now in very general request they are prepared without difficulty by attending to a very few directions they are somewhat expensive but may be kept without spoiling for a considerable time marmalades and jams differ little from each other they are preserves of a halfliquid consistency made by boiling the pulp of fruits and sometimes part of the rinds with sugar the appellation of marmalade is applied to those confitures which are composed of the firmer fruits as pineapples or the rinds of oranges whereas jams are made of the more juicy berries such as strawberries raspberries currants mulberries c fruit pastes are a kind of marmalades consisting of the pulp of fruits first evaporated to a proper consistency and afterwards boiled with sugar the mixture is then poured into a mould or spread on sheets of tin and subsequently dried in the oven or stove till it has acquired the state of a paste from a sheet of this paste strips may be cut and formed into any shape that may be desired as knots rings c jams require the same care and attention in the boiling as marmalade the slightest degree of burning communicates a disagreeable empyreumatic taste and if they are not boiled sufficiently they will not keep that they may keep it is necessary not to be sparing of sugar 1503 in all the operations for preservemaking when the preservingpan is used it should not be placed on the fire but on a trivet unless the jam is made on a hot plate when this is not necessary if the pan is placed close on to the fire the preserve is very liable to burn and the colour and flavour be consequently spoiled 1504 fruit jellies are compounds of the juices of fruits combined with sugar concentrated by boiling to such a consistency that the liquid upon cooling assumes the form of a tremulous jelly 1505 before fruits are candied they must first be boiled in syrup after which they are taken out and dried on a stove or before the fire the syrup is then to be concentrated or boiled to a candy height and the fruit dipped in it and again laid on the stove to dry and candy they are then to be put into boxes and kept dry 1506 conserves consist of fresh vegetable matters beat into a uniform mass with refined sugar and they are intended to preserve the virtues and properties of recent flowers leaves roots peels or fruits unaltered and as near as possible to what they were when fresh gathered and to give them an agreeable taste 1507 the lastmentioned but not the leastimportant preparation of fruit is the compte a confiture made at the moment of need and with much less sugar than would be ordinarily put to preserves they are most wholesome things suitable to most stomachs which cannot accommodate themselves to raw fruit or a large portion of sugar they are the happy medium and far better than ordinary stewed fruit confectionary 1508 in speaking of confectionary it should be remarked that all the various preparations above named come strictly speaking under that head for the various fruits flowers herbs roots and juices which when boiled with sugar were formerly employed in pharmacy as well as for sweetmeats were called confections from the latin word conficere to make up but the term confectionary embraces a very large class indeed of sweet food many kinds of which should not be attempted in the ordinary cuisine the thousand and one ornamental dishes that adorn the tables of the wealthy should be purchased from the confectioner they cannot profitably be made at home apart from these cakes biscuits and tarts c the class of sweetmeats called confections may be thus classified1 liquid confects or fruits either whole or in pieces preserved by being immersed in a fluid transparent syrup as the liquid confects of apricots green citrons and many foreign fruits 2 dry confects are those which after having been boiled in the syrup are taken out and put to dry in an oven as citron and orangepeel c 3 marmalade jams and pastes a kind of soft compounds made of the pulp of fruits or other vegetable substances beat up with sugar or honey such as oranges apricots pears c 4 jellies are the juices of fruits boiled with sugar to a pretty thick consistency so as upon cooling to form a trembling jelly as currant gooseberry apple jelly c 5 conserves are a kind of dry confects made by beating up flowers fruits c with sugar not dissolved 6 candies are fruits candied over with sugar after having been boiled in the syrup dessert dishes 1509 with moderns the dessert is not so profuse nor does it hold the same relationship to the dinner that it held with the ancientsthe romans more especially on ivory tables they would spread hundreds of different kinds of raw cooked and preserved fruits tarts and cakes as substitutes for the more substantial comestibles with which the guests were satiated however as late as the reigns of our two last georges fabulous sums were often expended upon fanciful desserts the dessert certainly repays in its general effect the expenditure upon it of much pains and it may be said that if there be any poetry at all in meals or the process of feeding there is poetry in the dessert the materials for which should be selected with taste and of course must depend in a great measure upon the season pines melons grapes peaches nectarines plums strawberries apples pears oranges almonds raisins figs walnuts filberts medlars cherries c c all kinds of dried fruits and choice and delicatelyflavoured cakes and biscuits make up the dessert together with the most costly and recherch wines the shape of the dishes varies at different periods the prevailing fashion at present being oval and circular dishes on stems the patterns and colours are also subject to changes of fashion some persons selecting china chaste in pattern and colour others elegantlyshaped glass dishes on stems with gilt edges the beauty of the dessert services at the tables of the wealthy tends to enhance the splendour of the plate the general mode of putting a dessert on table now the elegant tazzas are fashionable is to place them down the middle of the table a tall and short dish alternately the fresh fruits being arranged on the tall dishes and dried fruits bonbons c on small round or oval glass plates the garnishing needs especial attention as the contrast of the brilliantcoloured fruits with nicelyarranged foliage is very charming the garnish par excellence for dessert is the iceplant its crystallized dewdrops producing a marvellous effect in the height of summer giving a most inviting sense of coolness to the fruit it encircles the doubleedged mallow strawberry and vine leaves have a pleasing effect and for winter desserts the bay cuba and laurel are sometimes used in town the expense and difficulty of obtaining natural foliage is great but paper and composite leaves are to be purchased at an almost nominal price mixed fruits of the larger sort are now frequently served on one dish this mode admits of the display of much taste in the arrangement of the fruit for instance a pine in the centre of the dish surrounded with large plums of various sorts and colours mixed with pears rosycheeked apples all arranged with a due regard to colour have a very good effect again apples and pears look well mingled with plums and grapes hanging from the border of the dish in a nglig sort of manner with a large bunch of the same fruit lying on the top of the apples a dessert would not now be considered complete without candied and preserved fruits and confections the candied fruits may be purchased at a less cost than they can be manufactured at home they are preserved abroad in most ornamental and elegant forms and since from the facilities of travel we have become so familiar with the tables of the french chocolate in different forms is indispensable to our desserts ices 510 ices are composed it is scarcely necessary to say of congealed cream or water combined sometimes with liqueurs or other flavouring ingredients or more generally with the juices of fruits at desserts or at some evening parties ices are scarcely to be dispensed with the principal utensils required for making icecreams are icetubs freezingpots spaddles and a cellaret the tub must be large enough to contain about a bushel of ice pounded small when brought out of the icehouse and mixed very carefully with either salt nitre or soda the freezingpot is best made of pewter if it be of tin as is sometimes the case the congelation goes on too rapidly in it for the thorough intermingling of its contents on which the excellence of the ice greatly depends the spaddle is generally made of copper kept bright and clean the cellaret is a tin vessel in which ices are kept for a short time from dissolving the method to be pursued in the freezing process must be attended to when the icetub is prepared with freshpounded ice and salt the freezingpot is put into it up to its cover the articles to be congealed are then poured into it and covered over but to prevent the ingredients from separating and the heaviest of them from falling to the bottom of the mould it is requisite to turn the freezingpot round and round by the handle so as to keep its contents moving until the congelation commences as soon as this is perceived the cover of the pot being occasionally taken off for the purpose of noticing when freezing takes place the cover is immediately closed over it ice is put upon it and it is left in this state till it is served the use of the spaddle is to stir up and remove from the sides of the freezing pot the cream which in the shaking may have washed against it and by stirring it in with the rest to prevent waste of it occurring any negligence in stirring the contents of the freezingpot before congelation takes place will destroy the whole either the sugar sinks to the bottom and leaves the ice insufficiently sweetened or lumps are formed which disfigure and discolour it 1511 the aged the delicate and children should abstain from ices or iced beverages even the strong and healthy should partake of them in moderation they should be taken immediately after the repast or some hours after because the taking these substances during the process of digestion is apt to provoke indisposition it is necessary then that this function should have scarcely commenced or that it should be completely finished before partaking of ices it is also necessary to abstain from them when persons are very warm or immediately after taking violent exercise as in some cases they have produced illnesses which have ended fatally do ladies know to whom they are indebted for the introduction of ices which all the fair sex are passionately fond ofto catherine de medici will not this fact cover a multitude of sins committed by the instigator of st bartholomew recipes chapter xxxi to make syrup for compotes c 1512 ingredientsto every lb of sugar allow 112 pint of

again and then place the pan by the side of the fire for the preparation to settle remove all the scum and the sugar will be ready for use the scum should be placed on a sieve so that what syrup runs from it may be boiled up again this must also be well skimmed time20 minutes for the sugar to dissolve 5 minutes to boil notethe above two recipes are those used in the preparation of dishes usually made at home there are many degrees of boiling sugar which process requires great care attention and experience caramel sugar which makes an elegant cover for sweetmeats is difficult to prepare and is best left to an experienced confectioner we give the recipe for those of our readers who care to attempt the operation to boil sugar to caramel 1514 ingredientsto every lb of lump sugar allow 1 gill of spring water modeboil the sugar and water together very quickly over a clear fire skimming it very carefully as soon as it boils keep it boiling until the sugar snaps when a little of it is dropped in a pan of cold water if it remains hard the sugar has attained the right degree then squeeze in a little lemonjuice and let it remain an instant on the fire set the pan into another of cold water and the caramel is then ready for use the insides of welloiled moulds are often ornamented with this sugar which with a fork should be spread over them in fine threads or network a dish of light pastry tastefully arranged looks very prettily with this sugar spun lightly over it the sugar must be carefully watched and taken up the instant it is done unless the cook is very experienced and thoroughly understands her business it is scarcely worth while to attempt to make this elaborate ornament as it may be purchased quite as economically at a confectioners if the failures in the

forests but the fruit is of little value for the table being employed only in fattening hogs and for the distillation of peach brandy on the east side of the andes peaches grow wild among the cornfields and in the mountains and are dried as an article of food the young leaves of the peach are sometimes used in cookery from their agreeable flavour and a liqueur resembling the fine noyeau of

these tall high dishes than on the short flat ones all the dishes are now usually placed down the centre of the table dried and fresh fruit alternately the former being arranged on small round or oval glass plates and the latter on the dishes with stems the fruit should always be gathered on the same day that it is required for table and should be tastefully arranged on the dishes with leaves between and round it by purchasing fruits that are in season a dessert can be supplied at a very moderate cost these with a few fancy biscuits crystallized fruit bonbons c are sufficient for an ordinary dessert when fresh fruit cannot be obtained dried and foreign fruits compotes baked pears stewed normandy pippins c c must supply its place with the addition of preserves bonbons cakes biscuits c at fashionable tables forced fruit is served growing in pots these pots being hidden in more ornamental ones and arranged with the other dishessee coloured plate w1 a few vases of fresh flowers tastefully arranged add very much to the appearance of the dessert and when these are not obtainable a few paper ones mixed with green leaves answer very well as a substitute in decorating a table whether for luncheon dessert or supper a vase or two of flowers should never be forgotten as they add so much to the elegance of the tout ensemble in summer and autumn ladies residing in the country can always manage to have a few freshlygathered flowers on their tables and should never be without this inexpensive luxury on the continent vases or epergnes filled with flowers are invariably placed down the centre of the dinnertable at regular distances ices for dessert are usually moulded when this is not the case they are handed round in glasses with wafers to accompany them preserved ginger is frequently handed round after ices to prepare the palate for the delicious dessert wines a basin or glass of finelypounded lump sugar must never be omitted at a dessert as also a glass jug of fresh cold water iced if possible and two goblets by its side grapescissors a melonknife and fork and nutcrackers should always be put on table if there are dishes of fruit requiring them zests are sometimes served at the close of the dessert such as anchovy toasts or biscuits the french often serve plain or grated cheese with a dessert of fresh or dried fruit at some tables fingerglasses are placed at the right of each person nearly half filled with cold spring water and in winter with tepid water these precede the dessert at other tables a glass or vase is simply handed

table cooled or otherwise according to the season if the party be small the wine may be placed only at the top of the table near the host dish of nuts 1599 these are merely arranged piled high in the centre of the dish as shown in the engraving with or without leaves round the edge filberts should always be served with the outer skin or husk on them and walnuts should be well wiped with a damp cloth and thenwith a dry one to remove the unpleasant sticky feeling the shells frequently have seasonablefilberts from september to march good may be had after that time but are generally shrivelled and dry walnuts from september to january hazel nut and filbertthe common hazel is the wild and the filbert the cultivated state of the same tree the hazel is found wild not only in forests and hedges in dingles and ravines but occurs in extensive tracts in the more northern and mountainous parts of the country it was formerly one of the most abundant of those trees which are indigenous in this island it is seldom cultivated as a fruittree though perhaps its nuts are superior in flavour to the others the spanish nuts imported are a superior kind but they are somewhat oily and rather indigestible filberts both the red and the white and the cobnut are supposed to be merely varieties of the common hazel which have been produced partly by the superiority of soil and climate and partly by culture they were originally brought out of greece to italy whence they have found their way to holland and from that country to england it is supposed that within a few miles of maidstone in kent there are more filberts grown than in all england besides and it is from that place that the london market is supplied the filbert is longer than the common nut though of the same thickness and has a larger kernel the cobnut is a still larger variety and is roundish filberts are more esteemed at the dessert than common nuts and are generally eaten with salt they are very free from oil and disagree with few persons walnutsthe walnut is a native of persia the caucasus and china but was introduced to this kingdom from france the ripe kernel is brought to the dessert on account of its agreeable flavour and the fruit is also much used in the green state but before the stone hardens as a pickle in spain grated walnuts are employed in tarts and other dishes the walnut abounds in oil which is expressed and which being of a highly drying nature and very limpid is much employed for delicate painting this on the continent is sometimes used as a substitute for oliveoil in cooking but is very apt to turn rancid it is also manufactured into a kind of soap the mare or refuse matter after the oil is extracted proves very nutritious for poultry or other domestic animals in switzerland this is eaten by poor people under the name of pain amer box of french plums 1600 if the box which contains them is exceedingly ornamental it may be placed on the table if small on a glass dish if large without one french plums may also be arranged on a glass plate and garnished with brightcoloured sweetmeats which make a very good effect all fancy boxes of preserved and crystallized fruit may be put on the table or not at pleasure these little matters of detail must of course be left to individual taste seasonablemay be purchased all the year but are in greater perfection in the winter and are more suitable for that season as fresh fruit cannot be obtained dish of mixed fruit 1601 for a centre dish a mixture of various fresh fruits has a remarkably good effect particularly if a pine be added to the list a high raised appearance should be given to the fruit which is done in the following manner place a tumbler in the centre of the dish and in this tumbler the pine crown uppermost round the tumbler put a thick layer of moss and over this apples pears plums peaches and such fruit as is simultaneously in season by putting a layer of moss underneath so much fruit is not required besides giving a better shape to the dish grapes should be placed on the top of the fruit a portion of some of the bunches hanging over the sides of the dish in a nglig kind of manner which takes off the formal look of the dish in arranging the plums apples c let the colours contrast well seasonablesuitable for a dessert in september or october grapesfrance produces about a thousand varieties of the grape which is cultivated more extensively in that country than in any other hygienists agree in pronouncing grapes as among the best of fruits the grape possesses several rare qualities it is nourishing and fattening and its prolonged use has often overcome the most obstinate cases of constipation the skins and pips of grapes should not be eaten box of chocolate 1602 this is served in an ornamental box placed on a glass plate or dish seasonablemay be purchased at any time dish of apples 1603 the apples should be nicely wiped with a dry cloth and arranged on a dish piled high in the centre with evergreen leaves between each layer the inferior apples should form the bottom layer with the brightcoloured large ones at the top the leaves of the laurel bay holly or any shrub green in winter are suitable for garnishing dessert dishes oranges may be arranged in the same manner they should also be wiped with a dry cloth before being sent to table dish of mixed summer fruit 1604 this dish consists of cherries raspberries currants and strawberries piled in different layers with plenty of leaves between each layer so that each fruit is well separated the fruit should be arranged with a due regard to colour so that they contrast nicely one with the other our engraving shows a layer of white cherries at the bottom then one of red raspberries over that a layer of white currants and at the top some fine scarlet strawberries seasonable in june july and august almonds and raisins 1605 these are usually served on glass dishes the fruit piled high in the centre and the almonds blanched and strewn over to blanch the almonds put them into a small mug or teacup pour over them boiling water let them remain for 2 or 3 minutes and the skins may then be easily removed figs dates french plums c are all served on small glass plates or oval dishes but without the almonds seasonable at any time but more suitable in winter when fresh fruit is not obtainable datesdates are imported into britain in a dried state from barbary and egypt and when in good condition they are much esteemed an inferior kind has lately become common which are dried hard and have little or no flavour they should be chosen large softish not much wrinkled of a reddishyellow colour on the outside with a whitish membrane between the fruit and the stone dish of strawberries 1606 fine strawberries arranged in the manner shown in the engraving look exceedingly well the inferior ones should be placed at the bottom of the dish and the others put in rows pyramidically with the stalks downwards so that when the whole is completed nothing but the red part of the fruit is visible the fruit should be gathered with rather long stalks as there is then something to support it and it can be placed more upright in each layer a few of the finest should be reserved to crown the top to have walnuts fresh throughout the season 1607 ingredientsto every pint of water allow 1 teaspoonful of salt modeplace the walnuts in the salt and water for 24 hours at least then take them out and rub them dry old nuts may be freshened in this manner or walnuts when first picked may be put into an earthen pan with salt sprinkled amongst them and with damped hay placed on the top of them and then covered down with a lid they must be well wiped before they are put on table seasonableshould be stored away in september or october illustration illustration chapter xxxii general observations on milk butter cheese and eggs milk 1608 milk is obtained only from the class of animals called mammalia and is intended by nature for the nourishment of their young the milk of each animal is distinguished by some peculiarities but as that of the cow is by far the most useful to us in this part of the world our observations will be confined to that variety 1609 milk when drawn from the cow is of a yellowishwhite colour and is the most yellow at the beginning of the period of lactation its taste is agreeable and rather saccharine the viscidity and specific gravity of milk are somewhat greater than that of water but these properties vary somewhat in the milk procured from different individuals on an average the specific gravity of milk is 1035 water being 1 the small cows of the alderney breed afford the richest milk 1610 milk which is carried to a considerable distance so as to be much agitated and cooled before it is put into pans to settle for cream never throws up so much nor such rich cream as if the same milk had been put into pans directly after it was milked 1611 milk considered as an aliment is of such importance in domestic economy as to render all the improvements in its production extremely valuable to enlarge upon the antiquity of its use is unnecessary it has always been a favourite food in britain lacte et carno vivunt says caesar in his commentaries the english of which is the inhabitants subsist upon flesh and milk the breed of the cow has received great improvement in modern times as regards the quantity and quality of the milk which she affords the form of milchcows their mode of nourishment and progress are also manifest in the management of the dairy 1612 although milk in its natural state be a fluid yet considered as an aliment it is both solid and fluid for no sooner does it enter the stomach than it is coagulated by the gastric juice and separated into curd and whey the first of these being extremely nutritive 1613 milk of the human subject is much thinner than cows milk asss milk comes the nearest to human milk of any other goats milk is something thicker and richer than cows milk ewes milk has the appearance of cows milk and affords a larger quantity of cream mares milk contains more sugar than that of the ewe camels milk is used only in africa buffalos milk is employed in india 1614 from no other substance solid or fluid can so great a number of distinct kinds of aliment be prepared as from milk some forming food others drink some of them delicious and deserving the name of luxuries all of them wholesome and some medicinal indeed the variety of aliments that seems capable of being produced from milk appears to be quite endless in every age this must have been a subject for experiment and every nation has added to the number by the invention of some peculiarity of its own butter 1615 beckman in his history of inventions states that butter was not used either by the greeks or romans in cooking nor was it brought upon their tables at certain meals as is the custom at present in england it has been made from time immemorial though the art of making cheese is said not to have been known to the ancient britons and to have been learned from their conquerors 1616 the taste of butter is peculiar and very unlike any other fatty substance it is extremely agreeable when of the best quality but its flavour depends much upon the food given to the cows to be good it should not adhere to the knife 1617 butter with regard to its dietetic properties may be regarded nearly in the light of vegetable oils and animal fats but it becomes sooner rancid than most other fat oils when fresh it cannot but be considered as very wholesome but it should be quite free from rancidity if slightly salted when it is fresh its wholesomeness is probably not at all impaired but should it begin to turn rancid salting will not correct its unwholesomeness when salt butter is put into casks the upper part next the air is very apt to become rancid and this rancidity is also liable to affect the whole cask 1618 epping butter is the kind most esteemed in london fresh butter comes to london from buckinghamshire suffolk oxfordshire yorkshire devonshire c cambridge butter is esteemed next to fresh devonshire butter is nearly similar in quality to the latter irish butter sold in london is all salted but is generally good the number of firkins exported annually from ireland amounts to 420000 equal to a million of money dutch butter is in good repute all over europe america and even india and no country in the world is so successful in the manufacture of this article holland supplying more butter to the rest of the world than any country whatever 1619 there are two methods pursued in the manufacture of butter in one the cream is separated from the milk and in that state it is converted into butter by churning as is the practice about epping in the other milk is subjected to the same process which is the method usually followed in cheshire the first method is generally said to give the richest butter and the latter the largest quantity though some are of opinion that there is little difference either in quality or quantity cheese 1620 cheese is the curd formed from milk by artificial coagulation pressed and dried for use curd called also casein and caseous matter or the basis of cheese exists in the milk and not in the cream and requires only to be separated by coagulation the coagulation however supposes some alteration of the curd by means of the substance employed to coagulate it it is rendered insoluble in water when the curd is freed from the whey kneaded and pressed to expel it entirely it becomes cheese this assumes a degree of transparency and possesses many of the properties of coagulated albumen if it be well dried it does not change by exposure to the air but if it contain moisture it soon putrefies it therefore requires some salt to preserve it and this acts likewise as a kind of seasoning all our cheese is coloured more or less except that made from skim milk the colouring substances employed are arnatto turmeric or marigold all perfectly harmless unless they are adulterated and it is said that arnatto sometimes contains red lead 1621 cheese varies in quality and richness according to the materials of which it is composed it is made1 of entire milk as in cheshire 2 of milk and cream as at stilton 3 of new milk mixed with skimmed milk as in gloucestershire 4 of skimmed milk only as in suffolk holland and italy 1622 the principal varieties of cheese used in england are the followingcheshire cheese famed all over europe for its rich quality and fine piquant flavour it is made of entire new milk the cream not being taken off gloucester cheese is much milder in its taste than the cheshire there are two kinds of gloucester cheesesingle and double single gloucester is made of skimmed milk or of the milk deprived of half the cream double gloucester is a cheese that pleases almost every palate it is made of the whole milk and cream stilton cheese is made by adding the cream of one day to the entire milk of the next it was first made at stilton in leicestershire sage cheese is so called from the practice of colouring some curd with bruised sage marigoldleaves and parsley and mixing this with some uncoloured curd with the romans and during the middle ages this practice was extensively adopted cheddar cheese much resembles parmesan it has a very agreeable taste and flavour and has a spongy appearance brickbat cheese has nothing remarkable except its form it is made by turning with rennet a mixture of cream and new milk the curd is put into a wooden vessel the shape of a brick and is then pressed and dried in the usual way dunlop cheese has a peculiarly mild and rich taste the best is made entirely from new milk new cheese as it is called in london is made chiefly in lincolnshire and is either made of all cream or like stilton by adding the cream of one days milking to the milk that comes immediately from the cow they are extremely thin and are compressed gently two or three times turned for a few days and then eaten new with radishes salad c skimmed milk cheese is made for sea voyages principally parmesan cheese is made in parma and piacenza it is the most celebrated of all cheese it is made entirely of skimmed cows milk the high flavour which it has is supposed to be owing to the rich herbage of the meadows of the po where the cows are pastured the best parmesan is kept for three or four years and none is carried to market till it is at least six months old dutch cheese derives its peculiar pungent taste from the practice adopted in holland of coagulating the milk with muriatic acid instead of rennet swiss cheeses in their several varieties are all remarkable for their fine flavour that from gruyre a bailiwick in the canton of fribourg is best known in england it is flavoured by the dried herb of melilotos officinalis in powder cheese from milk and potatoes is manufactured in thuringia and saxony cream cheese although so called is not properly cheese but is nothing more than cream dried sufficiently to be cut with a knife eggs 1623 there is only one opinion as to the nutritive properties of eggs although the qualities of those belonging to different birds vary somewhat those of the common hen are most esteemed as delicate food particularly when newlaid the quality of eggs depends much upon the food given to the hen eggs in general are considered most easily digestible when little subjected to the art of cookery the lightest way of dressing them is by poaching which is effected by putting them for a minute or two into brisk boiling water this coagulates the external white without doing the inner part too much eggs are much better when newlaid than a day or two afterwards the usual time allotted for boiling eggs in the shell is 3 to 334 minutes less time than that in boiling water will not be sufficient to solidify the white and more will make the yolk hard and less digestible it is very difficult to guess accurately as to the time great care should be employed in putting them into the water to prevent cracking the shell which inevitably causes a portion of the white to exude and lets water into the egg eggs are often beaten up raw in nutritive beverages 1624 eggs are employed in a very great many articles of cookery entres and entremets and they form an essential ingredient in pastry creams flip c it is particularly necessary that they should be quite fresh as nothing is worse than stale eggs cobbett justly says stale or even preserved eggs are things to be run from not after 1625 the metropolis is supplied with eggs from all parts of the kingdom and they are likewise largely imported from various places on the continent as france holland belgium guernsey and jersey it appears from official statements mentioned in mccullochs commercial dictionary that the number imported from france alone amounts to about 60000000 a year and supposing them on an average to cost fourpence a dozen it follows that we pay our continental neighbours above 83000 a year for eggs 1626 the eggs of different birds vary much in size and colour those of the ostrich are the largest one laid in the menagerie in paris weighed 2 lbs 14 oz held a pint and was six inches deep this is about the usual size of those brought from africa travellers describe ostrich eggs as of an agreeable taste they keep longer than hens eggs drinkingcups are often made of the shell which is very strong the eggs of the turkey are almost as mild as those of the hen the egg of the goose is large but welltasted ducks eggs have a rich flavour the albumen is slightly transparent or bluish when set or coagulated by boiling which requires less time than hens eggs guineafowl eggs are smaller and more delicate than those of the hen eggs of wild fowl are generally coloured often spotted and the taste generally partakes somewhat of the flavour of the bird they belong to those of land birds that are eaten as the plover lapwing ruff c are in general much esteemed but those of seafowl have more or less a strong fishy taste the eggs of the turtle are very numerous they consist of yolk only without shell and are delicious recipes chapter xxxiii separation of milk and cream 1627 if it be desired that the milk should be freed entirely from cream it should be poured into a very shallow broad pan or dish not more than 112 inch deep as cream cannot rise through a great depth of milk in cold and wet weather milk is not so rich as it is in summer and warm weather and the mornings milk is always richer than the evenings the lastdrawn milk of each milking at all times and seasons is richer than the firstdrawn and on that account should be set apart for cream milk should be shaken as little as possible when carried from the cow to the dairy and should be poured into the pans very gently persons not keeping cows may always have a little cream provided the milk they purchase be pure and unadulterated as soon as it comes in it should be poured into very shallow open piedishes and set by in a very cool place and in 7 or 8 hours a nice cream should have risen to the surface milk is one of the most complete of all articles of food that is to say it contains a very large number of the elements which enter into the composition of the human body it disagrees with fat heavy languid people of slow circulation and at first with many people of sedentary habits and stomachs weakened by stimulants of different kinds but if exercise can be taken and a little patience shown while the system accommodates itself to a new regimen this bland and soothing article of diet is excellent for the majority of thin nervous people especially for those who have suffered much from emotional disturbances or have relaxed their stomachs by too much tea or coffee taken too hot milk is in fact a nutrient and a sedative at once stomachs however have their idiosyncrasies and it sometimes proves an unwelcome and illdigested article of food as milk when good contains a good deal of respiratory material fatmaterial which must either be burnt off or derange the liver and be rejected in other ways it may disagree because the lungs are not sufficiently used in the open air but it is very probable that there are really constitutions which cannot take to it and they should not be forced to keep milk and cream in hot weather 1628 when the weather is very warm and it is very difficult to prevent milk from turning sour and spoiling the cream it should be scalded and it will then remain good for a few hours it must on no account be allowed to boil or there will be a skin instead of a cream upon the milk and the slower the process the safer will it be a very good plan to scald milk is to put the pan that contains it into a saucepan or wide kettle of boiling water when the surface looks thick the milk is sufficiently scalded and it should then be put away in a cool place in the same vessel that it was scalded in cream may be kept for 24 hours if scalded without sugar and by the addition of the latter ingredient it will remain good double the time if kept in a cool place all pans jugs and vessels intended for milk should be kept beautifully clean and well scalded before the milk is put in as any negligence in this respect may cause large quantities of it to be spoiled and milk should never be kept in vessels of zinc or copper milk may be preserved good in hot weather for a few hours by placing the jug which contains it in ice or very cold water or a pinch of bicarbonate of soda may be introduced into the liquid milk when of good quality is of an opaque white colour the cream always comes to the top the wellknown milky odour is strong it will boil without altering its appearance in these respects the little bladders which arise on the surface will renew themselves if broken by the spoon to boil milk is in fact the simplest way of testing its quality the commonest adulterations of milk are not of a hurtful character it is a good deal thinned with water and sometimes thickened with a little starch or colored with yolk of egg or even saffron but these processes have nothing murderous in them curds and whey 1629 ingredientsa very small piece of rennet 12 gallon of milk modeprocure from the butchers a small piece of rennet which is the stomach of the calf taken as soon as it is killed scoured and well rubbed with salt and stretched on sticks to dry pour some boiling water on the rennet and let it remain for 6 hours then use the liquor to turn the milk the milk should be warm and fresh from the cow if allowed to cool it must be heated till it is of a degree quite equal to new milk but do not let it be too hot about a tablespoonful or rather more would be sufficient to turn the above proportion of milk into curds and whey and whilst the milk is turning let it be kept in rather a warm place timefrom 2 to 3 hours to turn the milk seasonable at any time devonshire cream 1630 the milk should stand 24 hours in the winter half that time when the weather is very warm the milkpan is then set on a stove and should there remain until the milk is quite hot but it must not boil or there will be a thick skin on the surface when it is sufficiently done the undulations on the surface look thick and small rings appear the time required for scalding cream depends on the size of the pan and the heat of the fire but the slower it is done the better the pan should be placed in the dairy when the cream is sufficiently scalded and skimmed the following day this cream is so much esteemed that it is sent to the london markets in small square tins and is exceedingly delicious eaten with fresh fruit in devonshire butter is made from this cream and is usually very firm devonshire junket 1631 ingredientsto every pint of new milk allow 2 dessertspoonfuls of brandy 1 dessertspoonful of sugar and 112 dessertspoonful of prepared rennet thick cream pounded cinnamon or grated nutmeg modemake the milk bloodwarm put it into a deep dish with the brandy sugar and rennet stir it altogether and cover it over until it is set then spread some thick or clotted cream over the top grate some nutmeg and strew some sugar over and the dish will be ready to serve timeabout 2 hours to set the milk seasonable at any time to keep and choose fresh butter 1632 fresh butter should be kept in a dark cool place and in as large a mass as possible mould as much only as is required as the more surface is exposed the more liability there will be to spoil and the outside very soon becomes rancid fresh butter should be kept covered with white paper for small larders buttercoolers of red brick are now very much used for keeping fresh butter in warm weather these coolers are made with a large bellshaped cover into the top of which a little cold water should be poured and in summer time very frequently changed and the butter must be kept covered these coolers keep butter remarkably firm in hot weather and are extremely convenient for those whose larder accommodation is limited illustration butterdish in choosing fresh butter remember it should smell deliciously and be of an equal colour all through if it smells sour it has not been sufficiently washed from the buttermilk and if veiny and open it has probably been worked with a staler or an inferior sort to preserve and to choose salt butter 1633 in large families where salt butter is purchased a tub at a time the first thing to be done is to turn the whole of the butter out and with a clean knife to scrape the outside the tub should then be wiped with a clean cloth and sprinkled all round with salt the butter replaced and the lid kept on to exclude the air it is necessary to take these precautions as sometimes a want of proper cleanliness in the dairymaid causes the outside of the butter to become rancid and if the scraping be neglected the whole mass would soon become spoiled to choose salt butter plunge a knife into it and if when drawn out the blade smells rancid or unpleasant the butter is bad the layers in tubs will vary greatly the butter being made at different times so to try if the whole tub be good the cask should be unhooped and the butter tried between the staves it is not necessary to state that butter is extracted from cream or from unskimmed milk by the churn of course it partakes of the qualities of the milk and winter butter is said not to be so good as spring butter a word of caution is necessary about rancid butter nobody eats it on bread but it is sometimes used in cooking in forms in which the acidity can be more or less disguised so much the worse it is almost poisonous disguise it as you may never under any exigency whatever be tempted into allowing butter with even a soupon of turning to enter into the composition of any dish that appears on your table and in general the more you can do without the employment of butter that has been subjected to the influence of heat the better the woman of modern times is not a leech but she might often keep the leech from the door if she would give herself the trouble to invent innocent sauces buttermoulds for moulding fresh butter illustration dish of rolled butter 1634 buttermoulds or wooden stamps for moulding fresh butter are much used and are made in a variety of forms and shapes in using them let them be kept scrupulously clean and before the butter is pressed in the interior should be well wetted with cold water the butter must then be pressed in the mould opened and the perfect shape taken out the butter may be then dished and garnished with a wreath of parsley if for a cheese course if for breakfast put it into an ornamental butterdish with a little water at the bottom should the weather be very warm curled butter 1635 tie a strong cloth by two of the corners to an iron hook in the wall make a knot with the other two ends so that a stick might pass through put the butter into the cloth twist it tightly over a dish into which the butter will fall through the knot so forming small and pretty little strings the butter may then be garnished with parsley if to serve with a cheese course or it may be sent to table plain for breakfast in an ornamental dish squirted butter for garnishing hams salads eggs c is made by forming a piece of stiff paper in the shape of a cornet and squeezing the butter in fine strings from the hole at the bottom scooped butter is made by dipping a teaspoon or scooper in warm water and then scooping the butter quickly and thin in warm weather it would not be necessary to heat the spoon butter may be kept fresh for ten or twelve days by a very simple process knead it well in cold water till the buttermilk is extracted then put it in a glazed jar which invert in another putting into the latter a sufficient quantity of water to exclude the air renew the water every day fairy butter 1636 ingredientsthe yolks of 2 hardboiled eggs 1 tablespoonful of orangeflower water 2 tablespoonfuls of pounded sugar 14 lb of good fresh butter modebeat the yolks of the eggs smoothly in a mortar with the orangeflower water and the sugar until the whole is reduced to a fine paste add the butter and force all through an old but clean cloth by wringing the cloth and squeezing the butter very hard the butter will then drop on the plate in large and small pieces according to the holes in the cloth plain butter may be done in the same manner and is very quickly prepared besides having a very good effect butterwhitecoloured butter is said not to be so good as the yellow but the yellow colour is often artificially produced by the introduction of colouring matter into the churn anchovy butter 1637 ingredientsto every lb of butter allow 6 anchovies 1 small bunch of parsley modewash bone and pound the anchovies well in a mortar scald the parsley chop it and rub through a sieve then pound all the ingredients together mix well and make the butter into pats immediately this makes a pretty dish if fancifully moulded for breakfast or supper and should be garnished with parsley average cost 1s 8d sufficient to make 2 dishes with 4 pats each seasonable at any time cheese 1638 in families where much cheese is consumed and it is bought in large quantities a piece from the whole cheese should be cut the larger quantity spread with a thicklybuttered sheet of white paper and the outside occasionally wiped to keep cheeses moist that are in daily use when they come from table a damp cloth should be wrapped round them and the cheese put into a pan with a cover to it in a cool but not very dry place to ripen cheeses and bring them forward put them into a damp cellar and to check too large a production of mites spirits may be poured into the parts affected pieces of cheese which are too near the rind or too dry to put on table may be made into welsh rarebits or grated down and mixed with macaroni cheeses may be preserved in a perfect state for years by covering them with parchment made pliable by soaking in water or by rubbing them over with a coating of melted fat the cheeses selected should be free from cracks or bruises of any kind cheeseit is well known that some persons like cheese in a state of decay and even alive there is no accounting for tastes and it maybe hard to show why mould which is vegetation should not be eaten as well as salad or maggots as well as eels but generally speaking decomposing bodies are not wholesome eating and the line must be drawn somewhere stilton cheese illustration stilton cheese 1639 stilton cheese or british parmesan as it is sometimes called is generally preferred to all other cheeses by those whose authority few will dispute those made in may or june are usually served at christmas or to be in prime order should be kept from 10 to 12 months or even longer an artificial ripeness in stilton cheese is sometimes produced by inserting a small piece of decayed cheshire into an aperture at the top from 3 weeks to a month is sufficient time to ripen the cheese an additional flavour may also be obtained by scooping out a piece from the top and pouring therein port sherry madeira or old ale and letting the cheese absorb these for 2 or 3 weeks but that cheese is the finest which is ripened without any artificial aid is the opinion of those who are judges in these matters in serving a stilton cheese the top of it should be cut off to form a lid and a napkin or piece of white paper with a frill at the top pinned round when the cheese goes from table the lid should be replaced mode of serving cheese illustration cheeseglass 1640 the usual mode of serving cheese at good tables is to cut a small quantity of it into neat square pieces and to put them into a glass cheesedish this dish being handed round should the cheese crumble much of course this method is rather wasteful and it may then be put on the table in the piece and the host may cut from it when served thus the cheese must always be carefully scraped and laid on a white doyley or napkin neatly folded cream cheese is often served

the tongue to the large end of the egg and if it feels warm it is new and may be relied on as a fresh egg another mode of ascertaining their freshness is to hold them before a lighted candle or to the light and if the egg looks clear it will be tolerably good if thick it is stale and if there is a black spot attached to the shell it is worthless no egg should be used for culinary purposes with the slightest taint in it as it will render perfectly useless those with which it has been mixed eggs that are purchased and that cannot be relied on should always be broken in a cup and then put into a basin by this means stale or bad eggs may be easily rejected without wasting the others eggs contain for their volume a greater quantity of nutriment than any other article of food but it does not follow that they are always good for weak stomachs quite the contrary for it is often a great object to give the stomach a large surface to work upon a considerable volume of ingesta over which the nutritive matter is diffused and so exposed to the action of the gastric juice at many points there are many persons who cannot digest eggs however cooked it is said however that their digestibility decreases in proportion to the degree in which they are hardened by boiling to keep eggs fresh for several weeks 1655 have ready a large saucepan capable of holding 3 or 4 quarts full of boiling water put the eggs into a cabbagenet say 20 at a time and hold them in the water which must be kept boiling for 20 seconds proceed in this manner till you have done as many eggs as you wish to preserve then pack them away in sawdust we have tried this method of preserving eggs and can vouch for its excellence they will be found at the end of 2 or 3 months quite good enough for culinary purposes and although the white may be a little tougher than that of a newlaid egg the yolk will be nearly the same many persons keep eggs for a long time by smearing the shells with butter or sweet oil they should then be packed in plenty of bran or sawdust and the eggs not allowed to touch each other eggs for storing should be collected in fine weather and should not be more than 24 hours old when they are packed away or their flavour when used cannot be relied on another simple way of preserving eggs is to immerse them in limewater soon after they have been laid and then to put the vessel

the egg be at all stale it is equally difficult to poach it nicely strain some boiling water into a deep clean fryingpan break the egg into a cup without damaging the yolk and when the water boils remove the pan to the side of the fire and gently slip the egg into it place the pan over a gentle fire and keep the water simmering until the white looks nicely set when the egg is ready take it up gently with a slice cut away the ragged edges of the white and serve either on toasted bread or on slices of ham or bacon or on spinach c a poached egg should not be overdone as its appearance and taste will be quite spoiled if the yolk be allowed to harden when the egg is slipped into the water the white should be gathered together to keep it a little in form or the cup should be turned over

1668 among the numerous vegetable products yielding articles of food for man the cereals hold the first place by means of skilful cultivation mankind have transformed the original forms of these growths poor and illflavoured as they perhaps were into various fruitful and agreeable species which yield an abundant and pleasant supply classified according to their respective richness in alimentary elements the cereals stand thuswheat and its varieties rye barley oats rice indian corn everybody knows it is wheat flour which yields the best bread ryebread is viscous hard less easily soluble by the gastric juice and not so rich in nutritive power flour produced from barley indian corn or rice is not so readily made into bread and the article when made is heavy and indigestible 1669 on examining a grain of corn from any of the numerous cereals footnote cereal a cornproducing plant from ceres the goddess of agriculture used in the preparation of flour such as wheat maize rye barley c it will be found to consist of two partsthe husk or exterior covering which is generally of a dark colour and the inner or albuminous part which is more or less white in grinding these two portions are separated and the husk being blown away in the process of winnowing the flour remains in the form of a light brown powder consisting principally of starch and gluten in order to render it white it undergoes a process called bolting it is passed through a series of fine sieves which separate the coarser parts leaving behind fine white flourthe fine firsts of the corndealer the process of bolting as just described tends to deprive flour of its gluten the coarser and darker portion containing much of that substance while the lighter part is peculiarly rich in starch bran contains a large proportion of gluten hence it will be seen why brown broad is so much more nutritious than white in fact we may lay it down as a general rule that the whiter the bread the less nourishment it contains majendie proved this by feeding a dog for forty days with white wheaten bread at the end of which time he died while another dog fed on brown bread made with flour mixed with bran lived without any disturbance of his health the bolting process then is rather injurious than beneficial in its result and is one of the numerous instances where fashion has chosen a wrong standard to go by in ancient times down to the emperors no bolted flour was known in many parts of germany the entire meal is used and in no part of the world are the digestive organs of the people in a better condition in years of famine when corn is scarce the use of bolted flour is most culpable for from 18 to 20 per cent is lost in bran brown bread has of late years become very popular and many physicians have recommended it to invalids with weak digestions with great success this rage for white bread has introduced adulterations of a very serious character affecting the health of the whole community potatoes are added for this purpose but this is a comparatively harmless cheat only reducing the nutritive property of the bread but bonedust and alum are also put in which are far from harmless 1670 breadmaking is a very ancient art indeed the assyrians egyptians and greeks used to make bread in which oil with aniseed and other spices was an element but this was unleavened every family used to prepare the bread for its own consumption the trade of baking not having yet taken shape it is said that somewhere about the beginning of the thirtieth olympiad the slave of an archon at athens made leavened bread by accident he had left some wheaten dough in an earthen pan and forgotten it some days afterwards he lighted upon it again and found it turning sour his first thought was to throw it away but his master coming up he mixed this now acescent dough with some fresh dough which he was working at the bread thus produced by the introduction of dough in which alcoholic fermentation had begun was found delicious by the archon and his friends and the slave being summoned and catechised told the secret it spread all over athens and everybody wanting leavened bread at once certain persons set up as breadmakers or bakers in a short time breadbaking became quite an art and athenian bread was quoted all over greece as the best bread just as the honey of hyamettus was celebrated as the best honey 1671 in our own times and among civilized peoples bread has become an article of food of the first necessity and properly so for it constitutes of itself a complete lifesustainer the gluten starch and sugar which it contains representing azotized and hydrocarbonated nutrients and combining the sustaining powers of the animal and vegetable kingdoms in one product 1672 wheaten breadthe finest wholesomest and most savoury bread is made from wheaten flour there are of wheat three leading qualities the soft the medium and the hard wheat the last of which yields a kind of bread that is not so white as that made from soft wheat but is richer in gluten and consequently more nutritive 1673 rye breadthis comes next to wheaten bread it is not so rich in gluten but is said to keep fresh longer and to have some laxative qualities 1674 barley bread indiancorn bread cbread made from barley maize oats rice potatoes c rises badly because the grains in question contain but little gluten which makes the bread heavy close in texture and difficult of digestion in fact cornflour has to be added before panification can take place in countries where wheat is scarce and maize abundant the people make the latter a chief article of sustenance when prepared in different forms breadmaking 1675 panification or breadmaking consists of the following processes in the case of wheaten flour fifty or sixty per cent of water is added to the flour with the addition of some leavening matter and preferably of yeast from malt and hops all kinds of leavening matter have however been and are still used in different parts of the world in the east indies toddy which is a liquor that flows from the wounded cocoanut tree and in the west indies dunder or the refuse of the distillation of rum the dough then undergoes the wellknown process called kneading the yeast produces fermentation a process which may be thus describedthe dough reacting upon the leavening matter introduced the starch of the flour is transformed into saccharine matter the saccharine matter being afterwards changed into alcohol and carbonic acid the dough must be well bound and yet allow the escape of the little bubbles of carbonic acid which accompany the fermentation and which in their passage cause the numerous little holes which are seen in light bread 1676 the yeast must be good and fresh if the bread is to be digestible and nice stale yeast produces instead of vinous fermentation an acetous fermentation which flavours the bread and makes it disagreeable a poor thin yeast produces an imperfect fermentation the result being a heavy unwholesome loaf 1677 when the dough is well kneaded it is left to stand for some time and then as soon as it begins to swell it is divided into loaves after which it is again left to stand when it once more swells up and manifests for the last time the symptoms of fermentation it is then put into the oven where the water contained in the dough is partly evaporated and the loaves swell up again while a yellow crust begins to form upon the surface when the bread is sufficiently baked the bottom crust is hard and resonant if struck with the finger while the crumb is elastic and rises again after being pressed down with the finger the bread is in all probability baked sufficiently if on opening the door of the oven you are met by a cloud of steam which quickly passes away 1678 one word as to the unwholesomeness of new bread and hot rolls when bread is taken out of the oven it is full of moisture the starch is held together in masses and the bread instead of being crusted so as to expose each grain of starch to the saliva actually prevents their digestion by being formed by the teeth into leathery poreless masses which lie on the stomach like so many bullets bread should always be at least a day old before it is eaten and if properly made and kept in a cool dry place ought to be perfectly soft and palatable at the end of three or four days hot rolls swimming in melted butter and new bread ought to be carefully shunned by everybody who has the slightest respect for that muchinjured individualthe stomach 1679 aerated breadit is not unknown to some of our readers that dr dauglish of malvern has recently patented a process for making bread light without the use of leaven the ordinary process of breadmaking by fermentation is tedious and much labour of human hands is requisite in the kneading in order that the dough may be thoroughly interpenetrated with the leaven the new process impregnates the bread by the application of machinery with carbonic acid gas or fixed air different opinions are expressed about the bread but it is curious to note that as corn is now reaped by machinery and dough is baked by machinery the whole process of breadmaking is probably in course of undergoing changes which will emancipate both the housewife and the professional baker from a large amount of labour 1680 in the production of arated bread wheaten flour water salt and carbonic acid gas generated by proper machinery are the only materials employed we need not inform our readers that carbonic acid gas is the source of the effervescence whether in common water coming from a depth or in lemonade or any arated drink its action in the new bread takes the place of fermentation in the old 1681 in the patent process the dough is mixed in a great iron ball inside which is a system of paddles perpetually turning and doing the kneading part of the business into this globe the flour is dropped till it is full and then the common atmospheric air is pumped out and the pure gas turned on the gas is followed by the water which has been arated for the purpose and then begins the churning or kneading part of the business 1682 of course it is not long before we have the dough and very light and nice it looks this is caught in tins and passed on to the floor of the oven which is an endless floor moving slowly through the fire done to a turn the loaves emerge at the other end of the apartmentand the arated bread is made 1683 it may be added that it is a good plan to change ones baker from time to time and so secure a change in the quality of the bread that is eaten 1684 mixed breadsrye bread is hard of digestion and requires longer and slower baking than wheaten bread it is better when made with leaven of wheaten flour rather than yeast and turns out lighter it should not be eaten till two days old it will keep a long time 1685 a good bread may be made by mixing ryeflour wheatflour and ricepaste in equal proportions also by mixing rye wheat and barley in norway it is said that they only bake their barley broad once a year such is its keeping quality 1686 indiancorn flour mixed with wheatflour half with half makes a nice bread but it is not considered very digestible though it keeps well 1687 rice cannot be made into bread nor can potatoes but onethird potato flour to threefourths wheaten flour makes a tolerably good loaf 1688 a very good bread better than the ordinary sort and of a delicious flavour is said to be produced by adopting the following recipetake ten parts of wheatflour five parts of potatoflour one part of ricepaste knead together add the yeast and bake as usual this is of course cheaper than wheaten bread 1689 flour when freshly ground is too glutinous to make good bread and should therefore not be used immediately but should be kept dry for a few weeks and stirred occasionally until it becomes dry and crumbles easily between the fingers 1690 flour should be perfectly dry before being used for bread or cakes if at all damp the preparation is sure to be heavy before mixing it with the other ingredients it is a good plan to place it for an hour or two before the fire until it feels warm and dry 1691 yeast from homebrewed beer is generally preferred to any other it is very bitter and on that account should be well washed and put away until the thick mass settles if it still continues bitter the process should be repeated and before being used all the water floating at the top must be poured off german yeast is now very much used and should be moistened and thoroughly mixed with the milk or water with which the bread is to be made 1692 the following observations are extracted from a valuable work on breadmaking footnote the english breadbook by eliza acton london longman and will be found very useful to our readers 1693 the first thing required for making wholesome bread is the utmost cleanliness the next is the soundness and sweetness of all the ingredients used for it and in addition to these there must be attention and care through the whole process 1694 an almost certain way of spoiling dough is to leave it halfmade and to allow it to become cold before it is finished the other most common causes of failure are using yeast which is no longer sweet or which has been frozen or has had hot liquid poured over it 1695 too small a proportion of yeast or insufficient time allowed for the dough to rise will cause the bread to be heavy 1696 heavy bread will also most likely be the result of making the dough very hard and letting it become quite cold particularly in winter 1697 if either the sponge or the dough be permitted to overwork itself that is to say if the mixing and kneading be neglected when it has reached the proper point for either sour bread will probably be the consequence in warm weather and bad bread in any the goodness will also be endangered by placing it so near a fire as to make any part of it hot instead of maintaining the gentle and equal degree of heat required for its due fermentation 1698 milk or buttermilk which is not perfectly sweet will not only injure the flavour of the bread but in sultry weather will often cause it to be quite uneatable yet either of them if fresh and good will materially improve its quality 1699 to keep bread sweet and fresh as soon as it is cold it should be put into a clean earthen pan with a cover to it this pan should be placed at a little distance from the ground to allow a current of air to pass underneath some persons prefer keeping bread on clean wooden shelves without being covered that the crust may not soften stale bread may be freshened by warming it through in a gentle oven stale pastry cakes c may also be improved by this method 1700 the utensils required for making bread on a moderate scale are a kneadingtrough or pan sufficiently large that the dough may be kneaded freely without throwing the flour over the edges and also to allow for its rising a hair sieve for straining yeast and one or two strong spoons 1701 yeast must always be good of its kind and in a fitting state to produce ready and proper fermentation yeast of strong beer or ale produces more effect than that of milder kinds and the fresher the yeast the smaller the quantity will be required to raise the dough 1702 as a general rule the oven for baking bread should be rather quick and the heat so regulated as to penetrate the dough without hardening the outside the oven door should not be opened after the bread is put in until the dough is set or has become firm as the cool air admitted will have an unfavourable effect on it 1703 brick ovens are generally considered the best adapted for baking bread these should be heated with wood faggots and then swept and mopped out to cleanse them for the reception of the bread iron ovens are more difficult to manage being apt to burn the surface of the bread before the middle is baked to remedy this a few clean bricks should be set at the bottom of the oven close together to receive the tins of bread in many modern stoves the ovens are so much improved that they bake admirably and they can always be brought to the required temperature when it is higher than is needed by leaving the door open for a time a few hints respecting the making and baking of cakes 1704 eggs should always be broken into a cup the whites and yolks separated and they should always be strained breaking the eggs thus the bad ones may be easily rejected without spoiling the others and so cause no waste as eggs are used instead of yeast they should be very thoroughly whisked they are generally sufficiently beaten when thick enough to carry the drop that falls from the whisk 1705 loaf sugar should be well pounded and then sifted through a fine sieve 1706 currants should be nicely washed picked dried in a cloth and then carefully examined that no pieces of grit or stone may be left amongst them they should then be laid on a dish before the fire to become thoroughly dry as if added damp to the other ingredients cakes will be liable to be heavy 1707 good butter should always be used in the manufacture of cakes and if beaten to a cream it saves much time and labour to warm but not melt it before beating 1708 less butter and eggs are required for cakes when yeast is mixed with the other ingredients 1709 the heat of the oven is of great importance especially for large cakes if the heat be not tolerably fierce the batter will not rise if the oven is too quick and there is any danger of the cake burning or catching put a sheet of clean paper over the top newspaper or paper that has been printed on should never be used for this purpose 1710 to know when a cake is sufficiently baked plunge a clean knife into the middle of it draw it quickly out and if it looks in the least sticky put the cake back and close the oven door until the cake is done 1711 cakes should be kept in closed tin canisters or jars and in a dry place those made with yeast do not keep so long as those made without it biscuits 1712 since the establishment of the large modern biscuit manufactories biscuits have been produced both cheap and wholesome in comparatively speaking endless variety their actual component parts are perhaps known only to the various makers but there are several kinds of biscuits which have long been in use that may here be advantageously described 1713 biscuits belong to the class of unfermented bread and are perhaps the most wholesome of that class in cases where fermented bread does not agree with the human stomach they may be recommended in many instances they are considered lighter and less liable to create acidity and flatulence the name is derived from the french bis cuit twicebaked because originally that was the mode of entirely depriving them of all moisture to insure their keeping but although that process is no longer employed the name is retained the use of this kind of bread on land is pretty general and some varieties are luxuries but at sea biscuits are articles of the first necessity 1714 sea or ship biscuits are made of wheatflour from which only the coarsest bran has been separated the dough is made up as stiff as it can be worked and is then formed into shapes and baked in an oven after which the biscuits are exposed in lofts over the oven until perfectly dry to prevent them from becoming mouldy when stored 1715 captains biscuits are made in a similar manner only of fine flour recipes chapter xxxv to make

fresh german yeast 114 to 112 pint of warm milkandwater illustration cottage loaf illustration tin bread modeput the flour into a large earthenware bowl or deep pan then with a strong metal or wooden spoon hollow out the middle but do not clear it entirely away from the bottom of the pan as in that case the sponge or leaven as it was formerly termed would stick to it which it ought not to do next take either a large tablespoonful of brewers yeast which has been rendered solid by mixing it with plenty of cold water and letting it afterwards stand to settle for a day and night or nearly an ounce of german yeast put it into a large basin and proceed to mix it so that it shall be as smooth as cream with 34 pint of warm milkandwater or with water only though even a very little milk will much improve the bread pour the yeast into the hole made in the flour and stir into it as much of that which lies round it as will make a thick batter in which there must be no lumps strew plenty of flour on the top throw a thick clean cloth over and set it where the air is warm but do not place it upon the kitchen fender for it will become too much heated there look at it from time to time when it has been laid for nearly an hour and when the yeast has risen and broken through the flour so that bubbles appear in it you will know that it is ready to be made up into dough then place the pan on a strong chair or dresser or table of convenient height pour into the sponge the remainder of the warm milkandwater stir into it as much of the flour as you can with the spoon then wipe it out clean with your fingers and lay it aside next take plenty of the remaining flour throw it on the top of the leaven and begin with the knuckles of both hands to knead it well when the flour is nearly all kneaded in begin to draw the edges of the dough towards the middle in order to mix the whole thoroughly and when it is free from flour and lumps and crumbs and does not stick to the hands when touched it will be done and may again be covered with the cloth and left to rise a second time in 34 hour look at it and should it have swollen very much and begin to crack it will be light enough to bake turn it then on to a pasteboard or very clean dresser and with a large sharp knife divide it in two make it up quickly into loaves and dispatch it to the oven make one or two incisions across the tops of the loaves as they will rise more easily if this be done if baked in tins or pans rub them with a tiny piece of butter laid on a piece of clean paper to prevent the dough from sticking to them all bread should be turned upside down or on its side as soon as it is drawn from the oven if this be neglected the under part of the loaves will become wet and blistered from the steam which cannot then escape from them to make the dough without setting a sponge merely mix the yeast with the greater part of the warm milkandwater and wet up the whole of the flour at once after a little salt has been stirred in proceeding exactly in every other respect as in the directions just given as the dough will soften in the rising it should be made quite firm at first or it will be too lithe by the time it is ready for the oven illustration italian millet timeto be left to rise an hour the first time 34 hour the second time to be baked from 1 to 114 hour or baked in one loaf from 112 to 2 hours italian millet or great indian millet is cultivated in egypt and nubia where it is called dhourra and is used as human food as well as for the fermentation of beer it will grow on poor soils and is extremely productive it has been introduced into italy where they make a coarse bread from it and it is also employed in pastry and puddings they also use it for feeding horses and domestic fowls it is the largest variety growing to the height of six feet but it requires a warm climate and will not ripen in this country a yellow variety called golden millet is sold in the grocers shops for making puddings and is very delicate and wholesome to make a peck of good bread 1719 ingredients3 lbs of potatoes 6 pints of cold water 12 pint of good yeast a peck of flour 2 oz of salt modepeel and boil the potatoes beat them to a cream while warm then add 1 pint of cold water strain through a colander and add to it 12 pint of good yeast which should have been put in water overnight to take off its bitterness stir all well together with a wooden spoon and pour the mixture into the centre of the flour mix it to the substance of cream cover it over closely and let it remain near the fire for an hour then add the 5 pints of water milkwarm with 2 oz of salt pour this in and mix the whole to a nice light dough let it remain for about 2 hours then make it into 7 loaves and bake for about 112 hour in a good oven when baked the bread should weigh nearly 20 lbs timeabout 112 hour the red varieties of wheat are generally hardier and more easily grown than the white sorts and although of less value to the miller they are fully more profitable to the grower in consequence of the better crops which they produce another advantage the red wheats possess is their comparative immunity from the attacks of mildew and fly the best english wheat comes from the counties of kent and essex the qualities under these heads always bearing a higher price than others as will be seen by the periodical lists in the journals rice bread 1720 ingredientsto every lb of rice allow 4 lbs of wheat flour nearly 3 tablespoonfuls of yeast 14 oz of salt modeboil the rice in water until it is quite tender pour off the water and put the rice before it is cold to the flour mix these well together with the yeast salt and sufficient warm water to make the whole into a smooth dough let it rise by the side of the fire then form it into loaves and bake them from 112 to 2 hours according to their size if the rice is boiled in milk instead of water it makes very delicious bread or cakes when boiled in this manner

batter has nicely risen work the whole to a nice smooth dough adding the water as required knead it well and mould the dough into loaves let them rise for nearly 12 hour then put them into a wellheated oven if made into 2 loaves they will require from 112 to 2 hours baking time112 to 2 hours illustration maize plant illustration ear of maize maizenext to wheat and rice maize is the grain most used in the nourishment of man in asia africa and america it is the principal daily food of a large portion of the population especially of the colonists in some of the provinces of france too it is consumed in large quantities there are eight varieties of the maize the most productive is the maize of cusco the flour of maize is yellow and it contains an oily matter which when fresh gives it an agreeable flavour and odour but the action of the air on it soon develops rancidity if carried any distance it should be stored away in airtight vessels an excellent soup is prepared with meat and maizeflour the inhabitants of some countries where wheat is scarce make with maize and water or milk and salt a kind of biscuit which is pleasant in taste but indigestible some of the preparations of maizeflour are very good and when partaken in moderation suitable food for almost everybody soda bread 1722 ingredientsto every 2 lbs of flour allow 1 teaspoonful of tartaric acid 1 teaspoonful of

in the milk and pour it several times from one basin to another before adding it to the flour work the whole quickly into a light dough divide it into 2 loaves and put them into a wellheated oven immediately and bake for an hour sour milk or buttermilk may be used but then a little less acid will be needed time1 hour polish and pomeranian wheat are accounted by authorities most excellent large raftlike barges convey this grain down the rivers from the interior of the country to the seaports this corn is described as being white hard and thinskinned and it yields a large quantity of flour

butter in the milk add to it the yeast and salt and mix these ingredients well together put the flour into a pan stir in the above ingredients and let the dough rise covered in a warm place knead it well make it into rolls let them rise again for a few minutes and bake in a quick oven richer rolls may be made by adding 1 or 2 eggs and a larger proportion of butter and their appearance improved by brushing the tops over with yolk of egg or a little milk time1 lb of flour divided into 6 rolls from 15 to 20 minutes hot rolls 1724 this dish although very unwholesome and indigestible is nevertheless a great favourite and eaten by many persons as soon as the rolls come from the bakers they should be put into the oven which in the early part of the morning is sure not to be very hot and the rolls must not be buttered until wanted when they are quite hot divide them lengthwise into three put some thin flakes of good butter between the slices press the rolls together and put them in the oven for a minute or two but not longer or the butter would oil take them out of the oven spread the butter equally over divide the rolls in half and put them on to a very hot clean dish and send them instantly to table to make dry toast 1725 to make dry toast properly a great deal of attention is required much more indeed than people generally suppose never use new bread for making any kind of toast as it eats heavy and besides is very extravagant procure a loaf of household bread about two days old cut off as many slices as may be required not quite 14 inch in thickness trim off the crusts and ragged edges put the bread on a toastingfork and hold it before a very clear fire move it backwards and forwards until the bread is nicely coloured then turn it and toast the other side and do not place it so near the fire that it blackens dry toast should be more gradually made than buttered toast as its great beauty consists in its crispness and this cannot be attained unless the process is slow and the bread is allowed gradually to colour it should never be made long before it is wanted as it soon becomes tough unless placed on the fender in front of the fire as soon as each piece is ready it should be put into a rack or stood upon its edges and sent quickly to table to make hot buttered toast 1726 a loaf of household bread about two days old answers for making toast better than cottage bread the latter not being a good shape and too crusty for the purpose cut as many nice even slices as may be required rather more than 14 inch in thickness and toast them before a very bright fire without allowing the bread to blacken which spoils the appearance and flavour of all toast when of a nice colour on both sides put it on a hot plate divide some good butter into small pieces place them on the toast set this before the fire and when the butter is just beginning to melt spread it lightly over the toast trim off the crust and ragged edges divide each round into 4 pieces and send the toast quickly to table some persons cut the slices of toast across from corner to corner so making the pieces of a threecornered shape soyer recommends that each slice should be cut into pieces as soon as it is buttered and when all are ready that they should be piled lightly on the dish they are intended to be served on he says that by cutting through 4 or 5 slices at a time all the butter is squeezed out of the upper ones while the bottom one is swimming in fat liquid it is highly essential to use good butter for making this dish muffins 1727 ingredientsto every quart of

the whole into a dough of rather a soft consistence cover it over with a cloth and place it in a warm place to rise and when light and nicely risen divide the dough into pieces and round them to the proper shape with the hands place them in a layer of flour about two inches thick on wooden trays and let them rise again when this is effected they each will exhibit a semiglobular shape then place them carefully on a hotplate or stove and bake them until they are slightly browned turning them when they are done on one side muffins are not easily made and are more generally purchased than manufactured at home to toast them divide the edge of the muffin all round by pulling it open to the depth of about an inch with the fingers put it on a toastingfork and hold it before a very clear fire until one side is nicely browned but not burnt turn and toast it on the other do not toast them too quickly as if this is done the middle of the muffin will not be warmed through when done divide

the other to toast them have ready a very bright clear fire put the crumpet on a toastingfork and hold it before the fire not too close until it is nicely brown on one side but do not allow it to blacken turn it and brown the other side then spread it with good butter cut it in half and when all are done pile them on a hot dish and send them quickly to table muffins and crumpets should always

circular stones as it was ground in egypt 2000 years ago see no 117 the requisite rotary motion being given by a blindfolded mule which paces round and round with untiring patience a bell being attached to his neck which as long as he is in movement tinkles on and when it stops he is urged to his duty by the shout of arre mula from some one within hearing when ground the wheat is sifted through three sieves the last of these being so fine that only the pure flour can pass through it this is of a pale apricotcolour the bread is made in the evening it is mixed with only sufficient water with a little salt in it to make it into dough a very small quantity of leaven or fermenting mixture is added the scripture says a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump but in england to avoid the trouble of kneading many put as much leaven or yeast in one batch of household bread as in spain would last them a week for the six or eight donkeyloads of bread they send every night from their oven the dough made it is put into sacks and carried on the donkeys backs to the oven in the centre of the village so as to bake it immediately it is kneaded on arriving there the dough is divided into portions weighing 3 lbs each two long narrow wooden tables on trestles are then placed down the room and now a curious sight may be seen about twenty men bakers come in and range themselves on one side of the tables a lump of dough is handed to the nearest which he commences kneading and knocking about with all his might for about 3 or 4 minutes and then passes it on to his neighbour who does the same and so on successively until all have kneaded it when it becomes as soft as new putty and ready for the oven of course as soon as the first baker has handed the first lump to his neighbour another is given to him and so on till the whole quantity of dough is successively kneaded by them all the bakers wives and daughters shape the loaves for the oven and some of them are very small and they are baked immediately the ovens are very large and not heated by fires under them but a quantity of twigs of the herbs of sweet marjoram and thyme which cover the hills in great profusion are put in the oven and ignited they heat the oven to any extent required and as the bread gets baked the oven gets gradually colder so the bread is never burned they knead the bread in

flour made from it and render it unfit for good bread the principal of these are the blight mildew and smut which are occasioned by microscopic fungi which sow themselves and grow upon the stems and ears destroying the nutritive principles and introducing matter of a deleterious kind the farmer is at the utmost pains to keep away these intruders wheat as well as all kinds of corn is also very liable to be injured by being stacked before it is quite dry in which case it will heat and become musty in the ricks in wet harvests it is sometimes impossible to get it sufficiently dried and a great deal of corn is thus often spoiled it is generally reckoned that the sweetest bread is made from wheat threshed out before it is stacked which shows the importance of studying the best modes of preserving it the erudite are not agreed as to the aboriginal country of corn some say it is egypt others tartary and the learned bailly as well as the traveller pallas affirms that it grows

xxxvi general observations on beverages 1789 beverages are innumerable in their variety but the ordinary beverages drunk in the british isles may be divided into three classes1 beverages of the simplest kind not fermented 2 beverages consisting of water containing a considerable quantity of carbonic acid 3 beverages composed partly of fermented liquors of the first class may be mentionedwater toastandwater barleywater eau sucr lait sucr cheese and milk whey milkandwater lemonade orangeade sherbet apple and pear juice capillaire vinegarandwater raspberry vinegar and water 1790 of the common class of beverages consisting of water impregnated with carbonic acid gas we may name sodawater single and double ordinary effervescing draughts and gingerbeer 1791 the beverages composed partly of fermented liquors are hot spiced wines bishop eggflip egghot ale posset sack posset punch and spiritsandwater 1792 we will however forthwith treat on the most popular of our beverages beginning with the one which makes the cup that cheers but not inebriates 1793 the beverage called tea has now become almost a necessary of life previous to the middle of the 17th century it was not used in england and it was wholly unknown to the greeks and romans pepys says in his diaryseptember 25th 1661i sent for a cup of tea a china drink of which i had never drunk before two years later it was so rare a commodity in england that the english eastindia company bought 2 lbs 2 oz of it as a present for his majesty in 1666 it was sold in london for sixty shillings a pound from that date the consumption has gone on increasing from 5000 lbs to 50000000 lbs 1794 linnaeus was induced to think that there were two species of teaplant one of which produced the black and the other the green teas but later observations do not confirm this when the leaves of black and green tea are expanded by hot water and examined by the botanist though a difference of character is perceived yet this is not sufficient to authorize considering them as distinct species the teatree flourishes best in temperate regions in china it is indigenous the part of china where the best tea is cultivated is called by us the tea country the cultivation of the plant requires great care it is raised chiefly on the sides of hills and in order to increase the quantity and improve the quality of the leaves the shrub is pruned so as not to exceed the height of from two to three feet much in the same manner as the vine is treated in france they pluck the leaves one selecting them according to the kinds of tea required and notwithstanding the tediousness of the operation each labourer is able to gather from four to ten or fifteen pounds a day when the trees attain to six or seven years of age the produce becomes so inferior that they are removed to make room for a fresh succession or they are cut down to allow of numerous young shoots teas of the finest flavour consist of the youngest leaves and as these are gathered at four different periods of the year the younger the leaves the higher flavoured the tea and the scarcer and consequently the dearer the article 1795 the various names by which teas are sold in the british market are corruptions of chinese words there are about a dozen different kinds but the principal are bohea congou and souchong and signify respectively inferior middling and superior teas are often perfumed and flavoured with the leaves of different kinds of plants grown on purpose different teafarms in china produce teas of various qualities raised by skilful cultivation on various soils 1796 tea when chemically analyzed is found to contain woody fibre mucilage a considerable quantity of the astringent principle or tannin a narcotic principle which is perhaps connected with a peculiar aroma the tannin is shown by its striking a black colour with sulphate of iron and is the cause of the dark stain which is always formed when tea is spilt upon buffcoloured cottons dyed with iron a constituent called theine has also been discovered in tea supposed to be identical with caffeine one of the constituents of coffee liebig says theine yields in certain processes of decomposition a series of most remarkable products which have much analogy with those derived from uric acid in similar circumstances the infusion of tea differs from that of coffee by containing iron and manganese we have in tea of many kinds a beverage which contains the active constituents of the most powerful mineral springs and however small the amount of iron may be which we daily take in this form it cannot be destitute of influence on the vital processes 1797 chinese tea has frequently been adulterated in this country by the admixture of the dried leaves of certain plants the leaves of the sloe white thorn ash elder and some others have been employed for this purpose such as the leaves of the speedwell wild germander black currants syringa purplespiked willowherb sweetbrier and cherrytree some of these are harmless others are to a certain degree poisonous as for example are the leaves of all the varieties of the plum and cherry tribe to which the sloe belongs adulteration by means of these leaves is by no means a new species of fraud and several acts of parliament from the time of george ii have been passed specifying severe penalties against those guilty of the offence which notwithstanding numerous convictions continues to the present time 1798 in the purchase of tea that should be chosen which possesses an agreeable odour and is as whole as possible in order that the leaf may be easily examined the greatest care should be taken that it has not been exposed to the air which destroys its flavour 1799 it would be impossible in the space at our command to enumerate the various modes adopted in different countries for making coffee that is the phrase commonly understood to mean the complete preparation of this delicious beverage for drinking for performing this operation such recipes or methods as we have found most practical will be inserted in their proper place but the following facts connected with coffee will be found highly interesting 1800 the introduction of coffee into this country is comparatively of recent date we are assured by bruce that the coffeetree is a native of abyssinia and it is said to have been cultivated in that country from time immemorial 1801 it appears that coffee was first introduced into england by daniel edwards a turkey merchant whose servant pasqua a greek understood the manner of roasting it this servant under the patronage of edwards established the first coffeehouse in london in george yard lombard street coffee was then sold at four or five guineas a pound and a duty was soon afterwards laid upon it of fourpence a gallon when made into a beverage in the course of two centuries however this berry unknown originally as an article of food except to some savage tribes on the confines of abyssinia has made its way through the whole of the civilized world mahommedans of all ranks drink coffee twice a day it is in universal request in france and the demand for it throughout the british isles is daily increasing the more especially since so much attention has been given to mechanical contrivances for roasting and grinding the berry and preparing the beverage 1802 of the various kinds of coffee the arabian is considered the best it is grown chiefly in the districts of aden and mocha whence the name of our mocha coffee mocha coffee has a smaller and rounder bean than any other and likewise a more agreeable smell and taste the next in reputation and quality is the java and ceylon coffee and then the coffees of bourbon and martinique and that of berbice a district of the colony of british guiana the jamaica and st domingo coffees are less esteemed 1803 a considerable change takes place in the arrangement of the constituents of coffee by the application of heat in roasting it independently of one of the objects of roasting namely that of destroying its toughness and rendering it easily ground its tannin and other principles are rendered partly soluble in water and it is to the tannin that the brown colour of the decoction of coffee is owing an aromatic flavour is likewise developed during torrefaction which is not perceived in the raw berry and which is not produced in the greatest perfection until the heat has arrived at a certain degree of temperature but if the heat be increased beyond this the flavour is again dissipated and little remains but a bitter and astringent matter with carbon 1804 the roasting of coffee in the best manner requires great nicety and much of the qualities of the beverage depends upon the operation the roasting of coffee for the dealers in london and paris has now become a separate branch of business and some of the roasters perform the operation on a great scale with considerable skill roasted coffee loses from 20 to 30 per cent by sufficient roasting and the powder suffers much by exposure to the air but while raw it not only does not lose its flavour for a year or two but improves by keeping if a cup of the best coffee be placed upon a table boiling hot it will fill the room with its fragrance but the coffee when warmed again after being cold will be found to have lost most of its flavour 1805 to have coffee in perfection it should be roasted and ground just before it is used and more should not be ground at a time than is wanted for immediate use or if it be necessary to grind more it should be kept closed from the air coffee readily imbibes exhalations from other substances and thus often acquires a bad flavour brown sugar placed near it will communicate a disagreeable flavour it is stated that the coffee in the west indies has often been injured by being laid in rooms near the sugarworks or where rum is distilled and the same effect has been produced by bringing over coffee in the same ships with rum and sugar dr moseley mentions that a few bags of pepper on board a ship from india spoiled a whole cargo of coffee 1806 with respect to the quantity of coffee used in making the decoction much depends upon the taste of the consumer the greatest and most common fault in english coffee is the too small quantity of the ingredient count rumford says that to make good coffee for drinking after dinner a pound of good mocha coffee which when roasted and ground weighs only thirteen ounces serves to make fiftysix full cups or a little less than a quarter of an ounce to a coffeecup of moderate size recipes chapter xxxvii to make chocolate 1807 ingredientsallow 12 oz of chocolate to each person to every oz allow 12 pint of water 12 pint of milk modemake

produces the edible cocoanuts which are the produce of the cocoatree cocos nucifera whereas the tree from which chocolate is procured is very different the theobroma cacao the cocoatree was cultivated by the aboriginal inhabitants of south america particularly in mexico where according to humboldt it was reared by montezuma it was transplanted thence into other dependencies of the spanish monarchy in 1520 and it was so highly esteemed by linnaeus receive from him the name now conferred upon it of theobroma a term derived from the greek and signifying food for gods chocolate has always been a favourite beverage among the spaniards and creoles and was considered here as a great luxury when first introduced after the discovery of america but the high duties laid upon it confined it long almost entirely to the wealthier classes before it was subjected to duty mr bryan edwards stated that cocoa plantations were numerous in jamaica but that the duty caused their almost entire ruin the removal of this duty has increased their cultivation for engraving of cocoabean see no 1816 to make essence of coffee 1808 ingredientsto every 14 lb of ground coffee allow 1 small teaspoonful of

sufficientallow 2 tablespoonfuls for a breakfastcupful of hot milk to roast coffee a french recipe 1809 it being an acknowledged fact that french coffee is decidedly superior to that made in england and as the roasting of the berry is of great importance to the flavour of the preparation it will be useful and interesting to know how they manage these things in france in paris there are two houses justly celebrated for the flavour of their coffeela maison corcellet and la maison royer de chartres and to obtain this flavour before roasting they add to every 3 lbs of coffee a piece of butter the size of a nut and a dessertspoonful of powdered sugar it is then roasted in the usual manner the addition of the butter and sugar develops the flavour and aroma of the berry but it must be borne in mind that the quality of the butter must be of the very best description to make coffee 1810 ingredientsallow 4 oz or 1 tablespoonful of ground coffee to each person to every oz of coffee allow 13 pint of water modeto make coffee good it should never be boiled but the boiling water merely poured on it the same as for tea the coffee should always be purchased in the berryif possible freshly roasted and it should never be ground long before it is wanted for use there are very many new kinds of coffeepots but the method of making the coffee is nearly always the same namely pouring the boiling water on the powder and allowing it to filter through our illustration shows one of loysels hydrostatic urns which are admirably adapted for making good and clear coffee which should be made in the following mannerwarm the urn with boiling water remove the lid and movable filter and place the ground coffee at the bottom of the urn put the movable filter over this and screw the lid inverted tightly on the end of the centre pipe pour into the inverted lid the above proportion of boiling water and when all the water so poured has disappeared from the funnel and made its way down the centre pipe and up again through the ground coffee by hydrostatic pressure unscrew screw the lid and cover the urn pour back direct into the urn not through the funnel one two or three cups according to the size of the percolater in order to make the infusion of uniform strength the contents will then be ready for use and should run from the tap strong hot and clear the coffee made in these urns generally turns out very good and there is but one objection to themthe coffee runs rather slowly from the tap this is of no consequence where there is a small party but tedious where there are many persons to provide for a remedy for this objection may be suggested namely to make the coffee very strong so that not more than 13 of a cup would be required as the rest would be filled up with milk making coffee in filters or percolaters does away with the necessity of using isinglass white of egg and various other preparations to clear it coffee should always be served very hot and if possible in the same vessel in which it is made as pouring it from one pot to another cools and consequently spoils it many persons may think that the proportion of water we have given for each oz of coffee is rather small it is so and the coffee produced from it will be very strong 13 of a cup will be found quite sufficient which should be filled with nice hot milk or milk and cream mixed this is the cafe au lait for which our neighbours over the channel are so justly celebrated should the ordinary method of making coffee be preferred use double the quantity of water and in pouring it into the cups put in more coffee and less milk illustration loysels hydrostatic urn sufficientfor very good coffee allow 12 oz or 1 tablespoonful to each person a very simple method of making coffee 1811 ingredientsallow 12 oz or 1 tablespoonful of coffee to each person to every oz allow 1 pint of water modehave a small iron ring made to fit the top of the coffeepot inside and to this ring sew a small muslin bag the muslin for the purpose must not be too thin fit the bag into the pot pour some boiling water in it and when the pot is well warmed put the ground coffee into the bag pour over as much boiling water as is required close the lid and when all the water has filtered through remove the bag and send the coffee to table making it in this manner prevents the necessity of pouring the coffee from one vessel to another which cools and spoils it the water should be poured on the coffee gradually so that the infusion may be stronger and the bag must be well made that none of the grounds may escape through the seams and so make the coffee thick and muddy sufficientallow 1 tablespoonful or 12 oz to each person illustration coffee the coffee plant grows to the height of about twelve or fifteen feet with leaves not unlike those of the common laurel although more pointed and not so dry and thick the blossoms are white much like those of jasmine and issue from the angles of the leafstalks when the flowers fade they are succeeded by the coffeebean or seed which is inclosed in a berry of a red colour when ripe resembling a cherry the coffeebeans are prepared by exposing them to the sun for a few days that the pulp may ferment and throw off a strong acidulous moisture they are then gradually dried for about three weeks and put into a mill to separate the husk from the seed cafe au lait 1812 this is merely very strong coffee added to a large proportion of good hot milk about 6 tablespoonfuls of strong coffee being quite sufficient for a breakfastcupful of milk of the essence no 1808 which answers admirably for cafe an lait so much would not be required this preparation is infinitely superior to the weak watery coffee so often served at english tables a little cream mixed with the milk if the latter cannot be depended on for richness improves the taste of the coffee as also the richness of the beverage sufficient6 tablespoonfuls of strong coffee or 2 tablespoonfuls of the essence to a breakfastcupful of milk tea and coffeeit is true says liebig that thousands have lived without a knowledge of tea and coffee and daily experience teaches us that under certain circumstances they may be dispensed with without disadvantage to the merely animal functions but it is an error certainly to conclude from this that they may be altogether dispensed with in reference to their effects and it is a question whether if we had no tea and no coffee the popular instinct would not seek for and discover the means of replacing them science which accuses us of so much in these respects will have in the first place to ascertain whether it depends on sensual and sinful inclinations merely that every people of the globe have appropriated some such means of acting on the nervous life from the shore of the pacific where the indian retires from life for days in order to enjoy the bliss of intoxication with koko to the arctic regions where kamtschatdales and koriakes prepare an intoxicating beverage from a poisonous mushroom we think it on the contrary highly probable not to say certain that the instinct of man feeling certain blanks certain wants of the intensified life of our times which cannot be satisfied or filled up by mere quantity has discovered in these products of vegetable life the true means of giving to his food the desired and necessary quality cafe noir 1813 this is usually handed round after dinner and should be drunk well sweetened with the addition of a little brandy or liqueurs which may be added or not at pleasure the coffee should be made very strong and served in very small cups but never mixed with milk or cream cafe noir may be made of the essence of coffee no 1808 by pouring a tablespoonful into each cup and filling it up with boiling water this is a very simple and expeditious manner of preparing coffee for a large party but the essence for it must be made very good and kept well corked until required for use to make tea 1814 there is very little art in making good tea if the water is boiling and there is no sparing of the fragrant leaf the beverage will almost invariably be good the oldfashioned plan of allowing a teaspoonful to each person and one over is still practised warm the teapot with boiling water let it remain for two or three minutes for the vessel to become thoroughly hot then pour it away put in the tea pour in from 12 to 34 pint of boiling water close the lid and let it stand for the tea to draw from 5 to 10 minutes then fill up the pot with water the tea will be quite spoiled unless made with water that is actually boiling as the leaves will not open and the flavour not be extracted from them the beverage will consequently be colourless and tastelessin fact nothing but tepid water where there is a very large party to make tea for it is a good plan to have two teapots instead of putting a large quantity of tea into one pot the tea besides will go farther when the infusion has been once completed the addition of fresh tea adds very little to the strength so when more is required have the pot emptied of the old leaves scalded and fresh tea made in the usual manner economists say that a few grains of carbonate of soda added before the boiling water is poured on the tea assist to draw out the goodness if the water is very hard perhaps it is a good plan as the soda softens it but care must be taken to use this ingredient sparingly as it is liable to give the tea a soapy taste if added in too large a quantity for mixed tea the usual proportion is four spoonfuls of black to one of green more of the latter when the flavour is very much liked but strong green tea is highly pernicious and should never be partaken of too freely time2 minutes to warm the

of the cask two or three times daily for three or four days to assist the melting of the sugar then paste a piece of linen cloth over the bunghole and set the cask in a warm place but not in the sun any corner of a warm kitchen is the best situation for it the following spring it should be drawn off into stone bottles and the vinegar will be fit for use twelve months after it is made this will be found a most excellent preparation greatly superior to much that is sold under the name of the best white wine vinegar many years experience has proved that pickle made with this vinegar will keep

of lump sugar modethis wine should be prepared from unripe gooseberries in order to avoid the flavour which the fruit would give to the wine when in a mature state its briskness depends more upon the time of bottling than upon the unripe state of the fruit for effervescing wine can be made from fruit that is ripe as well as that which is unripe the fruit should be selected when it has nearly attained its full growth and consequently before it shows any tendency to ripen any bruised or decayed berries and those that are very small should be rejected the blossom and stalk ends should be removed and the fruit well bruised in a tub or pan in such quantities as to insure each berry being broken without crushing the seeds pour the water which should be warm on the fruit squeeze and stir it with the hand until all the pulp is removed from the skin and seeds and cover the whole closely for 24 hours after which strain it through a coarse bag and press it with as much force as can be conveniently applied to extract the whole of the juice and liquor the fruit may contain to every 40 or 50 lbs of fruit one gallon more of hot water may be passed through the marc or husks in order to obtain any soluble matter that may remain and be again pressed the juice should be put into a tub or pan of sufficient size to contain all of it and the sugar added to it let it be well stirred until the sugar is dissolved and place the pan in a warm situation keep it closely covered and let it ferment for a day or two it must then be drawn off into clean casks placed a little on one side for the scum that arises to be thrown out and the casks kept filled with the remaining must that should be reserved for that purpose when the active fermentation has ceased the casks should be plugged upright again filled if necessary the bungs be put in loosely and after a few days when the fermentation is a little more languid which may be known by the hissing noise ceasing the bungs should be driven in tight and a spilehole made to give vent if necessary about november or december on a clear fine day the wine should he racked from its lees into clean casks which may be rinsed with brandy after a month it should be examined to see if it is sufficiently clear for bottling if not it must be fined with isinglass which may be dissolved in some of the wine 1 oz will be sufficient for 9 gallons in march or april or when the gooseberry bushes begin to blossom the wine must be bottled in order to insure its being effervescing seasonablemake this the end of may or beginning of june before the

designation of the particular district where they are made as lafitte latour c the clarets brought to the english market are frequently prepared for it by the winegrowers by mixing together several bordeaux wines or by adding to them a portion of some other wines but in france the pure wines are carefully preserved distinct the genuine wines of bordeaux are of great variety that part being one

class there is both red and white champagne and each of these may be either still or brisk there are the sparkling wines mousseux and the still wines nonmousseux the brisk are in general the most highly esteemed or at least are the most popular in this country on account of their delicate flavour and the agreeable pungency which they derive from the carbonic acid they contain and to which they

acids have the effect of destroying obesity but they also destroy health and freshness lemonade is of all acids the most harmless but few stomachs can resist it long i knew in 1776 at dijon a young lady of great beauty to whom i was attached by bonds of friendship great almost as those of love one day when she had for some time gradually grown pale and thin previously she had a slight embonpoint

ingredientsto every pint of wine allow 1 large cupful of water sugar and spice to taste modein making preparations like the above it is very difficult to give the exact proportions of ingredients like sugar and spice as what quantity might suit one person would be to another quite distasteful boil the spice in the water until the flavour is extracted then add the wine and sugar and bring the whole to the boilingpoint when serve with strips of crisp dry toast or with biscuits the spices usually used for mulled wine are cloves grated nutmeg and cinnamon or mace any kind of wine may be mulled but port and claret are those usually selected for the purpose and the latter requires a very large proportion of sugar the vessel that the wine is boiled in must be delicately clean and should be kept exclusively for the purpose small tin warmers may be purchased for a trifle which are more suitable than saucepans as if the latter are not scrupulously clean they will spoil the wine by imparting to it a very disagreeable flavour these warmers should be used for no other purposes to make hot punch 1839 ingredients12 pint of rum 12 pint of brandy 14 lb of sugar 1 large lemon 12 teaspoonful of

various spirituous liquors or wine hot water the acid juice of fruits and sugar it is considered to be very intoxicating but this is probably because the spirit being partly sheathed by the mucilaginous juice and the sugar its strength does not appear to the taste so great as it really is punch which was almost universally drunk among the middle classes about fifty or sixty years ago has almost disappeared from our domestic tables being superseded by wine there are many different varieties of punch it is sometimes kept cold in bottles and makes a most agreeable summer drink in scotland instead of the madeira or sherry generally used in its manufacture whiskey is substituted and then its insidious properties are more than usually felt where fresh lemons cannot be had for punch or similar beverages crystallized citric acid and a few drops of the essence of lemon will be very nearly the same thing in the composition of regents punch champagne brandy and veritable martinique are required norfolk punch requires seville oranges milk punch may be extemporized by adding a little hot milk to lemonade and then straining it through a jellybag then there are wine punch tea punch and french punch made with lemons spirits and wine in fantastic proportions but of all the compounds of these materials perhaps for a summer drink the northamerican mint julep is the most inviting captain marryat gives the following recipe for its preparationput into a tumbler about a dozen sprigs of the tender shoots of mint upon them put a spoonful of white sugar and equal proportions of peach and common brandy so as to fill up one third or perhaps a little less then take rasped or pounded ice and fill up the tumbler epicures rub the lips of the tumbler with a piece of fresh pineapple and the tumbler itself is very often encrusted outside with stalactites of ice as the ice melts you drink the virginians say captain marryat claim the merit of having invented this superb compound but from a passage in the comus of milton he claims it for his own country whiskey cordial 1840 ingredients1 lb of ripe white currants the rind of 2 lemons 14 oz of grated ginger 1

this in july illustration invalid cookery chapter xxxviii a few rules to be observed in cooking for invalids 1841 let all the kitchen utensils used in the preparation of invalids cookery be delicately and scrupulously clean if this is not the case a disagreeable flavour may be imparted to the preparation which flavour may disgust and prevent the patient from partaking of the refreshment when brought to him or her 1842 for invalids never make a large quantity of one thing as they seldom require much at a time and it is desirable that variety be provided for them 1843 always have something in readiness a little beef tea nicely made and nicely skimmed a few spoonfuls of jelly c c that it may be administered as soon almost as the invalid wishes for it if obliged to wait a long time the patient loses the desire to eat and often turns against the food when brought to him or her 1844 in sending dishes or preparations up to invalids let everything look as tempting as possible have a clean traycloth laid smoothly over the tray let the spoons tumblers cups and saucers c be very clean and bright gruel served in a tumbler is more appetizing than when served in a basin or cup and saucer 1845 as milk is an important article of food for the sick in warm weather let it be kept on ice to prevent its turning sour many other delicacies may also be preserved good in the same manner for some little time 1846 if the patient be allowed to eat vegetables never send them up undercooked or half raw and let a small quantity only be temptingly arranged on a dish this rule will apply to every preparation as an invalid is much more likely to enjoy his food if small delicate pieces are served to him 1847 never leave food about a sick room if the patient cannot eat it when brought to him take it away and bring it to him in an hour or twos time miss nightingale says to leave the patients untasted food by his side from meal to meal in hopes that he will eat it in the interval is simply to prevent him from taking any food at all she says i have known patients literally incapacitated from taking one article of food after another by this piece of ignorance let the food come at the right time and be taken away eaten or uneaten at the right time but never let a patient have something always standing by him if you dont wish to disgust him of everything 1848 never serve beef tea or broth with the smallest particle of fat or grease on the surface it is better after making either of these to allow them to get perfectly cold when all the fat may be easily removed then warm up as much as may be required two or three pieces of clean whitybrown paper laid on the broth will absorb any greasy particles that may be floating at the top as the grease will cling to the paper 1849 roast mutton chickens rabbits calves feet or head game fish simply dressed and simple puddings are all light food and easily digested of course these things are only partaken of supposing the patient is recovering 1850 a mutton chop nicely cut trimmed and broiled to a turn is a dish to be recommended for invalids but it must not be served with all the fat at the end nor must it be too thickly cut let it be cooked over a fire free from smoke and sent up with the gravy in it between two very hot plates nothing is more disagreeable to an invalid than smoked food 1851 in making toastandwater never blacken the bread but toast it only a nice brown never leave toastandwater to make until the moment it is required as it cannot then be properly preparedat least the patient will be obliged to drink it warm which is anything but agreeable 1852 in boiling eggs for invalids let the white be just set if boiled hard they will be likely to disagree with the patient 1853 in miss nightingales admirable notes on nursing a book that no mother or nurse should be without she saysyou cannot be too careful as to quality in sick diet a nurse should never put before a patient milk that is sour meat or soup that is turned an egg that is bad or vegetables underdone yet often she says she has seen these things brought in to the sick in a state perfectly perceptible to every nose or eye except the nurses it is here that the clever nurse appearsshe will not bring in the peccant article but not to disappoint the patient she will whip up something else in a few minutes remember that sick cookery should half do the work of your poor patients weak digestion 1854 she goes on to caution nurses by sayingtake care not to spill into your patients saucer in other words take care

xxxix to make arrowroot 1855 ingredientstwo teaspoonfuls of arrowroot 3 tablespoonfuls of cold water 12 pint of boiling water modemix the arrowroot smoothly in a basin with the cold water then pour on it the boiling water stirring all the time the water must be boiling at the time it is poured on the mixture or it will not thicken if mixed with hot water only it must be put into a clean saucepan and boiled until it thickens but this is more trouble and quite unnecessary if the water is boiling at first put the arrowroot into a tumbler sweeten it with lump sugar and flavour it with grated nutmeg or cinnamon or a piece of lemonpeel or when allowed 3 tablespoonfuls of port or sherry as arrowroot is in itself flavourless and insipid it is almost necessary to add the wine to make it palatable arrowroot made with milk instead of water is far nicer but is not so easily digested it should be mixed in the same manner with 3 tablespoonfuls of cold water the boiling milk then poured on it and well stirred when made in this manner no wine should be added but merely sugar and a little grated nutmeg or lemonpeel timeif obliged to be boiled 2 minutes average cost 2d per pint sufficient to make 12 pint of arrowroot miss nightingale says in her notes on nursing that arrowroot is a grand dependence of the nurse as a vehicle for wine and as a restorative quickly prepared it is all very

a cool place when wanted for use remove every particle of fat from the top warm up as much as may be required adding if necessary a little more salt this preparation is simple beef tea and is to be administered to those invalids to whom flavourings and seasonings are not allowed when the patient is very low use double the quantity of meat to the same proportion of water should the invalid be able to take the tea prepared in a more palatable manner it is easy to make it so by following the directions in the next recipe which is an admirable one for making savoury beef tea beef tea is always better when made the day before it is wanted and then warmed up it is a good plan to put the tea into a small cup or basin and to place this basin in a saucepan of boiling water when the tea is warm it is ready to serve time14 to 34 hour average cost 6d per pint sufficientallow 1 lb of meat for a pint of good beef tea miss nightingale says one of the most common errors among nurses with respect to sick diet is the belief that beef tea is the most nutritive of all article she says just try and boil down a lb of beef into beef tea evaporate your beef tea and see what is left of your beef you will find that there is barely a teaspoonful of solid nourishment to 14 pint of water in beef tea nevertheless there is a certain reparative quality in itwe do not know whatas there is in tea but it maybe safely given in almost any inflammatory disease and is as little to be depended upon with the healthy or convalescent where much nourishment is required savoury beef tea soyers recipe

boiled a little longer and pounded with spices c for potting it makes a very nice breakfast dish dr christison says that every one will be struck with the readiness with which certain classes of patients will often take diluted meat juice or beef tea repeatedly when they refuse all other kinds of food this is particularly remarkable in case of gastric fever in which he says little or nothing else besides beef tea or diluted meat juice has been taken for weeks or even months and yet a pint of beef tea contains scarcely 14 oz of anything but water the result is so striking that he asks what is its mode of action not simple nutriment 14 oz of the most nutritive material cannot nearly replace the daily wear and tear of the tissue in any circumstances possibly he says it belongs to a new denomination of remedies baked beef tea 1860 ingredients1 lb of fleshy beef 112 pint of water 14 saltspoonful of salt modecut the beef into small square pieces after trimming off all the fat and put it into a bakingjar with the above proportion of water and salt cover the jar well place it in a warm but not hot oven and bake for 3 or 4 hours when the oven is very fierce in the daytime it is a

to digest it with a flavouring of herbs c it may be made in the same manner as beef tea with water and salt only but the preparation will be but tasteless and insipid when the invalid cannot digest

breakfastcupful of coffee our great nurse miss nightingale remarks that a great deal too much against tea is said by wise people and a great deal too much of tea is given to the sick by foolish people when you see the natural and almost universal craving in english sick for their tea you cannot but feel that nature knows what she is about but a little tea or coffee restores them quite as much as a great deal and a great deal of tea and especially of coffee impairs the little power of digestion they have yet a nurse because she sees how one or two cups of tea or coffee restore her patient thinks that three or four cups will do twice as much this is not the case at all it is however certain that there is nothing yet discovered which is a substitute to the english patient for his cup of tea he can take it when he can take nothing else and he often cant take anything else if he has it not coffee is a better restorative than tea but a greater impairer of the digestion in making coffee it is absolutely necessary to buy it in the berry and grind it at home otherwise you may reckon upon its containing a certain amount of chicory at least this is not a question of the taste or of the wholesomeness of chicory it is that chicory has nothing at all of the properties for which you give coffee and therefore you may as well not give it the invalids cutlet 1865 ingredients1 nice cutlet

which has been previously scalded pearl barley or rice are very nice additions to mutton broth and should be boiled as long as the other ingredients when either of these is added the broth must not be strained but merely thoroughly skimmed plain mutton broth without seasoning is made by merely boiling the mutton water and salt together straining it letting the broth cool skimming all the fat off

seasoning of pepper and salt this sandwich may be varied by adding a little pulled meat or very fine slices of cold meat to the toast and in any of these forms will be found very tempting to the appetite of an invalid 1878 besides the recipes contained in this chapter there are in the previous chapters on cookery many others suitable for invalids which it would be useless to repeat here recipes for fish simply dressed light soups plain roast meat welldressed vegetables poultry simple puddings jelly stewed fruits c c all of which dishes may be partaken of by invalids and convalescents will be found in preceding chapters dinners and dining chapter xl 1879 man it has been said is a dining animal creatures of the inferior races eat and drink man only dines it has also been said that he is a cooking animal but some races eat food without cooking it a croat captain said to m brillat savarin when in campaign we feel hungry we knock over the first animal we find cut off a steak powder it with salt put it under the saddle gallop over it for half a mile and then eat it huntsmen in dauphiny when out shooting have been known to kill a bird pluck it salt and pepper it and cook it by carrying it some time in their caps it is equally true that some races of men do not dine any more than the tiger or the vulture it is not a dinner at which sits the aboriginal australian who gnaws his bone half bare and then flings it behind to his squaw and the native of terradelfuego does not dine when he gets his morsel of red clay dining is the privilege of civilization the rank which a people occupy in the grand scale may be measured by their way of taking their meals as well as by their way of treating their women the nation which knows how to dine has learnt the leading lesson of progress it implies both the will and the skill to reduce to order and surround with idealisms and graces the more material conditions of human existence and wherever that will and that skill exist life cannot be wholly ignoble 1880 dinner being the grand solid meal of the day is a matter of considerable importance and a wellserved table is a striking index of human ingenuity and resource their table says lord byron in describing a dinnerparty given by lord and lady amundevillo at norman abbey their table was a board to tempt even ghosts to pass the styx for more substantial feasts i will not dwell upon ragouts or roasts albeit all human history attests that happiness for manthe hungry sinner since eve ate apples much depends on dinner and then he goes on to observe upon the curious complexity of the results produced by human cleverness and application catering for the modifications which occur in civilized life one of the simplest of the primal instincts the mind is lost in mighty contemplation of intellect expended on two courses and indigestions grand multiplication requires arithmetic beyond my forces who would suppose from adams simple ration that cookery could have calld forth such resources as form a science and a nomenclature from out the commonest demands of nature and we may well say who indeed would suppose it the gulf between the croat with a steak under his saddle and alexis soyer getting up a great dinner at the reformclub or even thackerays mrs raymond gray giving a little dinner to mr snob with one of those famous rolypoly puddings of herswhat a gulf it is 1881 that adams ration however was simple is a matter on which we have contrary judgments given by the poets when raphael paid that memorable visit to paradisewhich we are expressly told by milton he did exactly at dinnertimeeve seems to have prepared a little dinner not wholly destitute of complexity and to have added icecreams and perfumes nothing can be clearer than the testimony of the poet on these points and eve within due at her home prepared for dinner savoury fruits of taste to please true appetite and not disrelish thirst of nectarous draughts between with dispatchful looks in haste she turns on hospitable thoughts intent what choice to choose for delicacy best what order so contrived as not to mix tastes not well joind inelegant but bring taste after taste upheld with kindliest change she tempers dulcet creams then strews the ground with rose and odours it may be observed in passing that the poets though they have more to say about wine than solid food because the former more directly stimulates the intellect and the feelings do not flinch from the subject of eating and drinking there is infinite zest in the above passage from milton and even more in the famous description of a dainty supper given by keats in his eve of saint agnes could queen mab herself desire to sit down to anything nicer both as to its appointments and serving and as to its quality than the collation served by porphyro in the ladys bedroom while she slept there by the bedside where the faded moon made a dim silver twilight soft he set a table and halfanguishd threw thereor a cloth of woven crimson gold and jet while he from forth the closet brought a heap of candied apple quince and plum and gourd with jellies smoother than the creamy curd and lucent syrups tinct with cinnamon manna and dates in argosy transferrd from fez and spiced dainties every one from silken samarcand to cedard lebanon but tennyson has ventured beyond dates and quinces and syrups which may be thought easy to be brought in by a poet in his idyl of audley court he gives a most appetizing description of a pasty at a picnic there on a slope of orchard francis laid a damask napkin wrought with horse and hound brought out a dusky loaf that smelt of home and half cut down a pasty costly made where quail and pigeon lark and leveret lay like fossils of the rock with golden yolks imbedded and injellied we gladly quote passages like these to show how eating and drinking may be surrounded with poetical associations and how man using his privilege to turn any and every repast into a feast of reason with a warm and plentiful flow of soul may really count it as not the least of his legitimate prides that he is a dining animal 1882 it has been said indeed that great men in general are great diners this however can scarcely be true of any great men but men of action and in that case it would simply imply that persons of vigorous constitution who work hard eat heartily for of course a life of action requires a vigorous constitution even though there may be much illness as in such cases as william iii and our brave general napier of men of thought it can scarcely be true that they eat so much in a general way though even they eat more than they are apt to suppose they do for as mr lewes observes nervetissue is very expensive leaving great men of all kinds however to get their own dinners let us who are not great look after ours dine we must and we may as well dine elegantly as well as wholesomely 1883 there are plenty of elegant dinners in modern days and they were not wanting in ancient times it is well known that the dinnerparty or symposium was a not unimportant and not unpoetical feature in the life of the sociable talkative tasteful greek douglas jerrold said that such is the british humour for dining and giving of dinners that if london were to be destroyed by an earthquake the londoners would meet at a public dinner to consider the subject the greeks too were great diners their social and religious polity gave them many chances of being merry and making others merry on good eating and drinking any public or even domestic sacrifice to one of the gods was sure to be followed by a dinnerparty the remains of the slaughtered offering being served up on the occasion as a pious pice de rsistance and as the different gods goddesses and demigods worshipped by the community in general or by individuals were very numerous indeed and some very religious people never let a day pass without offering up something or other the dinnerparties were countless a birthday too was an excuse for a dinner a birthday that is of any person long dead and buried as well as of a living person being a member of the family or otherwise esteemed dinners were of course eaten on all occasions of public rejoicing then among the young people subscription dinners very much after the manner of modern times were always being got up only that they would be eaten not at an hotel but probably at the house of one of the heterae a greek dinnerparty was a handsome wellregulated affair the guests came in elegantly dressed and crowned with flowers a slave approaching each person as he entered took off his sandals and washed his feet during the repast the guests reclined on couches with pillows among and along which were set small tables after the solid meal came the symposium proper a scene of music merriment and dancing the two latter being supplied chiefly by young girls there was a chairman or symposiarch appointed by the company to regulate the drinking and it was his duty to mix the wine in the mighty bowl from this bowl the attendants ladled the liquor into goblets and with the goblets went round and round the tables filling the cups of the guests 1884 the elegance with which a dinner is served is a matter which depends of course partly upon the means but still more upon the taste of the master and mistress of the house it may be observed in general that there should always be flowers on the table and as they form no item of expense there is no reason why they should not be employed every day 1885 the variety in the dishes which furnish forth a modern dinnertable does not necessarily imply anything unwholesome or anything capricious food that is not well relished cannot be well digested and the appetite of the overworked man of business or statesman or of any dweller in towns whose occupations are exciting and exhausting is jaded and requires stimulation men and women who are in rude health and who have plenty of air and exercise eat the simplest food with relish and consequently digest it well but those conditions are out of the reach of many men they must suit their mode of dining to their mode of living if they cannot choose the latter it is in serving up food that is at once appetizing and wholesome that the skill of the modern housewife is severely tasked and she has scarcely a more important duty to fulfil it is in fact her particular vocation in virtue of which she may be said to hold the health of the family and of the friends of the family in her hands from day to day it has been said that the destiny of nations depends on the manner in which they are fed and a great gastronomist exclaims tell me what kind of food you eat and i will tell you what kind of man you are the same writer has some sentences of the same kind which are rather hyperbolical but worth quotingthe pleasures of the table belong to all ages to all conditions to all countries and to all eras they mingle with all other pleasures and remain at last to console us for their departure the discovery of a new dish confers more happiness upon humanity than the discovery of a new star 1886 the gastronomist from whom we have already quoted has some aphorisms and short directions in relation to dinnerparties which are well deserving of noticelet the number of your guests never exceed twelve so that the conversation may be general footnote we have seen this varied by saying that the number should never exceed that of the muses or fall below that of the graces let the temperature of the diningroom be about 68 let the dishes be few in number in the first course but proportionally good the order of food is from the most substantial to the lightest the order of drinking wine is from the mildest to the most foamy and most perfumed to invite a person to your house is to take charge of his happiness so long as he is beneath your roof the mistress of the house should always be certain

small establishments a large number of servants being required to carve and to help the guests besides there being a necessity for more plates dishes knives forks and spoons than are usually to be found in any other than a very large establishment where however a service la russe is practicable there it perhaps no mode of serving a dinner so enjoyable as this suppers 2139 much may be done in the arrangement of a suppertable at a very small expense provided taste and ingenuity are exercised the colours and flavours of the various dishes should contrast nicely there should be plenty of fruit and flowers on the table and the room should be well lighted we have endeavoured to show how the various dishes may be placed but of course these little matters entirely depend on the length and width of the table used on individual taste whether the tables are arranged round the room whether down the centre with a cross one at the top or whether the supper is laid in two separate rooms c c the garnishing of the dishes has also much to do with the appearance of a suppertable hams and tongues should be ornamented with cut vegetable flowers raised pies with aspic jelly cut in dice and all the dishes garnished sufficiently to be in good taste without looking absurd the eye in fact should be as much gratified as the palate hot soup is now often served at suppers but is not placed on the table the servants fill the plates from a tureen on the buffet and then hand them to the guests when these plates are removed the business of supper commences 2140 where small rooms and large parties necessitate having a standing supper many things enumerated in the following bill of fare may be placed on the buffet dishes for these suppers should be selected which may be eaten standing without any trouble the following list may perhaps assist our readers in the arrangement of a buffet for a standing supper 2141 beef ham and tongue sandwiches lobster and oyster patties sausage rolls meat

dishes of a sort come together this bill of fare may be made to answer three or four purposes placing a wedding cake or christening cake in the centre on a high stand if required for either of these occasions a few dishes of fowls lobster salads c c should be kept in reserve to replenish those that are most likely to be eaten first a joint of cold roast and boiled beef should be placed on the buffet as being something substantial for the gentlemen of the party to partake of besides the articles enumerated in the bill of fare biscuits and wafers will be required creamandwater ices tea coffee wines liqueurs sodawater gingerbeer and lemonade breakfasts 2144 it will not be necessary to give here a long bill of fare of cold joints c which may be placed on the sideboard and do duty at the breakfasttable suffice it to say that any cold meat the larder may furnish should be nicely garnished and be placed on the buffet collared and potted meats or fish cold game or poultry vealandham pies gameandrumpsteak pies are all suitable dishes for the breakfasttable as also cold ham tongue c c 2145 the following list of hot dishes may perhaps assist our readers in knowing what to provide

rashers of bacon bacon and poached eggs ham and poached eggs omelets plain boiled eggs oeufsauplat poached eggs on toast muffins toast marmalade butter c c 2146 in the summer and when they are obtainable always have a vase of freshlygathered flowers on the breakfasttable and when convenient a nicelyarranged dish of fruit when strawberries are in season these are particularly refreshing as also grapes or even currants luncheons and suppers 2147 the remains of cold joints nicely garnished a few sweets or a little hashed meat poultry or game are the usual articles placed on the table for luncheon with bread and cheese biscuits butter c if a substantial meal is desired rumpsteaks or mutton chops may he served as also veal cutlets kidneys or any dish of that kind in families where there is a nursery the mistress of the house often partakes of the meal with the children and makes it her luncheon in the summer a few dishes of fresh fruit should be added to the luncheon or instead of this a compote of fruit or fruit tart or pudding 2148 of suppers we have little to say as we have already given two bills of fare for a large party which will answer very well for a smaller number by reducing the quantity of dishes and by omitting a few hot suppers are now very little in request as people now generally dine at an hour which precludes the possibility of requiring supper at all events not one of a substantial kind should however a bill of fare be required one of those under the head of dinners with slight alterations will be found to answer for a hot supper bill of fare for

bottles of claret champagne discrtion and any other light wine that may be preferred and 2 bottles of brandy water can usually be obtained so it is useless to take it domestic servants chapter xli 2153 it is the custom of society to abuse its servantsa faon de parler such as leads their lords and masters to talk of the weather and when rurally inclined of the cropsleads matronly ladies and ladies just entering on their probation in that honoured and honourable state to talk of servants and as we are told wax eloquent over the greatest plague in life while taking a quiet cup of tea young men at their clubs also we are told like to abuse their fellows perhaps not without a certain pride and pleasure at the opportunity of intimating that they enjoy such appendages to their state it is another conviction of society that the race of good servants has died out at least in england although they do order these things better in france that there is neither honesty conscientiousness nor the careful and industrious habits which distinguished the servants of our grandmothers and greatgrandmothers that domestics no longer know their place that the introduction of cheap silks and cottons and still more recently those ambiguous materials and tweeds have removed the landmarks between the mistress and her maid between the master and his man 2154 when the distinction really depends on things so insignificant this is very probably the case when the lady of fashion chooses her footman without any other consideration than his height shape and tournure of his calf it is not surprising that she should find a domestic who has no attachment for the family who considers the figure he cuts behind her carriage and the late hours he is compelled to keep a full compensation for the wages he exacts for the food he wastes and for the perquisites he can lay his hands on nor should the fast young man who chooses his groom for his knowingness in the ways of the turf and in the tricks of low horsedealers be surprised if he is sometimes the victim of these learned ways but these are the exceptional cases which prove the existence of a better state of things the great masses of society among us are not thus deserted there are few families of respectability from the shopkeeper in the next street to the nobleman whose mansion dignifies the next square which do not contain among their dependents attached and useful servants and where these are absent altogether there are good reasons for it the sensible master and the kind mistress know that if servants depend on them for their means of living in their turn they are dependent on their servants for very many of the comforts of life and that with a proper amount of care in choosing servants and treating them like reasonable beings and making slight excuses for the shortcomings of human nature they will save in some exceptional case be tolerably well served and in most instances surround themselves with attached domestics 2155 this remark which is applicable to all domestics is especially so to menservants families accustomed to such attendants have always about them humble dependents whose children have no other prospect than domestic service to look forward to to them it presents no degradation but the reverse to be so employed they are initiated step by step into the mysteries of the household with the prospect of rising in the service if it is a house admitting of promotionto the respectable position of butler or housesteward in families of humbler pretensions where they must look for promotion elsewhere they know that can only be attained by acquiring the goodwill of their employers can there be any stronger security for their good conductany doubt that in the mass of domestic servants good conduct is the rule the reverse the exception 2156 the number of the male domestics in a family varies according to the wealth and position of the master from the owner of the ducal mansion with a retinue of attendants at the head of which is the chamberlain and housesteward to the occupier of the humbler house where a single footman or even the odd manofallwork is the only male retainer the majority of gentlemens establishments probably comprise a servant out of livery or butler a footman and coachman or coachman and groom where the horses exceed two or three duties of the butler 2157 the domestic duties of the butler are to bring in the eatables at breakfast and wait upon the family at that meal assisted by the footman and see to the cleanliness of everything at table on taking away he removes the tray with the china and plate for which he is responsible at luncheon he arranges the meal and waits unassisted the footman being now engaged in other duties at dinner he places the silver and plated articles on the table sees that everything is in its place and rectifies what is wrong he carries in the first dish and announces in the drawingroom that dinner is on the table and respectfully stands by the door until the company are seated when he takes his place behind his masters chair on the left to remove the covers handing them to the other attendants to carry out after the first course of plates is supplied his place is at the sideboard to serve the wines but only when called on 2158 the first course ended he rings the cooks bell and hands the dishes from the table to the other servants to carry away receiving from them the second course which he places on the table removing the covers as before and again taking his place at the sideboard 2159 at dessert the slips being removed the butler receives the dessert from the other servants and arranges it on the table with plates and glasses and then takes his place behind his masters chair to hand the wines and ices while the footman stands behind his mistress for the same purpose the other attendants leaving the room where the oldfashioned practice of having the dessert on the polished table without any cloth is still adhered to the butler should rub off any marks made by the hot dishes before arranging the dessert 2160 before dinner he has satisfied himself that the lamps candles or gasburners are in perfect order if not lighted which will usually be the case having served every one with their share of the dessert put the fires in order when these are used and seen the lights are all right at a signal from his master he and the footman leave the room 2161 he now proceeds to the drawingroom arranges the fireplace and sees to the lights he then returns to his pantry prepared to answer the bell and attend to the company while the footman is clearing away and cleaning the plate and glasses 2162 at tea he again attends at bedtime he appears with the candles he locks up the plate secures doors and windows and sees that all the fires are safe 2163 in addition to these duties the butler where only one footman is kept will be required to perform some of the duties of the valet to pay bills and superintend the other servants but the real duties of the butler are in the winecellar there he should be competent to advise his master as to the price and quality of the wine to be laid in fine bottle cork and seal it and place it in the binns brewing racking and bottling malt liquors belong to his office as well as their distribution these and other drinkables are brought from the cellar every day by his own hands except where an underbutler is kept and a careful entry of every bottle used entered in the cellarbook so that the book should always show the contents of the cellar 2164 the office of butler is thus one of very great trust in a household here as elsewhere honesty is the best policy the butler should make it his business to understand the proper treatment of the different wines under his charge which he can easily do from the winemerchant and faithfully attend to it his own reputation will soon compensate for the absence of bribes from unprincipled winemerchants if he serves a generous and hospitable master nothing spreads more rapidly in society than the reputation of a good winecellar and all that is required is wines well chosen and well cared for and this a little knowledge carefully applied will soon supply 2165 the butler we have said has charge of the contents of the cellars and it is his duty to keep them in a proper condition to fine down wine in wood bottle it off and store it away in places suited to the sorts where wine comes into the cellar ready bottled it is usual to return the same number of empty bottles the butler has not in this case the same inducements to keep the bottles of the different sorts separated but where the wine is bottled in the house he will find his account not only in keeping them separate but in rinsing them well and even washing them with clean water as soon as they are empty 2166 there are various modes of fining wine isinglass gelatine and gum arabic are all used for the purpose whichever of these articles is used the process is always the same supposing eggs the cheapest to be useddraw a gallon or so of the wine and mix one quart of it with the whites of four eggs by stirring it with a whisk afterwards when thoroughly mixed pour it back into the cask through the bunghole and stir up the whole cask in a rotatory direction with a clean split stick inserted through the bunghole having stirred it sufficiently pour in the remainder of the wine drawn off until the cask is full then stir again skimming off the bubbles that rise to the surface when thoroughly mixed by stirring close the bunghole and leave it to stand for three or four days this quantity of clarified wine will fine thirteen dozen of port or sherry the other clearing ingredients are applied in the same manner the material being cut into small pieces and dissolved in the quart of wine and the cask stirred in the same manner 2167 to bottle winehaving thoroughly washed and dried the bottles supposing they have been before used for the same kind of wine provide corks which will be improved by being slightly boiled or at least steeped in hot watera wooden hammer or mallet a bottlingboot and a squeezer for the corks bore a hole in the lower part of the cask with a gimlet receiving the liquid stream which follows in the bottle and filterer which is placed in a tub or basin this operation is best performed by two persons one to draw the wine the other to cork the bottles the drawer is to see that the bottles are up to the mark but not too full the bottle being placed in a clean tub to prevent waste the corkingboot is buckled by a strap to the knee the bottle placed in it and the cork after being squeezed in the press driven in by a flat wooden mallet 2168 as the wine draws near to the bottom of the cask a thick piece of muslin is placed in the strainer to prevent the viscous grounds from passing into the bottle 2169 having carefully counted the bottles they are stored away in their respective binns a layer of sand or sawdust being placed under the first tier and another over it a second tier is laid over this protected by a lath the head of the second being laid to the bottom of the first over this another bed of sawdust is laid not too thick another lath and so on till the binn is filled 2170 wine so laid in will be ready for use according to its quality and age port wine old in the wood will be ready to drink in five or six months but if it is a fruity wine it will improve every year sherry if of good quality will be fit to drink as soon as the sickness as its first condition after bottling is called ceases and will also improve but the cellar must be kept at a perfectly steady temperature neither too hot nor too cold but about 55 or 60 and absolutely free from draughts of cold air duties of the footman 2171 where a single footman or odd man is the only male servant then whatever his ostensible position he is required to make himself generally useful he has to clean the knives and shoes the furniture the plate answer the visitors who call the drawingroom and parlour bells and do all the errands his life is no sinecure and a methodical arrangement of his time will be necessary in order to perform his many duties with any satisfaction to himself or his master 2172 the footman only finds himself in stockings shoes and washing where silk stockings or other extra articles of linen are worn they are found by the family as well as his livery a working dress consisting of a pair of overalls a waistcoat a fustian jacket with a white or jean one for times when he is liable to be called to answer the door or wait at breakfast and on quitting his service he is expected to leave behind him any livery had within six months 2173 the footman is expected to rise early in order to get through all his dirty work before the family are stirring boots and shoes and knives and forks should be cleaned lamps in use trimmed his masters clothes brushed the furniture rubbed over so that he may put aside his working dress tidy himself and appear in a clean jean jacket to lay the cloth and prepare breakfast for the family 2174 we need hardly dwell on the bootcleaning process three good brushes and good blacking must be provided one of the brushes hard to brush off the mud the other soft to lay on the blacking the third of a medium hardness for polishing and each should be kept for its particular use the blacking should be kept corked up except when in use and applied to the brush with a sponge tied to a stick which when put away rests in a notch cut in the cork when boots come in very muddy it is a good practice to wash off the mud and wipe them dry with a sponge then leave them to dry very gradually on their sides taking care they are not placed near the fire or scorched much delicacy of treatment is required in cleaning ladies boots so as to make the leather look wellpolished and the upper part retain a fresh appearance with the lining free from handmarks which are very offensive to a lady of refined tastes 2175 patent leather boots require to be wiped with a wet sponge and afterwards with a soft dry cloth and occasionally with a soft cloth and sweet oil blacking and polishing the edge of the soles in the usual way but so as not to cover the patent polish with blacking a little milk may also be used with very good effect for patent leather boots 2176 top boots are still occasionally worn by gentlemen while cleaning the lower part in the usual manner protect the tops by inserting a cloth or brown paper under the edges and bringing it over them in cleaning the tops let the covering fall down over the boot wash the tops clean with soap and flannel and rub out any spots with pumicestone if the tops are to be whiter dissolve an ounce of oxalic acid and half an ounce of pumicestone in a pint of soft water if a brown colour is intended mix an ounce of muriatic acid half an ounce of alum half an ounce of gum arabic and half an ounce of spirit of lavender in a pint and a half of skimmed milk turned these mixtures apply by means of a sponge and polish when dry with a rubber made of soft flannel 2177 knives are now generally cleaned by means of kents or masterss machine which gives very little trouble and is very effective before however putting the knives into the machine it is highly necessary that they be first washed in a little warm not hot water and then thoroughly wiped if put into the machine with any grease on them it adheres to the brushes and consequently renders them unfit to use for the next knives that may be put in when this precaution is not taken the machine must come to pieces so causing an immense amount of trouble which may all be avoided by having the knives thoroughly free from grease before using the machine brushes are also used for cleaning forks which facilitate the operation when knives are so cleaned see that they are carefully polished wiped and with a good edge the ferules and prongs free from dirt and place them in the basket with the handles all one way 2178 lamptrimming requires a thorough acquaintance with the mechanism after that constant attention to cleanliness and an occasional entire clearing out with hot water when this is done all the parts should be carefully dried before filling again with oil when lacquered wipe the lacquered parts with a soft brush and cloth and wash occasionally with weak soapsuds wiping carefully afterwards brass lamps may be cleaned with oil and rottenstone every day when trimmed with bronze and other ornamental lamps more care will be required and soft flannel and oil only used to prevent the removal of the bronze or enamel brasswork or any metalwork not lacquered is cleaned by a little oil and rottenstone made into a paste or with fine emerypowder and oil mixed in the same manner a small portion of sal ammoniac beat into a fine powder and moistened with soft water rubbed over brass ornaments and heated over a charcoal fire and rubbed dry with bran or whitening will give to brasswork the brilliancy of gold in trimming moderator lamps let the wick be cut evenly all round as if left higher in one place than it is in another it will cause it to smoke and burn badly the lamp should then be filled with oil from a feeder and afterwards well wiped with a cloth or rag kept for the purpose if it can be avoided never wash the chimneys of a lamp as it causes them to crack when they become hot small sticks covered with washleather pads are the best things to use for cleaning the glasses inside and a clean duster for polishing the outside the globe of a moderator lamp should be occasionally washed in warm soapandwater then well rinsed in cold water and either wiped dry or left to drain where candlelamps are used take out the springs occasionally and free them well from the grease that adheres to them 2179 french polish so universally applied to furniture is easily kept in condition by dusting and rubbing with a soft cloth or a rubber of old silk but diningtables can only be kept in order by hard rubbing or rather by quick rubbing which warms the wood and removes all spots 2180 brushing clothes is a very simple but very necessary operation fine cloths require to be brushed lightly and with rather a soft brush except where mud is to be removed when a hard one is necessary being previously beaten lightly to dislodge the dirt lay the garment on a table and brush it in the direction of the nap having brushed it properly turn the sleeves back to the collar so that the folds may come at the elbowjoints next turn the lappels or sides back over the folded sleeves then lay the skirts over level with the collar so that the crease may fall about the centre and double one half over the other so as the fold comes in the centre of the back 2181 having got through his dirty work the single footman has now to clean himself and prepare the breakfast he lays the cloth on the table over it the breakfastcloth and sets the breakfast things in order and then proceeds to wait upon his master if he has any of the duties of a valet to perform 2182 where a valet is not kept a portion of his duties falls to the footmans sharebrushing the clothes among others when the hat is silk it requires brushing every day with a soft brush after rain it requires wiping the way of the nap before drying and when nearly dry brushing with the soft brush and with the hatstick in it if the footman is required to perform any part of a valets duties he will have to see that the housemaid lights a fire in the dressingroom in due time that the room is dusted and cleaned that the washhandewer is filled with soft water and that the bath whether hot or cold is ready when required that towels are at hand that hairbrushes and combs are properly cleansed and in their places that hot water is ready at the hour ordered the dressinggown and slippers in their place the clean linen aired and the clothes to be worn for the day in their proper places after the master has dressed it will be the footmans duty to restore everything to its place properly cleansed and dry and the whole restored to order 2183 at breakfast when there is no butler the footman carries up the teaurn and assisted by the housemaid he waits during breakfast breakfast over he removes the tray and other things off the table folds up the breakfastcloth and sets the room in order by sweeping up all crumbs shaking the cloth and laying it on the table again making up the fire and sweeping up the hearth 2184 at luncheontime nearly the same routine is observed except where the footman is either out with the carriage or away on other business when in the absence of any butler the housemaid must assist 2185 for dinner the footman lays the cloth taking care that the table is not too near the fire if there is one and that passageroom is left a tablecloth should be laid without a wrinkle and this requires two persons over this the slips are laid which are usually removed preparatory to placing dessert on the table he prepares knives forks and glasses with five or six plates for each person this done he places chairs enough for the party distributing them equally on each side of the table and opposite to each a napkin neatly folded within it a piece of bread or small roll and a knife on the right side of each plate a fork on the left and a carvingknife and fork at the top and bottom of the table outside the others with the rests opposite to them and a gravyspoon beside the knife the fishslice should be at the top where the lady of the house with the assistance of the gentleman next to her divides the fish and the soupladle at the bottom it is sometimes usual to add a dessertknife and fork at the same time on the right side also of each plate put a wineglass for as many kinds of wine as it is intended to hand round and a fingerglass or glasscooler about four inches from the edge the latter are frequently put on the table with the dessert 2186 about half an hour before dinner he rings the dinnerbell where that is the practice and occupies himself with carrying up everything he is likely to require at the expiration of the time having communicated with the cook he rings the real dinnerbell and proceeds to take it up with such assistance as he can obtain having ascertained that all is in order that his own dress is clean and presentable and his white cotton gloves are without a stain he announces in the drawingroom that dinner is served and stands respectfully by the door until the company are seated he places himself on the left behind his master who is to distribute the soup where soup and fish are served together his place will be at his mistresss left hand but he must be on the alert to see that whoever is assisting him whether male or female are at their posts if any of the guests has brought his own servant with him his place is behind his masters chair rendering such assistance to others as he can while attending to his masters wants throughout the dinner so that every guest has what he requires this necessitates both activity and intelligence and should be done without bustle without asking any questions except where it is the custom of the house to hand round dishes or wine when it will be necessary to mention in a quiet and unobtrusive manner the dish or wine you present 2187 saltcellars should be placed on the table in number sufficient for the guests so that each may help themselves or at least their immediate neighbours dinners la russe 2188 in some houses the table is laid out with plate and glass and ornamented with flowers the dessert only being placed on the table the dinner itself being placed on the sideboard and handed round in succession in courses of soup fish entries meat game and sweets this is not only elegant but economical as fewer dishes are required the symmetry of the table being made up with the ornaments and dessert the various dishes are also handed round when hot but it involves additional and superior attendance as the wines are also handed round and unless the servants are very active and intelligent many blunders are likely to be made see p 954 general observations 2189 while attentive to all the footman should be obtrusive to none he should give nothing but on a waiter and always hand it with the left hand and on the left side of the person he serves and hold it so that the guest may take it with ease in lifting dishes from the table he should use both hands and remove them with care so that nothing is spilt on the tablecloth or on the dresses of the guests 2190 masters as well as servants sometimes make mistakes but it is not expected that a servant will correct any omissions even if he should have time to notice them although with the best intentions thus it would not be correct for instance if he observed that his master took wine with the ladies all round as some gentlemen still continue to do but stopped at some oneto nudge him on the shoulder and say as was done by the servant of a scottish gentleman what ails you at her in the green gown it will be better to leave the lady unnoticed than for the servant thus to turn his master into ridicule 2191 during dinner each persons knife fork plate and spoon should be changed as soon as he has done with it the vegetables and sauces belonging to the different dishes presented without remark to the guests and the footman should tread lightly in moving round and if possible should bear in mind if there is a wit or humorist of the party whose good things keep the table in a roar that they are not expected to reach his ears 2192 in opening wine let it be done quietly and without shaking the bottle if crusted let it be inclined to the crusted side and decanted while in that position in opening champagne it is not necessary to discharge it with a pop properly cooled the cork is easily extracted without an explosion when the cork is out the mouth of the bottle should be wiped with the napkin over the footmans arm 2193 at the end of the first course notice is conveyed to the cook who is waiting to send up the second which is introduced in the same way as before the attendants who remove the fragments carrying the dishes from the kitchen and handing them to the footman or butler whose duty it is to arrange them on the table after dinner the dessertglasses and wines are placed on the table by the footman who places himself behind his masters chair to supply wine and hand round the ices and other refreshments all other servants leaving the room 2194 as soon as the drawingroom bell rings for tea the footman enters with the tray which has been previously prepared hands the tray round to the company with cream and sugar the tea and coffee being generally poured out while another attendant hands cakes toast or biscuits if it is an ordinary family party where this social meal is prepared by the mistress he carries the urn or kettle as the case may be hands round the toast or such other eatable as may be required removing the whole in the same manner when tea is over 2195 after each meal the footmans place is in his pantry here perfect order should prevaila place for everything and everything in its place a sink with hot and cold water laid on is very desirablecold absolutely necessary wooden bowls or tubs of sufficient capacity are required one for hot and another for cold water have the bowl three parts full of clean hot water in this wash all plate and plated articles which are greasy wiping them before cleaning with the brush 2196 the footman in small families where only one man is kept has many of the duties of the upper servants to perform as well as his own and more constant occupation he will also have the arrangement of his time more immediately under his own control and he will do well to reduce it to a methodical division all his rough work should be done before breakfast is ready when he must appear clean and in a presentable state after breakfast when everything belonging to his pantry is cleaned and put in its place the furniture in the dining and drawing rooms requires rubbing towards noon the parlour luncheon is to be prepared and he must be at his mistresss disposal to go out with the carriage or follow her if she walks out 2197 glass is a beautiful and most fragile article hence it requires great care in washing a perfectly clean wooden bowl is best for this operation one for moderately hot and another for cold water wash the glasses well in the first and rinse them in the second and turn them down on a linen cloth folded two or three times to drain for a few minutes when sufficiently drained wipe them with a cloth and polish with a finer one doing so tenderly and carefully accidents will happen but nothing discredits a servant in the drawingroom more than continual reports of breakages which of course must reach that region 2198 decanters and waterjugs require still more tender treatment in cleaning inasmuch as they are more costly to replace fill them about twothirds with hot but not boiling water and put in a few pieces of wellsoaped brown paper leave them thus for two or three hours then shake the water up and down in the decanters empty this out rinse them well with clean cold water and put them in a rack to drain when dry polish them outside and inside as far as possible with a fine cloth to remove the crust of port or other wines add a little muriatic acid to the water and let it remain for some time 2199 when required to go out with the carriage it is the footmans duty to see that it has come to the door perfectly clean and that the glasses and sashes and linings are free from dust in receiving messages at the carriage door he should turn his ear to the speaker so as to comprehend what is said in order that he may give his directions to the coachman clearly when the house he is to call at is reached he should knock and return to the carriage for orders in closing the door upon the family he should see that the handle is securely turned and that no part of the ladies dress is shut in 2200 it is the footmans duty to carry messages or letters for his master or mistress to their friends to the post or to the tradespeople and nothing is more important than dispatch and exactness in doing so although writing even the simplest message is now the ordinary and very proper practice dean swift among his other quaint directions all of which are to be read by contraries recommends a perusal of all such epistles in order that you may be the more able to fulfil your duty to your master an old lady of forfarshire had one of those odd old caleb balderston sort of servants who construed the dean of st patrick more literally on one occasion when dispatch was of some importance knowing his inquiring nature she called her scotch paul pry to her opened the note and read it to him herself saying now andrew you ken a aboot it and needna stop to open and read it but just take it at once probably most of the notes you are expected to carry might with equal harmlessness be communicated to you but it will be better not to take so lively an interest in your mistresss affairs 2201 politeness and civility to visitors is one of the things masters and mistresses have a right to expect and should exact rigorously when visitors present themselves the servant charged with the duty of opening the door will open it promptly and answer without hesitation if the family are not at home or engaged which generally means the same thing and might be oftener used with advantage to morals on the contrary if he has no such orders he will answer affirmatively open the door wide to admit them and precede them to open the door of the drawingroom if the family are not there he will place chairs for them open the blinds if the room is too dark and intimate civilly that he goes to inform his mistress if the lady is in her drawingroom he announces the name of the visitors having previously acquainted himself with it in this part of his duty it is necessary to be very careful to repeat the names correctly mispronouncing names is very apt to give offence and leads sometimes to other disagreeables the writer was once initiated into some of the secrets on the other side of a legal affair in which he took an interest before he could correct a mistake made by the servant in announcing him when the visitor is departing the servant should be at hand ready when rung for to open the door he should open it with a respectful manner and close it gently when the visitors are fairly beyond the threshold when several visitors arrive together he should take care not to mix up the different names together where they belong to the same family as mr mrs and miss if they are strangers he should announce each as distinctly as possible 2202 receptions and evening partiesthe drawingrooms being prepared the cardtables laid out with cards and counters and such other arrangements as are necessary made for the reception of the company the rooms should be lighted up as the hour appointed approaches attendants in the drawingroom even more than in the diningroom should move about actively but noiselessly no creaking of shoes which is an abomination watching the lights from time to time so as to keep up their brilliancy but even if the attendant likes a game of cribbage or whist himself he must not interfere in his master or mistresss game nor even seem to take an interest in it we once knew a lady who had a footman and both were fond of a game of cribbagejohn in the kitchen the lady in her drawingroom the lady was a giver of evening parties where she frequently enjoyed her favourite amusement while handing about the tea and toast john could not always suppress his disgust at her mistakes there is more in that hand maam he has been known to say or maam you forgot to count his nob in fact he identified himself with his mistresss game and would have lost twenty places rather than witness a miscount it is not necessary to adopt his example on this point although john had many qualities a good servant might copy with advantage the coachhouse and stables 2203 the horse is the noblest of quadrupeds whether we view him in his strength his sagacity or his beauty he is also the most useful to man of all the animal creation but his delicacy is equal to his power and usefulness no other animal probably is so dependent on man in the state of domestication to which he has been reduced or deteriorates so rapidly under exposure bad feeding or bad grooming it is therefore a point of humanity not to speak of its obvious impolicy for the owner of horses to overlook any neglect in their feeding or grooming his interest dictates that so valuable an animal should be well housed well fed and well groomed and he will do well to acquire so much of stable lore as will enable him to judge of these points himself in a general way where a horses coat is habitually rough and untidy there is a sad want of elbowgrease in the stable when a horse of tolerable breeding is dull and spiritless he is getting ill or badly fed and where he is observed to perspire much in the stables is overfed and probably eats his litter in addition to his regular supply of food 2204 stablesthe architectural form of the stables will be subject to other influences than ours we confine ourselves therefore to their internal arrangements they should be roomy in proportion to the number of stalls warm with good ventilation and perfectly free from cold draughts the stalls roomy without excess with good and welltrapped drainage so as to exclude bad smells a sound ceiling to prevent the entrance of dust from the hayloft which is usually above them and there should be plenty of light coming however either from above or behind so as not to glare in the horses eye 2205 heatthe first of these objects is attained if the stables are kept within a degree or two of 50 in winter and 60 in summer although some grooms insist on a much higher temperature in the interests of their own labour 2206 ventilation is usually attained by the insertion of one or more tubes or boxes of wood or iron through the ceiling and the roof with a sloping covering over the opening to keep out rain and valves or ventilators below to regulate the atmosphere with openings in the walls for the admission of fresh air this is still a difficulty however for the effluvium of the stable is difficult to dispel and draughts must be avoided this is sometimes accomplished by means of hollow walls with gratings at the bottom outside for the exit of bad air which is carried down through the hollow walls and discharged at the bottom while for the admission of fresh air the reverse takes place the fresh by this means gets diffused and heated before it is discharged into the stable 2207 the stalls should be divided by partitions of woodwork eight or nine feet high at the head and six at the heels and nine feet deep so as to separate each horse from its neighbour a hayrack placed within easy reach of the horse of wood or iron occupies either a corner or the whole breadth of the stall which should be about six feet for on ordinarysized horse a manger formerly of wood but of late years more generally of iron lined with enamel occupies a corner of the stall the pavement of the stall should be nearly level with a slight incline towards the gutter to keep the bed dry paved with hard dutch brick laid on edge or asphalte or smithy clinkers or rubblestones laid in strong cement in the centre about five feet from the wall a grating should be firmly fixed in the pavement and in communication with a welltrapped drain to carry off the water the gutter outside the stall should also communicate with the drains by trapped openings the passage between the stall and the hall should be from five to six feet broad at least on the wall opposite to each stall pegs should be placed for receiving the harness and other things in daily use 2208 a harnessroom is indispensable to every stable it should be dry and airy and furnished with a fireplace and boiler both for the protection of the harness and to prepare mashes for the horses when required the partitionwall should be boarded where the harness goes with pegs to hang the various pieces of harness on with saddletrees to rest the saddles on a cupboard for the brushes sponges and leathers and a lockup cornbin 2209 the furniture of a stable with coachhouse consists of coachmops jacks for raising the wheels horsebrushes spokebrushes waterbrushes crest and bitbrushes dandybrushes currycombs birch and heath brooms trimmingcombs scissors and pickers oilcans and brushes harnessbrushes of three sorts leathers sponges for horse and carriage stableforks dungbaskets or wheelbarrow cornsieves and measures horsecloths and stable pails horn or glass lanterns over the stables there should be accommodation for the coachman or groom to sleep accidents sometimes occur and he should be at hand to interfere duties of the coachman groom and stableboy 2210 the establishment we have in view will consist of coachman groom and stableboy who are capable of keeping in perfect order four horses and perhaps the pony of this establishment the coachman is chief besides skill in driving he should possess a good general knowledge of horses he has usually to purchase provender to see that the horses are regularly fed and properly groomed watch over their condition apply simple remedies to trifling ailments in the animals under his charge and report where he observes symptoms of more serious ones which he does not understand he has either to clean the carriage himself or see that the stableboy does it properly 2211 the grooms first duties are to keep his horses in condition but he is sometimes expected to perform the duties of a valet to ride out with his master on occasions to wait at table and otherwise assist in the house in these cases he should have the means of dressing himself and keeping his clothes entirely away from the stables in the morning about six oclock or rather before the stables should be opened and cleaned out and the horses fed first by cleaning the rack and throwing in fresh hay putting it lightly in the rack that the horses may get it out easily a short time afterwards their usual morning feed of oats should be put into the manger while this is going on the stableboy has been removing the stabledung and sweeping and washing out the stables both of which should be done every day and every corner carefully swept in order to keep the stable sweet and clean the real duties of the groom follow where the horses are not taken out for early exercise the work of grooming immediately commences having tied up the head to use the excellent description of the process given by old barrett take a currycomb and curry him all over the body to raise the dust beginning first at the neck holding the left cheek of the headstall in the left hand and curry him from the settingon of his head all over the body to the buttocks down to the point of the hock then change your hands and curry him before on his breast and laying your right arm over his back join your right side to his left and curry him all under the belly near the forebowels and so all over from the knees and back upwards after that go to the far side and do that likewise then take a dead horses tail or failing that a cotton dustingcloth and strike that away which the currycomb hath raised then take a round brush made of bristles with a leathern handle and dress him all over both head body and legs to the very fetlocks always cleansing the brush from the dust by rubbing it with the currycomb in the currycombing process as well as brushing it must be applied with mildness especially with fineskinned horses otherwise the tickling irritates them much the brushing is succeeded by a haircloth with which rub him all over again very hard both to take away loose hairs and lay his coat then wash your hands in fair water and rub him all over while they are wet as well over the head as the body lastly take a clean cloth and rub him all over again till he be dry then take another haircloth and rub all his legs exceeding well from the knees and hocks downwards to his hoofs picking and dressing them very carefully about the fetlocks so as to remove all gravel and dust which will sometimes lie in the bending of the joints in addition to the practice of this old writer modern grooms add wisping which usually follows brushing the best wisp is made from a hayband untwisted and again doubled up after being moistened with water this is applied to every part of the body as the brushing had been by changing the hands taking care in all these operations to carry the hand in the direction of the coat stains on the hair are removed by sponging or when the coat is very dirty by the waterbrush the whole being finished off by a linen or flannel cloth the horsecloth should now be put on by taking the cloth in both hands with the outside next you and with your right hand to the off side throw it over his back placing it no farther back than will leave it straight and level which will be about a foot from the tail put the roller round and the padpiece under it about six or eight inches from the fore legs the horses head is now loosened he is turned about in his stall to have his head and ears rubbed and brushed over every part including throat with the dustingcloth finishing by pulling his ears which all horses seem to enjoy very much this done the mane and foretop should be combed out passing a wet sponge over them sponging the mane on both sides by throwing it back to the midriff to make it lie smooth the horse is now returned to his headstall his tail combed out cleaning it of stains with a wet brush or sponge trimming both tail and mane and forelock when necessary smoothing them down with a brush on which a little oil has been dropped 2212 watering usually follows dressing but some horses refuse their food until they have drunk the groom should not therefore lay down exclusive rules on this subject but study the temper and habits of his horse 2213 exerciseall horses not in work require at least two hours exercise daily and in exercising them a good groom will put them through the paces to which they have been trained in the case of saddlehorses he will walk trot canter and gallop them in order to keep them up to their work with draught horses they ought to be kept up to a smart walk and trot 2214 feeding must depend on their work but they require feeding three times a day with more or less corn each time according to their work in the fast coaching days it was a saying among proprietors that his belly was the measure of his food but the horses appetite is not to be taken as a criterion of the quantity of food under any circumstances horses have been known to consume 40 lbs of hay in twentyfour hours whereas 16 lbs to 18 lbs is the utmost which should have been given mr croall an extensive coach proprietor in scotland limited his horses to 412 lbs cut straw 8 lbs bruised oats and 212 lbs bruised beans in the morning and noon giving them at night 25 lbs of the following viz 560 lbs steamed potatoes 36 lbs barleydust 40 lbs cut straw and 6 lbs salt mixed up together under this the horses did their work well the ordinary measure given a horse is a peck of oats about 40 lbs to the bushel twice a day a third feed and a rackfull of hay which may be about 15 lbs or 18 lbs when he is in full work 2215 you cannot take up a paper without having the question put do you bruise your oats well that depends on circumstances a fresh young horse can bruise its own oats when it can get them but aged horses after a time lose the power of masticating and bruising them and bolt them whole thus much impeding the work of digestion for an old horse then bruise the oats for a young one it does no harm and little good oats should be bright and dry and not too new where they are new sprinkle them with salt and water otherwise they overload the horses stomach chopped straw mixed with oats in the proportion of a third of straw or hay is a good food for horses in full work and carrots of which horses are remarkably fond have a perceptible effect in a short time on the gloss of the coat 2216 the water given to a horse merits some attention it should not be too cold hard water is not to be recommended stagnant or muddy water is positively injurious river water is the best for all purposes and anything is preferable to spring water which should be exposed to the sun in summer for an hour or two and stirred up before using it a handful of oatmeal thrown into the pail will much improve its quality 2217 shoeinga horse should not be sent on a journey or any other hard work immediately after new shoeingthe stiffness incidental to new shoes is not unlikely to bring him down a days rest with reasonable exercise will not be thrown away after this operation on reaching home very hot the groom should walk him about for a few minutes this done he should take off the moisture with the scraper and afterwards wisp him over with a handful of straw and a flannel cloth if the cloth is dipped in some spirit all the better he should wash pick and wipe dry the legs and feet take off the bridle and crupper and fasten it to the rack then the girths and put a wisp of straw under the saddle when sufficiently cool the horse should have some hay given him and then a feed of oats if he refuse the latter offer him a little wet bran or a handful of oatmeal in tepid water when he has been fed he should be thoroughly cleaned and his bodyclothes put on and if very much harassed with fatigue a little good ale or wine will be well bestowed on a valuable horse adding plenty of fresh litter under the belly 2218 bridlesevery time a horse is unbridled the bit should be carefully washed and dried and the leather wiped to keep them sweet as well as the girths and saddle the latter being carefully dried and beaten with a switch before it is again put on in washing a horses feet after a days work the master should insist upon the legs and feet being washed thoroughly with a sponge until the water flows over them and then rubbed with a brush till quite dry 2219 harness if not carefully preserved very soon gets a shabby tarnished appearance where the coachman has a proper harnessroom and sufficient assistance this is inexcusable and easily prevented the harnessroom should have a wooden lining all round and be perfectly dry and well ventilated around the walls hooks and pegs should be placed for the several pieces of harness at such a height as to prevent their touching the ground and every part of the harness should have its peg or hookone for the halters another for the reins and others for snaffles and other bits and metalwork and either a wooden horse or saddletrees for the saddles and pads all these parts should be dry clean and shining this is only to be done by careful cleaning and polishing and the use of several requisite pastes the metallic parts when white should be cleaned by a soft brush and platepowder the copper and brass parts burnished with rottenstonepowder and oilsteel with emerypowder both made into a paste with a little oil 2220 an excellent paste for polishing harness and the leatherwork of carriages is made by melting 8 lbs of yellow wax stirring it till completely dissolved into this pour 1 lb of litharge of the shops which has been pounded up with water and dried and sifted through a sieve leaving the two when mixed to simmer on the fire stirring them continually till all is melted when it is a little cool mix this with 114 lb of good ivoryblack place this again on the fire and stir till it boils anew and suffer it to cool when cooled a little add distilled turpentine till it has the consistence of a thickish paste scenting it with any essence at hand thinning it when necessary from time to time by adding distilled turpentine 2221 when the leather is old and greasy it should be cleaned before applying this polish with a brush wetted in a weak solution of potass and water washing afterwards with soft river water and drying thoroughly if the leather is not black one or two coats of black ink may be given before applying the polish when quite dry the varnish should be laid on with a soft shoebrush using also a soft brush to polish the leather 2222 when the leather is very old it may be softened with fishoil and after putting on the ink a sponge charged with distilled turpentine passed over to scour the surface of the leather which should be polished as above 2223 for fawn or yellowcoloured leather take a quart of skimmed milk pour into it 1 oz of sulphuric acid and when cold add to it 4 oz of hydrochloric acid shaking the bottle gently until it ceases to emit white vapours separate the coagulated from the liquid part by straining through a sieve and store it away till required in applying it clean the leather by a weak solution of oxalic acid washing it off immediately and apply the composition when dry with a sponge 2224 wheelgrease is usually purchased at the shops but a good paste is made as followsmelt 80 parts of grease and stir into it mixing it thoroughly and smoothly 20 parts of fine blacklead in powder and store away in a tin box for use this grease is used in the mint at paris and is highly approved 2225 carriages in an endless variety of shapes and names are continually making their appearance but the hackney cab or clarence seems most in request for light carriages the family carriage of the day being a modified form of the clarence adapted for family use the carriage is a valuable piece of furniture requiring all the care of the most delicate upholstery with the additional disadvantage of continual exposure to the weather and to the muddy streets 2216 it requires therefore to be carefully cleaned before putting away and a coachhouse perfectly dry and well ventilated for the woodwork swells with moisture it shrinks also with heat unless the timber has undergone a long course of seasoning it should also have a dry floor a boarded one being recommended it must be removed from the ammoniacal influence of the stables from open drains and cesspools and other gaseous influences likely to affect the paint and varnish when the carriage returns home it should be carefully washed and dried and that if possible before the mud has time to dry on it this is done by first well slushing it with clean water so as to wash away all particles of sand having first closed the sashes to avoid wetting the linings the body is then gone carefully over with a soft mop using plenty of clean water and penetrating into every corner of the carved work so that not an atom of dirt remains the body of the carriage is then raised by placing the jack under the axletree and raising it so that the wheel turns freely this is now thoroughly washed with the mop until the dirt is removed using a waterbrush for corners where the mop does not penetrate every particle of mud and sand removed by the mop and afterwards with a wet sponge the carriage is wiped dry and as soon after as possible the varnish is carefully polished with soft leather using a little sweet oil for the leather parts and even for the panels so as to check any tendency of the varnish to crack stains are removed by rubbing them with the leather and sweet oil if that fails a little tripoli powder mixed with the oil will be more successful 2227 in preparing the carriage for use the whole body should be rubbed over with a clean leather and carefully polished the ironwork and joints oiled the plated and brasswork occasionally cleanedthe one with platepowder or with wellwashed whiting mixed with sweet oil and leather kept for the purposethe other with rottenstone mixed with a little oil and applied without too much rubbing until the paste is removed but if rubbed every day with the leather little more will be required to keep it untarnished the linings require careful brushing every day the cushions being taken out and beaten and the glass sashes should always be bright and clean the wheeltires and axletree are carefully seen to and greased when required the bolts and nuts tightened and all the parts likely to get out of order overhauled 2228 these duties however are only incidental to the coachmans office which is to drive and much of the enjoyment of those in the carriage depends on his proficiency in his artmuch also of the wear of the carriage and horses he should have sufficient knowledge of the construction of the carriage to know when it is out of orderto know also the pace at which he can go over the road he has under him without risking the springs and without shaking those he is driving too much 2229 having with or without the help of the groom or stableboy put his horses to the carriage and satisfied himself by walking round them that everything is properly arranged the coachman proceeds to the offside of the carriage takes the reins from the back of the horses where they were thrown buckles them together and placing his foot on the step ascends to his box having his horses now entirely under control in ordinary circumstances he is not expected to descend for where no footman accompanies the carriage the doors are usually so arranged that even a lady may let herself out if she wishes it from the inside the coachmans duties are to avoid everything approaching an accident and all his attention is required to guide his horses 2230 the pace at which he drives will depend upon his ordersin all probability a moderate pace of seven or eight miles an hour less speed is injurious to the horses getting them into lazy and sluggish habits for it is wonderful how soon these are acquired by some horses the writer was once employed to purchase a horse for a country friend and he picked a very handsome gelding out of collinss stables which seemed to answer to his friends wants it was duly committed to the coachman who was to drive it after some very successful trials in harness and out of it and seemed likely to give great satisfaction after a time the friend got tired of his carriage and gave it up as the easiest mode of getting rid of the horse it was sent up to the writers stablesa present only twelve months had elapsed the horse was as handsome as ever with plenty of flesh and a sleek glossy coat and he was thankfully enough received but on trial it was found that a stupid coachman who was imbued with one of their old maxims that its the pace that kills had driven the horse capable of doing his nine miles an hour with ease at a jogtrot of four miles or four and a half and now no persuasion of the whip could get more out of him after many unsuccessful efforts to bring him back to his pace in one of which a breakdown occurred under the hands of a professional trainer he was sent to the hammer and sold for a sum that did not pay for the attempt to break him in this maxim therefore that its the pace that kills is altogether fallacious in the moderate sense in which we are viewing it in the old coaching days indeed when the shrewsbury wonder drove into the inn yard while the clock was striking week after week and mouth after month with unerring regularity twentyseven hours to a hundred and sixtytwo miles when the quicksilver mail was timed to eleven miles an hour between london and plymouth with a fine of 5 to the driver if behind time when the brighton age toold and horsed by the late mr stevenson used to dash round the square as the fifth hour was striking having stopped at the halfway house while his servant handed a sandwich and a glass of sherry to his passengersthen the pace was indeed killing but the truth is horses that are driven at a jogtrot pace lose that lan with which a good driver can inspire them and they are left to do their work by mere weight and muscle therefore unless he has contrary orders a good driver will choose a smart pace but not enough to make his horses perspire on level roads this should never be seen 2231 in choosing his horses every master will see that they are properly pairedthat their paces are about equal when their habits differ it is the coachmans duty to discover how he can with least annoyance to the horses get that pace out of them some horses have been accustomed to be driven on the check and the curb irritates them others with harder mouths cannot be controlled with the slight leverage this affords he must therefore accommodate the horses as he best can the reins should always be held so that the horses are in hand but he is a very bad driver who always drives with a tight rein the pain to the horse is intolerable and causes him to rear and plunge and finally break sway if he can he is also a bad driver when the reins are always slack the horse then feels abandoned to himself he is neither directed nor supported and if no accident occurs it is great good luck 2232 the true coachmans hands are so delicate and gentle that the mere weight of the reins is felt on the bit and the directions are indicated by a turn of the wrist rather than by a pull the horses are guided and encouraged and only pulled up when they exceed their intended pace or in the event of a stumble for there is a strong though gentle hand on the reins 2233 the whip in the hands of a good driver and with wellbred cattle is there more as a precaution than a tool for frequent use if he uses it it is to encourage by stroking the flanks except indeed he has to punish some waywardness of temper and then he does it effectually taking care however that it is done on the flank where there is no very tender part never on the crupper in driving the coachman should never give way to temper how often do we see horses stumble from being conducted or at least allowed to go over bad ground by some careless driver who immediately wreaks that vengeance on the poor horse which might with much more justice be applied to his own brutal shoulders the whip is of course useful and even necessary but should be rarely used except to encourage and excite the horses duties of the valet 2234 attendants on the personno man is a hero to his valet saith the proverb and the corollary may run no lady is a heroine to her maid the infirmities of humanity are perhaps too numerous and too equally distributed to stand the severe microscopic tests which attendants on the person have opportunities of applying the valet and waitingmaid are placed near the persons of the master and mistress receiving orders only from them dressing them accompanying them in all their journeys the confidants and agents of their most unguarded moments of their most secret habits and of course subject to their commandseven to their caprices they themselves being subject to erring judgment aggravated by an imperfect education all that can be expected from such servants is polite manners modest demeanour and a respectful reserve which are indispensable to these good sense good temper some selfdenial and consideration for the feelings of others whether above or below them in the social scale will be useful qualifications their duty leads them to wait on those who are from sheer wealth station and education more polished and consequently more susceptible of annoyance and any vulgar familiarity of manner is opposed to all their notions of selfrespect quiet unobtrusive manners therefore and a delicate reserve in speaking of their employers either in praise or blame is as essential in their absence as good manners and respectful conduct in their presence 2235 some of the duties of the valet we have just hinted at in treating of the duties of the footman in a small family his day commences by seeing that his masters dressingroom is in order that the housemaid has swept and dusted it properly that the fire is lighted and burns cheerfully and some time before his master is expected he will do well to throw up the sash to admit fresh air closing it however in time to recover the temperature which he knows his master prefers it is now his duty to place the bodylinen on the horse before the fire to be aired properly to lay the trousers intended to be worn carefully brushed and cleaned on the back of his masters chair while the coat and waistcoat carefully brushed and folded and the collar cleaned are laid in their place ready to put on when required all the articles of the toilet should be in their places the razors properly set and stropped and hot water ready for use 2236 gentlemen generally prefer performing the operation of shaving themselves but a valet should be prepared to do it if required and he should besides be a good hairdresser shaving over he has to brush the hair beard and moustache where that appendage is encouraged arranging the whole simply and gracefully according to the age and style of countenance every fortnight or three weeks at the utmost the hair should be cut and the points of the whiskers trimmed as often as required a good valet will now present the various articles of the toilet as they are wanted afterwards the bodylinen necktie which he will put on if required and afterwards waistcoat coat and boots in suitable order and carefully brushed and polished 2237 having thus seen his master dressed if he is about to go out the valet will hand him his cane gloves and hat the latter well brushed on the outside with a soft brush and wiped inside with a clean handkerchief respectfully attend him to the door and open it for him and receive his last orders for the day 2238 he now proceeds to put everything in order in the dressingroom cleans the combs and brushes and brushes and folds up any clothes that may be left about the room and puts them away in the drawers 2239 gentlemen are sometimes indifferent as to their clothes and appearance it is the valets duty in this case where his master permits it to select from the wardrobe such things as are suitable for the occasion so that he may appear with scrupulous neatness and cleanliness that his linen and necktie where that is white or coloured are unsoiled and where he is not accustomed to change them every day that the cravat is turned and even ironed to remove the crease of the previous fold the coat collarwhich where the hair is oily and worn long is apt to get greasyshould also be examined a careful valet will correct this by removing the spots day by day as they appear first by moistening the greasespots with a little rectified spirits of wine or spirits of hartshorn which has a renovating effect and the smell of which soon disappears the grease is dissolved and removed by gentle scraping the grease removed add a little more of the spirit and rub with a piece of clean cloth finish by adding a few drops more rub it with the palm of the hand in the direction of the grain of the cloth and it will be clean and glossy as the rest of the garment 2240 polish for the boots is an important matter to the valet and not always to be obtained good by purchase never so good perhaps as he can make for himself after the following recipestake of ivoryblack and treacle each 4 oz sulphuric acid 1 oz best oliveoil 2 spoonfuls best whitewine vinegar 3 halfpints mix the ivoryblack and treacle well in an earthen jar then add the sulphuric acid continuing to stir the mixture next pour in the oil and lastly add the vinegar stirring it in by degrees until thoroughly incorporated 241 another polish is made by mixing 1 oz each of pounded galls and logwoodchips and 3 lbs of red french vine ordinaire boil together till the liquid is reduced to half the quantity and pour it off through a strainer now take 12 lb each of pounded gumarabic and lumpsugar 1 oz of green copperas and 3 lbs of brandy dissolve the gumarabic in the preceding decoction and add the sugar and copperas when all is dissolved and mixed together stir in the brandy mixing it smoothly this mixture will yield 5 or 6 lbs of a very superior polishing paste for boots and shoes 2242 it is perhaps unnecessary to add that having discharged all the commissions intrusted to him by his master such as conveying notes or messages to friends or the tradesmen all of which he should punctually and promptly attend to it is his duty to be in waiting when his master returns home to dress for dinner or for any other occasion and to have all things prepared for this second dressing previous to this he brings under his notice the cards of visitors who may have called delivers the messages be may have received for him and otherwise acquits himself of the mornings commissions and receives his orders for the remainder of the day the routine of his evening duty is to have the dressingroom and study where there is a separate one arranged comfortably for his master the fires lighted candles prepared dressinggown and slippers in their place and aired and everything in order that is required for his masters comforts female domestics duties of the ladysmaid 2243 the duties of a ladysmaid are more numerous and perhaps more onerous than those of the valet for while the latter is aided by the tailor the hatter the linendraper and the perfumer the ladysmaid has to originate many parts of the mistresss dress herself she should indeed be a tolerably expert milliner and dressmaker a good hairdresser and possess some chemical knowledge of the cosmetics with which the toilettable is supplied in order to use them with safety and effect her first duty in the morning after having performed her own toilet is to examine the clothes put off by her mistress the evening before either to put them away or to see that they are all in order to put on again during the winter and in wet weather the dresses should be carefully examined and the mud removed dresses of tweed and other woollen materials may be laid out on a table and brushed all over but in general even in woollen fabrics the lightness of the tissues renders brushing unsuitable to dresses and it is better to remove the dust from the folds by beating them lightly with a handkerchief or thin cloth silk dresses should never be brushed but rubbed with a piece of merino or other soft material of a similar colour kept for the purpose summer dresses of barge muslin mohair and other light materials simply require shaking but if the muslin be tumbled it must be ironed afterwards if the dresses require slight repair it should be done at once a stitch in time saves nine 2244 the bonnet should be dusted with a light feather plume in order to remove every particle of dust but this has probably been done as it ought to have been the night before velvet bonnets and other velvet articles of dress should be cleaned with a soft brush if the flowers with which the bonnet is decorated have been crushed or displaced or the leaves tumbled they should be raised and readjusted by means of flowerpliers if feathers have suffered from damp they should be held near the fire for a few minutes and restored to their natural state by the hand or a soft brush 2245 the chausserie or footgear of a lady is one of the few things left to mark her station and requires special care satin boots or shoes should be dusted with a soft brush or wiped with a cloth kid or varnished leather should have the mud wiped off with a sponge charged with milk which preserves its softness and polish the following is also an excellent polish for applying to ladies boots instead of blacking themmix equal proportions of sweetoil vinegar and treacle with 1 oz of lampblack when all the ingredients are thoroughly incorporated rub the mixture on the boots with the palm of the hand and put them in a cool place to dry ladies blacking which may be purchased in 6d and 1s bottles is also very much used for patent leather and kid boots particularly when they are a little worn this blacking is merely applied with a piece of sponge and the boots should not be put on until the blacking is dry und hardened 2246 these various preliminary offices performed the ladysmaid should prepare for dressing her mistress arranging her dressingroom toilettable and linen according to her mistresss wishes and habits the details of dressing we need not touch uponevery lady has her own mode of doing so but the maid should move about quietly perform any offices about her mistresss person as lacing stays gently and adjust her linen smoothly 2247 having prepared the dressingroom by lighting the fire sweeping the hearth and made everything ready for dressing her mistress placed her linen before the fire to air and laid out the various articles of dress she is to wear which will probably have been arranged the previous evening the ladysmaid is prepared for the mornings duties 2248 hairdressing is the most important part of the ladysmaids office if ringlets are worn remove the curlpapers and after thoroughly brushing the back hair both above and below dress it according to the prevailing fashion if bandeaux are worn the hair is thoroughly brushed and frizzed outside and inside folding the hair back round the head brushing it perfectly smooth giving it a glossy appearance by the use of pomades or oil applied by the palm of the hand smoothing it down with a small brush dipped in bandoline double bandeaux are formed by bringing most of the hair forward and rolling it over frizettes made of hair the same colour as that of the wearer it is finished behind by plaiting the hair and arranging it in such a manner as to look well with the headdress 2249 lessons in hairdressing may be obtained and at not an unreasonable charge if a ladysmaid can afford it we would advise her to initiate herself in the mysteries of hairdressing before entering on her duties if a mistress finds her maid handy and willing to learn she will not mind the expense of a few lessons which are almost necessary as the fashion and mode of dressing the hair is so continually changing brushes and combs should be kept scrupulously clean by washing them about twice a week to do this oftener spoils the brushes as very frequent washing makes them so very soft to wash brushes 2250 dissolve a piece of soda in some hot water allowing a piece the size of a walnut to a quart of water put the water into a basin and after combing out the hair from the brushes dip them bristles downwards into the water and out again keeping the backs and handles as free from the water as possible repeat this until the bristles look clean then rinse the brushes in a little cold water shake them well and wipe the handles and backs with a towel but not the bristles and set the brushes to dry in the sun or near the fire but take care not to put them too close to it wiping the bristles of a brush makes them soft as does also the use of soap to clean combs 2251 if it can be avoided never wash combs as the water often makes the teeth split and the tortoiseshell or horn of which they are made rough small brushes manufactured purposely for cleaning combs may be purchased at a trifling cost with this the comb should be well brushed and afterwards wiped with a cloth or towel a good wash for the hair 2252 ingredients1 pennyworth of borax 12 pint of oliveoil 1 pint of boiling water modepour the boiling water over the borax and oil let it cool then put the mixture into a bottle shake it before using and apply it with a flannel camphor and borax dissolved in boiling water and left to cool make a very good wash for the hair as also does rosemarywater mixed with a little borax after using any of these washes when the hair becomes thoroughly dry a little pomatum or oil should be rubbed in to make it smooth and glossy to make pomade for the hair 2253 ingredients14 lb of lard 2 pennyworth of castoroil scent modelet the lard be unsalted beat it up well then add the castoroil and mix thoroughly together with a knife adding a few drops of any scent that may be preferred put the pomatum into pots which keep well covered to prevent it turning rancid another recipe for pomatum 2254 ingredients8 oz of oliveoil 1 oz of spermaceti 3 pennyworth of essential oil of almonds 3 pennyworth of essence of lemon modemix these ingredients together and store away in jars for use to make bandoline 2555 ingredients1 oz of gumtragacanth 14 pint of cold water 3 pennyworth of essence of almonds 2 teaspoonfuls of old rum modeput the gumtragacanth into a widemouthed bottle with the cold water let it stand till dissolved then stir into it the essence of almonds let it remain for an hour or two when pour the rum on the top this should make the stock bottle and when any is required for use it is merely necessary to dilute it with a little cold water until the desired consistency is obtained and to keep it in a small bottle well corked for use this bandoline instead of injuring the hair as many other kinds often do improves it by increasing its growth and making it always smooth and glossy an excellent pomatum 2256 ingredients112 lb of lard 12 pint of oliveoil 12 pint of castoroil 4 oz of spermaceti bergamot or any other scent elderflower water modewash the lard well in the elderflower water drain and beat it to a cream mix the two oils together and heat them sufficiently to dissolve the spermaceti which should be beaten fine in a mortar mix all these ingredients together with the brandy and whatever kind of scent may be preferred and whilst warm pour into glass bottles for use keeping them well corked the best way to liquefy the pomatum is to set the bottle in a saucepan of warm water it will remain good for many months to promote the growth of hair 2257 ingredientsequal quantities of oliveoil and spirit of rosemary a few drops of oil of nutmeg modemix the ingredients together rub the roots of the hair every night with a little of this liniment and the growth of it will very soon sensibly increase 2258 our further remarks on dressing must be confined to some general advice in putting on a band see that it is laid quite flat and is drawn tightly round the waist before it is pinned in front that the pin is a strong one and that it is secured to the stays so as not to slip up or down or crease in the folds arrange the folds of the dress over the crinoline petticoats if the dress fastens behind put a small pin in the slit to prevent it from opening see that the sleeves fall well over the arms if it is finished with a jacket or other upper dress see that it fits smoothly under the arms pull out the flounces and spread out the petticoat at the bottom with the hands so that it falls in graceful folds in arranging the petticoat itself a careful ladysmaid will see that this is firmly fastened round the waist 2259 where sashes are worn pin the bows securely on the inside with a pin so as not to be visible then raise the bow with the fingers the collar is arranged and carefully adjusted with brooch or bow in the centre 2260 having dressed her mistress for breakfast and breakfasted herself the further duties of the ladysmaid will depend altogether upon the habits of the family in which hardly two will probably agree where the duties are entirely confined to attendance on her mistress it is probable that the bedroom and dressingroom will be committed to her care that the housemaid will rarely enter except for the weekly or other periodical cleaning she will therefore have to make her mistresss bed and keep it in order and as her duties are light and easy there can be no allowance made for the slightest approach to uncleanliness or want of order every morning immediately after her mistress has left it and while breakfast is on she should throw the bed open by taking off the clothes open the windows except in rainy weather and leave the room to air for half an hour after breakfast except her attendance on her mistress prevents it if the rooms are carpeted she should sweep them carefully having previously strewed the room with moist tealeaves dusting every table and chair taking care to penetrate to every corner and moving every article of furniture that is portable this done satisfactorily and having cleaned the dressingglass polished up the furniture and the ornaments and made the glass jug and basin clean and bright emptied all slops emptied the waterjugs and filled them with fresh water and arranged the rooms the dressingroom is ready for the mistress when she thinks proper to appear 2261 the dressingroom thoroughly in order the same thing is to be done in the bedroom in which she will probably be assisted by the housemaid to make the bed and empty the slops in making the bed she will study her ladys wishes whether it is to be hard or soft sloping or straight and see that it is done accordingly 2262 having swept the bedroom with equal care dusted the tables and chairs chimneyornaments and put away all articles of dress left from yesterday and cleaned and put away any articles of jewellery her next care is to see before her mistress goes out what requires replacing in her department and furnish her with a list of them that she may use her discretion about ordering them all this done she may settle herself down to any work on which she is engaged this will consist chiefly in mending which is first to be seen to everything except stockings being mended before washing plain work will probably be one of the ladysmaids chief employments 2263 a waitingmaid who wishes to make herself useful will study the fashionbooks with attention so as to be able to aid her mistresss judgment in dressing according to the prevailing fashion with such modifications as her style of countenance requires she will also if she has her mistresss interest at heart employ her spare time in repairing and making up dresses which have served one purpose to serve another also or turning many things unfitted for her mistress to use for the younger branches of the family the ladysmaid may thus render herself invaluable to her mistress and increase her own happiness in so doing the exigencies of fashion and luxury are such that all ladies except those of the very highest rank will consider themselves fortunate in having about them a thoughtful person capable of diverting their finery to a useful purpose 2264 among other duties the ladysmaid should understand the various processes for washing and cleaning and repairing laces edging of collars removing stains and greasespots from dresses and similar processes for which the following recipes will be found very useful in washing 2265 blonde fine toiletsoap is used the blonde is soaped over very slightly and washed in water in which a little figblue is dissolved rubbing it very gently when clean dry it dip it afterwards in very thin gumwater dry it again in linen spread it out as flat as it will lie and iron it where the blonde is of better quality and wider it may be stretched on a hoop to dry after washing in the bluewater applying the gum with a sponge or it may be washed finally in water in which a lump of sugar has been dissolved which gives it more the appearance of new blonde 2266 lace collars soil very quickly when in contact with the neck they are cleaned by beating the edge of the collar between the folds of a fine linen cloth then washing the edges as directed above and spreading it out on an ironingboard pinning it at each corner with fine pins then going carefully over it with a sponge charged with water in which some gumdragon and figblue have been dissolved to give it a proper consistence to give the collar the same tint throughout the whole collar should be sponged with the same water taking care not to touch the flowers 2267 a multiplicity of accidents occur to soil and spot dresses which should be removed at once to remove 2268 greasespots from cotton or woollen materials of fast colours absorbent pastes purified bullocksblood and even common soap are used applied to the spot when dry when the colours are not fast use fullersearth or pulverized pottersclay laid in a layer over the spot and press it with a very hot iron 2269 for silks moires and plain or brocaded satins begin by pouring over the spot two drops of rectified spirits of wine cover it over with a linen cloth and press it with a hot iron changing the linen instantly the spot will look tarnished for a portion of the grease still remains this will be removed entirely by a little sulphuric ether dropped on the spot and a very little rubbing if neatly done no perceptible mark or circle will remain nor will the lustre of the richest silk be changed the union of the two liquids operating with no injurious effects from rubbing 2270 fruitspots are removed from white and fastcoloured cottons by the use of chloride of soda commence by coldsoaping the article then touch the spot with a hairpencil or feather dipped in the chloride dipping it immediately into cold water to prevent the texture of the article being injured 2271 inkspots are removed when fresh applied to the spot by a few drops of hot water being poured on immediately afterwards by the same process ironmould in linen or calico may be removed dipping immediately in cold water to prevent injury to the fabric 2272 wax dropped on a shawl tablecover or cloth dress is easily discharged by applying spirits of wine 2273 syrups or preserved fruits by washing in lukewarm water with a dry cloth and pressing the spot between two folds of clean linen 2274 essence of lemon will remove grease but will make a spot itself in a few days to clean silk or ribbons 2275 ingredients12 pint of gin 12 lb of honey 12 lb of soft soap 12 pint of water modemix the above ingredients together then lay each breadth of silk upon a clean kitchen table or dresser and scrub it well on the soiled side with the mixture have ready three vessels of cold water take each piece of silk at two corners and dip it up and down in each vessel but do not wring it and take care that each breadth has one vessel of quite clean water for the last dip hang it up dripping for a minute or two then dab it in a cloth and iron it quickly with a very hot iron to remove paintspots from silk cloth 2276 if the fabric will bear it sharp rubbing will frequently entirely discharge a newlymade paintstain but if this is not successful apply spirit of turpentine with a quill till the stains disappear to make old crape look nearly equal to new 2277 place a little water in a teakettle and let it boil until there is plenty of steam from the spout then holding the crape in both hands pass it to and fro several times through the steam and it will to clean and look nearly equal to new 2278 linenbefore sending linen to wash the ladysmaid should see that everything under her charge is properly mended for her own sake she should take care that it is sent out in an orderly manner each class of garments by themselves with a proper list of which she retains a copy on its return it is still more necessary to examine every piece separately so that all missing buttons be supplied and only the articles properly washed and in perfect repair passed into the wardrobe 2279 ladies who keep a waitingmaid for their own persons are in the habit of paying visits to their friends in which it is not unusual for the maid to accompany them at all events it is her duty to pack the trunks and this requires not only knowledge but some practice although the improved trunks and portmanteaus now made in which there is a place for nearly everything render this more simple than formerly before packing let the trunks be thoroughly well cleaned and if necessary lined with paper and everything intended for packing laid out on the bed or chairs so that it may be seen what is to be stowed away the nicer articles of dress neatly folded in clean calico wrappers having satisfied herself that everything wanted is laid out and that it is in perfect order the packing is commenced by disposing of the most bulky articles the dressingcase and workbox skirts and other articles requiring room leaving the smaller articles to fill up finally having satisfied herself that all is included she should lock and cover up the trunk in its canvas case and then pack her own box if she is to accompany her mistress 2280 on reaching the house the ladysmaid will be shown her ladys apartment and her duties here are what they were at home she will arrange her mistresss things and learn which is her bell in order to go to her when she rings her meals will be taken in the housekeepers room and here she must be discreet and guarded in her talk to any one of her mistress or her concerns her only occupation here will be attending in her ladys room keeping her things in order and making her rooms comfortable for her 2281 the evening duties of a ladysmaid are pretty nearly a repetition of those of the morning she is in attendance when her mistress retires she assists her to undress if required brushes her hair and renders such other assistance as is demanded removes all slops takes care that the fire if any is safe before she retires to rest herself 2282 ironing is a part of the duties of a ladysmaid and she should be able to do it in the most perfect manner when it becomes necessary ironing is often badly done from inattention to a few very simple requirements cleanliness is the first essential the ironingboard the fire the iron and the ironingblanket should all be perfectly clean it will not be necessary here to enter into details on ironing as full directions are given in the duties of the laundrymaid a ladysmaid will have a great deal of ironingout to do such as light evening dresses muslin dresses c which are not dirty enough to be washed but merely require smoothing out to remove the creases in summer particularly an iron will be constantly required as also a skirtboard which should be covered with a nice clean piece of flannel to keep muslin dresses in order they almost require smoothing out every time they are worn particularly if made with many flounces the ladysmaid may often have to perform little services for her mistress which require care such as restoring the colour to scorched linen c c the following recipe is we believe a very good one to restore whiteness to scorched linen 2283 ingredients12 pint of vinegar 2 oz of fullersearth 1 oz of dried fowls dung 12 oz of soap the juice of 2 large onions modeboil all these ingredients together to the consistency of paste spread the composition thickly over the damaged part and if the threads be not actually consumed after it has been allowed to dry on and the place has subsequently been washed once or twice every trace of scorching will disappear 2284 furs feathers and woollens require the constant care of the waitingmaid furs and feathers not in constant use should be wrapped up in linen washed in lye from may to september they are subject to being made the depositary of the motheggs they should be looked too and shaken and beaten from time to time in case some of the eggs should have been lodged in them in spite of every precaution laying them up again or rather folding them up as before wrapping them in brown paper which is itself a preservative shawls and cloaks which would be damaged by such close folds must be looked to and aired and beaten putting them away dry before the evening preservatives against the ravages of moths 2285 place pieces of camphor cedarwood russia leather tobaccoleaves bogmyrtle or anything else strongly aromatic in the drawers or boxes where furs or other things to be preserved from moths are kept and they will never take harm 2286 jewels are generally wrapped up in cotton and kept in their cases but they are subject to tarnish from exposure to the air and require cleaning this is done by preparing clean soapsuds using fine toiletsoap dip any article of gold silver gilt or precious stones into this lye and dry them by brushing with a brush of soft badgers hair or a fine sponge afterwards with a piece of fine cloth and lastly with a soft leather 2287 epaulettes of gold or silver and in general all articles of jewellery may be dressed by dipping them in spirits of wine warmed in a bain marie or shallow kettle placed over a slow fire or hotplate 2288 the valet and ladysmaid from their supposed influence with their master and mistress are exposed to some temptations to which other servants are less subjected they are probably in communication with the tradespeople who supply articles for the toilet such as batters tailors dressmakers and perfumers the conduct of waitingmaid and valet to these people should be civil but independent making reasonable allowance for want of exact punctuality if any such can be made they should represent any inconvenience respectfully and if an excuse seems unreasonable put the matter fairly to master or mistress leaving it to them to notice it further if they think it necessary no expectations of a personal character should influence them one way or the other it would be acting unreasonably to any domestic to make them refuse such presents as tradespeople choose to give them the utmost that can be expected is that they should not influence their judgment in the articles suppliedthat they should represent them truly to master or mistress without fear and without favour civility to all servility to none is a good maxim for every one deference to a master and mistress and to their friends and visitors is one of the implied terms of their engagement and this deference must apply even to what may be considered their whims a servant is not to be seated or wear a hat in the house in his masters or mistresss presence nor offer any opinion unless asked for it nor even to say good night or good morning except in reply to that salutation to preserve cut flowers 2289 a bouquet of freshlycut flowers may be preserved alive for a long time by placing them in a glass or vase with fresh water in which a little charcoal has been steeped or a small piece of camphor dissolved the vase should be set upon a plate or dish and covered with a bellglass around the edges of which when it comes in contact with the plate a little water should be poured to exclude the air to revive cut flowers after packing 2290 plunge the stems into boiling water and by the time the water is cold the flowers will have revived then cut afresh the ends of the stems and keep them in fresh cold water upper and under housemaids 2291 housemaids in large establishments have usually one or more assistants in this case they are upper and under housemaids dividing the work between them the upper housemaid will probably reserve for herself the task of dusting the ornaments and cleaning the furniture of the principal apartments but it is her duty to see that every department is properly attended to the number of assistants depends on the number in the family as well as on the style in which the establishment is kept up in wealthy families it is not unusual for every grownup daughter to have her waitingmaid whose duty it is to keep her mistresss apartments in order thus abridging the housemaids duties in others perhaps one waitingmaid attends on two or three when the housemaids assistance will be more requisite in fact every establishment has some customs peculiar to itself on which we need not dwell the general duties are the same in all perfect cleanliness and order being the object duties of the housemaid 2292 cleanliness is next to godliness saith the proverb and order is in the next degree the housemaid then may be said to be the handmaiden to two of the most prominent virtues her duties are very numerous and many of the comforts of the family depend on their performance but they are simple and easy to a person naturally clean and orderly and desirous of giving satisfaction in all families whatever the habits of the master and mistress servants will find it advantageous to rise early their daily work will thus come easy to them if they rise late there is a struggle to overtake it which throws an air of haste and hurry over the whole establishment where the masters time is regulated by early business or professional engagements this will of course regulate the hours of the servants but even where that is not the case servants will find great personal convenience in rising early and getting through their work in an orderly and methodical manner the housemaid who studies her own ease will certainly be at her work by six oclock in the summer and probably halfpast six or seven in the winter months having spent a reasonable time in her own chamber in dressing earlier than this would probably be an unnecessary waste of coals and candle in winter 2293 the first duty of the housemaid in winter is to open the shutters of all the lower rooms in the house and take up the hearthrugs of those rooms which she is going to do before breakfast in some families where there is only a cook and housemaid kept and where the drawingrooms are large the cook has the care of the diningroom and the housemaid that of the breakfastroom library and drawingrooms after the shutters are all opened she sweeps the breakfastroom sweeping the dust towards the fireplace of course previously removing the fonder she should then lay a cloth generally made of coarse wrappering over the carpet in front of the stove and on this should place her housemaids box containing blacklead brushes leathers emerypaper cloth black lead and all utensils necessary for cleaning a grate with the cinderpail on the other side illustration carpetbrooms 2294 she now sweeps up the ashes and deposits them in her cinderpail which is a japanned tin pail with a wiresifter inside and a closelyfitting top in this pail the cinders are sifted and reserved for use in the kitchen or under the copper the ashes only being thrown away the cinders disposed of she proceeds to blacklead the grate producing the black lead the soft brush for laying it on her blacking and polishing brushes from the box which contains her tools this housemaids box should be kept well stocked having blackened brushed and polished every part and made all clean and bright she now proceeds to lay the fire sometimes it is very difficult to get a proper polish to black grates particularly if they have been neglected and allowed to rust at all brunswick black which is an excellent varnish for grates may be prepared in the following manner illustration stove brushes illustration housemaids box 2295 ingredients1 lb of common asphaltum 12 pint of linseed oil 1 quart of oil of turpentine modemelt the asphaltum and add gradually to it the other two ingredients apply this with a small painters brush and leave it to become perfectly dry the grate will need no other cleaning but will merely require dusting every day and occasionally brushing with a dry blacklead brush this is of course when no fires are used when they are required the bars cheeks and back of the grate will need blackleading in the usual manner 2296 firelighting however simple is an operation requiring some skill a fire is readily made by laying a few cinders at the bottom in open order over this a few pieces of paper and over that again eight or ten pieces of dry wood over the wood a course of moderatesized pieces of coal taking care to leave hollow spaces between for air at the centre and taking care to lay the whole well back in the grate so that the smoke may go up the chimney and not into the room this done fire the paper with a match from below and if properly laid it will soon burn up the stream of flame from the wood and paper soon communicating to the coals and cinders provided there is plenty of air at the centre 2297 a new method of lighting a fire is sometimes practised with advantage the fire lighting from the top and burning down in place of being lighted and burning up from below this is arranged by laying the coals at the bottom mixed with a few goodsized cinders and the wood at the top with another layer of coals and some paper over it the paper is lighted in the usual way and soon burns down to a good fire with some economy of fuel as is said 2298 bright grates require unceasing attention to keep them in perfect order a day should never pass without the housemaid rubbing with a dry leather the polished parts of a grate as also the fender and fireirons a careful and attentive housemaid should have no occasion ever to use emerypaper for any part but the bars which of course become blackened by the fire some mistresses to save labour have a double set of bars one set bright for the summer and another black set to use when fires are in requisition when bright grates are once neglected small rustspots begin to show themselves which a plain leather will not remove the following method of cleaning them must then be resorted tofirst thoroughly clean with emerypaper then take a large smooth pebble from the road sufficiently large to hold comfortably in the hand with which rub the steel backwards and forwards one way until the desired polish is obtained it may appear at first to scratch but continue rubbing and the result will be success the following is also an excellent polish for bright stoves and steel articles 2299 ingredients1 tablespoonful of turpentine 1 ditto of sweet oil emery powder modemix the turpentine and sweet oil together stirring in sufficient emery powder to make the mixture of the thickness of cream put it on the article with a piece of soft flannel rub off quickly with another piece then polish with a little dry emery powder and clean leather 2300 the several fires lighted the housemaid proceeds with her dusting and polishing the several pieces of furniture in the breakfastparlour leaving no corner unvisited before sweeping the carpet it is a good practice to sprinkle it all over with tealeaves which not only lay all dust but give a slightly fragrant smell to the room it is now in order for the reception of the family and where there is neither footman nor parlourmaid she now proceeds to the dressingroom and lights her mistresss fire if she is in the habit of having one to dress by her mistress is called hot water placed in the dressingroom for her use her clothesas far as they are under the housemaids chargeput before the fire to air hanging a fireguard on the bars where there is one while she proceeds to prepare the breakfast 2301 in summer the housemaids work is considerably abridged she throws open the windows of the several rooms not occupied as bedrooms that they may receive the fresh morning air before they are occupied she prepares the breakfastroom by sweeping the carpet rubbing tables and chairs dusting mantelshelf and pictureframes with a light brush dusting the furniture and beating and sweeping the rug she cleans the grate when necessary and replaces the white paper or arranges the shavings with which it is filled leaving everything clean and tidy for breakfast it is not enough however in cleaning furniture just to pass lightly over the surface the rims and legs of tables and the backs and legs of chairs and sofas should be rubbed vigorously daily if there is a bookcase every corner of every pane and ledge requires to be carefully wiped so that not a speck of dust can be found in the room 2302 after the breakfastroom is finished the housemaid should proceed to sweep down the stairs commencing at the top whilst the cook has the charge of the hall doorstep and passages after this she should go into the drawingroom cover up every article of furniture that is likely to spoil with large dustingsheets and put the chairs together by turning them seat to seat and in fact make as much room as possible by placing all the loose furniture in the middle of the room whilst she sweeps the corners and sides when this is accomplished the furniture can then be put back in its place and the middle of the room swept sweeping the dirt as before said towards the fireplace the same rules should be observed in cleaning the drawingroom grates as we have just stated putting down the cloth before commencing to prevent the carpet from getting soiled in the country a room would not require sweeping thoroughly like this more than twice a week but the housemaid should go over it every morning with a dustpan and broom taking up every crumb and piece she may see after the sweeping she should leave the room shut the door and proceed to lay the breakfast where there is neither footman nor parlourmaid kept the duty of laying the breakfastcloth rests on the housemaid illustration banisterbroom illustration staircasebroom 2303 before laying the cloth for breakfast the heater of the teaurn is to be placed in the hottest part of the kitchen fire or where the kettle is used boiled on the kitchen fire and then removed to the parlour where it is kept hot having washed herself free from the dust arising from the mornings work the housemaid collects the breakfastthings on her tray takes the breakfastcloth from the napkin press and carries them all on the tray into the parlour arranges them on the table placing a sufficiency of knives forks and saltcellars for the family and takes the tray back to the pantry gets a supply of milk cream and bread fills the butterdish taking care that the salt is plentiful and soft and dry and that hot plates and eggcups are ready where warm meat or eggs are served and that butterknife and breadknife are in their places and now she should give the signal for breakfast holding herself ready to fill the urn with hot water or hand the kettle and take in the rolls toast and other eatables with which the cook supplies her when the breakfastroom bell rings bearing in mind that she is never to enter the parlour with dirty hands or with a dirty apron and that everything is to be handed on a tray that she is to hand everything she may be required to supply on the left hand of the person she is serving and that all is done quietly and without bustle or hurry in some families where there is a large number to attend on the cook waits at breakfast whilst the housemaid is busy upstairs in the bedrooms or sweeping dusting and putting the drawingroom in order 2304 breakfast served the housemaid proceeds to the bedchambers throws up the sashes if not already done pulls up the blinds throwing back curtains at the same time and opens the beds by removing the clothes placing them over a horse or failing that over the backs of chairs she now proceeds to empty the slops in doing this everything is emptied into the sloppail leaving a little scaldinghot water for a minute in such vessels as require it adding a drop of turpentine to the water when that is not sufficient to cleanse them the basin is emptied well rinsed with clean water and carefully wiped the ewers emptied and washed finally the waterjugs themselves emptied out and rinsed and wiped dry as soon as this is done she should remove and empty the pails taking care that they also are well washed scalded and wiped as soon as they are empty 2305 next follows bedmaking at which the cook or kitchenmaid where one is kept usually assists but before beginning velvet chairs or other things injured by dust should be removed to another room in bedmaking the fancy of its occupant should be consulted some like beds sloping from the top towards the feet swelling slightly in the middle others perfectly flat a good housemaid will accommodate each bed to the taste of the sleeper taking care to shake beat and turn it well in the process some persons prefer sleeping on the mattress in which case a feather bed is usually beneath resting on a second mattress and a straw paillasse at the bottom in this case the mattresses should change places daily the feather bed placed on the mattress shaken beaten taken up and opened several times so as thoroughly to separate the feathers if too large to be thus handled the maid should shake and beat one end first and then the other smoothing it afterwards equally all over into the required shape and place the mattress gently over it any feathers which escape in this process a tidy servant will put back through the seam of the tick she will also be careful to sew up any stitch that gives way the moment it is discovered the bedclothes are laid on beginning with an under blanket and sheet which are tucked under the mattress at the bottom the bolster is then beaten and shaken and put on the top of the sheet rolled round it and the sheet tucked in all round the pillows and other bedclothes follow and the counterpane over all which should fall in graceful folds and at equal distance from the ground all round the curtains are drawn to the head and folded neatly across the bed and the whole finished in a smooth and graceful manner where springmattresses are used care should be taken that the top one is turned every day the housemaid should now take up in a dustpan any pieces that may be on the carpet she should dust the room shut the door and proceed to another room when all the bedrooms are finished she should dust the stairs and polish the handrail of the banisters and see that all ledges windowsills c are quite free from dust it will be necessary for the housemaid to divide her work so that she may not have too much to do on certain days and not sufficient to fill up her time on other days in the country bedrooms should be swept and thoroughly cleaned once a week and to be methodical and regular in her work the housemaid should have certain days for doing certain rooms thoroughly for instance the drawingroom on monday two bedrooms on tuesday two on wednesday and so on reserving a day for thoroughly cleaning the plate bedroom candlesticks c c which she will have to do where there is no parlourmaid or footman kept by this means the work will be divided and there will be no unnecessary bustling and hurrying as is the case where the work is done any time without rule or regulation illustration scrubbingbrush 2306 once a week when a bedroom is to be thoroughly cleaned the housemaid should commence by brushing the mattresses of the bed before it is made she should then make it shake the curtains lay them smoothly on the bed and pin or tuck up the bottom valance so that she may be able to sweep under the bed she should then unloop the windowcurtains shake them and pin them high up out of the way after clearing the dressingtable and the room altogether of little articles of china c c she should shake the toiletcovers fold them up and lay them on the bed over which a large dustingsheet should be thrown she should then sweep the room first of all sprinkling the carpet with wellsqueezed tealeaves or a little freshlypulled grass when this is obtainable after the carpet is swept and the grate cleaned she should wash with soap and water with a little soda in it the washingtable apparatus removing all marks or fur round the jugs caused by the water the waterbottles and tumblers must also have her attention as well as the top of the washingstand which should be cleaned with soap and flannel if it be marble if of polished mahogany no soap must be used when these are all clean and arranged in their places the housemaid should scrub the floor where it is not covered with carpet under the beds and round the wainscot she should use as little soap and soda as possible as too free a use of these articles is liable to give the boards a black appearance in the country cold soft water a clean scrubbingbrush and a willing arm are all that are required to make bedroom floors look white in winter it is not advisable to scrub rooms too often as it is difficult to dry them thoroughly at that season of the year and nothing is more dangerous than to allow persons to sleep in a damp room the housemaid should now dust the furniture blinds ornaments c polish the lookingglass arrange the toiletcover and muslin remove the cover from the bed and straighten and arrange the curtains and counterpane a bedroom should be cleaned like this every week there are times however when it is necessary to have the carpet up this should be done once a year in the country and twice a year in large cities the best time for these arrangements is spring and autumn when the bedfurniture requires changing to suit the seasons of the year after arranging the furniture it should all be well rubbed and polished and for this purpose the housemaid should provide herself with an old silk pockethandkerchief to finish the polishing illustration long hairbroom 2307 as modern furniture is now nearly always frenchpolished it should often be rubbed with an old silk rubber or a fine cloth or duster to keep it free from smears three or four times a year any of the following polishes may be applied with very great success as any of them make frenchpolished furniture look very well one precaution must be takennot to put too much of the polish on at one time and to rub not smear it over the articles furniture polish 2308 ingredients14 pint of linseedoil 14 pint of vinegar 1 oz of spirits of salts 12 oz of muriatic antimony modemix all well together and shake before using furniture polish 2309 ingredientsequal proportions of linseedoil turpentine vinegar and spirits of wine modewhen used shake the mixture well and rub on the furniture with a piece of linen rag and polish with a clean duster vinegar and oil rubbed in with flannel and the furniture rubbed with a clean duster produce a very good polish furniture paste 2310 ingredients3 oz of common beeswax 1 oz of white wax 1 oz of curd soap 1 pint of turpentine 1 pint of boiled water illustration furniture brush modemix the ingredients together adding the water when cold shake the mixture frequently in the bottle and do not use it for 48 hours after it is made it should be applied with a piece of flannel the furniture polished with a duster and then with an old silk rubber 2311 the chambers are finished the chamber candlesticks brought down and cleaned the parlour lamps trimmedand here the housemaids utmost care is required in cleaning candlesticks as in every other cleaning she should have cloths and brushes kept for that purpose alone the knife used to scrape them should be applied to no other purpose the tallowgrease should be thrown into a box kept for the purpose the same with everything connected with the lamptrimming the best mode of doing which she will do well to learn from the tradesman who supplies the oil always bearing in mind however that without perfect cleanliness which involves occasional scalding no lamp can be kept in order 2312 the drawing and diningroom inasmuch as everything there is more costly and valuable require even more care when the carpets are of the kind known as velvetpile they require to be swept firmly by a hard whisk brush made of cocoanut fibre 2313 the furniture must be carefully gone over in every corner with a soft cloth that it may be left perfectly free from dust or where that is beyond reach with a brush made of long feathers or a gooses wing the sofas are swept in the same manner slightly beaten the cushions shaken and smoothed the pictureframes swept and everything arranged in its proper place this of course applies to dining as well as drawingroom and morningroom and now the housemaid may dress herself for the day and prepare for the family dinner at which she must attend 2314 we need not repeat the long instructions already given for laying the dinnertable at the family dinner even where no footman waits the routine will be the same in most families the cloth is laid with the slips on each side with napkins knives forks spoons and wine and finger glasses on all occasions illustration butlers tray and stand 2315 she should ascertain that her plate is in order glasses free from smears waterbottles and decanters the same and everything ready on her tray that she may be able to lay her cloth properly few things add more to the neat and comfortable appearance of a dinnertable than wellpolished plate indeed the state of the plate is a certain indication of a wellmanaged or illmanaged household nothing is easier than to keep plate in good order and yet many servants from stupidity and ignorance make it the greatest trouble of all things under their care it should be remembered that it is utterly impossible to make greasy silver take a polish and that as spoons and forks in daily use are continually in contact with grease they must require good washing in soapandwater to remove it silver should be washed with a soapy flannel in one water rinsed in another and then wiped dry with a dry cloth the plate so washed may be polished with the platerags as in the following directionsonce a week all the plate should receive a thorough cleaning with the hartshorn powder as directed in the first recipe for cleaning plate and where the housemaid can find time rubbed every day with the platerags 2316 hartshorn we may observe is one of the best possible ingredients for platepowder in daily use it leaves on the silver a deep dark polish and at the same time does less injury than anything else it has also the advantage of being very cheap almost all the ordinary powders sold in boxes containing more or less of quicksilver in some form or another and this in process of time is sure to make the plate brittle if any one wishes to be convinced of the effect of quicksilver on plate he has only to rub a little of it on one place for some timeon the handle of a silver teaspoon for instance and he will find it break in that spot with very little pressure to clean plate a very excellent method illustration platebrush 2317 wash the plate well to remove all grease in a strong lather of common yellow soap and boiling water and wipe it quite dry then mix as much hartshorn powder as will be required into a thick paste with cold water or spirits of wine smear this lightly over the plate with a piece of soft rag and leave it for some little time to dry when perfectly dry brush it off quite clean with a soft platebrush and polish the plate with a dry leather if the plate be very dirty or much tarnished spirits of wine will be found to answer better than the water for mixing the paste platerags for daily use 2318 boil soft rags nothing is better for the purpose than the tops of old cotton stockings in a mixture of new milk and hartshorn powder in the proportion of 1 oz of powder to a pint of milk boil them for 5 minutes wring them as soon as they are taken out for a moment in cold water and dry them before the fire with these rags rub the plate briskly as soon as it has been well washed and dried after daily use a most beautiful deep polish will be produced and the plate will require nothing more than merely to be dusted with a leather or a dry soft cloth before it is again put on the table 2319 for waiting at table the housemaid should be neatly and cleanly dressed and if possible her dress made with closed sleeves the large open ones dipping and falling into everything on the table and being very much in the way she should not wear creaking boots and should move about the room as noiselessly as possible anticipating peoples wants by handing them things without being asked for them and altogether be as quiet as possible it will be needless here to repeat what we have already said respecting waiting at table in the duties of the butler and footman rules that are good to be observed by them are equally good for the parlourmaid or housemaid 2320 the housemaid having announced that dinner is on the table will hand the soup fish meat or sidedishes to the different members of the family but in families who do not spend much of the day together they will probably prefer being alone at dinner and breakfast the housemaid will be required after all are helped if her master does not wish her to stay in the room to go on with her work of cleaning up in the pantry and answer the bell when rung in this case she will place a pile of plates on the table or a dumbwaiter within reach of her master and mistress and leave the room illustration crumbbrush 2321 dinner over the housemaid removes the plates and dishes on the tray places the dirty knives and forks in the basket prepared for them folds up the napkins in the ring which indicates by which member of the family it has been used brushes off the crumbs on the handtray kept for the purpose folds up the tablecloth in the folds already made and places it in the linenpress to be smoothed out after every meal the table should be rubbed all marks from hot plates removed and the tablecover thrown over and the room restored to its usual order if the family retire to the drawingroom or any other room it is a good practice to throw up the sash to admit fresh air and ventilate the room 2322 the housemaids evening service consists in washing up the dinnerthings the plate plated articles and glasses restoring everything to its place cleaning up her pantry and putting away everything for use when next required lastly preparing for tea as the time approaches by setting the things out on the tray getting the urn or kettle ready with cream and other things usually partaken of at that meal 2323 in summertime the windows of all the bedrooms which have been closed during the heat of the day should be thrown open for an hour or so after sunset in order to air them before dark they should be closed the bedclothes turned down and the nightclothes laid in order for use when required during winter where fires are required in the dressingrooms they should be lighted an hour before the usual time of retiring placing a fireguard before each fire at the same time the nightthings on the horse should be placed before it to be aired with a tin can of hot water if the mistress is in the habit of washing before going to bed we may add that there is no greater preservative of beauty than washing the face every night in hot water the housemaid will probably be required to assist her mistress to undress and put her dress in order for the morrow in which case her duties are very much those of the ladysmaid 2324 and now the fire is made up for the night the fireguard replaced and everything in the room in order for the night the housemaid taking care to leave the nightcandle and matches together in a convenient place should they be required it is usual in summer to remove all highly fragrant flowers from sleepingrooms the impression being that their scent is injurious in a close chamber 2325 on leisure days the housemaid should be able to do some needlework for her mistresssuch as turning and mending sheets and darning the house linen or assist her in anything she may think fit to give her to do for this reason it is almost essential that a housemaid in a small family should be an expert needlewoman as if she be a good manager and an active girl she will have time on her hands to get through plenty of work 2326 periodical cleaningsbesides the daily routine which we have described there are portions of every house which can only be thoroughly cleaned occasionally at which time the whole house usually undergoes a more thorough cleaning than is permitted in the general way on these occasions it is usual to begin at the top of the house and clean downwards moving everything out of the room washing the wainscoting or paint with soft soap and water pulling down the beds and thoroughly cleansing all the joints scrubbing the floor beating feather beds mattress and paillasse and thoroughly purifying every article of furniture before it is put back in its place 2327 this general cleaning usually takes place in the spring or early summer when the warm curtains of winter are replaced by the light and cheerful muslin curtains carpets are at the same time taken up and beaten except where the mistress of the house has been worried into an experiment by the oftenreiterated question why beat your carpets in this case she will probably have made up her mind to try the cleaning process and arranged with the company to send for them on the morning when cleaning commenced it is hardly necessary to repeat that on this occasion every article is to be gone over the frenchpolished furniture well rubbed and polished the same thorough system of cleaning should be done throughout the house the walls cleaned where painted and swept down with a soft broom or feather brush where papered the window and bed curtains which have been replaced with muslin ones carefully brushed or if they require it cleaned lamps not likely to be required washed out with hot water dried and cleaned the several grates are now to be furnished with their summer ornaments and we know none prettier than the following which the housemaid may provide at a small expense to her mistresspurchase two yards and a half of crinoline muslin and tear it into small strips the selvage way of the material about an inch wide strip this thread by thread on each side leaving the four centre threads this gives about sixandthirty pieces fringed on each side which are tied together at one end and fastened to the trap of the register while the threads unravelled are spread gracefully about the grate the lower part of which is filled with paper shavings this makes a very elegant and very cheap ornament which is much stronger besides than those usually purchased illustration cornicebrush illustration housepail illustration dustingbrush 2328 as winter approaches this housecleaning will have to be repeated and the warm bed and window curtains replaced the process of scouring and cleaning is again necessary and must be gone through beginning at the top and going through the house down to the kitchens 2329 independently of these daily and periodical cleanings other occupations will present themselves from time to time which the housemaid will have to perform when spots show on polished furniture they can generally be restored by soapandwater and a sponge the polish being brought out by using a little polish and then well rubbing it again drawers which draw out stiffly may be made to move more easily if the spot where they press is rubbed over with a little soap 2330 chips broken off any of the furniture should be collected and replaced by means of a little glue applied to it liquid glue which is sold prepared in bottles is very useful to have in the house as it requires no melting and anything broken can be so quickly repaired 2331 breaking glass and china is about the most disagreeable thing that can happen in a family and it is probably a greater annoyance to a rightminded servant than to the mistress a neathanded housemaid may sometimes repair these breakages where they are not broken in very conspicuous places by joining the pieces very neatly together with a cement made as followsdissolve an ounce of gum mastic in a quantity of highlyrectified spirits of wine then soften an ounce of isinglass in warm water and finally dissolve it in rum or brandy till it forms a thick jelly mix the isinglass and gum mastic together adding a quarter of an ounce of finelypowdered gum ammoniac put the whole into an earthen pipkin and in a warm place till they are thoroughly incorporated together pour it into a small phial and cork it down for use 2332 in using it dissolve a small piece of the cement in a silver teaspoon over a lighted candle the broken pieces of glass or china being warmed and touched with the now liquid cement join the parts neatly together and hold in their places till the cement has set then wipe away the cement adhering to the edge of the joint and leave it for twelve hours without touching it the joint will be as strong as the china itself and if neatly done it will show no joining it is essential that neither of the pieces be wetted either with hot or cold water useful recipes for housemaids to clean marble 2333 mix with 14 pint of soap lees 12 gill of turpentine sufficient pipeclay and bullocks gall to make the whole into rather a thick paste apply it to the marble with a soft brush and after a day or two when quite dry rub it off with a soft rag apply this a second or third time till the marble is quite clean another method 2334 take two parts of soda one of pumicestone and one of finelypowdered chalk sift these through a fine sieve and mix them into a paste with water rub this well all over the marble and the stains will be removed then wash it with soapandwater and a beautiful bright polish will be produced to clean floorcloth 2335 after having washed the floorcloth in the usual manner with a damp flannel wet it all over with milk and rub it well with a dry cloth when a most beautiful polish will be brought out some persons use for rubbing a wellwaxed flannel but this in general produces an unpleasant slipperiness which is not the case with the milk to clean decanters 2336 roll up in small pieces some soft brown or blotting paper wet them and soap them well put them into the decanters about one quarter full of warm water shake them well for a few minutes then rinse with clear cold water wipe the outsides with a nice dry cloth put the decanters to drain and when dry they will be almost as bright as new ones to brighten gilt frames 2337 take sufficient flour of sulphur to give a golden tinge to about 112 pint of water and in this boil 4 or 5 bruised onions or garlic which will answer the same purpose strain off the liquid and with it when cold wash with a soft brush any gilding which requires restoring and when dry it will come out as bright as new work to preserve bright grates or fireirons from rust 2338 make a strong paste of fresh lime and water and with a fine brush smear it as thickly as possible over all the polished surface requiring preservation by this simple means all the grates and fireirons in an empty house may be kept for months free from harm without further care or attention german furnituregloss 2339 ingredients12 lb yellow wax 1 oz black rosin 2 oz of oil of turpentine modecut the wax into small pieces and melt it in a pipkin with the rosin pounded very fine stir in gradually while these two ingredients are quite warm the oil of turpentine keep this composition well covered for use in a tin or earthen pot a little of this gloss should be spread on a piece of coarse woollen cloth and the furniture well rubbed with it afterwards it should be polished with a fine cloth duties of the maidofallwork 2340 the general servant or maidofallwork is perhaps the only one of her class deserving of commiseration her life is a solitary one and in some places her work is never done she is also subject to rougher treatment than either the house or kitchenmaid especially in her earlier career she starts in life probably a girl of thirteen with some small tradesmans wife as her mistress just a step above her in the social scale and although the class contains among them many excellent kindhearted women it also contains some very rough specimens of the feminine gender and to some of these it occasionally falls to give our maidofallwork her first lessons in her multifarious occupations the mistresss commands are the measure of the maidofallworks duties by the time she has become a tolerable servant she is probably engaged in some respectable tradesmans house where she has to rise with the lark for she has to do in her own person all the work which in larger establishments is performed by cook kitchenmaid and housemaid and occasionally the part of a footmans duty which consists in carrying messages 2341 the general servants duties commence by opening the shutters and windows if the weather permits of all the lower apartments in the house she should then brush up her kitchenrange light the fire clear away the ashes clean the hearth and polish with a leather the bright parts of the range doing all as rapidly and as vigorously as possible that no more time be wasted than is necessary after putting on the kettle she should then proceed to the diningroom or parlour to get it in order for breakfast she should first roll up the rug take up the fender shake and fold up the tablecloth then sweep the room carrying the dirt towards the fireplace a coarse cloth should then be laid down over the carpet and she should proceed to clean the grate having all her utensils close to her when the grate is finished the ashes cleared away the hearth cleaned and the fender put back in its place she must dust the furniture not omitting the legs of the tables and chairs and if there are any ornaments or things on the sideboard she must not dust round them but lift them up on to another place dust well where they have been standing and then replace the things nothing annoys a particular mistress so much as to find when she comes down stairs different articles of furniture looking as if they had never been dusted if the servant is at all methodical and gets into a habit of doing a room in a certain way she will scarcely ever leave her duties neglected after the rug is put down the tablecloth arranged and everything in order she should lay the cloth for breakfast and then shut the diningroom door 2342 the hall must now be swept the mats shaken the doorstep cleaned and any brass knockers or handles polished up with the leather if the family breakfast very early the tidying of the hall must then be deferred till after that meal after cleaning the boots that are absolutely required the servant should now wash her hands and face put on a clean white apron and be ready for her mistress when she comes down stairs in families where there is much work to do before breakfast the master of the house frequently has two pairs of boots in wear so that they may be properly cleaned when the servant has more time to do them in the daytime this arrangement is perhaps scarcely necessary in the summertime when there are no grates to clean every morning but in the dark days of winter it is only kind and thoughtful to lighten a servantofallworks duties as much as possible illustration blackingbrush box 2343 she will now carry the urn into the diningroom where her mistress will make the tea or coffee and sometimes will boil the eggs to insure them being done to her liking in the mean time the servant cooks if required the bacon kidneys fish cif cold meat is to be served she must always send it to table on a clean dish and nicely garnished with tufts of parsley if this is obtainable 2344 after she has had her own breakfast and whilst the family are finishing theirs she should go upstairs into the bedrooms open all the windows strip the clothes off the beds and leave them to air whilst she is clearing away the breakfast things she should then take up the crumbs in a dustpan from under the table put the chairs in their places and sweep up the hearth 2345 the breakfast things washed up the kitchen should be tidied so that it may be neat when her mistress comes in to give the orders for the day after receiving these orders the servant should go upstairs again with a jug of boiling water the sloppail and two cloths after emptying the slops and scalding the vessels with the boiling water and wiping them thoroughly dry she should wipe the top of the washtable and arrange it all in order she then proceeds to make the beds in which occupation she is generally assisted by the mistress or if she have any daughters by one of them before commencing to make the bed the servant should put on a large bedapron kept for this purpose only which should be made very wide to button round the waist and meet behind while it should be made as long as the dress by adopting this plan the blacks and dirt on servants dresses which at all times it is impossible to help will not rub off on to the bedclothes mattresses and bed furniture when the beds are made the rooms should be dusted the stairs lightly swept down hall furniture closets c dusted the lady of the house where there is but one servant kept frequently takes charge of the drawingroom herself that is to say dusting it the servant sweeping cleaning windows lookingglasses grates and rough work of that sort if there are many ornaments and knickknacks about the room it is certainly better for the mistress to dust these herself as a maidofallworks hands are not always in a condition to handle delicate ornaments 2346 now she has gone the rounds of the house and seen that all is in order the servant goes to her kitchen to see about the cooking of the dinner in which very often her mistress will assist her she should put on a coarse apron with a bib to do her dirty work in which may be easily replaced by a white one if required 2347 half an hour before dinner is ready she should lay the cloth that everything may be in readiness when she is dishing up the dinner and take all into the diningroom that is likely to be required in the way of knives forks spoons bread salt water c c by exercising a little forethought much confusion and trouble may be saved both to mistress and servant by getting everything ready for the dinner in good time 2348 after taking in the dinner when every one is seated she removes the covers hands the plates round and pours out the beer and should be careful to hand everything on the left side of the person she is waiting on 2349 we need scarcely say that a maidofallwork cannot stay in the diningroom during the whole of dinnertime as she must dish up her pudding or whatever is served after the first course when she sees every one helped she should leave the room to make her preparations for the next course and anything that is required such as bread c people may assist themselves to in the absence of the servant 2350 when the dinner things are cleared away the servant should sweep up the crumbs in the diningroom sweep the hearth and lightly dust the furniture then sit down to her own dinner illustration knifecleaning machine 2351 after this she washes up and puts away the dinner things sweeps the kitchen dusts and tidies it and puts on the kettle for tea she should now before dressing herself for the afternoon clean her knives boots and shoes and do any other dirty work in the scullery that may be necessary knifecleaning machines are rapidly taking the place in most households of the old knifeboard the saving of labour by the knifecleaner is very great and its performance of the work is very satisfactory small and large machines are manufactured some cleaning only four knives whilst others clean as many as twelve at once nothing can be more simple than the process of machine knifecleaning and although in a very limited household the substitution of the machine for the board may not be necessary yet we should advise all housekeepers to whom the outlay is not a difficulty to avail themselves of the services of a machine we have already spoken of its management in the duties of the footman no 2177 2352 when the servant is dressed she takes in the tea and after tea turns down the beds sees that the waterjugs and bottles are full closes the windows and draws down the blinds if the weather is very warm these are usually left open until the last thing at night to cool the rooms 2353 the routine of a general servants duties depends upon the kind of situation she occupies but a systematic maidofallwork should so contrive to divide her work that every day in the week may have its proper share by this means she is able to keep the house clean with less fatigue to herself than if she left all the cleaning to do at the end of the week supposing there are five bedrooms in the house two sittingrooms kitchen scullery and the usual domestic officeson monday she should thoroughly clean the drawingroom on tuesday two of the bedrooms on wednesday two more on thursday the other bedroom and stairs on friday morning she should sweep the diningroom very thoroughly clean the hall and in the afternoon her kitchen tins and bright utensils by arranging her work in this manner no undue proportion will fall to saturdays share and she will then have this day for cleaning plate cleaning her kitchen and arranging everything in nice order the regular work must of course be performed in the usual manner as we have endeavoured to describe 2354 before retiring to bed she will do well to clean up glasses plates c which have been used for the evening meal and prepare for her mornings work by placing her wood near the fire on the hob to dry taking care there is no danger of it igniting before she leaves the kitchen for the night before retiring she will have to lock and bolt the doors unless the master undertakes this office himself 2355 if the washing or even a portion of it is done at home it will be impossible for the maidofallwork to do her household duties thoroughly during the time it is about unless she have some assistance usually if all the washing is done at home the mistress hires some one to assist at the washtub and sees to little matters herself in the way of dusting clearing away breakfast things folding starching and ironing the fine things with a little management much can be accomplished provided the mistress be industrious energetic and willing to lend a helping hand let washingweek be not the excuse for having everything in a muddle and although things cannot be cleaned so thoroughly and so much time spent upon them as ordinarily yet the house may be kept tidy and clear from litter without a great deal of exertion either on the part of the mistress or servant we will conclude our remarks with an extract from an admirablywritten book called home truths for home peace the authoress says with respect to the great washamongst all the occasions in which it is most difficult and glorious to keep muddle out of a family the great wash stands preeminent and as very little money is now saved by having everything done at home many ladies with the option of taking another servant or putting out the chief part of the washing have thankfully adopted the latter course she goes on to saywhen a gentleman who dines at home cant bear washing in the house but gladly pays for its being done elsewhere the lady should gratefully submit to his wishes and put out anything in her whole establishment rather than put out a good and generous husband 2356 a bustling and active girl will always find time to do a little needlework for herself if she lives with consistent and reasonable people in the summer evenings she should manage to sit down for two or three hours and for a short time in the afternoon in leisure days a general servants duties are so multifarious that unless she be quick and active she will not be able to accomplish this to discharge these various duties properly is a difficult task and sometimes a thankless office but it must be remembered that a good maidofallwork will make a good servant in any capacity and may be safely taken not only without fear of failure but with every probability of giving satisfaction to her employer duties of the dairymaid 2357 the duties of the dairymaid differ considerably in different districts in scotland wales and some of the northern counties women milk the cows on some of the large dairy farms in other parts of england she takes her share in the milking but in private families the milking is generally performed by the cowkeeper and the dairymaid only receives the milkpails from him morning and night and empties and cleans them preparatory to the next milking her duty being to supply the family with milk cream and butter and other luxuries depending on the milky mothers of the herd 2358 the dairythe object with which gentlemen keep cows is to procure milk unadulterated and sweet butter for themselves and families in order to obtain this however great cleanliness is required and as visitors as well as the mistress of the house sometimes visit the dairy some efforts are usually made to render it ornamental and picturesque the locality is usually fixed near to the house it should neither be exposed to the fierce heat of the summers sun nor to the equally unfavourable frosts of winterit must be both sheltered and shaded if it is a building apart from the house and other offices the walls should be tolerably thick and if hollow the temperature will be more equable the walls inside are usually covered with dutch glazed tiles the flooring also of glazed tiles set in asphalte to resist water and the ceiling lath and plaster or closelyjointed woodwork painted its architecture will be a matter of fancy it should have a northern aspect and a thatched roof is considered most suitable from the shade and shelter it affords and it should contain at least two apartments besides a cool place for storing away butter one of the apartments in which the milk is placed to deposit cream or to ripen for churning is usually surrounded by shelves of marble or slate on which the milkdishes rest but it will be found a better plan to have a large square or round table of stone in the centre with a watertight ledge all round it in which water may remain in hot weather or if some attempt at the picturesque is desired a small fountain might occupy the centre which would keep the apartment cool and fresh round this table the milkdishes should be ranged one shelf or dresser of slate or marble being kept for the various occupations of the dairymaid it will be found a better plan than putting them on shelves and corners against the wall there should be a funnel or ventilator in the ceiling communicating with the open air made to open and shut as required double windows are recommended but of the lattice kind so that they may open and with wiregauze blinds fitted into the opening and calico blinds which may be wetted when additional coolness is required the other apartment will be used for churning washing and scrubbingin fact the scullery of the dairy with a boiler for hot water and a sink with cold water laid on which should be plentiful and good in some dairies a third apartment or at least a cool airy pantry is required for storing away butter with shelves of marble or slate to hold the creamjars while it is ripening and where cheeses are made a fourth becomes necessary the dairy utensils are not numerouschurns milkpails for each cow hairsieves slices of tin milkpans marble dishes for cream for family use scales and weights a portable rack for drying the utensils wooden bowls buttermoulds and butterpatters and wooden tubs for washing the utensils comprising pretty nearly everything 2359 pails are made of maplewood or elm and hooped or of tin more or less ornamented one is required for each cow 2360 the hairsieve is made of closelytwisted horsehair with a rim through which the milk is strained to remove any hairs which may have dropped from the cow in milking 2361 milkdishes are shallow basins of glass of glazed earthenware or tin about 16 inches in diameter at top and 12 at the bottom and 5 or 6 inches deep holding about 8 to 10 quarts each when full 2362 churns are of all sorts and sizes from that which churns 70 or 80 gallons by means of a strap from the engine to the square box in which a pound of butter is made the churn used for families is a square box 18 inches by 12 or 13 and 17 deep bevelled below to the plane of the dashers with a loose lid or cover the dasher consists of an axis of wood to which the four beaters or fanners are attached these fans are simply four pieces of elm strongly dovetailed together forming an oblong square with a space left open two of the openings being left broader than the others attached to an axle they form an axis with four projecting blades the axle fits into supports at the centre of the box a handle is fitted to it and the act of churning is done by turning the handle 2363 such is the temple in which the dairymaid presides it should be removed both from stable and cowhouse and larder no animal smells should come near it and the drainage should be perfect 2364 the dairymaid receives the milk from the cowkeeper each pail being strained through the hairsieve into one of the milkbasins this is left in the basins from twentyfour to thirtysix hours in the summer according to the weather after which it is skimmed off by means of the slicer and poured into glazed earthenware jars to turn for churning some persons prefer making up a separate churning for the milk of each cow in which there is some advantage in this case the basins of each cow for two days would either be kept together or labelled as soon as emptied the pails should be scalded and every particle of milk washed out and placed away in a dry place till next required and all milk spilt on the floor or on the table or dresser cleaned up with a cloth and hot water where very great attention is paid to the dairy the milkcoolers are used larger in winter when it is desirable to retard the cooling down and increase the creamy deposit and smaller in summer to hasten it the temperature required being from 55 to 50 in summer it is sometimes expedient in very sultry weather to keep the dairy fresh and cool by suspending cloths dipped in chloride of lime across the room 2365 in some dairies it is usual to churn twice and in others three times a week the former produces the best butter the other the greatest quantity with three cows the produce should be 27 to 30 quarts a day the dairymaid should churn every day when very hot if they are in full milk and every second day in more temperate weather besides supplying the milk and cream required for a large establishment the churning should always be done in the morning the dairymaid will find it advantageous in being at work on churning mornings by five oclock the operation occupies from 20 minutes to half an hour in summer and considerably longer in winter a steady uniform motion is necessary to produce sweet butter neither too quick nor too slow rapid motion causes the cream to heave and swell from too much air being forced into it the result is a tedious churning and soft badcoloured butter 2366 in spring and summer when the cow has her natural food no artificial colour is required but in winter under stallfeeding the colour is white and tallowy and some persons prefer a higher colour this is communicated by mixing a little finelypowdered arnotto with the cream before putting it into the churn a still more natural and delicate colour is communicated by scraping a red carrot into a clean piece of linen cloth dipping it into water and squeezing it into the cream 2367 as soon as the butter comes the milk is poured off and the butter put into a shallow wooden tub or bowl full of pure spring water in which it is washed and kneaded pouring off the water and renewing it until it comes away perfectly free from milk imperfect washing is the frequent cause of bad butter and in nothing is the skill of the dairymaid tested more than in this process moreover it is one in which cleanliness of habits and person are most necessary in this operation we want the aid of phylliss neat soft and perfectly clean hand for no mechanical operation can so well squeeze out the sour particles of milk or curd 2368 the operations of churning and buttermaking over the buttermilk is disposed of usually in england it goes to the pigs but it is a very wholesome beverage when fresh and some persons like it the disposal therefore will rest with the mistress the dairymaids duty is to get rid of it she must then scald with boiling water and scrub out every utensil she has used brush out the churn clean out the creamjars which will probably require the use of a little common soda to purify wipe all dry and place them in a position where the sun can reach them for a short time to sweeten them 2369 in devonshire celebrated for its dairy system the milk is always scalded the milkpans which are of tin and contain from 10 to 12 quarts after standing 10 or 12 hours are placed on a hot plate of iron over a stove until the cream has formed on the surface which is indicated by the airbubbles rising through the milk and producing blisters on the surfacecoating of cream this indicates its approach to the boiling point and the vessel is now removed to cool when sufficiently that is quite cool the cream is skimmed off with the slice it is now the clouted cream for which devonshire is so famous it is now placed in the churn and churned until the butter comes which it generally does in a much shorter time than by the other process the butter so made contains more caseine than butter made in the usual way but does not keep so long 2370 it is a question frequently discussed how far it is economical for families to keep cows and make their own butter it is calculated that a good cow costs from may 1 to october 1 when well but economically kept 5 16s 6d and from october 1 to april 30 10 2s 6d during that time she should produce 227 lbs of butter besides the skimmed milk of course if new milk and cream are required that will diminish the quantity of butter 2371 besides churning and keeping her dairy in order the dairymaid has charge of the whole produce handing it over to the cook butler or housemaid as required and she will do well to keep an exact account both of what she receives and how and when she disposes of it duties of the laundrymaid 2372 the laundrymaid is charged with the duty of washing and gettingup the family linena situation of great importance where the washing is all done at home but in large towns where there is little convenience for bleaching and drying it is chiefly done by professional laundresses and companies who apply mechanical and chemical processes to the purpose these processes however are supposed to injure the fabric of the linen and in many families the fine linen cottons and muslins are washed and gotup at home even where the bulk of the washing is given out in country and suburban houses where greater conveniences exist washing at home is more commonin country places universal 2373 the laundry establishment consists of a washinghouse an ironing and dryingroom and sometimes a dryingcloset heated by furnaces the washinghouse will probably be attached to the kitchen but it is better that it should be completely detached from it and of one story with a funnel or shaft to carry off the steam it will be of a size proportioned to the extent of the washing to be done a range of tubs either round or oblong opposite to and sloping towards the light narrower at the bottom than the top for convenience in stooping over and fixed at a height suited to the convenience of the women using them each tub having a tap for hot and cold water and another in the bottom communicating with the drains for drawing off foul water a boiler and furnace proportioned in size to the wants of the family should also be fixed the flooring should be york stone laid on brick piers with good drainage or asphalte sloping gently towards a gutter connected with the drain 2374 adjoining the bleachinghouse a second room about the same size is required for ironing drying and mangling the contents of this room should comprise an ironingboard opposite to the light a strong white deal table about twelve or fourteen feet long and about three and a half feet broad with drawers for ironingblankets a mangle in one corner and clotheshorses for drying and airing cupboards for holding the various irons starch and other articles used in ironing a hotplate built in the chimney with furnace beneath it for heating the irons sometimes arranged with a flue for carrying the hot air round the room for drying where this is the case however there should be a funnel in the ceiling for ventilation and carrying off steam but a better arrangement is to have a hotair closet adjoining heated by hotair pipes and lined with iron with proper arrangements for carrying off steam and clotheshorses on castors running in grooves to run into it for drying purposes this leaves the laundry free from unwholesome vapour 2375 the laundrymaid should commence her labours on monday morning by a careful examination of the articles committed to her care and enter them in the washingbook separating the white linen and collars sheets and bodylinen into one heap fine muslins into another coloured cotton and linen fabrics into a third woollens into a fourth and the coarser kitchen and other greasy cloths into a fifth every article should be examined for ink or greasespots or for fruit or winestains inkspots are removed by dipping the part into hot water and then spreading it smoothly on the hand or on the back of a spoon pouring a few drops of oxalic acid or salts of sorel over the inkspot rubbing and rinsing it in cold water till removed greasespots by rubbing over with yellow soap and rinsing in hot water fruit and winespots by dipping in a solution of sal ammonia or spirits of wine and rinsing 2376 every article having been examined and assorted the sheets and fine linen should be placed in one of the tubs and just covered with lukewarm water in which a little soda has been dissolved and mixed and left there to soak till the morning the greasy cloths and dirtier things should be laid to soak in another tub in a liquor composed of 12 lb of unslaked lime to every 6 quarts of water which has been boiled for two hours then left to settle and strained off when clear each article should be rinsed in this liquor to wet it thoroughly and left to soak till the morning just covered by it when the things are pressed together coppers and boilers should now be filled and the fires laid ready to light 2377 early on the following morning the fires should be lighted and as soon as hot water can be procured washing commenced the sheets and bodylinen being wanted to whiten in the morning should be taken first each article being removed in succession from the lye in which it has been soaking rinsed rubbed and wrung and laid aside until the tub is empty when the foul water is drawn off the tub should be again filled with lukewarm water about 80 in which the articles should again be plunged and each gone over carefully with soap and rubbed novices in the art sometimes rub the linen against the skin more experienced washerwomen rub one linen surface against the other which saves their hands and enables them to continue their labour much longer besides economizing time two parts being thus cleaned at once 2378 after this first washing the linen should be put into a second water as hot as the hand can bear and again rubbed over in every part examining every part for spots not yet moved which require to be again soaped over and rubbed till thoroughly clean then rinsed and wrung the larger and stronger articles by two of the women the smaller and more delicate articles requiring gentler treatment 2379 in order to remove every particle of soap and produce a good colour they should now be placed and boiled for about an hour and a half in the copper in which soda in the proportion of a teaspoonful to every two gallons of water has been dissolved some very careful laundresses put the linen into a canvas bag to protect it from the scum and the sides of the copper when taken out it should again be rinsed first in clean hot water and then in abundance of cold water slightly tinged with figblue and again wrung dry it should now be removed from the washinghouse and hung up to dry or spread out to bleach if there are conveniences for it and the earlier in the day this is done the clearer and whiter will be the linen 2380 coloured muslins cottons and linens require a milder treatment any application of soda will discharge the colour and soaking all night even in pure water deteriorates the more delicate tints when ready for washing if not too dirty they should be put into cold water and washed very speedily using the common yellow soap which should be rinsed off immediately one article should be washed at a time and rinsed out immediately before any others are wetted when washed thoroughly they should be rinsed in succession in soft water in which common salt has been dissolved in the proportion of a handful to three or four gallons and afterwards wrung gently as soon as rinsed with as little twisting as possible and then hung out to dry delicatecoloured articles should not be exposed to the sun but dried in the shade using clean lines and wooden pegs 2381 woollen articles are liable to shrink unless the flannel has been well shrunk before making up this liability is increased where very hot water is used cold water would thus be the best to wash woollens in but as this would not remove the dirt lukewarm water about 85 and yellow soap are recommended when thoroughly washed in this they require a good deal of rinsing in cold water to remove the soap 2382 greasy cloths which have soaked all night in the liquid described should be now washed out with soapandwater as hot as the hands can bear first in one water and rinsed out in a second and afterwards boiled for two hours in water in which a little soda is dissolved when taken out they should be rinsed in cold water and laid out or hung up to dry 2383 silk handkerchiefs require to be washed alone when they contain snuff they should be soaked by themselves in lukewarm water two or three hours they should be rinsed out and put to soak with the others in cold water for an hour or two then washed in lukewarm water being soaped as they are washed if this does not remove all stains they should be washed a second time in similar water and when finished rinsed in soft water in which a handful of common salt has been dissolved in washing stuff or woollen dresses the band at the waist and the lining at the bottom should be removed and wherever it is gathered into folds and in furniture the hems and gatherings a black silk dress if very dirty must be washed but if only soiled soaking for fourandtwenty hours will do if old and rusty a pint of common spirits should be mixed with each gallon of water which is an improvement under any circumstances whether soaked or washed it should be hung up to drain and dried without wringing 2384 satin and silk ribbons both white and coloured may be cleaned in the same manner 2385 silks when washed should be dried in the shade on a linenhorse taking care that they are kept smooth and unwrinkled if black or blue they will be improved if laid again on the table when dry and sponged with gin or whiskey or other white spirit 2386 the operations should be concluded by rinsing the tubs cleaning the coppers scrubbing the floors of the washinghouse and restoring everything to order and cleanliness 2387 thursday and friday in a laundry in full employ are usually devoted to mangling starching and ironing 2388 linen cotton and other fabrics after being washed and dried are made smooth and glossy by mangling and by ironing the mangling process which is simply passing them between rollers subjected to a very considerable pressure produced by weight is confined to sheets towels tablelinen and similar articles which are without folds or plaits ironing is necessary to smooth bodylinen and madeup articles of delicate texture or gathered into folds the mangle is too well known to need description 2389 ironingthe irons consist of the common flatiron which is of different sizes varying from 4 to 10 inches in length triangular in form and from 212 to 412 inches in width at the broad end the oval iron which is used for more delicate articles and the boxiron which is hollow and heated by a redhot iron inserted into the box the italian iron is a hollow tube smooth on the outside and raised on a slender pedestal with a footstalk into the hollow cylinder a redhot iron is pushed which heats it and the smooth outside of the latter is used on which articles such as frills and plaited articles are drawn crimping and gaufferingmachines are used for a kind of plaiting where much regularity is required the articles being passed through two iron rollers fluted so as to represent the kind of plait or fold required 2390 starching is a process by which stiffness is communicated to certain parts of linen as the collar and front of shirts by dipping them in a paste made of starch boiled in water mixed with a little gum arabic where extra stiffness is required to make starch 2391 ingredientsallow 12 pint of cold water and 1 quart of boiling water to every 2 tablespoonfuls of starch modeput the starch into a tolerably large basin pour over it the cold water and stir the mixture well with a wooden spoon until it is perfectly free from lumps and quite smooth then take the basin to the fire and whilst the water is actually boiling in the kettle or boiler pour it over the starch stirring it the whole time if made properly in this manner the starch will require no further boiling but should the water not be boiling when added to the starch it will not thicken and must be put into a clean saucepan and stirred over the fire until it boils take it off the fire strain it into a clean basin cover it up to prevent a skin forming on the top and when sufficiently cool that the hand may be borne in it starch the things many persons to give a shiny and smooth appearance to the linen when ironed stir round two or three times in the starch a piece of wax candle which also prevents the iron from sticking 2392 when the things to be starched are washed dried and taken off the lines they should be dipped into the hot starch made as directed squeezed out of it and then just dipped into cold water and immediately squeezed dry if fine things be wrung or roughly used they are very liable to tear so too much care cannot be exercised in this respect if the article is lace clap it between the hands a few times which will assist to clear it then have ready laid out on the table a large clean towel or cloth shake out the starched things lay them on the cloth and roll it up tightly and let it remain for three or fours when the things will be ready to iron 2393 to be able to iron properly requires much practice and experience strict cleanliness with all the ironing utensils must be observed as if this is not the case not the most expert ironer will be able to make her things look clear and free from smears c after wiping down her ironing table the laundrymaid should place a coarse cloth on it and over that the ironingblanket with her stand and ironrubber and having ascertained that her irons are quite clean and of the right heat she proceeds with her work 2394 it is a good plan to try the heat of the iron on a coarse cloth or apron before ironing anything fine there is then no danger of scorching for ironing fine things such as collars cuffs muslins and laces there is nothing so clean and nice to use as the boxiron the bottom being bright and never placed near the fire it is always perfectly clean it should however be kept in a dry place for fear of its rusting gaufferingtongs or irons must be placed in a clear fire for a minute then withdrawn wiped with a coarse rubber and the heat of them tried on a piece of paper as unless great care is taken these will very soon scorch 2395 the skirts of muslin dresses should be ironed on a skirtboard covered with flannel and the fronts of shirts on a smaller board also covered with flannel this board being placed between the back and front 2396 after things are mangled they should also be ironed in the folds and gathers dinnernapkins smoothed over as also tablecloths pillowcases and sometimes sheets the bands of flannel petticoats and shoulderstraps to flannel waistcoats must also undergo the same process upper and under nursemaids 2397 the nursery is of great importance in every family and in families of distinction where there are several young children it is an establishment kept apart from the rest of the family under the charge of an upper nurse assisted by under nurserymaids proportioned to the work to be done the responsible duties of upper nursemaid commence with the weaning of the child it must now be separated from the mother or wetnurse at least for a time and the cares of the nursemaid which have hitherto been only occasionally put in requisition are now to be entirely devoted to the infant she washes dresses and feeds it walks out with it and regulates all its little wants and even at this early age many good qualities are required to do so in a satisfactory manner patience and good temper are indispensable qualities truthfulness purity of manners minute cleanliness and docility and obedience almost equally so she ought also to be acquainted with the art of ironing and trimming little caps and be handy with her needle 2398 there is a considerable art in carrying an infant comfortably for itself and for the nursemaid if she carry it always seated upright on her arm and presses it too closely against her chest the stomach of the child is apt to get compressed and the back fatigued for her own comfort a good nurse will frequently vary this position by changing from one arm to the other and sometimes by laying it across both raising the head a little when teaching it to walk and guiding it by the hand she should change the hand from time to time so as to avoid raising one shoulder higher than the other this is the only way in which a child should be taught to walk leadingstrings and other foolish inventions which force an infant to make efforts with its shoulders and head forward before it knows how to use its limbs will only render it feeble and retard its progress 2399 most children have some bad habit of which they must be broken but this is never accomplished by harshness without developing worse evils kindness perseverance and patience in the nurse are here of the utmost importance when fingersucking is one of these habits the fingers are sometimes rubbed with bitter aloes or some equally disagreeable substance others have dirty habits which are only to be changed by patience perseverance and above all by regularity in the nurse she should never be permitted to inflict punishment on these occasions or indeed on any occasion but if punishment is to be avoided it is still more necessary that all kinds of indulgences and flattery be equally forbidden yielding to all the whims of a childpicking up its toys when thrown away in mere wantonness would be intolerable a child should never be led to think others inferior to it to beat a dog or even the stone against which it falls as some children are taught to do by silly nurses neither should the nurse affect or show alarm at any of the little accidents which must inevitably happen if it falls treat it as a trifle otherwise she encourages a spirit of cowardice and timidity but she will take care that such accidents are not of frequent occurrence or the result of neglect 2400 the nurse should keep the child as clean as possible and particularly she should train it to habits of cleanliness so that it should feel uncomfortable when otherwise watching especially that it does not soil itself in eating at the same time vanity in its personal appearance is not to be encouraged by overcare in this respect or by too tight lacing or buttoning of dresses nor a small foot cultivated by the use of tight shoes 2401 nursemaids would do well to repeat to the parents faithfully and truly the defects they observe in the dispositions of very young children if properly checked in time evil propensities may be eradicated but this should not extend to anything but serious defects otherwise the intuitive perceptions which all children possess will construe the act into spying and informing which should never be resorted to in the case of children nor indeed in any case 2402 such are the cares which devolve upon the nursemaid and it is her duty to fulfil them personally in large establishments she will have assistants proportioned to the number of children of which she has the care the under nursemaid lights the fires sweeps scours and dusts the rooms and makes the beds empties slops and carries up water brings up and removes the nursery meals washes and dresses all the children except the infant and assists in mending where there is a nursery girl to assist she does the rougher part of the cleaning and all take their meals in the nursery together after the children of the family have done 2403 in smaller families where there is only one nursemaid kept she is assisted by the housemaid or servantofallwork who will do the rougher part of the work and carry up the nursery meals in such circumstances she will be more immediately under the eye of her mistress who will probably relieve her from some of the cares of the infant in higher families the upper nurse is usually permitted to sup or dine occasionally at the housekeepers table by way of relaxation when the children are all well and her subordinates trustworthy 2404 where the nurse has the entire charge of the nursery and the mother is too much occupied to do more than pay a daily visit to it it is desirable that she be a person of observation and possess some acquaintance with the diseases incident to childhood as also with such simple remedies as may be useful before a medical attendant can be procured or where such attendance is not considered necessary all these little ailments are preceded by symptoms so minute as to be only perceptible to close observation such as twitching of the brows restless sleep grinding the gums and in some inflammatory diseases even to the child abstaining from crying from fear of the increased pain produced by the movement dentition or cutting the teeth is attended with many of these symptoms measles thrush scarlatina croup hoopingcough and other childish complaints are all preceded by wellknown symptoms which may be alleviated and rendered less virulent by simple remedies instantaneously applied 2405 dentition is usually the first serious trouble bringing many other disorders in its train the symptoms are most perceptible to the mother the child sucks feebly and with gums hot inflamed and swollen in this case relief is yielded by rubbing them from time to time with a little of mrs johnsons soothing syrup a valuable and perfectly safe medicine selfish and thoughtless nurses and mothers too sometimes give cordials and sleepingdraughts whose effects are too well known 2406 convulsion fits sometimes follow the feverish restlessness produced by these causes in which case a hot bath should be administered without delay and the lower parts of the body rubbed the bath being as hot as it can be without scalding the tender skin at the same time the doctor should be sent for immediately for no nurse should administer medicine in this case unless the fits have been repeated and the doctor has left directions with her how to act 2407 croup is one of the most alarming diseases of childhood it is accompanied with a hoarse croaking ringing cough and comes on very suddenly and most so in strong robust children a very hot bath should be instantly administered followed by an emetic either in the form of tartaremetic crouppowder or a teaspoonful of ipecacuanha wrapping the body warmly up in flannel after the bath the slightest delay in administering the bath or the emetic may be fatal hence the importance of nurses about very young children being acquainted with the symptoms 2408 hoopingcough is generally preceded by the moaning noise during sleep which even adults threatened with the disorder cannot avoid it is followed by violent fits of coughing which little can be done to relieve a child attacked by this disorder should be kept as much as possible in the fresh pure air but out of draughts and kept warm and supplied with plenty of nourishing food many fatal diseases flow from this scourge of childhood and a change to purer air if possible should follow convalescence 2409 worms are the torment of some children the symptoms are an unnatural craving for food even after a full meal costiveness suddenly followed by the reverse fetid breath a livid circle under the eyes enlarged abdomen and picking the nose for which the remedies must be prescribed by the doctor 2410 measles and scarlatina much resemble each other in their early stages headache restlessness and fretfulness are the symptoms of both shivering fits succeeded by a hot skin pains in the back and limbs accompanied by sickness and in severe cases sore throat pain about the jaws difficulty in swallowing running at the eyes which become red and inflamed while the face is hot and flushed often distinguish scarlatina and scarlet fever of which it is only a mild form 2411 while the case is doubtful a dessertspoonful of spirit of nitre diluted in water given at bedtime will throw the child into a gentle perspiration and will bring out the rash in either case in measles this appears first on the face in scarlatina on the chest and in both cases a doctor should be called in in scarlatina tartaremetic powder or ipecacuanha may be administered in the mean time 2412 in all cases cleanliness fresh air clean utensils and frequent washing of the person both of nurse and children are even more necessary in the nursery than in either drawingroom or sickroom inasmuch as the delicate organs of childhood are more susceptible of injury from smells and vapours than adults 2413 it may not be out of place if we conclude this brief notice of the duties of a nursemaid by an extract from florence nightingales admirable notes on nursing referring to children she says 2414 they are much more susceptible than grown people to all noxious influences they are affected by the same things but much more quickly and seriously by want of fresh air of proper warmth want of cleanliness in house clothes bedding or body by improper food want of punctuality by dulness by want of light by too much or too little covering in bed or when up and all this in health and then she quotes a passage from a lecture on sudden deaths in infancy to show the importance of careful nursing of childrenin the great majority of instances when death suddenly befalls the infant or young child it is an accident it is not a necessary inevitable result of any disease that which is known to injure children most seriously is foul air keeping the rooms where they sleep closely shut up is destruction to them and if the childs breathing be disordered by disease a few hours only of such foul air may endanger its life even where no inconvenience is felt by grownup persons in the room 2415 persons moving in the beat society will see after perusing miss nightingales book that this foul air want of light too much or too little clothing and improper food is not confined to crown street or st giless that belgravia and the squares have their north room where the rays of the sun never reach a wooden bedstead two or three mattresses piled up to above the height of the table a vallance attached to the framenothing but a miracle could ever thoroughly dry or air such a bed and beddingis the ordinary bed of a private house than which nothing can be more unwholesome dont treat your children like sick she sums up dont dose them with tea let them eat meat and drink milk or half a glass of light beer give them fresh light sunny and open rooms cool bedrooms plenty of outdoor exercise facing even the cold and wind and weather in sufficiently warm clothes and with sufficient exercise plenty of amusements and play more liberty and less schooling and cramming and training more attention to food and less to physic duties of the sicknurse 2416 all women are likely at some period of their lives to be called on to perform the duties of a sicknurse and should prepare themselves as much as possible by observation and reading for the occasion when they may be required to perform the office the main requirements are good temper compassion for suffering sympathy with sufferers which most women worthy of the name possess neathandedness quiet manners love of order and cleanliness with these qualifications there will be very little to be wished for the desire to relieve suffering will inspire a thousand little attentions and surmount the disgusts which some of the offices attending the sickroom are apt to create where serious illness visits a household and protracted nursing is likely to become necessary a professional nurse will probably be engaged who has been trained to its duties but in some families and those not a few let us hope the ladies of the family would oppose such an arrangement as a failure of duty on their part there is besides even when a professional nurse is ultimately called in a period of doubt and hesitation while disease has not yet developed itself when the patient must be attended to and in these cases some of the female servants of the establishment must give their attendance in the sickroom there are also slight attacks of cold influenza and accidents in a thousand forms to which all are subject where domestic nursing becomes a necessity where disease though unattended with danger is nevertheless accompanied by the nervous irritation incident to illness and when all the attention of the domestic nurse becomes necessary 2417 in the first stage of sickness while doubt and a little perplexity hang over the household as to the nature of the sickness there are some things about which no doubt can exist the patients room must be kept in a perfectly pure state and arrangements made for proper attendance for the first canon of nursing according to florence nightingale its apostle is to keep the air the patient breathes as pure as the external air without chilling him this can be done without any preparation which might alarm the patient with proper windows open fireplaces and a supply of fuel the room may be as fresh as it is outside and kept at a temperature suitable for the patients state 2418 windows however must be opened from above and not from below and draughts avoided cool air admitted beneath the patients head chills the lower strata and the floor the careful nurse will keep the door shut when the window is open she will also take care that the patient is not placed between the door and the open window nor between the open fireplace and the window if confined to bed she will see that the bed is placed in a thoroughly ventilated part of the room but out of the current of air which is produced by the momentary opening of doors as well as out of the line of draught between the window and the open chimney and that the temperature of the room is kept about 64 where it is necessary to admit air by the door the windows should be closed but there are few circumstances in which good air can be obtained through the chamberdoor through it on the contrary the gases generated in the lower parts of the house are likely to be drawn into the invalid chamber 2419 these precautions taken and plain nourishing diet such as the patient desires furnished probably little more can be done unless more serious symptoms present themselves in which case medical advice will be sought 2420 under no circumstances is ventilation of the sickroom so essential as in cases of febrile diseases usually considered infectious such as typhus and puerperal fevers influenza hoopingcough small and chickenpox scarlet fever measles and erysipelas all these are considered communicable through the air but there is little danger of infection being thus communicated provided the room is kept thoroughly ventilated on the contrary if this essential be neglected the power of infection is greatly increased and concentrated in the confined and impure air it settles upon the clothes of the attendants and visitors especially where they are of wool and is frequently communicated to other families in this manner 2421 under all circumstances therefore the sickroom should be kept as fresh and sweet as the open air while the temperature is kept up by artificial heat taking care that the fire burns clear and gives out no smoke into the room that the room is perfectly clean wiped over with a damp cloth every day if boarded and swept after sprinkling with damp tealeaves or other aromatic leaves if carpeted that all utensils are emptied and cleaned as soon as used and not once in fourandtwenty hours as is sometimes done a sloppail miss nightingale says should never enter a sickroom everything should be carried direct to the watercloset emptied there and brought up clean in the best hospitals the sloppail is unknown i do not approve says miss nightingale of making housemaids of nursesthat would be waste of means but i have seen surgical sisters women whose hands were worth to them two or three guineas a week down on their knees scouring a room or hut because they thought it was not fit for their patients these women had the true nurse spirit 2422 bad smells are sometimes met by sprinkling a little liquid chloride of lime on the floor fumigation by burning pastiles is also a common expedient for the purification of the sickroom they are useful but only in the sense hinted at by the medical lecturer who commenced his lecture thusfumigations gentlemen are of essential importance they make so abominable a smell that they compel you to open the windows and admit fresh air in this sense they are useful but ineffectual unless the cause be removed and fresh air admitted 2423 the sickroom should be quiet no talking no gossiping and above all no whisperingthis is absolute cruelty to the patient he thinks his complaint the subject and strains his ear painfully to catch the sound no rustling of dresses nor creaking shoes either where the carpets are taken up the nurse should wear list shoes or some other noiseless material and her dress should be of soft material that does not rustle miss nightingale denounces crinoline and quotes lord melbourne on the subject of women in the sickroom who said i would rather have men about me when ill than women it requires very strong health to put up with women ungrateful man but absolute quiet is necessary in the sickroom 2424 never let the patient be waked out of his first sleep by noise never roused by anything like a surprise always sit in the apartment so that the patient has you in view and that it is not necessary for him to turn in speaking to you never keep a patient standing never speak to one while moving never lean on the sickbed above all be calm and decisive with the patient and prevent all noises overhead 2425 a careful nurse when a patient leaves his bed will open the sheets wide and throw the clothes back so as thoroughly to air the bed she will avoid drying or airing anything damp in the sickroom 2426 it is another fallacy says florence nightingale to suppose that night air is injurious a great authority told me that in london the air is never so good as after ten oclock when smoke has diminished but then it must be air from without not within and not air vitiated by gaseous airs a great fallacy prevails also she says in another section about flowers poisoning the air of the sickroom no one ever saw them overcrowding the sickroom but if they did they actually absorb carbonic acid and give off oxygen cut flowers also decompose water and produce oxygen gas lilies and some other very odorous plants may perhaps give out smells unsuited to a close room while the atmosphere of the sickroom should always be fresh and natural 2427 patients says miss nightingale are sometimes starved in the midst of plenty from want of attention to the ways which alone make it possible for them to take food a spoonful of beeftea or arrowroot and wine or some other light nourishing diet should be given every hour for the patients stomach will reject large supplies in very weak patients there is often a nervous difficulty in swallowing which is much increased if food is not ready and presented at the moment when it is wanted the nurse should be able to discriminate and know when this moment is approaching 2428 diet suitable for patients will depend in some degree on their natural likes and dislikes which the nurse will do well to acquaint herself with beeftea is useful and relishing but possesses little nourishment when evaporated it presents a teaspoonful of solid meat to a pint of water eggs are not equivalent to the same weight of meat arrowroot is less nourishing than flour butter is the lightest and most digestible kind of fat cream in some diseases cannot be replaced but to sum up with some of miss nightingales useful maximsobservation is the nurses best guide and the patients appetite the rule half a pint of milk is equal to a quarter of a pound of meat beeftea is the least nourishing food administered to the sick and tea and coffee she thinks are both too much excluded from the sickroom the monthly nurse 2429 the choice of a monthly nurse is of the utmost importance and in the case of a young mother with her first child it would be well for her to seek advice and counsel from her more experienced relatives in this matter in the first place the engaging a monthly nurse in good time is of the utmost importance as if she be competent and clever her services will be sought months beforehand a good nurse having seldom much of her time disengaged there are some qualifications which it is evident the nurse should possess she should be scrupulously clean and tidy in her person honest sober and noiseless in her movements should possess a natural love for children and have a strong nerve in case of emergencies snufftaking and spiritdrinking must not be included in her habits but these are happily much less frequent than they were in former days 2430 receiving as she often will instructions from the doctor she should bear these in mind and carefully carry them out in those instances where she does not feel herself sufficiently informed she should ask advice from the medical man and not take upon herself to administer medicines c without his knowledge 2431 a monthly nurse should be between 30 and 50 years of age sufficiently old to have had a little experience and yet not too old or infirm to be able to perform various duties requiring strength and bodily vigour she should be able to wake the moment she is calledat any hour of the night that the mother or child may have their wants immediately attended to good temper united to a kind and gentle disposition is indispensable and although the nurse will frequently have much to endure from the whims and caprices of the invalid she should make allowances for these and command her temper at the same time exerting her authority when it is necessary 2432 what the nurse has to do in the way of cleaning and dusting her ladys room depends entirely on the establishment that is kept where there are plenty of servants the nurse of course has nothing whatever to do but attend on her patient and ring the bell for anything she may require where the number of domestics is limited she should not mind keeping her room in order that is to say sweeping and dusting it every morning if fires be necessary the housemaid should always clean the grate and do all that is wanted in that way as this being rather dirty work would soil the nurses dress and unfit her to approach the bed or take the infant without soiling its clothes in small establishments too the nurse should herself fetch things she may require and not ring every time she wants anything and she must of course not leave her invalid unless she sees everything is comfortable and then only for a few minutes when down stairs and in company with the other servants the nurse should not repeat what she may have heard in her ladys room as much mischief may be done by a gossiping nurse as in most houses the monthly nurse is usually sent for a few days before her services may be required she should see that all is in readiness that there be no bustle and hurry at the time the confinement takes place she should keep two pairs of sheets thoroughly aired as well as nightdresses flannels c c all the things which will be required to dress the baby the first time should be laid in the basket in readiness in the order in which they are to be put on as well as scissors thread a few pieces of soft linen rag and two or three flannel squares if a berceaunette is to be used immediately the nurse should ascertain that the mattresses pillow c are all well aired and if not already done before she arrives she should assist in covering and trimming it ready for the little occupant a monthly nurse should be handy at her needle as if she is in the house some time before the baby is born she will require some work of this sort to occupy her time she should also understand the makingup of little caps although we can scarcely say this is one of the nurses duties as most children wear no caps except out of doors her powers in this way will not be much taxed 2433 a nurse should endeavour to make her room as cheerful as possible and always keep it clean and tidy she should empty the chamber utensils as soon as used and on no account put things under the bed soiled babys napkins should be rolled up and put into a pan when they should be washed out every morning and hung out to dry they are then in a fit state to send to the laundress and should on no account be left dirty but done every morning in this way the bedroom should be kept rather dark particularly for the first week or ten days of a regular temperature and as free as possible from draughts at the same time well ventilated and free from unpleasant smells 2434 the infant during the month must not be exposed to strong light or much air and in carrying it about the passages stairs c the nurse should always have its headflannel on to protect the eyes and ears from the currents of air for the management of children we must refer our readers to the following chapters and we need only say in conclusion that a good nurse should understand the symptoms of various ills incident to this period as in all cases prevention is better than cure as young mothers with their first baby are very often much troubled at first with their breasts the nurse should understand the art of emptying them by suction or some other contrivance if the breasts are kept well drawn there will be but little danger of inflammation and as the infant at first cannot take all that is necessary something must be done to keep the inflammation down this is one of the greatest difficulties a nurse has to contend with and we can only advise her to be very persevering to rub the breasts well and to let the infant suck as soon and as often as possible until they get in proper order the wetnurse 2435 we are aware that according to the opinion of some ladies there is no domestic theme during a certain period of their married lives more fraught with vexation and disquietude than that everfruitful source of annoyance the nurse but as we believe there are thousands of excellent wives and mothers who pass through life without even a temporary embroglio in the kitchen or suffering a state of moral hectic the whole time of a nurses empire in the nursery or bedroom our own experience goes to prove that although many unqualified persons palm themselves off on ladies as fully competent for the duties they so rashly and dishonestly undertake to perform and thus expose themselves to illwill and merited censure there are still very many fully equal to the legitimate exercise of what they undertake and if they do not in every case give entire satisfaction some of the faultand sometimes a great deal of itmay be honestly placed to the account of the ladies themselves who in many instances are so impressed with the propriety of their own method of performing everything as to insist upon the adoption of their system in preference to that of the nurse whose plan is probably based on a comprehensive forethought and rendered perfect in all its details by an ample experience 2436 in all our remarks on this subject we should remember with gentleness the order of society from which our nurses are drawn and that those who make their duty a study and are termed professional nurses have much to endure from the caprice and egotism of their employers while others are driven to the occupation from the laudable motive of feeding their own children and who in fulfilling that object are too often both selfish and sensual performing without further interest than is consistent with their own advantage the routine of customary duties 2437 properly speaking there are two nursesthe nurse for the mother and the nurse for the child or the monthly and the wet nurse of the former we have already spoken and will now proceed to describe the duties of the latter and add some suggestions as to her age physical health and moral conduct subjects of the utmost importance as far as the charge intrusted to her is concerned and therefore demanding some special remarks 2438 when from illness suppression of the milk accident or some natural process the mother is deprived of the pleasure of rearing her infant it becomes necessary at once to look around for a fitting substitute so that the child may not suffer by any needless delay a physical loss by the deprivation of its natural food the first consideration should be as regards age state of health and temper 2439 the age if possible should not be less than twenty nor exceed thirty years with the health sound in every respect and the body free from all eruptive disease or local blemish the best evidence of a sound state of health will be found in the womans clear open countenance the ruddy tone of the skin the full round and elastic state of the breasts and especially in the erectile firm condition of the nipple which in all unhealthy states of the body is pendulous flabby and relaxed in which case the milk is sure to be imperfect in its organization and consequently deficient in its nutrient qualities appetite is another indication of health in the suckling nurse or mother for it is impossible a woman can feed her child without having a corresponding appetite and though inordinate craving for food is neither desirable nor necessary a natural vigour should be experienced at mealtimes and the food taken should be anticipated and enjoyed 2440 besides her health the moral state of the nurse is to be taken into account or that mental discipline or principle of conduct which would deter the nurse from at any time gratifying her own pleasures and appetites at the cost or suffering of her infant charge 2441 the conscientiousness and good faith that would prevent a nurse so acting are unfortunately very rare and many nurses rather than forego the enjoyment of a favourite dish though morally certain of the effect it will have on the child will on the first opportunity feed with avidity on fried meats cabbage cucumbers pickles or other crude and injurious aliments in defiance of all orders given or confidence reposed in their word good sense and humanity and when the infant is afterwards racked with pain and a night of disquiet alarms the mother the doctor is sent for and the nurse covering her dereliction by a falsehood the consequence of her gluttony is treated as a disease and the poor infant is dosed for some days with medicines that can do it but little if any good and in all probability materially retard its physical development the selfish nurse in her ignorance believes too that as long as she experiences no admonitory symptoms herself the child cannot suffer and satisfied that whatever is the cause of its screams and plunges neither she nor what she had eaten had anything to do with it with this flattering assurance at her heart she watches her opportunity and has another luxurious feast off the proscribed dainties till the increasing disturbance in the childs health or treachery from the kitchen opens the eyes of mother and doctor to the nurses unprincipled conduct in all such cases the infant should be spared the infliction of medicine and as a wholesome corrective to herself and relief to her charge a good sound dose administered to the nurse 2442 respecting the diet of the wetnurse the first point of importance is to fix early and definite hours for every meal and the mother should see that no cause is ever allowed to interfere with their punctuality the food itself should be light easy of digestion and simple boiled or roast meat with bread and potatoes with occasionally a piece of sago rice or tapioca pudding should constitute the dinner the only meal that requires special comment broths green vegetables and all acid or salt foods must be avoided fresh fish once or twice a week may be taken but it is hardly sufficiently nutritious to be often used as a meal if the dinner is taken earlyat one oclockthere will be no occasion for luncheon which too often to the injury of the child is made the cover for a first dinner half a pint of stout with a reading biscuit at eleven oclock will be abundantly sufficient between breakfast at eight and a good dinner with a pint of porter at one oclock about eight oclock in the evening half a pint of stout with another biscuit may be taken and for supper at ten or halfpast a pint of porter with a slice of toast or a small amount of bread and cheese may conclude the feeding for the day 2443 animal food once in twentyfour hours is quite sufficient all spirits unless in extreme cases should be avoided and wine is still more seldom needed with a due quantity of plain digestible food and the proportion of stout and porter ordered with early hours and regularity the nurse will not only be strong and healthy herself but fully capable of rearing a child in health and strength there are two points all mothers who are obliged to employ wetnurses should remember and be on their guard against the first is never to allow a nurse to give medicine to the infant on her own authority many have such an infatuated idea of the healing excellence of castoroil that they would administer a dose of this disgusting grease twice a week and think they had done a meritorious service to the child the next point is to watch carefully lest to insure a nights sleep for herself she does not dose the infant with godfreys cordial syrup of poppies or some narcotic potion to insure tranquillity to the one and give the opportunity of sleep to the other the fact that scores of nurses keep secret bottles of these deadly syrups for the purpose of stilling their charges is notorious and that many use them to a fearful extent is sufficiently patent to all 2444 it therefore behoves the mother while obliged to trust to a nurse to use her best discretion to guard her child from the unprincipled treatment of the person she must to a certain extent depend upon and trust and to remember in all cases rather than resort to castoroil or sedatives to consult a medical man for her infant in preference to following the counsel of her nurse the rearing management and diseases of infancy and childhood chapter xlii physiology of life as illustrated by respiration circulation and digestion 2445 the infantine management of children like the mothers love for her offspring seems to be born with the child and to be a direct intelligence of nature it may thus at first sight appear as inconsistent and presumptuous to tell a woman how to rear her infant as to instruct her in the manner of loving it yet though nature is unquestionably the best nurse art makes so admirable a fostermother that no sensible woman in her novitiate of parent would refuse the admonitions of art or the teachings of experience to consummate her duties of nurse it is true that in a civilized state of society few young wives reach the epoch that makes them mothers without some insight traditional or practical into the management of infants consequently the cases wherein a woman is left to her own unaided intelligence or what in such a case may be called instinct and obliged to trust to the promptings of nature alone for the wellbeing of her child are very rare indeed again every woman is not gifted with the same physical ability for the harassing duties of a mother and though nature as a general rule has endowed all female creation with the attributes necessary to that most beautiful and at the same time holiest functionthe healthy rearing of their offspringthe cases are sufficiently numerous to establish the exception where the mother is either physically or socially incapacitated from undertaking these most pleasing duties herself and where consequently she is compelled to trust to adventitious aid for those natural benefits which are at once the mothers pride and delight to render to her child 2446 in these cases when obliged to call in the services of hired assistance she must trust the dearest obligation of her life to one who from her social sphere has probably notions of rearing children diametrically opposed to the preconceived ideas of the mother and at enmity with all her sentiments of right and prejudices of position 2447 it has justly been saidwe think by hoodthat the children of the poor are not brought up but dragged up however facetious this remark may seem there is much truth in it and that children reared in the reeking dens of squalor and poverty live at all is an apparent anomaly in the course of things that at first sight would seem to set the laws of sanitary provision at defiance and make it appear a perfect waste of time to insist on pure air and exercise as indispensable necessaries of life and especially so as regards infantine existence 2448 we see elaborate care bestowed on a family of children everything studied that can tend to their personal comfortpure air pure water regular ablution a dietary prescribed by art and every precaution adopted that medical judgment and maternal love can dictate for the wellbeing of the parents hope and find in despite of all this care and vigilance disease and death invading the guarded treasure we turn to the foetor and darkness that in some obscure court attend the robust brood who coated in dirt and with mud and refuse for playthings live and thrive and grow into manhood and in contrast to the pale face and flabby flesh of the aristocratic child exhibit strength vigour and welldeveloped frames and our belief in the potency of the lifegiving elements of air light and cleanliness receives a shock that at first sight would appear fatal to the implied benefits of these in reality allsufficient attributes of health and life 2449 but as we must enter more largely on this subject hereafter we shall leave its consideration for the present and return to what we were about to say respecting trusting to others aid in the rearing of children here it is that the young and probably inexperienced mother may find our remarks not only an assistance but a comfort to her in as far as knowing the simplest and best system to adopt she may be able to instruct another and see that her directions are fully carried out 2450 the human body materially considered is a beautiful piece of mechanism consisting of many parts each one being the centre of a system and performing its own vital function irrespectively of the others and yet dependent for its vitality upon the harmony and health of the whole it is in fact to a certain extent like a watch which when once wound up and set in motion will continue its function of recording true time only so long as every wheel spring and lever performs its allotted duty and at its allotted time or till the limit that mans ingenuity has placed to its existence as a moving automaton has been reached or in other words till it has run down 2451 what the key is to the mechanical watch air is to the physical man once admit air into the mouth and nostrils and the lungs expand the heart beats the blood rushes to the remotest part of the body the mouth secretes saliva to soften and macerate the food the liver forms its bile to separate the nutriment from the digested aliment the kidneys perform their office the eye elaborates its tears to facilitate motion and impart that glistening to the orb on which depends so much of its beauty and a dewy moisture exudes from the skin protecting the body from the extremes of heat and cold and sharpening the perception of touch and feeling at the same instant and in every part the arteries like innumerable bees are everywhere laying down layers of muscle bones teeth and in fact like the coral zoophyte building up a continent of life and matter while the veins equally busy are carrying away the dbris and refuse collected from where the zoophyte arteries are buildingthis refuse in its turn being conveyed to the liver there to be converted into bile 2452 all theseand they are but a few of the vital actions constantly taking placeare the instant result of one gasp of lifegiving air no subject can be fraught with greater interest than watching the first spark of life as it courses with electric speed through all the gates and alleys of the soft insensate body of the infant the effect of air on the newborn child is as remarkable in its results as it is wonderful in its consequence but to understand this more intelligibly it must first be remembered that life consists of the performance of three vital functionsrespiration circulation and digestion the lungs digest the air taking from it its most nutritious element the oxygen to give to the impoverished blood that circulates through them the stomach digests the food and separates the nutrimentchylefrom the aliment which it gives to the blood for the development of the frame and the blood which is understood by the term circulation digests in its passage through the lungs the nutrimentchyleto give it quantity and quality and the oxygen from the air to give it vitality hence it will be seen that speaking generally the three vital functions resolve themselves into onedigestion and that the lungs are the primary and the most important of the vital organs and respiration the first in fact as we all know it is the last in deed of all the functions performed by the living body the lungsrespiration 2453 the first effect of air on the infant is a slight tremor about the lips and angles of the mouth increasing to twitchings and finally to a convulsive contraction of the lips and cheeks the consequence of sudden cold to the nerves of the face this spasmodic action produces a gasp causing the air to rush through the mouth and nostrils and enter the windpipe and upper portion of the flat and contracted lungs which like a sponge partly immersed in water immediately expand this is succeeded by a few faint sobs or pants by which larger volumes of air are drawn into the chest till after a few seconds and when a greater bulk of the lungs has become inflated the breastbone and ribs rise the chest expands and with a sudden start the infant gives utterance to a succession of loud sharp cries which have the effect of filling every cell of the entire organ with air and life to the anxious mother the first voice of her child is doubtless the sweetest music she ever heard and the more loudly it peals the greater should be her joy as it is an indication of health and strength and not only shows the perfect expansion of the lungs but that the process of life has set in with vigour having welcomed in its own existence like the morning bird with a shrill note of gladness the infant ceases its cry and after a few short sobs usually subsides into sleep or quietude 2454 at the same instant that the air rushes into the lungs the valve or door between the two sides of the heartand through which the blood had previously passedis closed and hermetically sealed and the blood taking a new course bounds into the lungs now expanded with air and which we have likened to a wetted sponge to which they bear a not unapt affinity air being substituted for water it here receives the oxygen from the atmosphere and the chyle or white blood from the digested food and becomes in an instant arterial blood a vital principle from which every solid and fluid of the body is constructed besides the lungs nature has provided another respiratory organ a sort of supplemental lung that as well as being a covering to the body inspires air and expires moisturethis is the cuticle or skin and so intimate is the connection between the skin and lungs that whatever injures the first is certain to affect the latter 2455 hence the difficulty of breathing experienced after scalds or burns on the cuticle the cough that follows the absorption of cold or damp by the skin the oppressed and laborious breathing experienced by children in all eruptive diseases while the rash is coming to the surface and the hot dry skin that always attends congestion of the lungs and fever 2456 the great practical advantage derivable from this fact is the knowledge that whatever relieves the one benefits the other hence too the great utility of hot baths in all affections of the lungs or diseases of the skin and the reason why exposure to cold or wet is in nearly all cases followed by tightness of the chest sore throat difficulty of breathing and cough these symptoms are the consequence of a larger quantity of blood than is natural remaining in the lungs and the cough is a mere effort of nature to throw off the obstruction caused by the presence of too much blood in the organ of respiration the hot bath by causing a larger amount of blood to rush suddenly to the skin has the effect of relieving the lungs of their excess of blood and by equalizing the circulation and promoting perspiration from the cuticle affords immediate and direct benefit both to the lungs and the system at large the stomachdigestion 2457 the organs that either directly or indirectly contribute to the process of digestion are the mouth teeth tongue and gullet the stomach small intestines the pancreas the salivary glands and the liver next to respiration digestion is the chief function in the economy of life as without the nutritious fluid digested from the aliment there would be nothing to supply the immense and constantly recurring waste of the system caused by the activity with which the arteries at all periods but especially during infancy and youth are building up the frame and developing the body in infancy the period of which our present subject treats the series of parts engaged in the process of digestion may be reduced simply to the stomach and liver or rather its secretionthe bile the stomach is a thick muscular bag connected above with the gullet and at its lower extremity with the commencement of the small intestines the duty or function of the stomach is to secrete from the arteries spread over its inner surface a sharp acid liquid called the gastric juice this with a due mixture of saliva softens dissolves and gradually digests the food or contents of the stomach reducing the whole into a soft pulpy mass which then passes into the first part of the small intestines where it comes in contact with the bile from the gallbladder which immediately separates the digested food into two parts one is a white creamy fluid called chyle and the absolute concentration of all nourishment which is taken up by proper vessels and as we have before said carried directly to the heart to be made blood of and vitalized in the lungs and thus provide for the wear and tear of the system it must be here observed that the stomach can only digest solids for fluids being incapable of that process can only be absorbed and without the result of digestion animal at least human life could not exist now as nature has ordained that infantine life shall be supported on liquid aliment and as without a digestion the body would perish some provision was necessary to meet this difficulty and that provision was found in the nature of the liquid itself or in other words the milk the process of making cheese or fresh curds and whey is familiar to most persons but as it is necessary to the elucidation of our subject we will briefly repeat it the internal membrane or the lining coat of a calfs stomach having been removed from the organ is hung up like a bladder to dry when required a piece is cut off put in a jug a little warm water poured upon it and after a few hours it is fit for use the liquid so made being called rennet a little of this rennet poured into a basin of warm milk at once coagulates the greater part and separates from it a quantity of thin liquor called whey this is precisely the action that takes place in the infants stomach after every supply from the breast the cause is the same in both cases the acid of the gastric juice in the infants stomach immediately converting the milk into a soft cheese it is gastric juice adhering to the calfs stomach and drawn out by the water forming rennet that makes the curds in the basin the cheesy substance being a solid at once undergoes the process of digestion is separated into chyle by the bile and in a few hours finds its way to the infants heart to become blood and commence the architecture of its little frame this is the simple process of a babys digestionmilk converted into cheese cheese into chyle chyle into blood and blood into flesh bone and tegumenthow simple is the cause but how sublime and wonderful are the effects 2458 we have described the most important of the three functions that take place in the infants bodyrespiration and digestion the third namely circulation we hardly think it necessary to enter on not being called for by the requirements of the nurse and mother so we shall omit its notice and proceed from theoretical to more practical considerations children of weakly constitutions are just as likely to be born of robust parents and those who earn their bread by toil as the offspring of luxury and affluence and indeed it is against the ordinary providence of nature to suppose the children of the hardworking and necessitous to be hardier and more vigorous than those of parents blessed with ease and competence 2459 all children come into the world in the same imploring helplessness with the same general organization and wants and demanding either from the newlyawakened mothers love or from the memory of motherly feeling in the nurse or the common appeals of humanity in those who undertake the earliest duties of an infant the same assistance and protection and the same fostering care the infant 2460 we have already described the phenomena produced on the newborn child by the contact of air which after a succession of muscular twitchings becomes endowed with voice and heralds its advent by a loud but brief succession of cries but though this is the general rule it sometimes happens from causes it is unnecessary here to explain that the infant does not cry or give utterance to any audible sounds or if it does they are so faint as scarcely to be distinguished as human accents plainly indicating that life as yet to the new visitor is neither a boon nor a blessing the infant being in fact in a state of suspended or imperfect vitalitya state of quasi existence closely approximating the condition of a stillbirth 2461 as soon as this state of things is discovered the child should be turned on its right side and the whole length of the spine from the head downwards rubbed with all the fingers of the right hand sharply and quickly without intermission till the quick action has not only evoked heat but electricity in the part and till the loud and sharp cries of the child have thoroughly expanded the lungs and satisfactorily established its life the operation will seldom require above a minute to effect and less frequently demands a repetition if there is brandy at hand the fingers before rubbing may be dipped into that or any other spirit 2462 thereis another condition of what we may call mute births where the child only makes short ineffectual gasps and those at intervals of a minute or two apart when the lips eyelids and fingers become of a deep purple or slate colour sometimes half the body remaining white while the other half which was at first swarthy deepens to a livid hue this condition of the infant is owing to the valve between the two sides of the heart remaining open and allowing the unvitalized venous blood to enter the arteries and get into the circulation 2463 the object in this case as in the previous one is to dilate the lungs as quickly as possible so that by the sudden effect of a vigorous inspiration the valve may be firmly closed and the impure blood losing this means of egress be sent directly to the lungs the same treatment is therefore necessary as in the previous case with the addition if the friction along the spine has failed of a warm bath at a temperature of about 80 in which the child is to be plunged up to the neck first cleansing the mouth and nostrils of the mucus that might interfere with the free passage of air 2464 while in the bath the friction along the spine is to be continued and if the lungs still remain unexpended while one person retains the child in an inclined position in the water another should insert the pipe of a small pair of bellows into one nostril and while the month is closed and the other nostril compressed on the pipe with the hand of the assistant the lungs are to be slowly inflated by steady puffs of air from the bellows the hand being removed from the mouth and nose after each inflation and placed on the pit of the stomach and by a steady pressure expelling it out again by the mouth this process is to be continued steadily inflating and expelling the air from the lungs till with a sort of tremulous leap nature takes up the process and the infant begins to gasp and finally to cry at first low and faint but with every gulp of air increasing in length and strength of volume when it is to be removed from the water and instantly wrapped all but the face and mouth in a flannel sometimes however all these means will fail in effecting an utterance from the child which will lie with livid lips and a flaccid body every few minutes opening its mouth with a short gasping pant and then subsiding into a state of pulseless inaction lingering probably some hours till the spasmodic pantings growing further apart it ceases to exist 2465 the time that this state of negative vitality will linger in the frame of an infant is remarkable and even when all the previous operations though longcontinued have proved ineffectual the child will often rally from the simplest of meansthe application of dry heat when removed from the bath place three or four hot bricks or tiles on the hearth and lay the child loosely folded in a flannel on its back along them taking care that there is but one fold of flannel between the spine and heated bricks or tiles when neither of these articles can be procured put a few clear pieces of red cinder in a warmingpan and extend the child in the same manner along the closed lid as the heat gradually diffuses itself over the spinal marrow the child that was dying or seemingly dead will frequently give a sudden and energetic cry succeeded in another minute by a long and vigorous peal making up in volume and force for the previous delay and instantly confirming its existence by every effort in its nature 2466 with these two exceptionsrestored by the means we have pointed out to the functions of lifewe will proceed to the consideration of the child healthily born here the first thing that meets us on the threshold of inquiry and what is often between mother and nurse not only a vexed question but one of vexatious import is the crying of the child the mother in her natural anxiety maintaining that her infant must be ill to cause it to cry so much or so often and the nurse insisting that all children cry and that nothing is the matter with it and that crying does good and is indeed an especial benefit to infancy the anxious and unfamiliar mother though not convinced by these abstract sayings of the truth or wisdom of the explanation takes both for granted and giving the nurse credit for more knowledge and experience on this head than she can have contentedly resigns herself to the infliction as a thing necessary to be endured for the good of the baby but thinking it at the same time an extraordinary instance of the imperfectibility of nature as regards the human infant for her mind wanders to what she has observed in her childhood with puppies and kittens who except when rudely torn from their nurse seldom give utterance to any complaining 2467 we undoubtedly believe that crying to a certain extent is not only conducive to health but positively necessary to the full development and physical economy of the infants being but though holding this opinion we are far from believing that a child does not very often cry from pain thirst want of food and attention to its personal comfort but there is as much difference in the tone and expression of a childs cry as in the notes of an adults voice and the mothers ear will not be long in discriminating between the sharp peevish whine of irritation and fever and the louder intermitting cry that characterizes the want of warmth and sleep all these shades of expression in the childs inarticulate voice every nurse should understand and every mother will soon teach herself to interpret them with an accuracy equal to language 2468 there is no part of a womans duty to her child that a young mother should so soon make it her business to study as the voice of her infant and the language conveyed in its cry the study is neither hard nor difficult a close attention to its tone and the expression of the babys features are the two most important points demanding attention the key to both the mother will find in her own heart and the knowledge of her success in the comfort and smile of her infant we have two reasonsboth strong onesfor urging on mothers the imperative necessity of early making themselves acquainted with the nature and wants of their child the first that when left to the entire responsibility of the baby after the departure of the nurse she may be able to undertake her new duties with more confidence than if left to her own resources and mothers instinct without a clue to guide her through the mysteries of those calls that vibrate through every nerve of her nature and secondly that she may be able to guard her child from the nefarious practices of unprincipled nurses who while calming the mothers mind with false statements as to the character of the babys cries rather than lose their rest or devote that time which would remove the cause of suffering administer behind the curtains those deadly narcotics which while stupefying nature into sleep insure for herself a night of many unbroken hours such nurses as have not the hardihood to dose their infant charges are often full of other schemes to still that constant and reproachful cry the most frequent means employed for this purpose is giving it something to sucksomething easily hid from the motheror when that is impossible under the plea of keeping it warm the nurse covers it in her lap with a shawl and under this blind surreptitiously inserts a finger between the parched lips which possibly moan for drink and under this inhuman cheat and delusion the infant is pacified till nature balked of its desires drops into a troubled sleep these are two of our reasons for impressing upon mothers the early the immediate necessity of putting themselves sympathetically in communication with their child by at once learning its hidden language as a delightful task 2469 we must strenuously warn all mothers on no account to allow the nurse to sleep with the baby never herself to lay down with it by her side for a nights rest never to let it sleep in the parents bed and on no account keep it longer than absolutely necessary confined in on atmosphere loaded with the breath of many adults 2470 the amount of oxygen required by an infant is so large and the quantity consumed by midlife and age and the proportion of carbonic acid thrown off from both so considerable that an infant breathing the same air cannot possibly carry on its healthy existence while deriving its vitality from so corrupted a medium this objection always in force is still more objectionable at nighttime when doors and windows are closed and amounts to a condition of poison when placed between two adults in sleep and shut in by bedcurtains and when in addition to the impurities expired from the lungs we remember in quiescence and sleep how large a portion of mephitic gas is given off from the skin 2471 mothers in the fullness of their affection believe there is no harbour sleeping or awake where their infants can be so secure from all possible or probable danger as in their own arms yet we should astound our readers if we told them the statistical number of infants who in despite of their motherly solicitude and love are annually killed unwittingly by such parents themselves and this from the persistency in the practice we are so strenuously condemning the mother frequently on awaking discovers the babys face closely impacted between her bosom and her arm and its body rigid and lifeless or else so enveloped in the headblanket and superincumbent bedclothes as to render breathing a matter of physical impossibility in such cases the jury in general returns a verdict of accidentally overlaid but one of careless suffocation would be more in accordance with truth and justice the only possible excuse that can be urged either by nurse or mother for this culpable practice is the plea of imparting warmth to the infant but this can always be effected by an extra blanket in the childs crib or if the weather is particularly cold by a bottle of hot water enveloped in flannel and placed at the childs feet while all the objections already urgedas derivable from animal heat imparted by actual contactare entirely obviated there is another evil attending the sleeping together of the mother and infant which as far as regards the latter we consider quite as formidable though not so immediate as the others and is always followed by more or less of mischief to the mother the evil we now allude to is that most injurious practice of letting the child suck after the mother has fallen asleep a custom that naturally results from the former and which as we hare already said is injurious to both mother and child it is injurious to the infant by allowing it without control to imbibe to distension a fluid sluggishly secreted and deficient in those vital principles which the want of mental energy and of the sympathetic appeals of the child on the mother so powerfully produce on the secreted nutriment while the mother wakes in a state of clammy exhaustion with giddiness dimness of sight nausea loss of appetite and a dull aching pain through the back and between the shoulders in fact she wakes languid and unrefreshed from her sleep with febrile symptoms and hectic flushes caused by her baby vampire who while dragging from her her health and strength has excited in itself a set of symptoms directly opposite but fraught with the same injurious consequencesfunctional derangement the milk 2472 as nature has placed in the bosom of the mother the natural food of her offspring it must be selfevident to every reflecting woman that it becomes her duty to study as far as lies in her power to keep that reservoir of nourishment in as pure and invigorating a condition as possible for she must remember that the quantity is no proof of the quality of this aliment 2473 the mother while suckling as a general rule should avoid all sedentary occupations take regular exercise keep her mind as lively and pleasingly occupied as possible especially by music and singing her diet should be light and nutritious with a proper sufficiency of animal food and of that kind which yields the largest amount of nourishment and unless the digestion is naturally strong vegetables and fruit should form a very small proportion of the general dietary and such preparations as broths gruels arrowroot c still less tapioca or groundrice pudding made with several eggs may be taken freely but all slops and thin potations such as that delusion called chickenbroth should be avoided as yielding a very small amount of nutriment and a large proportion of flatulence all purely stimulants should be avoided as much as possible especially spirits unless taken for some special object and that medicinally but as a part of the dietary they should be carefully shunned lactation is always an exhausting process and as the child increases in size and strength the drain upon the mother becomes great and depressing then something more even than an abundant diet is required to keep the mind and body up to a standard sufficiently healthy to admit of a constant and nutritious secretion being performed without detriment to the physical integrity of the mother or injury to the child who imbibes it and as stimulants are inadmissible if not positively injurious the substitute required is to be found in malt liquor to the lady accustomed to her madeira and sherry this may appear a very vulgar potation for a delicate young mother to take instead of the more subtle and condensed elegance of wine but as we are writing from experience and with the avowed object of imparting useful facts and beneficial remedies to our readers we allow no social distinctions to interfere with our legitimate object 2474 we have already said that the suckling mother should avoid stimulants especially spirituous ones and though something of this sort is absolutely necessary to support her strength during the exhausting process it should be rather of a tonic than of a stimulating character and as all wines contain a large percentage of brandy they are on that account less beneficial than the pure juice of the fermented grape might be but there is another consideration to be taken into account on this subject the mother has not only to think of herself but also of her infant now wines especially port wine very oftenindeed most frequentlyaffect the babys bowels and what might have been grateful to the mother becomes thus a source of pain and irritation to the child afterwards sherry is less open to this objection than other wines yet still it very frequently does influence the second participator or the child whose mother has taken it 2475 the nine or twelve months a woman usually suckles must be to some extent to most mothers a period of privation and penance and unless she is deaf to the cries of her baby and insensible to its kicks and plunges and will not see in such muscular evidences the griping pains that rack her child she will avoid every article that can remotely affect the little being who draws its sustenance from her she will see that the babe is acutely affected by all that in any way influences her and willingly curtail her own enjoyments rather than see her infant rendered feverish irritable and uncomfortable as the best tonic then and the most efficacious indirect stimulant that a mother can take at such times there is no potation equal to porter and stout or what is better still an equal part of porter and stout ale except for a few constitutions is too subtle and too sweet generally causing acidity or heartburn and stout alone is too potent to admit of a full draught from its proneness to affect the head and quantity as well as moderate strength is required to make the draught effectual the equal mixture therefore of stout and porter yields all the properties desired or desirable as a medicinal agent for this purpose 2476 independently of its invigorating influence on the constitution porter exerts a marked and specific effect on the secretion of milk more powerful in exciting an abundant supply of that fluid than any other article within the range of the physicians art and in cases of deficient quantity is the most certain speedy and the healthiest means that can be employed to insure a quick and abundant flow in cases where malt liquor produces flatulency a few grains of the carbonate of soda may advantageously be added to each glass immediately before drinking which will have the effect of neutralizing any acidity that may be in the porter at the time and will also prevent its afterdisagreement with the stomach the quantity to be taken must depend upon the natural strength of the mother the age and demand made by the infant on the parent and other causes but the amount should vary from one to two pints a day never taking less than half a pint at a time which should be repeated three or four times a day 2477 we have said that the period of suckling is a season of penance to the mother but this is not invariably the case and as so much must depend upon the natural strength of the stomach and its power of assimilating all kinds of food into healthy chyle it is impossible to define exceptions where a woman feels she can eat any kind of food without inconvenience or detriment she should live during her suckling as she did before but as a general rule we are bound to advise all mothers to abstain from such articles as pickles fruits cucumbers and all acid and slowly digestible foods unless they wish for restless nights and crying infants 2478 as regards exercise and amusement we would certainly neither prohibit a mothers dancing going to a theatre nor even from attending an assembly the first however is the best indoor recreation she can take and a young mother will do well to often amuse herself in the nursery with this most excellent means of healthful circulation the only precaution necessary is to avoid letting the child suck the milk that has lain long in the breast or is heated by excessive action 2479 every mother who can should be provided with a breastpump or glass tube to draw off the superabundance that has been accumulating in her absence from the child or the first gush excited by undue exertion the subsequent supply of milk will be secreted under the invigorating influence of a previous healthy stimulus 2480 as the first milk that is secreted contains a large amount of the saline elements and is thin and innutritious it is most admirably adapted for the purpose nature designed it to fulfilthat of an aperient but which unfortunately it is seldom permitted in our artificial mode of living to perform 2481 so opposed are we to the objectionable plan of physicking newborn children that unless for positive illness we would much rather advise that medicine should be administered through the mother for the first eight or ten weeks of its existence this practice which few mothers will object to is easily effected by the parent when such a course is necessary for the child taking either a dose of castoroil half an ounce of tasteless salts the phosphate of soda one or two teaspoonfuls of magnesia a dose of lenitive electuary manna or any mild and simple aperient which almost before it can have taken effect on herself will exhibit its action on her child 2482 one of the most common errors that mothers fall into while suckling their children is that of fancying they are always hungry and consequently overfeeding them and with this the great mistake of applying the child to the breast on every occasion of its crying without investigating the cause of its complaint and under the belief that it wants food putting the nipple into its crying mouth until the infant turns in revulsion and petulance from what it should accept with eagerness and joy at such times a few teaspoonfuls of water slightly chilled will often instantly pacify a crying and restless child who has turned in loathing from the offered breast or after imbibing a few drops and finding it not what nature craved throws back its head in disgust and cries more petulantly than before in such a case as this the young mother grieved at her babys rejection of the tempting present and distressed at its cries and in terror of some injury over and over ransacks its clothes believing some insecure pin can alone be the cause of such sharp complaining an accident that from her own care in dressing however is seldom or ever the case 2483 these abrupt cries of the child if they do not proceed from thirst which a little water will relieve not unfrequently occur from some unequal pressure a fold or twist in the roller or some constriction round the tender body if this is suspected the mother must not be content with merely slackening the strings the child should be undressed and the creases and folds of the hot skin especially those about the thighs and groins examined to see that no powder has caked and becoming hard irritated the parts the violet powder should be dusted freely over all to cool the skin and everything put on fresh and smooth if such precautions have not afforded relief and in addition to the crying the child plunges or draws up its legs the mother may be assured some cause of irritation exists in the stomach or bowelseither acidity in the latter or distension from overfeeding in the former but from whichever cause the child should be opened before the fire and a heated napkin applied all over the abdomen the infant being occasionally elevated to a sitting position and while gently jolted on the knee the back should be lightly patted with the hand 2484 should the mother have any reason to apprehend that the cause of inconvenience proceeds from the bladdera not unfrequent source of painthe napkin is to be dipped in hot water squeezed out and immediately applied over the part and repeated every eight or ten minutes for several times in succession either till the natural relief is afforded or a cessation of pain allows of its discontinuance the pain that young infants often suffer and the crying that results from it is as we have already said frequently caused by the mother inconsiderately overfeeding her child and is produced by the pain of distension and the mechanical pressure of a larger quantity of fluid in the stomach than the gastric juice can convert into cheese and digest 2485 some children are stronger in the enduring power of the stomach than others and get rid of the excess by vomiting concluding every process of suckling by an emission of milk and curd such children are called by nurses thriving children and generally they are so simply because their digestion is good and they have the power of expelling with impunity that superabundance of aliment which in others is a source of distension flatulence and pain 2486 the length of time an infant should be suckled must depend much on the health and strength of the child and the health of the mother and the quantity and quality of her milk though when all circumstances are favourable it should never be less than nine nor exceed fifteen months but perhaps the true time will be found in the medium between both but of this we may be sure that nature never ordained a child to live on suction after having endowed it with teeth to bite and to grind and nothing is more out of place and unseemly than to hear a child with a set of twenty teeth ask for the breast 2487 the practice of protracted wetnursing is hurtful to the mother by keeping up an uncalledfor and after the proper time an unhealthy drain on her system while the child either derives no benefit from what it no longer requires or it produces a positive injury on its constitution after the period when nature has ordained the child shall live by other means the secretion of milk becomes thin and deteriorated showing in the flabby flesh and puny features of the child both its loss of nutritious properties and the want of more stimulating aliment 2488 though we have said that twelve months is about the medium time a baby should be suckled we by no means wish to imply that a child should be fed exclusively on milk for its first year quite the reverse the infant can hardly be too soon made independent of the mother thus should illness assail her her milk fail or any domestic cause abruptly cut off the natural supply the child having been annealed to an artificial diet its life might be safely carried on without seeking for a wetnurse and without the slightest danger to its system 2489 the advantage to the mother of early accustoming the child to artificial food is as considerable to herself as beneficial to her infant the demand on her physical strength in the first instance will be less severe and exhausting the child will sleep longer on a less rapidly digestible aliment and yield to both more quiet nights and the mother will be more at liberty to go out for business or pleasure another means of sustenance being at hand till her return besides these advantages by a judicious blending of the two systems of feeding the infant will acquire greater constitutional strength so that if attacked by sickness or disease it will have a much greater chance of resisting its virulence than if dependent alone on the mother whose milk affected by fatigue and the natural anxiety of the parent for her offspring is at such a time neither good in its properties nor likely to be beneficial to the patient 2490 all that we have further to say on suckling is an advice to mothers that if they wish to keep a sound and unchapped nipple and possibly avoid what is called a broken breast never to put it up with a wet nipple but always to have a soft handkerchief in readiness and the moment that delicate part is drawn from the childs mouth to dry it carefully of the milk and saliva that moisten it and further to make a practice of suckling from each breast alternately dress and dressing washing c 2491 as respects the dress and dressing of a newborn infant or of a child in arms during any stage of its nursing there are few women who will require us to give them guidance or directions for their instruction and though a few hints on the subject may not be out of place here yet most women intuitively take to a baby and with a small amount of experience are able to perform all the little offices necessary to its comfort and cleanliness with ease and completeness we shall therefore on this delicate subject hold our peace and only from afar hint at what we would leaving our suggestions to be approved or rejected according as they chime with the judgment and the apprehension of our motherly readers 2492 in these days of intelligence there are few ladies who have not in all probability seen the manner in which the indian squaw the aborigines of polynesia and even the lapp and esquimaux strap down their baby on a board and by means of a loop suspend it to the bough of a tree hang it up to the rafters of the hut or on travel dangle it on their backs outside the domestic implements which as the slave of her master man the wronged but uncomplaining woman carries in order that her lord may march in unhampered freedom cruel and confining as this system of backboard dressing may seem to our modern notions of freedom and exercise it is positively less irksome less confining and infinitely less prejudicial to health than the mummying of children by our grandmothers a hundred ay fifty years ago for what with chinstays backstays bodystays foreheadcloths rollers bandages c an infant had as many girths and strings to keep head limbs and body in one exact position as a ship has halyards 2493 much of thisindeed we may say allhas been abolished but still the child is far from being dressed loosely enough and we shall never be satisfied till the abominable use of the pin is avoided in toto in an infants dressing and a texture made for all the under garments of a child of a cool and elastic material 2494 the manner in which an infant is encircled in a bandage called the roller as if it had fractured ribs compressing those organsthat living on suction must be for the health of the child to a certain degree distended to obtain sufficient aliment from the fluid imbibedis perfectly preposterous our humanity as well as our duty calls upon us at once to abrogate and discountenance by every means in our power instead of the process of washing and dressing being made as with the adult a refreshment and comfort it is by the dawdling manner in which it is performed the multiplicity of things used and the perpetual change of position of the infant to adjust its complicated clothing rendered an operation of positive irritation and annoyance we therefore entreat all mothers to regard this subject in its true light and study to the utmost simplicity in dress and dispatch in the process 2495 children do not so much cry from the washing as from the irritation caused by the frequent change of position in which they are placed the number of times they are turned on their face on their back and on their side by the manipulations demanded by the multiplicity of articles to be fitted tacked and carefully adjusted on their bodies what mother ever found her girl of six or seven stand quiet while she was curling her hair how many times nightly has she not to reprove her for not standing still during the process it is the same with the unconscious infant who cannot bear to be moved about and who has no sooner grown reconciled to one position than it is forced reluctantly into another it is true in one instance the child has intelligence to guide it and in the other not but the motitory nerves in both instances resent coercion and a child cannot be too little handled 2496 on this account alone and for the moment setting health and comfort out of the question we beg mothers to simplify their babys dress as much as possible and not only to put on as little as is absolutely necessary but to make that as simple in its contrivance and adjustment as it will admit of to avoid bellybands rollers girths and everything that can impede or confine the natural expansion of the digestive organs on the due performance of whose functions the child lives thrives and develops its physical being rearing by hand articles necessary and how to use thempreparation of foods bathsadvantages of rearing by hand 2497 as we do not for a moment wish to be thought an advocate for an artificial in preference to the natural course of rearing children we beg our renders to understand us perfectly on this head all we desire to prove is the fact that a child can be brought up as well on a spoon dietary as the best example to be found of those reared on the breast having more strength indeed from the more nutritious food on which it lives it will be thus less liable to infectious diseases and more capable of resisting the virulence of any danger that may attack it and without in any way depreciating the nutriment of its natural food we wish to impress on the mothers mind that there are many cases of infantine debility which might eventuate in rickets curvature of the spine or mesenteric disease where the addition to or total substitution of an artificial and more stimulating aliment would not only give tone and strength to the constitution but at the same time render the employment of mechanical means totally unnecessary and finally though we would neverwhere the mother had the strength to suckle her childsupersede the breast we would insist on making it a rule to accustom the child as early as possible to the use of an artificial diet not only that it may acquire more vigour to help it over the ills of childhood but that in the absence of the mother it might not miss the maternal sustenance and also for the parents sake that should the milk from any cause become vitiated or suddenly cease the child can be made over to the bottle and the spoon without the slightest apprehension of hurtful consequences 2498 to those persons unacquainted with the system or who may have been erroneously informed on the matter the rearing of a child by hand may seem surrounded by innumerable difficulties and a large amount of personal trouble and anxiety to the nurse or mother who undertakes the duty this however is a fallacy in every respect except as regards the fact of preparing the food but even this extra amount of work by adopting the course we shall lay down may be reduced to a very small sum of inconvenience and as respects anxiety the only thing calling for care is the display of judgment in the preparation of the food the articles required for the purpose of feeding an infant are a nightlamp with its pan and lid to keep the food warm a nursingbottle with a prepared teat and a small pap saucepan for use by day of the lamp we need hardly speak most mothers being acquainted with its operation but to those to whom it is unknown we may observe that the flame from the floating rushlight heats the water in the reservoir above in which the covered pan that contains the food floats keeping it at such a heat that when thinned by milk it will be of a temperature suitable for immediate use though many kinds of nursingbottles have been lately invented and some mounted with indiarubber nipples the common glass bottle with the calfs teat is equal in cleanliness and utility to any besides the nipple put into the childs mouth is so white and natural in appearance that no child taken from the breast will refuse it the black artificial ones of caoutchouc or guttapercha are unnatural the prepared teats can be obtained at any chemists and as they are kept in spirits they will require a little soaking in warm water and gentle washing before being tied securely by means of fine twine round the neck of the bottle just sufficient being left projecting for the child to grasp freely in its lips for if left the full length or over long it will be drawn too far into the mouth and possibly make the infant heave when once properly adjusted the nipple need never be removed till replaced by a new one which will hardly be necessary oftener than once a fortnight though with care one will last for several weeks the nursingbottle should be thoroughly washed and cleaned every day and always rinsed out before and after using it the warm water being squeezed through the nipple to wash out any particles of food that might lodge in the aperture and become sour the teat can always be kept white and soft by turning the end of the bottle when not in use into a narrow jug containing water taking care to dry it first and then to warm it by drawing the food through before putting it into the childs mouth food and its preparation 2499 the articles generally employed as food for infants consist of arrowroot bread flour baked flour prepared groats farinaceous food biscuitpowder biscuits topsandbottoms and semolina or manna croup as it is otherwise called which like tapioca is the prepared pith of certain vegetable substances of this list the least efficacious though perhaps the most believed in is arrowroot which only as a mere agent for change and then only for a very short time should ever be employed as a means of diet to infancy or childhood it is a thin flatulent and innutritious food and incapable of supporting infantine life with energy bread though the universal rgime with the labouring poor where the infants stomach and digestive powers are a reflex in miniature of the fathers should never be given to an infant under three months and even then however finely beaten up and smoothly made is a very questionable diet flour when well boiled though infinitely better than arrowroot is still only a kind of fermentative paste that counteracts its own good by afteracidity and flatulence 2500 baked flour when cooked into a pale brown mass and finely powdered makes a far superior food to the others and may be considered as a very useful diet especially for a change prepared groats may be classed with arrowroot and raw flour as being innutritious the articles that now follow in our list are all good and such as we could with conscience and safety trust to for the health and development of any child whatever 2501 we may observe in this place that an occasional change in the character of the food is highly desirable both as regards the health and benefit of the child and though the interruption should only last for a day the change will be advantageous 2502 the packets sold as farinaceous food are unquestionably the best aliment that can be given from the first to a baby and may be continued with the exception of an occasional change without alteration of the material till the child is able to take its regular meals of animal and vegetable food some infants are so constituted as to require a frequent and total change in their system of living seeming to thrive for a certain time on any food given to them but if persevered in too long declining in bulk and appearance as rapidly as they had previously progressed in such cases the food should be immediately changed and when that which appeared to agree best with the child is resumed it should be altered in its quality and perhaps in its consistency 2503 for the farinaceous food there are directions with each packet containing instructions for the making but whatever the food employed is enough should be made at once to last the day and night at first about a pint basinful but as the child advances a quart will hardly be too much in all cases let the food boil a sufficient time constantly stirring and taking every precaution that it does not get burnt in which case it is on no account to be used 2504 the food should always be made with water the whole sweetened at once and of such a consistency that when poured out and it has had time to cool it will cut with the firmness of a pudding or custard one or two spoonfuls are to be put into the pap saucepan and stood on the hob till the heat has softened it when enough milk is to be added and carefully mixed with the food till the whole has the consistency of ordinary cream it is then to be poured into the nursingbottle and the food having been drawn through to warm the nipple it is to be placed in the childs mouth for the first month or more half a bottleful will be quite enough to give the infant at one time but as the child grows it will be necessary not only to increase the quantity given at each time but also gradually to make its food more consistent and after the third month to add an egg to every pint basin of food made at night the mother puts the food into the covered pan of her lamp instead of the saucepanthat is enough for one supply and having lighted the rush she will find on the waking of her child the food sufficiently hot to bear the cooling addition of the milk but whether night or day the same food should never be heated twice and what the child leaves should be thrown away 2505 the biscuit powder is used in the same manner as the farinaceous food and both prepared much after the fashion of making starch but when topsandbottoms or the whole biscuit are employed they require soaking in cold water for some time previous to boiling the biscuit or biscuits are then to be slowly boiled in as much water as will when thoroughly soft allow of their being beaten by a threepronged fork into a fine smooth and even pulp and which when poured into a basin and become cold will cut out like a custard if two large biscuits have been so treated and the child is six or seven months old beat up two eggs sufficient sugar to properly sweeten it and about a pint of skim milk pour this on the beaten biscuit in the saucepan stirring constantly boil for about five minutes pour into a basin and use when cold in the same manner as the other 2506 this makes an admirable food at once nutritious and strengthening when topsandbottoms or rusks are used the quantity of the egg may be reduced or altogether omitted 2507 semolina or manna croup being in little hard grains like a fine milletseed must be boiled for some time and the milk sugar and egg added to it on the fire and boiled for a few minutes longer and when cold used as the other preparations 2508 many persons entertain a belief that cows milk is hurtful to infants and consequently refrain from giving it but this is a very great mistake for both sugar and milk should form a large portion of every meal an infant takes teething and convulsions fits c the consequence of dentition and how to be treatedthe number and order of the teeth and manner in which they are cutfirst and second set 2509 about three months after birth the infants troubles may be said to begin teeth commence forming in the gums causing pain and irritation in the mouth and which but for the saliva it causes to flow so abundantly would be attended with very serious consequences at the same time the mother frequently relaxes in the punctuality of the regimen imposed on her and taking some unusual or different food excites diarrhoea or irritation in her childs stomach which not unfrequently results in a rash on the skin or slight febrile symptoms which if not subdued in their outset superinduce some more serious form of infantine disease but as a general rule the teeth are the primary cause of much of the childs sufferings in consequence of the state of nervous and functional irritation into which the system is thrown by their formation and progress out of the jaw and through the gums we propose beginning this branch of our subject with that most fertile source of an infants suffering teething 2510 that this subject may he better understood by the nurse and mother and the reason of the constitutional disturbance that to a greater or less degree is experienced by all infants may be made intelligible to those who have the care of children we shall commence by giving a brief account of the formation of the teeth the age at which they appear in the mouth and the order in which they pierce the gums the organs of mastication in the adult consist of 32 distinct teeth 16 in either jaw being in fact a double set the teeth are divided into 4 incisors 2 canine 4 first and second grinders and 6 molars but in childhood the complement or first set consists of only twenty and these only make their appearance as the development of the frame indicates the requirement of a different kind of food for the support of the system at birth some of the firstcut teeth are found in the cavities of the jaw in a very small and rudimentary form but this is by no means universal about the third month the jaws which are hollow and divided into separate cells begin to expand making room for the slowly developing teeth which arranged for beauty and economy of space lengthwise gradually turn their tops upwards piercing the gum by their edges which being sharp assist in cutting a passage through the soft parts there is no particular period at which children cut their teeth some being remarkably early and others equally late the earliest age that we have ever ourselves known as a reliable fact was six weeks such peculiarities are generally hereditary and as in this case common to a whole family the two extremes are probably represented by six and sixteen months pain and drivelling are the usual but by no means the general indications of teething 2511 about the sixth month the gums become tense and swollen presenting a red shiny appearance while the salivary glands pour out an unusual quantity of saliva after a time a white line or round spot is observed on the top of one part of the gums and the sharp edge of the tooth may be felt beneath if the finger is gently pressed on the part through these white spots the teeth burst their way in the following order 2512 two incisors in the lower jaw are first cut though in general some weeks elapse between the appearance of the first and the advent of the second the next teeth cut are the four incisors of the upper jaw the next in order are the remaining two incisors of the bottom one on each side then two top and two bottom on each side but not joining the incisors and lastly about the eighteenth or twentieth month the four eye teeth filling up the space left between the side teeth and the incisors thus completing the infants set of sixteen sometimes at the same period but more frequently some months later four more double teeth slowly make their appearance one on each side of each jaw completing the entire series of the childs first set of twenty teeth it is asserted that a child while cutting its teeth should either dribble excessively vomit after every meal or be greatly relaxed though one or other or all of these at once may attend a case of teething it by no means follows that any one of them should accompany this process of nature though there can be no doubt that where the pain consequent on the unyielding state of the gums and the firmness of the skin that covers the tooth is severe a copious discharge of saliva acts beneficially in saving the head and also in guarding the child from those dangerous attacks of fits to which many children in their teething are liable 2513 the symptoms that generally indicate the cutting of teeth in addition to the inflamed and swollen state of the gums and increased flow of saliva are the restless and peevish state of the child the hands being thrust into the mouth and the evident pleasure imparted by rubbing the finger or nail gently along the gum the lips are often excoriated and the functions of the stomach or bowels are out of order in severe cases occurring in unhealthy or scrofulous children there are from the first considerable fever disturbed sleep fretfulness diarrhoea rolling of the eyes convulsive startings laborious breathing coma or unnatural sleep ending unless the head is quickly relieved in death 2514 the treatment in all cases of painful teething is remarkably simple and consists in keeping the body cool by mild aperient medicines allaying the irritation in the gums by friction with a rough ivory ring or a stale crust of broad and when the head lungs or any organ is overloaded or unduly excited to use the hot bath and by throwing the body into a perspiration equalize the circulation and relieve the system from the danger of a fatal termination 2515 besides these there is another means but that must be employed by a medical man namely scarifying the gumsan operation always safe and which when judiciously performed and at a critical opportunity will often snatch the child from the grasp of death 2516 there are few subjects on which mothers have often formed such strong and mistaken opinions as on that of lancing an infants gums some rather seeing their child go into fitsand by the unrelieved irritation endangering inflammation of the brain water on the head rickets and other lingering affectionsthan permit the surgeon to afford instant relief by cutting through the hard skin which like a bladder over the stopper of a bottle effectually confines the tooth to the socket and prevents it piercing the soft spongy substance of the gum this prejudice is a great error as we shall presently show for so far from hurting the child there is nothing that will so soon convert an infants tears into smiles as scarifying the gums in painful teething that is if effectually done and the skin of the tooth be divided 2517 though teething is a natural function and to an infant in perfect health should be unproductive of pain yet in general it is not only a fertile cause of suffering but often a source of alarm and danger the former from irritation in the stomach and bowels deranging the whole economy of the system and the latter from coma and fits that may excite alarm in severe cases and the danger that eventuates in some instances from organic disease of the head or spinal marrow 2518 we shall say nothing in this place of rickets or water on the head which are frequent results of dental irritation but proceed to finish our remarks on the treatment of teething though strongly advocating the lancing of the gums in teething and when there are any severe headsymptoms yet it should never be needlessly done or before being satisfied that the tooth is fully formed and is out of the socket and under the gum when assured on these points the gum should be cut lengthwise and from the top of the gum downwards to the tooth in an horizontal direction thus and for about half an inch in length the operation is then to be repeated in a transverse direction cutting across the gum in the centre of the first incision and forming a cross thus the object of this double incision is to insure a retraction of the cut parts and leave an open way for the tooth to start froman advantage not to be obtained when only one incision is made for unless the tooth immediately follows the lancing the opening reunites and the operation has to be repeated that this operation is very little or not at all painful is evidenced by the suddenness with which the infant falls asleep after the lancing and awakes in apparently perfect health though immediately before the use of the gumlancet the child may have been shrieking or in convulsions convulsions or infantine fits 2519 from their birth till after teething infants are more or less subject or liable to sudden fits which often without any assignable cause will attack the child in a moment and while in the mothers arms and which according to their frequency and the age and strength of the infant are either slight or dangerous 2520 whatever may have been the remote cause the immediate one is some irritation of the nervous system causing convulsions or an effusion to the head inducing coma in the first instance the infant cries out with a quick short scream rolls up its eyes arches its body backwards its arms become bent and fixed and the fingers parted the lips and eyelids assume a dusky leaden colour while the face remains pale and the eyes open glassy or staring this condition may or may not be attended with muscular twitchings of the mouth and convulsive plunges of the arms the fit generally lasts from one to three minutes when the child recovers with a sigh and the relaxation of the body in the other case the infant is attacked at once with total insensibility and relaxation of the limbs coldness of the body and suppressed breathing the eyes when open being dilated and presenting a dim glistening appearance the infant appearing for the moment to be dead 2521 treatmentthe first step in either case is to immerse the child in a hot bath up to the chin or if sufficient hot water cannot be procured to cover the body make a hipbath of what can be obtained and while the left hand supports the child in a sitting or recumbent position with the right scoop up the water and run it over the chest of the patient when sufficient water can be obtained the spine should be briskly rubbed while in the bath when this cannot be done lay the child on the knees and with the fingers dipped in brandy rub the whole length of the spine vigorously for two or three minutes and when restored to consciousness give occasionally a teaspoonful of weak brandy and water or wine and water 2522 an hour after the bath it may be necessary to give an aperient powder possibly also to repeat the dose for once or twice every three hours in which case the following prescription is to be employed take of powdered scammony 6 grains grey powder 6 grains antimonial powder 4 grains lump sugar 20 grains mix thoroughly and divide into three powders which are to be taken as advised for an infant one year old for younger or weakly infants divide into four powders and give as the other for thirst and febrile symptoms give drinks of barleywater or cold water and every three hours put ten to fifteen drops of spirits of sweet nitre in a dessertspoonful of either beverage thrush and its treatment 2523 this is a disease to which infants are peculiarly subject and in whom alone it may be said to be a disease for when thrush shows itself in adult or advanced life it is not as a disease proper but only as a symptom or accessory of some other ailment generally of a chronic character and should no more be classed as a separate affection than the petechae or darkcoloured spots that appear in malignant measles may be considered a distinct affection 2524 thrush is a disease of the follicles of the mucous membrane of the alimentary canal whereby there are formed small vesicles or bladders filled with a thick mucous secretion which bursting discharge their contents and form minute ulcers in the centre of each vessel to make this formal but unavoidable description intelligible we must beg the readers patience while we briefly explain terms that may appear to many so unmeaning and make the pathology of thrush fully familiar 2525 the whole digestive canal of which the stomach and bowels are only a part is covered from the lips eyes and ears downwards with a thin glairy tissue like the skin that lines the inside of an egg called the mucous membrane this membrane is dotted all over in a state of health by imperceptible points called follicles through which the saliva or mucous secreted by the membrane is poured out 2526 these follicles or little glands then becoming enlarged and filled with a congealed fluid constitute thrush in its first stage and when the childs lips and mouth appear a mass of small pearls then as these break and discharge the second stage or that of ulceration sets in 2527 symptomsthrush is generally preceded by considerable irritation by the child crying and fretting showing more than ordinary redness of the lips and nostrils hot fetid breath with relaxed bowels and dark feculent evacuations the water is scanty and highcoloured whilst considerable difficulty in swallowing and much thirst are the other symptoms which a careful observation of the little patient makes manifest 2528 the situation and character of thrush show at once that the cause is some irritation of the mucous membrane and can proceed only from the nature and quality of the food before weaning this must be looked for in the mother and the condition of the milk after that time in the crude and indigestible nature of the food given in either case this exciting cause of the disease must be at once stopped when it proceeds from the mother it is always best to begin by physicking the infant through the parent that is to say let the parent first take the medicine which will sufficiently affect the child through the milk this plan has the double object of benefiting the patient and at the same time correcting the state of the mother and improving the condition of her milk in the other case when the child is being fed by hand then proceed by totally altering the style of aliment given and substituting farinaceous food custards blancmange and groundrice puddings 2529 as an aperient medicine for the mother the best thing she can take is a dessertspoonful of carbonate of magnesia once or twice a day in a cup of cold water and every second day for two or three times an aperient pill 2530 as the thrush extends all over the mouth throat stomach and bowels the irritation to the child from such an extent of diseased surface is proportionately great and before attempting to act on such a tender surface by opening medicine the better plan is to soothe by an emollient mixture and for that purpose let the following be prepared take of castor oil 2 drachms sugar 1 drachm mucilage or powdered gum arabic half a drachm triturate till the oil is incorporated then add slowly mintwater one ounce and a half laudanum ten drops half a teaspoonful three times a day to an infant from one to two years old a teaspoonful from two to three years old and a dessertspoonful at any age over that time after two days use of the mixture one of the following powders should be given twice a day accompanied with one dose daily of the mixture grey powder 20 grains powdered rhubarb 15 grains scammony 10 grains mix divide into twelve powders for one year eight powders from one to two and six powders from two to six years old after that age double the strength by giving the quantity of two powders at once 2531 it is sometimes customary to apply borax and honey to the mouth for thrush but it is always better to treat the disease constitutionally rather than locally the first steps therefore to be adopted are to remove or correct the exciting causethe mothers milk or food allay irritation by a warm bath and the castoroil mixture followed by and conjoined with the powders 2532 to those however who wish to try the honey process the best preparation to use is the followingrub down one ounce of honey with two drachms of tincture of myrrh and apply it to the lips and mouth every four or six hours 2533 it is a popular belief and one most devoutly cherished by many nurses and elderly persons that everybody must at some time of their life between birth and death have an attack of thrush and if not in infancy or prime of life it will surely attack them on their deathbed in a form more malignant than if the patient had been affected with the malady earlier the black thrush with which they are then reported to be affected being in all probability the petechae or purple spots that characterize the worst form and often the last stage of typhoid fever 2534 in general very little medicine is needed in this disease of the thrushan alterative powder or a little magnesia given once or twice being all with the warm bath that in the great majority of cases is needed to restore the mucous membrane to health as thrush is caused by an excess of heat or overaction in the lining membrane of the stomach and bowels whatever will counteract this state by throwing the heat on the surface must materially benefit if not cure the disease and that means every mother has at hand in the form of a warm bath after the application of this a little magnesia to correct the acidity existing along the surface of the mucous membrane is often all that is needed to throw the system into such a state as will effect its own cure this favourable state is indicated by an excessive flow of saliva or what is called dribbling and by a considerable amount of relaxation of the bowelsa condition that must not be mistaken for diarrhoea and checked as if a disease but rather for the day or two it continues encouraged as a critical evacuant 2535 should there be much debility in the convalescence half a teaspoonful of stee wine given twice a day in a little barleywater will be found sufficient for all the purposes of a tonic this with the precaution of changing the childs food or when it lives on the mother of correcting the quality of the milk by changing her own diet and by means of an antacid or aperient improving the state of the secretion such is all the treatment that this disease in general requires 2536 the class of diseases we are now approaching are the most important both in their pathological features and in their consequences on the constitution of any group or individual disease that assails the human body and though more frequently attacking the undeveloped frame of childhood are yet by no means confined to that period these are called eruptive fevers and embrace chickenpox cowpox smallpox scarlet fever measles milary fever and erysipelas or st anthonys fire 2537 the general character of all these is that they are contagious and as a general rule attack a person only once in his lifetime that their chain of diseased actions always begins with fever and that after an interval of from one to four days the fever is followed by an eruption of the skin chickenpox or glasspox and cowpox or vaccination 2538 chickenpox or glasspox may in strict propriety be classed as a mild variety of smallpox presenting all the mitigated symptoms of that formidable disease among many physicians it is indeed classed as smallpox and not a separate disease but as this is not the place to discuss such questions and as we profess to give only facts the result of our own practical experience we shall treat this affection of glasspox or chickenpox as we ourselves have found it as a distinct and separate disease 2539 chickenpox is marked by all the febrile symptoms presented by smallpox with this difference that in the case of chickenpox each symptom is particularly slight the heat of body is much less acute and the principal symptoms are difficulty of breathing headache coated tongue and nausea which sometimes amounts to vomiting after a term of general irritability heat and restlessness about the fourth day or between the third and fourth an eruption makes its appearance over the face neck and body in its first two stages closely resembling smallpox with this especial difference that whereas the pustules in smallpox have flat and depressed centresan infallible characteristic of smallpoxthe pustules in chickenpox remain globular while the fluid in them changes from a transparent white to a strawcoloured liquid which begins to exude and disappear about the eighth or ninth day and in mild cases by the twelfth desquamates or peels off entirely 2540 there can be no doubt that chickenpox like smallpox is contagious and under certain states of the atmosphere becomes endemic parents should therefore avoid exposing young children to the danger of infection by taking them where it is known to exist as chickenpox in weakly constitutions or in very young children may superinduce smallpox the one disease either running concurrently with the other or discovering itself as the other declines this of course is a condition that renders the case very hazardous as the child has to struggle against two diseases at once or before it has recruited strength from the attack of the first 2541 treatmentin all ordinary cases of chickenpoxand it is very seldom it assumes any complexitythe whole treatment resolves itself into the use of the warm bath and a course of gentle aperients the bath should be used when the oppression of the lungs renders the breathing difficult or the heat and dryness of the skin with the undeveloped rash beneath the surface shows the necessity for its use 2542 as the pustules in chickenpox very rarely run to the state of suppuration as in the other disease there is no fear of pitting or disfigurement except in very severe forms which however happen so seldom as not to merit apprehension when the eruption subsides however the face may be washed with elderflower water and the routine followed which is prescribed in the convalescent state of smallpox 2543 cowpox properly speaking is an artificial disease established in a healthy body as a prophylactic or preventive agent against the more serious attack of smallpox and is merely that chain of slight febrile symptoms and local irritation consequent on the specific action of the lymph of the vaccination in its action on the circulating system of the body this is not the place to speak of the benefits conferred on mankind by the discovery of vaccination not only as the preserver of the human features from a most loathsome disfigurement but as a sanitary agent in the prolongation of life 2544 fortunately the state has now made it imperative on all parents to have their children vaccinated before or by the end of the twelfth week thus doing away as far as possible with the danger to public health proceeding from the ignorance or prejudice of those parents whose want of information on the subject makes them object to the employment of this specific preventive for though vaccination has been proved not to be always an infallible guard against smallpox the attack is always much lighter should it occur and is seldom if indeed ever fatal after the precaution of vaccination the best time to vaccinate a child is after the sixth and before the twelfth week if it is in perfect health but still earlier if smallpox is prevalent and any danger exists of the infant taking the disease it is customary and always advisable to give the child a mild aperient powder one or two days before inserting the lymph in the arm and should measles scarlet fever or any other disease arise during the progress of the pustule the child when recovered should be revaccinated and the lymph taken from its arm on no account used for vaccinating purposes 2545 the disease of cowpox generally takes twenty days to complete its course in other words the maturity and declension of the pustule takes that time to fulfil its several changes the mode of vaccination is either to insert the matter or lymph taken from a healthy child under the cuticle in several places on both arms or which is still better to make three slight scratches or abrasions with a lancet on one arm in this manner and work into the irritated parts the lymph allowing the arm to dry thoroughly before putting down the infants sleeve by this means absorption is insured and the unnecessary pain of several pustules on both arms avoided no apparent change is observable by the eye for several days indeed not till the fourth in many cases is there any evidence of a vesicle about the fifth day however a pink areola or circle is observed round one or all of the places surrounding a small pearly vesicle or bladder this goes on deepening in hue till the seventh or eighth day when the vesicle is about an inch in diameter with a depressed centre on the ninth the edges are elevated and the surrounding part hard and inflamed the disease is now at its height and the pustule should be opened if not for the purpose of vaccinating other children to allow the escape of the lymph and subdue the inflammatory action after the twelfth day the centre is covered by a brown scab and the colour of the swelling becomes darker gradually declining in hardness and colour till the twentieth when the scab falls off leaving a small pit or cicatrix to mark the seat of the disease and for life prove a certificate of successful vaccination 2546 in some children the inflammation and swelling of the arm is excessive and extremely painful and the fever about the ninth or tenth day very high the pustule therefore at that time should sometimes be opened the arm fomented every two hours with a warm bread poultice and an aperient powder given to the infant measles and scarlet fever with the treatment of both measles 2547 this muchdreaded disease which forms the next subject in our series of infantine diseases and which entails more evils on the health of childhood than any other description of physical suffering to which that age of life is subject may be considered more an affection of the venous circulation tending to general and local congestion attended with a diseased condition of the blood than either as a fever or an inflammation and though generally classed before or after scarlet fever is in its pathology and treatment irrespective of its afterconsequences as distinct and opposite as one disease can well be from another 4548 as we have already observed measles are always characterized by the running at the nose and eyes and great oppression of breathing so in the mode of treatment two objects are to be held especially in view first to unload the congested state of the lungsthe cause of the oppressed breathing and secondly to act vigorously both during the disease and afterwards on the bowels at the same time it cannot be too strongly borne in mind that though the patient in measles should on no account be kept unduly hot more care than in most infantine complaints should be taken to guard the body from cold or any abrupt changes of temperature with these special observations we shall proceed to give a description of the disease as recognized by its usual 2549 symptoms which commence with cold chills and flushes lassitude heaviness pain in the head and drowsiness cough hoarseness and extreme difficulty of breathing frequent sneezing deduction or running at the eyes and nose nausea sometimes vomiting thirst a furred tongue the pulse throughout is quick and sometimes full and soft at others hard and small with other indications of an inflammatory nature 2550 on the third day small red points make their appearance first on the face and neck gradually extending over the upper and lower part of the body on the fifth day the vivid red of the eruption changes into a brownish hue and in two or three days more the rash entirely disappears leaving a loose powdery desquamation on the skin which rubs off like dandriff at this stage of the disease a diarrhoea frequently comes on which being what is called critical should never be checked unless seriously severe measles sometimes assume a typhoid or malignant character in which form the symptoms are all greatly exaggerated and the case from the first becomes both doubtful and dangerous in this condition the eruption comes out sooner and only in patches and often after showing for a few hours suddenly recedes presenting instead of the usual florid red a dark purple or blackish hue a dark brown fur forms on the gums and mouth the breathing becomes laborious delirium supervenes and if unrelieved is followed by coma a fetid diarrhoea takes place and the patient sinks under the congested state of the lungs and the oppressed functions of the brain 2551 the unfavourable symptoms in measles are a high degree of fever the excessive heat and dryness of the skin hurried and short breathing and a particularly hard pulse the sequels or afterconsequences of measles are croup bronchitis mesenteric disease abscesses behind the ear ophthalmia and glandular swellings in other parts of the body 2552 treatmentin the first place the patient should be kept in a cool room the temperature of which must be regulated to suit the childs feelings of comfort and the diet adapted to the strictest principles of abstinence when the inflammatory symptoms are severe bleeding in some form is often necessary though when adopted it must be in the first stage of the disease and if the lungs are the apprehended seat of the inflammation two or more leeches according to the age and strength of the patient must be applied to the upper part of the chest followed by a small blister or the blister may be substituted for the leeches the attendant bearing in mind that the benefit effected by the blister can always be considerably augmented by plunging the feet into very hot water about a couple of hours after applying the blister and kept in the water for about two minutes and let it further be remembered that this immersion of the feet in hot water may be adopted at any time or stage of the disease and that whenever the head or lungs are oppressed relief will always accrue from its sudden and brief employment when the symptoms commence with much shivering and the skin early assumes a hot dry character the appearance of the rash will be facilitated and all the other symptoms rendered milder if the patient is put into a warm bath and kept in the water for about three minutes or where that is not convenient the following process which will answer quite as well can be substitutedstand the child naked in a tub and having first prepared several jugs of sufficiently warm water empty them in quick succession over the patients shoulders and body immediately wrap in a hot blanket and put the child to bed till it rouses from the sleep that always follows the effusion or bath this agent by lowering the temperature of the skin and opening the pores producing a natural perspiration and unloading the congested state of the lungs in most cases does away entirely with the necessity both for leeches and a blister whether any of these external means have been employed or not the first internal remedies should commence with a series of aperient powders and a saline mixture as prescribed in the following formularies at the same time as a beverage to quench the thirst let a quantity of barleywater be made slightly acidulated by the juice of an orange and partially sweetened by some sugarcandy and of which when properly made and cold let the patient drink as often as thirst or the dryness of the mouth renders necessary 2553 aperient powderstake of scammony and jalap each 24 grains grey powder and powdered antimony each 18 grains mix and divide into 12 powders if for a child between two and four years of age into 8 powders if for a child between four and eight years of ago and into 6 powders for between eight and twelve years one powder to be given in a little jelly or sugarandwater every three or four hours according to the severity of the symptoms 2554 saline mixturetake of mintwater 6 ounces powdered nitre 20 grains antimonial wine 3 drachms spirits of nitre 2 drachms syrup of saffron 2 drachms mix to children under three years give a teaspoonful every two hours from that age to six a dessertspoonful at the same times and a tablespoonful every three or four hours to children between six and twelve 2555 the object of these aperient powders is to keep up a steady but gentle action on the bowels but whenever it seems necessary to administer a stronger dose and effect a brisk action on the digestive organsa course particularly imperative towards the close of the diseasetwo of these powders given at once according to the age will be found to produce that effect that is two of the twelve for a child under four years and two of the eight and two of the six according to the age of the patient 2556 when the difficulty of breathing becomes oppressive as it generally does towards night a hot bran poultice laid on the chest will be always found highly beneficial the diet throughout must be light and consist of farinaceous food such as rice and sago puddings beeftea and toast and not till convalescence sets in should hard or animal food be given 2557 when measles assume the malignant form the advice just given must be broken through food of a nutritious and stimulating character should be at once substituted and administered in conjunction with wine and even spirits and the disease regarded and treated as a case of typhus but as this form of measles is not frequent and if occurring hardly likely to be treated without assistance it is unnecessary to enter on the minutiae of its practice here what we have prescribed in almost all cases will be found sufficient to meet every emergency without resorting to a multiplicity of agents 2558 the great point to remember in measles is not to give up the treatment with the apparent subsidence of the disease as the afterconsequences of measles are too often more serious and to be more dreaded than the measles themselves to guard against this danger and thoroughly purify the system after the subsidence of all the symptoms of the disease a corrective course of medicine and a regimen of exercise should be adopted for some weeks after the cure of the disease to effect this an active aperient powder should be given every three or four clays with a daily dose of the subjoined tonic mixture with as much exercise by walking running after a hoop or other bodily exertion as the strength of the child and the state of the atmosphere will admit the patient being wherever possible removed to a purer air as soon as convalescence warrants the change 2559 tonic mixturetake of infusion of roseleaves 6 ounces quinine 8 grains diluted sulphuric acid 15 drops mix dose from half a teaspoonful up to a dessertspoonful once a day according to the ago of the patient scarlatina or scarlet fever 2560 though professional accuracy has divided this disease into several forms we shall keep to the one disease most generally mot with the common or simple scarlet fever which in all cases is characterized by an excessive heat on the skin sore throat and a peculiar speckled appearance of the tongue 2561 symptomscold chills shivering nausea thirst hot skin quick pulse with difficulty of swallowing the tongue is coated presenting through its fur innumerable specks the elevated papillae of the tongue which gives it the speckled character that if not the invariable sign of scarlet fever is only met with in cases closely analogous to that disease between the second and third day but most frequently on the third a bright red efflorescence breaks out in patches on the face neck and back from which it extends over the trunk and extremities always showing thicker and deeper in colour wherever there is any pressure such as the elbows back and hips when the eruption is well out the skin presents the appearance of a boiled lobstershell at first the skin is smooth but as the disease advances perceptible roughness is apparent from the elevation of the rash or more properly the pores of the skin on the fifth and sixth days the eruption begins to decline and by the eighth has generally entirely disappeared during the whole of this period there is more or less constant sore throat 2562 the treatment of scarlet fever is in general very simple where the heat is great and the eruption comes out with difficulty or recedes as soon as it appears the body should be sponged with cold vinegarandwater or tepid water as in measles poured over the chest and body the patient being as in that disease wrapped in a blanket and put to bed and the same powders and mixture ordered in measles administered with the addition of a constant hot bran poultice round the throat which should be continued from the first symptom till a day or two after the declension of the rash the same low diet and cooling drink with the same general instructions are to be obeyed in this as in the former disease 2563 when the fever runs high in the first stage and there is much nausea before employing the effusions of water give the patient an emetic of equal parts of ipecacuanha and antimonial wine in doses of from a teaspoonful to a tablespoonful according to age by these means nine out of every ten cases of scarlatina may be safely and expeditiously cured especially if the temperature of the patients room is kept at an even standard of about sixty degrees hoopingcough croup and diarrhoea with their mode of treatment hoopingcough 2564 this is purely a spasmodic disease and is only infectious through the faculty of imitation a habit that all children are remarkably apt to fall into and even where adults have contracted hoopingcough it has been from the same cause and is as readily accounted for on the principle of imitation as that the gaping of one person will excite or predispose a whole party to follow the same spasmodic example if any one associates for a few days with a person who stammers badly he will find when released from his company that the sequence of his articulation and the fluency of his speech are for a time gone and it will be a matter of constant vigilance and some difficulty to overcome the evil of so short an association the manner in which a number of schoolgirls will one after another fall into a fit on beholding one of their number attacked with epilepsy must be familiar to many these several facts lead us to a juster notion of how to treat this spasmodic disease every effort should therefore be directed mentally and physically to break the chain of nervous action on which the continuance of the cough depends 2565 symptomshoopingcough comes on with a slight oppression of breathing thirst quick pulse hoarseness and a hard dry cough this state may exist without any change from one to two or three weeks before the peculiar feature of the diseasethe hoopsets in as the characteristics of this cough are known to all it is unnecessary to enter here physiologically on the subject we shall therefore merely remark that the frequent vomiting and bleeding at the mouth or nose are favourable signs and proceed to the 2566 treatment which should consist in keeping up a state of nausea and vomiting for this purpose give the child doses of ipecacuanha and antimonial wines in equal parts and quantities varying from half to one and a half teaspoonful once a day or when the expectoration is hard and difficult of expulsion giving the following cough mixture every four hours take of syrup of squills 12 ounce antimonial wine 1 ounce laudanum 15 drops syrup of toulou 2 drachms water 112 ounce mix the dose is from half a spoonful to a dessertspoonful when the cough is urgent the warm bath is to be used and either one or two leeches applied over the breastbone or else a small blister laid on the lower part of the throat 2567 such is the medical treatment of hoopingcough but there is a moral regimen based on the nature of the disease which should never be omitted and on the principle that a sudden start or diversion of the mind will arrest a person in the act of sneezing or gaping so the like means should be adopted with the hoopingcough patient and in the first stage before the hooping has been added the parent should endeavour to break the paroxysm of the cough by abruptly attracting the patients attention and thus if possible preventing the cough from reaching that height when the ingulp of air gives the hoop or crow that marks the disease but when once that symptom has set in it becomes still more necessary to endeavour by even measures of intimidation to break the spasmodic chain of the cough exercise in the open air when dry is also requisite and charge of scene and air in all cases is of absolute necessity and may be adopted at any stage of the disease croup 2568 this is by far the most formidable and fatal of all the diseases to which infancy and childhood are liable and is purely an inflammatory affection attacking that portion of the mucous membrane lining the windpipe and bronchial tubes and from the effect of which a false or loose membrane is formed along the windpipe resembling in appearance the finger of a glove suspended in the passage and consequently terminating the life of the patient by suffocation for as the lower end grows together and becomes closed no air can enter the lungs and the child dies choked all dull fat and heavy children are peculiarly predisposed to this disease and those with short necks and who make a wheezing noise in their natural breathing croup is always sudden in its attack and rapid in its career usually proving fatal within three days most frequently commences in the night and generally attacking children between the ages of three and ten years mothers should therefore be on their guard who have children predisposed to this disease and immediately resort to the means hereafter advised 2569 symptomslanguor and restlessness hoarseness wheezing and short dry cough with occasional rattling in the throat during sleep the child often plucking at its throat with its fingers difficulty of breathing which quickly becomes hard and laboured causing great anxiety of the countenance and the veins of the neck to swell and become knotted the voice in speaking acquires a sharp crowing or croupy sound while the inspirations have a harsh metallic intonation after a few hours a quantity of thick ropy mucus is thrown out hanging about the mouth and causing suffocating fits of coughing to expel 2570 treatmentplace the child immediately in a hot bath up to the throat and on removal from the water give an emetic of the antimonial or ipecacuanha wine and when the vomiting has subsided lay a long blister down the front of the throat and administer one of the following powders every twenty minutes to a child from three to six years of age 2571 take of calomel 12 grains tartar emetic 2 grains lump sugar 30 grains mix accurately and divide into 12 powders for a child from six to twelve years divide into 6 powders and give one every halfhour 2572 should the symptoms remain unabated after a few hours apply one or two leeches to the throat and put mustard poultices to the foot and thighs retaining them about eight minutes and in extreme cases a mustard poultice to the spine between the shoulders and at the same time rub mercurial ointment into the armpits and the angles of the jaws 2573 such is a vigorous and reliable system of treatment in severe cases of croup but in the milder and more general form the following abridgment will in all probability be all that will be requiredfirst the hot bath second the emetic third a mustard plaster round the throat for five minutes fourth the powders fifth another emetic in six hours if needed and the powders continued without intermission while the urgency of the symptoms continues when relief has been obtained these are to be discontinued and a dose of senna tea given to act on the bowels diarrhoea 2574 the diarrhoea with which children are so frequently affected especially in infancy should demand the nurses immediate attention and when the secretion from its clayey colour indicates an absence of bile a powder composed of 3 grains of grey powder and 1 grain of rhubarb should be given twice with an interval of four hours between each dose to a child from one to two years and a day or two afterwards an aperient powder containing the same ingredients and quantities with the addition of 2 or 3 grains of scammony for the relaxation consequent on an overloaded stomach or acidity in the bowels a little magnesia dissolved in milk should be employed two or three times a day 2575 when much griping and pain attend the diarrhoea half a teaspoonful of dalbys carminative the best of all patent medicines should be given either with or without a small quantity of castor oil to carry off the exciting cause 2576 for any form of diarrhoea that by excessive action demands a speedy correction the most efficacious remedy that can be employed in all ages and conditions of childhood is the tincture of kino of which from 10 to 30 drops mixed with a little sugar and water in a spoon are to be given every two or three hours till the undue action has been checked often the change of diet to rice milk eggs or the substitution of animal for vegetable food or vice versa will correct an unpleasant and almost chronic state of diarrhoea 2577 a very excellent carminative powder for flatulent infants may be kept in the house and employed with advantage whenever the child is in pain or griped by dropping 5 grains of oil of aniseed and 2 of peppermint on half an ounce of lump sugar and rubbing it in a mortar with a drachm of magnesia into a fine powder a small quantity of this may be given in a little water at any time and always with benefit the doctor chapter xliii 2578 time according to the old proverb is money and it may also in many cases and with equal truthfulness be said to be life for a few moments in great emergencies often turn the balance between recovery and death this applies more especially to all kinds of poisoning fits submersion in water or exposure to noxious gases and many accidents if people knew how to act during the interval that must necessarily elapse from the moment that a medical man is sent for until he arrives many lives might be saved which now unhappily are lost generally speaking however nothing is doneall is confusion and fright and the surgeon on his arrival finds that death has already seized its victim who had his friends but

the bread has soaked up as much water as it will imbibe drain off the remaining water and there will be left a light pulp spread it a third of an inch thick on folded linen and apply it when of the temperature of a warm bath to preserve it moist occasionally drop warm water on it 2596 linseedmeal poulticescald your basin by pouring a little hot water into it then put a small quantity of finelyground linseedmeal into the basin pour a little hot water on it and stir it round briskly until you have well incorporated them add a little more meal and a little more water then stir it again do not let any lumps remain in the basin but stir the poultice well and do not be sparing of your trouble what you do next is to take as much of it out of the basin as you may require lay it on a piece of soft linen and let it be about a quarter of an inch thickabernethy 2597 mustard poulticemix equal parts of dry mustard and linseedmeal in warm vinegar when the poultice is wanted weak warm water may be used for the vinegar and when it is required very strong mustard alone without any linseedmeal is to be mixed with warm vinegar 2598 an ordinary blisterspread a little blister compound on a piece of common adhesive plaster with the right thumb it should be put on just thickly enough to conceal the appearance of the plaster beneath the part from which a blister has been taken should be covered till it heals over with soft linen rags smeared with lard baths and fomentations 2599 all fluid applications to the body are exhibited either in a hot or cold form and the object for which they are administered is to produce a stimulating effect over the entire or a part of the system for the effect though differently obtained and varying in degree is the same in principle whether procured by hot or cold water 2600 heatthere are three forms in which heat is universally applied to the bodythat of the tepid warm and vapour bath but as the first is too inert to be worth notice and the last dangerous and inapplicable except in public institutions we shall confine our remarks to the really efficacious and always attainable onethe 2601 warm and hot baththese baths are used whenever there is congestion or accumulation of blood in the internal organs causing pain difficulty of breathing or stupor and are employed by their stimulating property to cause a rush of blood to the surface and by unloading the great organs produce a temporary inflammation in the skin and so equalize the circulation the effect of the hot bath is to increase the fulness of the pulse accelerate respiration and excite perspiration in all inflammations of the stomach and bowels the hot bath is of the utmost consequence the temperature of the warm bath varies from 92 to 100 and may be obtained by those who have no thermometer to test the exact heat by mixing one measure of boiling with two of cold water 2602 fomentations are generally used to effect in a part the benefit produced on the whole body by the bath to which a sedative action is occasionally given by the use of roots herbs or other ingredients the object being to relieve the internal organ as the throat or muscles round a joint by exciting a greater flow of blood to the skin over the affected part as the real agent of relief is heat the fomentation should always be as hot as it can comfortably be borne and to insure effect should be repeated every halfhour warm fluids are applied in order to render the swelling which accompanies inflammation less painful by the greater readiness with which the skin yields than when it is harsh and dry they are of various kinds but the most simple and oftentimes the most useful that can be employed is warm water another kind of fomentation is composed of dried poppyheads 4 oz break them to pieces empty out the seeds put them into 4 pints of water boil for a quarter of an hour then strain through a cloth or sieve and keep the water for use or chamomile flowers hemlock and many other plants may be boiled and the part fomented with the hot liquor by means of flannels wetted with the decoction 2603 cold when applied in excess to the body drives the blood from the surface to the centre reduces the pulse makes the breathing hard and difficult produces coma and if long continued death but when medicinally used it excites a reaction on the surface equivalent to a stimulating effect as in some cases of fever when the body has been sponged with cold water it excites by reaction increased circulation on the skin cold is sometimes used to keep up a repellent action as when local inflammation takes place a remedy is applied which by its benumbing and astringent effect causes the blood or the excess of it in the part to recede and by contracting the vessels prevents the return of any undue quantity till the affected part recovers its tone such remedies are called lotions and should when used be applied with the same persistency as the fomentation for as the latter should be renewed as often as the heat passes off so the former should be applied as often as the heat from the skin deprives the application of its cold 2604 poultices are only another form of fomentation though chiefly used for abscesses the ingredient best suited for a poultice is that which retains heat the longest of these ingredients the best are linseedmeal bran and bread bran sewed into a bag as it can be reheated will be found the cleanest and most useful especially for sore throats how to bleed 2605 in cases of great emergency such as the strong kind of apoplexy and when a surgeon cannot possibly be obtained for some considerable time the life of the patient depends almost entirely upon the fact of his being bled or not we therefore give instructions how the operation of bleeding is to be performed but caution the reader only to attempt it in cases of the greatest emergency place a handkerchief or piece of tape rather but not too tightly round the arm about three or four inches above the elbow this will cause the veins below to swell and become very evident if this is not sufficient the hand should be constantly and quickly opened and shut for the same purpose there will now be seen passing up the middle of the forearm a vein which just below the bend of the elbow sends a branch inwards and outwards each branch shortly joining another large vein it is from the outer branchthat the person is to be bled the right arm is the one mostly operated on the operator should take the lancet in his right hand between the thumb and first finger place the thumb of his left hand on the vein below the part where he is going to bleed from and then gently thrust the tip of the lancet into the vein and taking care not to push it too deeply cut in a gently curved direction thus and bring it out point upwards at about half an inch from the part of the vein into which he had thrust it the vein must be cut lengthways and not across when sufficient blood has been taken away remove the bandage from above the elbow and place the thumb of the left hand firmly over the cut until all the bleeding ceases a small pad of lint is then to be put over the cut with a larger pad over it and the two kept in their places by means of a handkerchief or linen roller bound pretty tightly over them and round the arm 2606 when a person is bled he should always be in the standing or at any rate in the sitting position for if as is often the case he should happen to faint he can in most eases at least easily be brought to again by the operator placing him flat on his back and stopping the bleeding this is of the greatest importance it has been recommended for what supposed advantages we dont know to bleed people when they are lying down should a person under these circumstances faint what could be done to bring him to again the great treatment of lowering the body of the patient to the flat position cannot be followed here it is in that position already and cannot be placed lower than it at present isexcept as is most likely to be the case under the ground 2607 bleeding from the nosemany children especially those of a sanguineous temperament are subject to sudden discharges of blood from some part of the body and as all such fluxes are in general the result of an effort of nature to relieve the system from some overload or pressure such discharges unless in excess and when likely to produce debility should not be rashly or too abruptly checked in general these discharges are confined to the summer or spring months of the year and follow pains in the head a sense of drowsiness languor or oppression and as such symptoms are relieved by the loss of blood the hemorrhage should to a certain extent be encouraged when however the bleeding is excessive or returns too frequently it becomes necessary to apply means to subdue or mitigate the amount for this purpose the sudden and unexpected application of cold is itself sufficient in most cases to arrest the most active hemorrhage a wet towel laid suddenly on the back between the shoulders and placing the child in a recumbent posture is often sufficient to effect the object where however the effusion resists such simple means napkins wrung out of cold water must be laid across the forehead and nose the hands dipped in cold water and a bottle of hot water applied to the feet if in spite of these means the bleeding continues a little fine wool or a few folds of lint tied together by a piece of thread must be pushed up the nostril from which the blood flows to act as a plug and pressure on the bleeding vessel when the discharge has entirely ceased the plug is to be pulled out by means of the thread to prevent a repetition of the hemorrhage the body should be sponged every morning with cold water and the child put under a course of steel wine have openair exercise and if possible saltwater bathing for children a key suddenly dropped down the back between the skin and clothes will often immediately arrest a copious bleeding 2608 spitting of blood or hemorrhage from the lungs is generally known from blood from the stomach by its being of a brighter colour and in less quantities than that which is always grumous and mixed with the halfdigested food in either case rest should be immediately enjoined total abstinence from stimulants and a low poor diet accompanied with the horizontal position and bottles of boiling water to the feet at the same time the patient should suck through a quill every hour half a wineglass of water in which 10 or 15 drops of the elixir of vitriol has been mixed and till further advice has been procured keep a towel wrung out of cold water on the chest or stomach according to the seat of the hemorrhage bites and stings 2609 bites and stings may be divided into three kinds1 those of insects 2 those of snakes 3 those of dogs and other animals 2610 1 the bites or stings of insects such as gnats bees wasps c need cause very little alarm and are generally speaking easily cured they are very serious however when they take place on some delicate part of the body such as near the eye or in the throat the treatment is very simple in most cases and consists in taking out the sting if it is left behind with a needle and applying to the part a liniment made of finelyscraped chalk and oliveoil mixed together to about the thickness of cream 2611 bathing the part bitten with warm turpentine or warm vinegar is also of great use if the person feels faint he should lie quietly on his back and take a little brandyandwater or salvolatile and water when the inside of the throat is the part stung there is great danger of violent inflammation taking place in this case from eight to twelve leeches should be immediately put to the outside of the throat and when they drop off the part to which they had been applied should be well fomented with warm water the inside of the throat is to be constantly gargled with salt and water bits of ice are to be sucked rubbing the face and hands well over with plain oliveoil before going to bed will often keep gnats and musquitoes from biting during the night strong scent such as eaudecologne will have the same effect 2612 2 bites of snakesthese are much more dangerous than the preceding and require more powerful remedies the bites of the different kinds of snakes do not all act alike but affect people in different waystreatment of the part bitten the great thing is to prevent the poison getting into the blood and if possible to remove the whole of it at once from the body a pockethandkerchief a piece of tape or cord or in fact of anything that is at hand should be tied tightly round the part of the body bitten if it be the leg or arm immediately above the bite and between it and the heart the bite should then be sucked several times by any one who is near there is no danger in this provided the person who does it has not got the skin taken off any part of his mouth what has been sucked into the mouth should be immediately spit out again but if those who are near have sufficient nerve for the operation and a suitable instrument they should cut out the central part bitten and then bathe the wound for some time with warm water to make it bleed freely the wound should afterwards be rubbed with a stick of lunar caustic or what is better a solution of this60 grains of lunar caustic dissolved in an ounce of watershould be dropped into it the band should be kept on the part during the whole of the time that these means are being adopted the wound should afterwards be covered with lint dipped in cold water the best plan however to be adopted if it can be managed is the followingtake a common wineglass and holding it upside down put a lighted candle or a spiritlamp into it for a minute or two this will take out the air then clap the glass suddenly over the bitten part and it will become attached and hold on to the flesh the glass being nearly empty the blood containing the poison will in consequence flow into it from the wound of its own accord this process should be repeated three or four times and the wound sucked or washed with warm water before each application of the glass as a matter of course when the glass is removed all the blood should be washed out of it before it is applied againconstitutional treatment there is mostly at first great depression of strength in these cases and it is therefore requisite to give some stimulant a glass of hot brandyandwater or twenty drops of salvolatile is the best that can be given when the strength has returned and if the patient has not already been sick a little mustard in hot water should be given to make him so if on the other hand as is often the case the vomiting is excessive a large mustard poultice should be placed over the stomach and a grain of solid opium swallowed in the form of a pill for the purpose of stopping it only one of these pills should be given by a nonprofessional person in all cases of bites from snakes send for a surgeon as quickly as possible and act according to the above directions until he arrives if he is within any reasonable distance content yourself by putting on the band sucking the wound applying the glass and if necessary giving a little brandyandwater 2613 3 bites of dogsfor obvious reasons these kinds of bites are more frequently met with than those of snakes the treatment is the same as that for snakebites more especially that of the bitten part the majority of writers on the subject are in favour of keeping the wound open as long as possible this may be done by putting a few beans on it and then by applying a large linseedmeal poultice over them injuries and accidents to bones 2614 dislocation of boneswhen the end of a bone is pushed out of its natural position it is said to be dislocated this may be caused by violence disease or natural weakness of the parts about a jointsymptoms deformity about the joint with unnatural prominence at one part and depression at another the limb may be shorter or longer than usual and is stiff and unable to be moved differing in these last two respects from a broken limb which is mostly shorter never longer than usual and which is always more movabletreatment so much practical science and tact are requisite in order to bring a dislocated bone into its proper position again that we strongly advise the reader never to interfere in these cases unless indeed it is altogether impossible to obtain the services of a surgeon but because any one of us may very possibly be placed in that emergency we give a few rough rules for the readers guidance in the first place make the joint from which the bone has been displaced perfectly steady either by fixing it to some firm object or else by holding it with the hands then pull the dislocated bone in a direction towards the place from which it has been thrust so that if it moves at all from its unnatural position it may have the best chance of returning to its proper place do not however pull or press against the parts too violently as you may perhaps by doing so rupture bloodvessels and produce most serious consequences when you do attempt to reduce a dislocated bone do it as quickly as possible after the accident has taken place every hour making the operation more difficult when the patient is very strong he may be put into a warm bath until he feels faint or have sixty drops of antimonial wine given him every ten minutes until he feels sickish these two means are of great use in relaxing the muscles if the bone has been brought back again to its proper place keep it there by means of bandages and if there is much pain about the joint apply a cold lotion to it and keep it perfectly at rest the lotion should be a dessertspoonful of goulards extract and two tablespoonfuls of vinegar mixed in a pint of water leeches are sometimes necessary unless the local pain or general feverish symptoms are great the patients diet should be the same as usual dislocations may be reduced a week or even a fortnight after they have taken place as therefore although the sooner a bone is reduced the better there is no very great emergency and as the most serious consequences may follow improper or too violent treatment it is always better for people in these cases to do too little than too much inasmuch as the good which has not yet may still be done whereas the evil that has been done cannot so easily be undone 2615 fractures of bonessymptoms 1 deformity of the part 2 unnatural looseness 3 a grating sound when the two ends of the broken bone are rubbed together 4 loss of natural motion and power in some cases there is also shortening of the limbfracture takes place from several causes as a fall a blow a squeeze and sometimes from the violent action of musclestreatment in cases where a surgeon cannot be procured immediately after the accident the following general rules are offered for the readers guidancethe broken limb should be placed and kept as nearly as possible in its natural position this is to be done by first pulling the two portions of the bone in opposite directions until the limb becomes as long as the opposite one and then by applying a splint and binding it to the part by means of a roller when there is no deformity the pulling is of course unnecessary if there is much swelling about the broken part a cold lotion is to be applied this lotion which we will call lotion no 1 may be thus mademix a dessertspoonful of goulards extract and two tablespoonfuls of vinegar in a pint of water when the leg or arm is broken always if possible get it to the same length and form as the opposite limb the broken part should be kept perfectly quiet when a broken limb is deformed and a particular muscle is on the stretch place the limb in such a position as will relax it this will in most cases cure the deformity brandyandwater or salvolatile and water are to be given when the patient is faint surgical aid should of course be procured as soon as possible 2616 joints injuries toall kinds of injuries to joints of whatever description require particular attention in consequence of the violent inflammations which are so liable to take place in these parts of the body and which do so much mischief in a little time the joint injured should always be kept perfectly at rest and when it is very painful and the skin about it red swollen hot and shining at the same time that the patient has general feverish symptoms such as great thirst and headacheleeches and when they drop off warm poppy fomentations are to be applied the no 1 pills abovementioned are to be given two are a dose for a grown person with a black draught three hours afterwards give also two tablespoonfuls of the fevermixture every four hours and keep the patient on low diet when the injury and swelling are not very great warm applications with rest low diet and a dose of aperient medicine will be sufficient when a joint has received a penetrating wound it will require the most powerful treatment and can only be properly attended to by a surgeon the patients friends will have to use their own judgment to a great extent in these and in many other cases as to when leeches fevermixture c are necessary a universal rule however without a single exception is always to rest a joint well after it has been injured in any way whatever to purge the patient and to keep him on low diet without beer unless he has been a very great drinker indeed in which case he may still be allowed to take a little for if the stimulant that a person has been accustomed to in excess be all taken away at once he is very likely to have an attack of delirium tremens the quantity given should not however be muchsay a pint or at the most a pint and a half a day rubbing the joint with opodeldoc or the application of a blister to it is of great service in taking away the thickenings which often remain after all heat pain and redness have left an injured joint great care should be observed in not using a joint too quickly after it has been injured when the shoulderjoint is the one injured the arm should be bound tightly to the body by means of a linen or flannel roller and the elbow raised when the elbow it should be kept raised in the straight position on a pillow when the wrist it should be raised on the chest and suspended in a sling when the knee it should be kept in the straight position and lastly when the ankle it should be a little raised on a pillow 2617 bruises lacerations and cutswherever the bruise may be or however swollen or discoloured the skin may become two or three applications of the extract of lead kept to the part by means of lint will in an hour or little more remove all pain swelling and tenderness simple or clean cuts only require the edges of the wound to be placed in their exact situation drawn close together and secured there by one or two slips of adhesive plaster when the wound however is jagged or the flesh or cuticle lacerated the parts are to be laid as smooth and regular as possible and a piece of lint wetted in the extract of lead laid upon the wound and a piece of greased lint placed above it to prevent the dressing sticking the whole covered over to protect from injury and the part dressed in the same manner once a day till the cure is effected 2618 bruises and their treatmentthe best application for a bruise be it large or small is moist warmth therefore a warm breadandwater poultice in hot moist flannels should be put on as they supple the skin if the bruise be very severe and in the neighbourhood of a joint it will be well to apply ten or a dozen leeches over the whole bruised part and afterwards a poultice but leeches should not be put on young children if the bruised part be the knee or the ankle walking should not be attempted till it can be performed without pain inattention to this point often lays the foundation for serious mischief in these joints especially in the case of scrofulous persons in all conditions of bruises occurring in children whether swellings or abrasions no remedy is so quick or certain of effecting a cure as the pure extract of lead applied to the part burns and scalds 2619 burns and scalds being essentially the same in all particulars and differing only in the manner of their production may be spoken of together as a general rule scalds are less severe than burns because the heat of water by which scalds are mostly produced is not even when it is boiling so intense as that of flame oil however and other liquids whose boilingpoint is high produce scalds of a very severe nature burns and scalds have been divided into three classes the first class comprises those where the burn is altogether superficial and merely reddens the skin the second where the injury is greater and we get little bladders containing a fluid called serum dotted over the affected part in the third class we get in the case of burns a charring and in that of scalds a softening or pulpiness perhaps a complete and immediate separation of the part this may occur at once or in the course of a little time the pain from the second kind of burns is much more severe than that in the other two although the danger as a general rule is less than it is in the third class these injuries are much more dangerous when they take place on the trunk than when they happen on the arms or legs the danger arises more from the extent of surface that is burnt than from the depth to which the burn goes this rule of course has certain exceptions because a small burn on the chest or belly penetrating deeply is more dangerous than a more extensive but superficial one on the arm or leg when a persons clothes are in flames the best way of extinguishing them is to wind a rug or some thick material tightly round the whole of the body 2620 treatment of the first class of burns and scaldsof the part affectedcover it immediately with a good coating of common flour or cottonwool with flour dredged well into it the great thing is to keep the affected surface of the skin from the contact of the air the part will shortly get well and the skin may or may not peel offconstitutional treatment if the burn or scald is not extensive and there is no prostration of strength this is very simple and consists in simply giving a little aperient medicinepills no 2 as followsmix 5 grains of blue pill and the same quantity of compound extract of colocynth and make into two pillsthe dose for a fullgrown person three hours after the pills give a black draught if there are general symptoms of fever such as hot skin thirst headache c c two tablespoonfuls of fevermixture are to be given every four hours the fevermixture we remind our readers is made thusmix a drachm of powdered nitro 2 drachms of carbonate of potash 2 teaspoonfuls of antimonial wine and a tablespoonful of sweet spirits of nitro in half a pint of water 2621 second class local treatmentas the symptoms of these kinds of burns are more severe than those of the first class so the remedies appropriate to them are more powerful having as carefully as possible removed the clothes from the burnt surface and taking care not to break the bladders spread the following liniment no 1 on a piece of linen or lintnot the fluffy sideand apply it to the part the liniment should be equal parts of limewater and linseedoil well mixed if the burn is on the trunk of the body it is better to use a warm linseedmeal poultice after a few days dress the wound with turners cerate if the burn is at the bend of the elbow place the arm in the straight position for if it is bent the skin when healed will be contracted and the arm in all probability always remain in the same un natural position this indeed applies to all parts of the body therefore always place the part affected in the most stretched position possibleconstitutional treatment the same kind of treatment is to be used as for the first class only it must be more powerful stimulants are move often necessary but must be given with great caution if as is often the case there is great irritability and restlessness a dose of opium paregoric in doses of from sixty to a hundred drops according to age is best is of great service the feverish symptoms will require aperient medicines and the fever mixture a drink made of about a tablespoonful of cream of tartar and a little lemonjuice in a quart of warm water allowed to cool is a very nice one in these cases the diet throughout should not be too low especially if there is much discharge from the wound after a few days it is often necessary to give wine ammonia and strong beeftea these should be had recourse to when the tongue gets dry and dark and the pulse weak and frequent if there should be after the lapse of a week or two pain over one particular part of the belly a blister should be put on it and a powder of mercury and chalkgrey powder and dovers powder two grains of the former and five of the latter given three times a day affections of the head and chest also frequently occur as a consequence of these kinds of burns but no one who is not a medical man can treat them 2622 third classthese are so severe as to make it impossible for a nonprofessional person to be of much service in attending to them when they occur a surgeon should always be sent for until he arrives however the following treatment should be adoptedplace the patient fulllength on his back and keep him warm apply fomentations of flannels wrung out of boiling water and sprinkled with spirits of turpentine to the part and give wine and salvolatile in such quantities as the prostration of strength requires always bearing in mind the great fact that you have to steer between two quicksandsdeath from present prostration and death from future excitement which will always be increased in proportion to the amount of stimulants given give therefore only just as much as is absolutely necessary to keep life in the body 2623 concussion of brainstunningthis may be caused by a blow or a fallsymptoms cold skin weak pulse almost total insensibility slow weak breathing pupil of eye sometimes bigger sometimes smaller than natural inability to move unwillingness to answer when spoken to these symptoms come on directly after the accidenttreatment place the patient quietly on a warm bed send for a surgeon and do nothing else for the first four or six hours after this time the skin will become hot the pulse full and the patient feverish altogether if the surgeon has not arrived by the time these symptoms have set in shave the patients head and apply the following lotion no 2 mix half an ounce of salammoniac two tablespoonfuls of vinegar and the same quantity of gin or whisky in half a pint of water then give this pill no 1 mix five grains of calomel and the same quantity of antimonial powder with a little breadcrumb and make into two pills give a black draught three hours after the pill and two tablespoonfuls of the abovementioned fevermixture every four hours keep on low diet leeches are sometimes to be applied to the head these cases are often followed by violent inflammation of the brain they can therefore only be attended to properly throughout by a surgeon the great thing for people to do in these cases isnothing contenting themselves with putting the patient to bed and waiting the arrival of a surgeon 2624 the cholera and autumnal complaintsto oppose cholera there seems no surer or better means than cleanliness sobriety and judicious ventilation where there is dirt that is the place for cholera where windows and doors are kept most jealously shut there cholera will find easiest entrance and people who indulge in intemperate diet during the hot days of autumn are actually courting death to repeat it cleanliness sobriety and free ventilation almost always defy the pestilence but in case of attack immediate recourse should be had to a physician the faculty say that a large number of lives have been lost in many seasons solely from delay in seeking medical assistance they even assert that taken early the cholera is by no means a fatal disorder the copious use of salt is recommended on very excellent authority other autumnal complaints there are of which diarrhoea is the worst example they come on with pain flatulence sickness with or without vomiting followed by loss of appetite general lassitude and weakness if attended to at the first appearance they may soon be conquered for which purpose it is necessary to assist nature in throwing off the contents of the bowels which may be one by means of the following prescriptiontake of calomel 3 grains rhubarb 8 grains mix and take it in a little honey or jelly and repeat the dose three times at the intervals of four or five hours the next purpose to be answered is the defence of the lining membrane of the intestines from their acrid contents which will be best effected by drinking copiously of linseed tea or of a drink made by pouring boiling water on quinceseeds which are of a very mucilaginous nature or what is still better full draughts of whey if the complaint continue after these means have been employed some astringent or binding medicine will be required as the subjoinedtake of prepared chalk 2 drachms cinnamonwater 7 oz syrup of poppies 1 oz mix and take 3 tablespoonfuls every four hours should this fail to complete the cure 12 oz of tincture of catechu or of kino may be added to it and then it will seldom fail or a teaspoonful of the tincture of kino alone with a little water every three hours till the diarrhoea is checked while any symptoms of derangement are present particular attention must be paid to the diet which should be of a soothing lubricating and light nature as instanced in veal or chicken broth which should contain but little salt rice batter and bread puddings will be generally relished and be eaten with advantage but the stomach is too much impaired to digest food of a more solid nature indeed we should give that organ together with the bowels as little trouble as possible while they are so incapable of acting in their accustomed manner much mischief is frequently produced by the absurd practice of taking tincture of rhubarb which is almost certain of aggravating that species of disorder of which we have now treated for it is a spirit as strong as brandy and cannot fail of producing harm upon a surface which is rendered tender by the formation and contact of vitiated bile but our last advice is upon the first appearance of such symptoms as are above detailed have immediate recourse to a doctor where possible 2625 to cure a coldput a large teacupful of linseed with 14 lb of sun raisins and 2 oz of stick liquorice into 2 quarts of soft water and let it simmer over a slow fire till reduced to one quart add to it 14 lb of pounded sugarcandy a tablespoonful of old rum and a tablespoonful of the best whitewine vinegar or lemonjuice the rum and vinegar should be added as the decoction is taken for if they are put in at first the whole soon becomes flat and less efficacious the dose is half a pint made warm on going to bed and a little may be taken whenever the cough is troublesome the worst cold is generally cured by this remedy in two or three days and if taken in time is considered infallible 2626 cold on the chesta flannel dipped in boiling water and sprinkled with turpentine laid on the chest as quickly as possible will relieve the most severe cold or hoarseness 2627 substances in the eyeto remove fine particles of gravel lime c the eye should be syringed with lukewarm water till free from them be particular not to worry the eye under the impression that the substance is still there which the enlargement of some of the minute vessels makes the patient believe is actually the case 2628 sore eyesincorporate thoroughly in a glass mortar or vessel one part of strong citron ointment with three parts of spermaceti ointment use the mixture night and morning by placing a piece of the size of a pea in the corner of the eye affected only to be used in cases of chronic or longstanding inflammation of the organ or its lids 2629 lime in the eyebathe the eye with a little weak vinegarandwater and carefully remove any little piece of lime which may be seen with a feather if any lime has got entangled in the eyelashes carefully clear it away with a bit of soft linen soaked in vinegarandwater violent inflammation is sure to follow a smart purge must be therefore administered and in all probability a blister must be applied on the temple behind the ear or nape of the neck 2630 stye in the eyestyes are little abscesses which form between the roots of the eyelashes and are rarely larger than a small pea the best way to manage them is to bathe them frequently with warm water or in warm poppywater if very painful when they have burst use an ointment composed of one part of citron ointment and four of spermaceti well rubbed together and smear along the edge of the eyelid give a grain or two of calomel with 5 or 8 grains of rhubarb according to the age of the child twice a week the oldfashioned and apparently absurd practice of rubbing the stye with a ring is as good and speedy a cure as that by any process of medicinal application though the number of times it is rubbed or the quality of the ring and direction of the strokes has nothing to do with its success the pressure and the friction excite the vessels of the part and cause an absorption of the effused matter under the eyelash the edge of the nail will answer as well as a ring 2631 inflammation of the eyelidsthe following ointment has been found very beneficial in inflammations of the eyeball and edges of the eyelidstake of prepared calomel 1 scruple spermaceti ointment 12 oz mix them well together in a glass mortar apply a small quantity to each corner of the eye every night and morning and also to the edges of the lids if they are affected if this should not eventually remove the inflammation elderflower water may be applied three or four times a day by means of an eyecup the bowels should be kept in a laxative state by taking occasionally a quarter of an ounce of the cheltenham or epsom salts 2632 fastingit is said by many able physicians that fasting is a means of removing incipient disease and of restoring the body to its customary healthy sensations howard the celebrated philanthropist says a writer used to fast one day in every week napoleon when he felt his system unstrung suspended his wonted repast and took his exercise on horseback fits 2633 fits come on so suddenly often without even the slightest warning and may prove fatal so quickly that all people should be acquainted at least with their leading symptoms and treatment as a few moments more or less will often decide the question between life and death the treatment in very many cases at least to be of the slightest use should be immediate as a person in a fit of apoplexy for instance may die while a surgeon is being fetched from only the next street we shall give as far as the fact of our editing a work for nonprofessional readers will permit the peculiar and distinctive symptoms of all kind of fits and the immediate treatment to be adopted in each case 2634 apoplexythese fits may be divided into two kindsthe strong and the weak 2635 1 the strong kindthese cases mostly occur in stout strong shortnecked bloatedfaced people who are in the habit of living wellsymptoms the patient may or may not have had headache sparks before his eyes with confusion of ideas and giddiness for a day or two before the attack when it takes place he falls down insensible the body becomes paralyzed generally more so on one side than the other the face and head are hot and the bloodvessels about them swollen the pupils of the eyes are larger than natural and the eyes themselves are fixed the mouth is mostly drawn down at one corner the breathing is like loud snoring the pulse full and hardtreatment place the patient immediately in bed with his head well raised take off everything that he has round his neck and bleed freely and at once from the arm if you have not got a lancet use a penknife or anything suitable that may be at hand apply warm mustard poultices to the soles of the feet and the insides of the thighs and legs put two drops of castor oil mixed up with eight grains of calomel on the top of the tongue as far back as possible a most important part of the treatment being to open the bowels as quickly and freely as possible the patient cannot swallow but these medicines especially the oil will be absorbed into the stomach altogether independent of any voluntary action if possible throw up a warm turpentine clyster two tablespoonfuls of oil of turpentine in a pint of warm gruel or if this cannot be obtained one composed of about a quart of warm saltandwater and soap cut off the hair and apply rags dipped in weak vinegarandwater or weak ginandwater or even simple cold water to the head if the bloodvessels about the head and neck are much swollen put from eight to ten leeches on the temple opposite to the paralyzed side of the body always send for a surgeon immediately and act according to the above rules doing more or less according to the means at hand and the length of time that must necessarily elapse until he arrives a pint or even a quart of blood in a very strong person may be taken away when the patient is able to swallow give him the no 1 pills and the no 1 mixture directly the no 1 pills are made as followsmix 5 grains of calomel and the same quantity of antimonial powder with a little breadcrumb make into two pills the dose for a fullgrown person for the no 1 mixture dissolve on ounce of epsom salts in half a pint of senna tea take a quarter of the mixture as a dose repeat these remedies if the bowels are not well opened keep the patients head well raised and cool as above give very low diet indeed gruel arrowroot and the like when a person is recovering he should have blisters applied to the nape of the neck his bowels should be kept well open light diet given and fatigue worry and excess of all kinds avoided 2636 2 the weak kindsymptoms these attacks are more frequently preceded by warning symptoms than the first kind the face is pale the pulse weak and the body especially the hands and legs cold after a little while these symptoms sometimes alter to those of the first class in a mild degreetreatment at first if the pulse is very feeble indeed a little brandyandwater or salvolatile must be given mustard poultices are to be put as before to the soles of the foot and the insides of the thighs and legs warm bricks or bottles filled with warm water are also to be placed under the armpits when the strength has returned the body become warmer and the pulse fuller and harder the head should be shaved and wet rags applied to it as before described leeches should be put as before to the temple opposite the side paralyzed and the bowels should be opened as freely and as quickly as possible bleeding from the arm is often necessary in these cases but a nonprofessional person should never have recourse to it blisters may be applied to the nape of the neck at once the diet in those cases should not be so low as in the formerindeed it is often necessary in a day or so after one of these attacks to give wine strong beeftea c according to the condition of the patients strength 2637 distinctions between apoplexy and epilepsy1 apoplexy mostly happens in people over thirty whereas epilepsy generally occurs under that ago at any rate for the first time a person who has epileptic fits over thirty has generally suffered from them for some years 2 again in apoplexy the body is paralyzed and therefore has not the convulsions which take place in epilepsy 3 the peculiar snoring will also distinguish apoplexy from epilepsy 2638 distinctions between apoplexy and drunkeness1 the known habits of the person 2 the fact of a person who was perfectly sober and sensible a little time before being found in a state of insensibility 3 the absence in apoplexy of the smell of drink on applying the nose to the mouth 4 a person in a fit of apoplexy cannot be roused at all in drunkenness he mostly can to a certain extent 2639 distinction between apoplexy and hysteriahysterics mostly happen in young nervous unmarried women and are attended with convulsions sobbing laughter throwing about of the body c c 2640 distinction between apoplexy and poisoning by opiumit is exceedingly difficult to distinguish between these two cases in poisoning by opium however we find the particular smell of the drug in the patients breath we should also in forming our opinion take into consideration the persons previous conductwhether he has been low and desponding for some time before or has ever talked about committing suicide 2641 epilepsyfalling sicknessthose fits mostly happen at any rate for the first time to young people and are more common in boys than girls they are produced by numerous causessymptoms the fit may be preceded by pains in the head palpitations c c but it mostly happens that the person falls down insensible suddenly and without any warning whatever the eyes are distorted so that only their whites can be seen there is mostly foaming from the mouth the fingers are clinched and the body especially on one side is much agitated the tongue is often thrust out of the mouth when the fit goes off the patient feels drowsy and faint and often sleeps soundly for some timetreatment during the fit keep the patient flat on his back with his head slightly raised and prevent him from doing any harm to himself dash cold water into his face and apply smellingsalts to his nose loosen his shirt collar c hold a piece of wood about as thick as a fingerthe handle of a toothbrush or knife will do as wellbetween the two rows of teeth at the back part of the mouth this will prevent the tongue from being injured a teaspoonful of common salt thrust into the patients mouth during the fit is of much service the aftertreatment of these fits is various and depends entirely upon their causes a good general rule however is always to keep the bowels well open and the patient quiet and free from fatigue worry and excess of all kinds 2642 fainting fits are sometimes very dangerous and at others perfectly harmless the question of danger depending altogether upon the causes which have produced them and which are exceedingly various for instance fainting produced by disease of the heart is a very serious symptom indeed whereas that arising from some slight cause such as the sight of blood c need cause no alarm whatever the symptoms of simple fainting are so well known that it would be quite superfluous to enumerate them here the treatment consists in laying the patient at full length upon his back with his head upon a level with the rest of his body loosening everything about the neck dashing cold water into the face and sprinkling vinegar and water about the mouth applying smellingsalts to the nose and when the patient is able to swallow in giving a little warm brandyandwater or about 20 drops of salvolatile in water 2643 hystericsthese fits take place for the most part in young nervous unmarried women they happen much less often in married women and even in some rare cases indeed in men young women who are subject to these fits are apt to think that they are suffering from all the ills that flesh is heir to and the false symptoms of disease which they show are so like the true ones that it is often exceedingly difficult to detect the difference the fits themselves are mostly preceded by great depression of spirits shedding of tears sickness palpitation of the heart c a pain as if a nail were being driven in is also often felt at one particular part of the head in almost all cases when a fit is coming on pain is felt on the left side this pain rises gradually until it reaches the throat and then gives the patient a sensation as if she had a pellet there which prevents her from breathing properly and in fact seems to threaten actual suffocation the patient now generally becomes insensible and faints the body is thrown about in all directions froth issues from the mouth incoherent expressions are uttered and fits of laughter crying or screaming take place when the fit is going off the patient mostly cries bitterly sometimes knowing all and at others nothing of what has taken place and feeling general soreness all over the body treatment during the fit place the body in the same position as for simple fainting and treat in other respects as directed in the article on epilepsy always well loosen the patients stays and when she is recovering and able to swallow give 20 drops of sal volatile in a little water the aftertreatment of these cases is very various if the patient is of a strong constitution she should live on plain diet take plenty of exercise and take occasional doses of castor oil or an aperient mixture such as that described as no 1 in previous numbers if as is mostly the case the patient is weak and delicate she will require a different mode of treatment altogether good nourishing diet gentle exercise cold baths occasionally a dose of no 3 myrrh and aloes pills at night and a dose of compound iron pills twice a day as to the myrrh and aloes pills no 3 10 grains made into two pills are a dose for a fullgrown person of the compound iron pills no 4 the dose for a full grown person is also 10 grains made into two pills in every case amusing the mind and avoiding all causes of overexcitement are of great service in bringing about a permanent cure 2644 liver complaint and spasmsa very obliging correspondent recommends the following from personal experiencetake 4 oz of dried dandelion root 1 oz of the best ginger 14 oz of columba root braise and boil all together in 3 pints of water till it is reduced to a quart strain and take a wineglassful every four hours our correspondent says it is a safe and simple medicine for both liver complaint and spasms 2645 lumbagoa new and successful mode of treating lumbago advocated by dr day is a form of counterirritation said to have been introduced into this country by the late sir anthony carlisle and which consists in the instantaneous application of a flat iron button gently heated in a spiritlamp to the skin dr corrigan published about three years ago an account of some cases very successfully treated by nearly similar means dr corrigans plan was however to touch the surface of the part affected at intervals of half an inch as lightly and rapidly as possible dr day has found greater advantages to result from drawing the flat surface of the heated button lightly over the affected part so as to act on a greater extent of surface the doctor speaks so enthusiastically of the benefit to be derived from this practice that it is evidently highly deserving attention 2646 palpitation of the heartwhere palpitation occurs as symptomatic of indigestion the treatment must be directed to remedy that disorder when it is consequent on a plethoric state purgatives will be effectual in this case the patient should abstain from every kind of diet likely to produce a plethoric condition of body animal food and fermented liquor must be particularly avoided too much indulgence in sleep will also prove injurious when the attacks arise from nervous irritability the excitement must be allayed by change of air and a tonic diet should the palpitation originate from organic derangement it must be of course beyond domestic management luxurious living indolence and tightlacing often produce this affection such cases are to be conquered with a little resolution 2647 poisons shall be the next subject for remark and we anticipate more detailed instructions for the treatment of persons poisoned by giving a simple list of the principal poisons with their antidotes or remedies oil of vitriol aquafortis magnesia chalk soapandwater spirit of salt emetic tartar oily drinks solution of oakbark salt of lemons or chalk whiting lime or magnesia and acid of sugar water sometimes an emetic draught pump on back smellingsalts to nose prussic acid artificial breathing chloride of lime to nose pearlash soaplees smellingsalts nitre lemonjuice and vinegarandwater hartshorn salvolatile arsenic flypowder or emetics limewater soapandwater white arsenic sugar and water oily drinks kings yellow or yellow arsenic mercury corrosive sublimate whites of eggs soapandwater calomel opium emetic draught vinegarandwater laudanum dashing cold water on chest and face walking up and down two or three hours lead white lead epsom salts castor oil emetics sugar of lead goulards extract copper bluestone whites of eggs sugarandwater verdigris castor oil gruel zinc limewater chalkandwater soapandwater iron magnesia warm water henbane hemlock emetics and castor oil nightshade brandyandwater if necessary foxglove poisonous food emetics and castor oil 2648 the symptoms of poisoning may be known for the most part from those of some diseases which they are very like from the fact of their coming on immediately after eating or drinking something whereas those of disease come on in most cases at least by degrees and with warnings in most cases where poison is known or suspected to have been taken the first thing to be done is to empty the stomach well and immediately by means of mustard mixed in warm water or plain warm saltandwater or better this draught which we call no 1twenty grains of sulphate of zinc in an ounce and a half of water this draught to be repeated in a quarter of an hour if vomiting does not ensue the back part of the throat should be well tickled with a feather or two of the fingers thrust down it to induce vomiting the cases where vomiting must not be used are those where the skin has been taken off and the parts touched irritated and inflamed by the poison taken and where the action of vomiting would increase the evil full instructions are given in the article on each particular poison as to where emetics are or are not to be given the best and safest way of emptying the stomach is by means of the stomachpump as in certain cases the action of vomiting is likely to increase the danger arising from the swollen and congested condition of the bloodvessels of the head which often takes place in the hands however of any one else than a surgeon it would be not only useless but harmful as a great deal of dexterity caution and experience are required to use it properly after having made these brief introductory remarks we shall now proceed to particulars 2649 sulphuric acid or oil of vitriol a clear colourless liquid of an oily appearancesymptoms in those who have swallowed it when much is taken these come on immediately there is great burning pain extending from the mouth to the stomach vomiting of a liquid of a dark coffeecolour often mixed with shreds of flesh and streaks of blood the skin inside the mouth is taken off and the exposed surface is at first white and after a time becomes brownish there are sometimes spots of a brown colour round the lips and on the neck caused by drops of the acid falling on these parts there is great difficulty of breathing owing to the swelling at the back part of the mouth after a time there is much depression of strength with a quick weak pulse and cold clammy skin the face is pale and has a very anxious look when the acid swallowed has been greatly diluted in water the same kind of symptoms occur only in a milder degreetreatment give a mixture of magnesia in milkandwater or if this cannot be obtained of finely powdered chalk or whiting or even of the plaster torn down from the walls or ceiling in milkandwater the mixture should be nearly as thick as cream and plenty of it given as well as this simple gruel milk or thick flourandwater are very useful and should be given in large quantities violent inflammation of the parts touched by the acid is most likely to take place in the coarse of a little time and can only be properly attended to by a surgeon but if one cannot be obtained leeches the fevermixtures the recipe for which appears repeatedly in previous paragraphs thick drinks such as barleywater gruel arrowroot c must be had recourse to according to the symptoms of each particular case and the means at hand the inflamed condition of the back part of the mouth requires particular attention when the breathing is very laboured and difficult in consequence from fifteen to twenty leeches are to be immediately applied to the outside of the throat and when they drop off warm poppy fomentations constantly kept to the part when the pain over the stomach is very great the same local treatment is necessary but if it is only slight a good mustard poultice will be sufficient without the leeches in all these cases two tablespoonfuls of the fevermixture should be given every four hours and only gruel or arrowroot allowed to be eaten for some days 2650 nitric acid commonly known as aqua fortis or red spirit of nitre a strawcoloured fluid of the consistence of water and which gives off dense white fumes on exposure to the airsymptoms produced in those who have swallowed it much the same as in the case of sulphuric acid in this case however the surface touched by the acid becomes yellowish the tongue is mostly much swollentreatment the same as for sulphuric acid 2651 muriatic acid spirit of salt a thin yellow fluid emitting dense white fumes on exposure to the airthis is not often taken as a poison the symptoms and treatment are much the same as those of nitric acid nbin no case of poisoning by these three acids should emetics ever be given 2652 oxalic acid commonly called salt of lemonsthis poison may be taken by mistake for epsom salts which it is a good deal like it may be distinguished from them by its very acid taste and its shape which is that of needleformed crystals each of which if put into a drop of ink will turn it to a reddish brown whereas epsom salts will not change its colour at all when a large dose of this poison has been taken death takes place very quickly indeedsymptoms produced in those who have swallowed it a hot burning acid taste is felt in the act of swallowing and vomiting of a greenishbrown fluid is produced sooner or later according to the quantity and strength of the poison taken there is great tenderness felt over the stomach followed by clammy perspirations and convulsions the legs are often drawn up and there is generally stupor from which the patient however can easily be roused and always great prostration of strength the pulse is small and weak and the breathing fainttreatment chalk or magnesia made into a cream with water should be given in large quantities and afterwards the emetic draught above prescribed or some mustardandwater if the draught cannot be got the back part of the throat to be tickled with a feather to induce vomiting arrowroot gruel and the like drinks are to be taken when the prostration of strength is very great and the body cold warmth is to be applied to it and a little brandyandwater or salvolatile and water given 2653 prussic acid a thin transparent and colourless liquid with a peculiar smell which greatly resembles that of bitter almondssymptoms produced in those who have swallowed it these come on immediately after the poison has been taken and may be produced by merely smelling it the patient becomes perfectly insensible and falls down in convulsionshis eyes are fixed and staring the pupils being bigger than natural the skin is cold and clammy the pulse scarcely perceptible and the breathing slow and gaspingtreatment very little can be done in these cases as death takes place so quickly after the poison has been swallowed when it takes place at all the best treatmentwhich should always be adopted in all cases even though the patient appears quite deadis to dash quantities of cold water on the back from the top of the neck downwards placing the patient under a pump and pumping on him is the best way of doing this smellingsalts are also to be applied to the nose and the chest well rubbed with a camphor liniment 2654 alkalis potash soda and ammonia or common smellingsalts with their principal preparationspearlash soap lees liquor potassae nitre sal prunella hartshorn and salvolatilealkalis are seldom taken or given with the view of destroying life they may however be swallowed by mistakesymptoms produced in those who have swallowed them there is at first a burning acrid taste in and a sensation of tightness round the throat like that of strangling the skin touched is destroyed retching mostly followed by actual vomiting then sets in the vomited matters often containing blood of a dark brown colour with little shreds of flesh here and there and always changing vegetable blue colours green there is now great tenderness over the whole of the belly after a little while great weakness with cold clammy sweats a quick weak pulse and purging of bloody matters takes place the brain too mostly becomes affectedtreatment give two tablespoonfuls of vinegar or lemonjuice in a glassful of water every few minutes until the burning sensation is relieved any kind of oil or milk may also be given and will form soap when mixed with the poison in the stomach barleywater gruel arrowroot linseedtea c are also very useful and should be taken constantly and in large quantities if inflammation should take place it is to be treated by applying leeches and warm poppy fomentations to the part where the pain is most felt and giving two tablespoonfuls of the fever mixture every four hours the diet in all these cases should only consist of arrowroot or gruel for the first few days and then of weak broth or beeftea for some time after 2655 when very strong fumes of smellingsalts have in any way been inhaled there is great difficulty of breathing and alarming pain in the mouth and nostrils in this case let the patient inhale the steam of warm vinegar and treat the feverish symptoms as before 2656 arsenicmostly seen under the form of white arsenic or flypowder and yellow arsenic or kings yellowsymptoms produced in those who have swallowed it these vary very much according to the form and dose in which the poison has been taken there is faintness depression and sickness with an intense burning pain in the region of the stomach which gets worse and worse and is increased by pressure there is also vomiting of dark brown matter sometimes mixed with blood and mostly great thirst with a feeling of tightness round and of burning in the throat purging also takes place the matters brought away being mixed with blood the pulse is small and irregular and the skin sometimes cold and clammy and at others hot the breathing is painful convulsions and spasms often occurtreatment give a couple of teaspoonfuls of mustard in a glass of water to bring on or assist vomiting and also use the other means elsewhere recommended for the purpose a solution half of limewater and half of linseedoil well mixed may be given as well as plenty of arrowroot gruel or linseedtea simple milk is also useful a little castoroil should be given to cleanse the intestines of all the poison and the aftersymptoms treated on general principles 2657 corrosive sublimatemostly seen in the form of little heavy crystalline masses which melt in water and have a metallic taste it is sometimes seen in powder this is a most powerful poisonsymptoms these mostly come on immediately after the poison has been taken there is a coppery taste experienced in the act of swallowing with a burning heat extending from the top of the throat down to the stomach and also a feeling of great tightness round the throat in a few minutes great pain is felt over the region of the stomach and frequent vomiting of long stringy white masses mixed with blood takes place there is also mostly great purging the countenance is generally pale and anxious the pulse always small and frequent the skin cold and clammy and the breathing difficult convulsions and insensibility often occur and are very bad symptoms indeed the inside of the mouth is more or less swollentreatment mix the whites of a dozen eggs in two pints of cold water and give a glassful of the mixture every three or four minutes until the stomach can contain no more if vomiting does not now come on naturally and supposing the mouth is not very sore or much swollen an emetic draught no 1 may be given and vomiting induced the no 1 draught we remind our readers is thus madetwenty grains of sulphate of zinc in an ounce and a half of water the draught to be repeated if vomiting does not take place in a quarter of an hour after the stomach has been well cleaned out milk flourandwater linseedtea or barleywater should be taken in large quantities if eggs cannot be obtained milk or flourandwater should be given as a substitute for them at once when the depression of strength is very great indeed a little warm brandyandwater must be given in the course of an hour or two the patient should take two tablespoonfuls of castoroil and if inflammation comes on it is to be treated as directed in the article on acids and alkalis the diet should also be the same if the patient recovers great soreness of the gums is almost certain to take place the simplest and at the same time one of the best modes of treatment is to wash them well three or four times a day with brandyandwater 2658 calomela heavy white powder without taste and insoluble in water it has been occasionally known to destroy lifesymptoms much the same as in the case of corrosive sublimatetreatment the same as for corrosive sublimate if the gums are sore wash them as recommended in the case of corrosive sublimate with brandyandwater three or four times a day and keep the patient on fluids such as arrowroot gruel broth or beeftea according to the other symptoms eating hard substances would make the gums more sore and tender 2659 copperthe preparations of this metal which are most likely to be the ones producing poisonous symptoms are bluestone and verdigris people are often taken ill after eating food that has been cooked in copper saucepans when anything has been cooked in one of these vessels it should never be allowed to cool in itsymptoms headache pain in the stomach and purging vomiting of green or blue matters convulsions and spasmstreatment give whites of eggs sugarandwater castoroil and drinks such as arrowroot and gruel 2660 emetic tartarseen in the form of a white powder or crystals with a slightly metallic taste it has not often been known to destroy lifesymptoms a strong metallic taste in the act of swallowing followed by a burning pain in the region of the stomach vomiting and great purging the pulse is small and rapid the skin cold and clammy the breathing difficult and painful and the limbs often much cramped there is also great prostration of strengthtreatment promote the vomiting by giving plenty of warm water or warm arrowroot and water strong tea in large quantities should be drunk or if it can be obtained a decoction of oak bark the aftertreatment is the same as that for acids and alkalis the principal object in all these cases being to keep down the inflammation of the parts touched by the poison by means of leeches warm poppy fomentations fevermixtures and very low diet 2661 lead and its preparations sugar of lead goulards extract white leadlead is by no means an active poison although it is popularly considered to be so it mostly affects people by being taken into the system slowly as in the case of painters and glaziers a newlypainted house too often affects those living in itsymptoms produced when taken in a large dose there is at first a burning pricking sensation in the throat to which thirst giddiness and vomiting follow the belly is tight swollen and painful the pain being relieved by pressure the bowels are mostly bound there is great depression of strength and a cold skintreatment give an emetic draught no 1 see above at once and shortly afterwards a solution of epsom salts in large quantities a little brandyandwater must be taken if the depression of strength is very great indeed milk whites of eggs and arrowroot are also useful after two or three hours cleanse the stomach and intestines well out with two tablespoonfuls of castoroil and treat the symptoms which follow according to the rules laid down in other parts of these articlessymptoms when it is taken into the body slowly headache pain about the navel loss of appetite and flesh offensive breath a blueness of the edges of the gums the belly is tight hard and knotty and the pulse slow and languid there is also sometimes a difficulty in swallowingtreatment give five grains of calomel and half a grain of opium directly in the form of a pill and half an ounce of epsom salts in two hours and repeat this treatment until the bowels are well opened put the patient into a warm bath and throw up a clyster of warmish water when he is in it fomentations of warm oil of turpentine if they can be obtained should be put over the whole of the belly the great object is to open the bowels as freely and as quickly as possible when this has been done a grain of pure opium may be given arrowroot or gruel should be taken in good large quantities the aftertreatment must depend altogether upon the symptoms of each particular case 2662 opium and its preparations laudanum csolid opium is mostly seen in the form of rich brown flattish cakes with little pieces of leaves sticking on them here and there and a bitter and slightly warm taste the most common form in which it is taken as a poison is that of laudanumsymptoms these consist at first in giddiness and stupor followed by insensibility the patient however being roused to consciousness by a great noise so as to be able to answer a question but becoming insensible again almost immediately the pulse is now quick and small the breathing hurried and the skin warm and covered with perspiration after a little time these symptoms change the person becomes perfectly insensible the breathing slow and snoring as in apoplexy the skin cold and the pulse slow and full the pupil of the eye is mostly smaller than natural on applying his nose to the patients mouth a person may smell the poison very distinctlytreatment give an emetic draught no 1 see above directly with large quantities of warm mustardandwater warm saltandwater or simple warm water tickle the top of the throat with a feather or put two fingers down it to bring on vomiting which rarely takes place of itself dash cold water on the head chest and spine and flap these parts well with the ends of wet towels give strong coffee or tea walk the patient up and down in the open air for two or three hours the great thing being to keep him from sleeping electricity is of much service when the patient is recovering mustard poultices should be applied to the soles of the feet and the insides of the thighs and legs the head should be kept cool and raised 2663 the following preparations which are constantly given to children by their nurses and mothers for the purpose of making them sleep often prove fatalsyrup of poppies and godfreys cordial the author would most earnestly urge all people caring for their childrens lives never to allow any of these preparations to be given unless ordered by a surgeon 2664 the treatment in the case of poisoning by henbane hemlock nightshade and foxglove is much the same as that for opium vomiting should be brought on in all of them 2665 poisonous foodit sometimes happens that things which are in daily use and mostly perfectly harmless give rise under certain unknown circumstances and in certain individuals to the symptoms of poisoning the most common articles of food of this description are mussels salmon and certain kinds of cheese and bacon the general symptoms are thirst weight about the stomach difficulty of breathing vomiting purging spasms prostration of strength and in the case of mussels more particularly an eruption on the body like that of nettlerashtreatment empty the stomach well with no 1 draught and warm water and give two tablespoonfuls of castoroil immediately after let the patient take plenty of arrowroot gruel and the like drinks and if there is much depression of strength give a little warm brandyandwater should symptoms of fever or inflammation follow they must be treated as directed in the articles on other kinds of poisoning 2666 mushrooms and similar kinds of vegetables often produce poisonous effects the symptoms are various sometimes giddiness and stupor and at others pain in and swelling of the belly with vomiting and purging being the leading ones when the symptoms come on quickly after taking the poison it is generally the head that is affectedthe treatment consists in bringing on vomiting in the usual manner as quickly and as freely as possible the other symptoms are to be treated on general principles if they are those of depression by brandyandwater or salvolatile if those of inflammation by leeches fomentations fevermixtures c c 2667 for cure of ringwormtake of subcarbonate of soda 1 drachm which dissolve in 12 pint of vinegar wash the head every morning with soft soap and apply the lotion night and morning one teaspoonful of sulphur and treacle should also be given occasionally night and morning the hair should be cut close and round the spot it should be shaved off and the part night and morning bathed with a lotion made by dissolving a drachm of white vitriol in 8 oz of water a small piece of either of the two subjoined ointments rubbed into the part when the lotion has dried in no 1take of citron ointment 1 drachm sulphur and tar ointment of each 12 oz mix thoroughly and apply twice a day no 2take of simple cerate 1 oz creosote 1 drachm calomel 30 grains mix and use in the same manner as the first concurrent with these external remedies the child should take an alterative powder every morning or if they act too much on the bowels only every second day the following will be found to answer all the intentions desired 2668 alterative powders for ringwormtake of sulphuret of antimony precipitated 24 grains grey powder 12 grains calomel 6 grains jalap powder 36 grains mix carefully and divide into 12 powders for a child from 1 to 2 years old into 9 powders for a child from 2 to 4 years and into 6 powders for a child from 4 to 6 years where the patient is older the strength may be increased by enlarging the quantities of the drugs ordered or by giving one and a half or two powders for one dose the ointment is to be well washed off every morning with soapandwater and the part bathed with the lotion before reapplying the ointment an imperative fact must be remembered by mother or nursenever to use the same comb employed for the child with ringworm for the healthy children or let the affected little one sleep with those free from the disease and for fear of any contact by hands or otherwise to keep the childs head enveloped in a nightcap till this eruption is completely cured 2669 scratchestrifling as scratches often seem they ought never to be neglected but should be covered and protected and kept clean and dry until they have completely healed if there is the least appearance of inflammation no time should be lost in applying a large breadandwater poultice or hot flannels repeatedly applied or even leeches in good numbers may be put on at some distance from each other 2670 for shortness of breath or difficult breathingvitriolated spirits of ether 1 oz camphor 12 grains make a solution of which take a teaspoonful during the paroxysm this is found to afford instantaneous relief in difficulty of breathing depending on internal diseases and other causes where the patient from a very quick and laborious breathing is obliged to be in an erect posture 2671 sprainsa sprain is a stretching of the leaders or ligaments of a part through some violence such as slipping falling on the hands pulling a limb c c the most common are those of the ankle and wrist these accidents are more serious than people generally suppose and often more difficult to cure than a broken log or arm the first thing to be done is to place the sprained part in the straight position and to raise it a little as well some recommend the application of cold lotions at first the editress however is quite convinced that warm applications are in most cases the best for for the first three or four days these fomentations are to be applied in the following mannerdip a goodsized piece of flannel into a pail or basin full of hot water or hot poppy fomentationsix poppy heads boiled in one quart of water for about a quarter of an hour wring it almost dry and apply it as hot as the patient can bear right round the sprained part then place another piece of flannel quite dry over it in order that the steam and warmth may not escape this process should be repeated as often as the patient feels that the flannel next to his skin is getting coldthe oftener the better the bowels should be opened with a black draught and the patient kept on low diet if he has been a great drinker he may be allowed to take a little beer but it is better not to do so a little of the cream of tartar drink ordered in the case of burns may be taken occasionally if there is much thirst when the swelling and tenderness about the joint are very great from eight to twelve leeches may be applied when the knee is the joint affected the greatest pain is felt at the inside and therefore the greater quantity of the leeches should be applied to that part when the shoulder is sprained the arm should be kept close to the body by means of a linen roller which is to be taken four or five times round the whole of the chest it should also be brought two or three times underneath the elbow in order to raise the shoulder this is the best treatment for these accidents during the first three or four days after that time supposing that no unfavourable symptoms have taken place a cold lotion composed of a tablespoonful of salammoniac to a quart of water or vinegarandwater should be constantly applied this lotion will strengthen the part and also help in taking away any thickening that may have formed about the joint in the course of two or three weeks according to circumstances the joint is to be rubbed twice a day with flannel dipped in opodeldoc a flannel bandage rolled tightly round the joint the pressure being greatest at the lowest part and the patient allowed to walk about with the assistance of a crutch or stick he should also occasionally when sitting or lying down quietly bend the joint backwards and forwards to cause its natural motion to return and to prevent stiffness from taking place when the swelling is very great immediately after the accident has occurred from the breaking of the bloodvessels it is best to apply cold applications at first if it can be procured oilsilk may be put over the warmfomentation flannel instead of the dry piece of flannel old flannel is better than new 2672 cure for stammeringwhere there is no malformation of the organs of articulation stammering may be remedied by reading aloud with the teeth closed this should be practised for two hours a day for three or four months the advocate of this simple remedy says i can speak with certainty of its utility 2673 stammeringat a recent meeting of the boston society of natural history dr warren stated a simple easy and effectual cure of stammering it is simply at every syllable pronounced to tap at the same time with the finger by so doing the most inveterate stammerer will be surprised to find that he can pronounce quite fluently and by long and constant practice he will pronounce perfectly well 2674 suffocation apparentsuffocation may arise from many different causes anything which prevents the air getting into the lungs will produce it we shall give the principal causes and the treatment to be followed in each case 2675 1 carbonic acid gas chokedamp of minesthis poisonous gas is met with in rooms where charcoal is burnt and where there is not sufficient draught to allow it to escape in coalpits near limekilns in breweries and in rooms and houses where a great many people live huddled together in wretchedness and filth and where the air in consequence becomes poisoned this gas gives out no smell so that we cannot know of its presence a candle will not burn in a room which contains much of iteffects at first there is giddiness and a great wish to sleep after a little time or where there is much of it present a person feels great weight in the head and stupid gets by degrees quite unable to move and snores as if in a deep sleep the limbs may or may not be stiff the heat of the body remains much the same at firsttreatment remove the person affected into the open air and even though it is cold weather take off his clothes then lay him on his back with his head slightly raised having done this dash vinegarandwater over the whole of the body and rub it hard especially the face and chest with towels dipped in the same mixture the hands and feet also should be rubbed with a hard brush apply smellingsalts to the nose which may be tickled with a feather dashing cold water down the middle of the back is of great service if the person can swallow give him a little lemonwater or vinegarandwater to drink the principal means however to be employed in this as in fact in most cases of apparent suffocation is what is called artificial breathing this operation should be performed by three persons and in the following mannerthe first person should put the nozzle of a common pair of bellows into one of the patients nostrils the second should push down and then thrust back that part of the throat called adams apple and the third should first raise and then depress the chest one hand being placed over each side of the ribs these three actions should be performed in the following orderfirst of all the throat should be drawn down and thrust back then the chest should be raised and the bellows gently blown into the nostril directly this is done the chest should be depressed so as to imitate common breathing this process should be repeated about eighteen times a minute the mouth and the other nostril should be closed while the bellows are being blown persevere if necessary with this treatment for seven or eight hoursin fact till absolute signs of death are visible many lives are lost by giving it up too quickly when the patient becomes roused he is to be put into a warm bed and a little brandyandwater or twenty drops of salvolatile given cautiously now and then this treatment is to be adopted in all cases where people are affected from breathing bad air smells c c 2676 2 drowningthis is one of the most frequent causes of death by suffocationtreatment many methods have been adopted and as some of them are not only useless but hurtful we will mention them here merely in order that they may be avoided in the first place then never hang a person up by his heels as it is an error to suppose that water gets into the lungs hanging a person up by his heels would be quite as bad as hanging him up by his neck it is also a mistake to suppose that rubbing the body with salt and water is of serviceproper treatment directly a person has been taken out of the water he should be wiped dry and wrapped in blankets but if these cannot be obtained the clothes of the bystanders must be used for the purpose his head being slightly raised and any water weeds or froth that may happen to be in his mouth having been removed he should be carried as quickly as possible to the nearest house he should now be put into a warm bath about as hot as the hand can pleasantly bear and kept there for about ten minutes artificial breathing being had recourse to while he is in it having been taken out of the bath he should be placed flat on his back with his head slightly raised upon a warm bed in a warm room wiped perfectly dry and then rubbed constantly all over the body with warm flannels at the same time mustard poultices should be put to the soles of the feet the palms of the hands and the inner surface of the thighs and legs warm bricks or bottles filled with warm water should be placed under the armpits the nose should be tickled with a feather and smellingsalts applied to it this treatment should be adopted while the bath is being got ready as well as when the body has been taken out of it the bath is not absolutely necessary constantly rubbing the body with flannels in a warm room having been found sufficient for resuscitation sir b brodie says that warm air is quite as good as warm water when symptoms of returning consciousness begin to show themselves give a little wine brandy or twenty drops of salvolatile and water in some cases it is necessary in about twelve or twentyfour hours after the patient has revived to bleed him for peculiar headsymptoms which now and then occur bleeding however even in the hands of professional men themselves should be very cautiously usednonprofessional ones should never think of it the best thing to do in these cases is to keep the head well raised and cool with a lotion such as that recommended above for sprains to administer an aperient draught and to abstain from giving anything that stimulates such as wine brandy salvolatile c c as a general rule a person dies in three minutes and a half after he has been under water it is difficult however to tell how long he has actually been under it although we may know well exactly how long he has been in it this being the case always persevere in your attempts at resuscitation until actual signs of death have shown themselves even for six eight or ten hours dr douglas of glasgow resuscitated a person who had been under water for fourteen minutes by simply rubbing the whole of his body with warm flannels in a warm room for eight hours and a half at the end of which time the person began to show the first symptoms of returning animation should the accident occur at a great distance from any house this treatment should be adopted as closely as the circumstances will permit of breathing through any tube such as a piece of card or paper rolled into the form of a pipe will do as a substitute for the bellows to recapitulate rub the body dry take matters out of mouth cover with blankets or clothes slightly raise the head and place the body in a warm bath or on a bed in a warm

person has been struck by lightning there is a general paleness of the whole body with the exception of the part struck which is often blackened or even scorchedtreatment same as for drowning it is not however of much use for when death takes place at all it is generally instantaneous 2678 cure for the toothachetake a piece of sheet zinc about the size of a sixpence and a piece of silver say a shilling place them together and hold the defective tooth between them or contiguous to them in a few minutes the pain will be gone as if by magic the zinc and silver acting as a galvanic battery will produce on the nerves of the tooth sufficient electricity to establish a current and consequently to relieve the pain or smoke a pipe of tobacco and carawayseeds again 2679 a small piece of the pellitory root will by the flow of saliva it causes afford relief creosote or a few drops of tincture of myrrh or friars balsam on cotton put on the tooth will often subdue the pain a small piece of camphor however retained in the mouth is the most reliable and likely means of conquering the paroxysms of this dreaded enemy 2680 wartseisenberg says in his advice on the hand that the hydrochlorate of lime is the most certain means of destroying warts the process however is very slow and demands perseverance for if discontinued before the proper time no advantage is gained the following is a simple cureon breaking the stalk of the crowfoot plant in two a drop of milky juice will be observed to hang on the upper part of the stem if this be allowed to drop on a wart so that it be well saturated with the juice in about three or four dressings the warts will die and may be taken off with the fingers they may be removed by the above means from the teats of cows where they are sometimes very troublesome and prevent them standing quiet to be milked the wart touched lightly every second day with lunar caustic or rubbed every night with bluestone for a few weeks will destroy the largest wart wherever situated 2681 to cure a whitlowas soon as the whitlow has risen distinctly a pretty large piece should be snipped out so that the watery matter may readily escape and continue to flow out as fast as produced a breadandwater poultice should be put on for a few days when the wound should be bound up lightly with some mild ointment when a cure will be speedily completed constant poulticing both before and after the opening of the whitlow is the only practice needed but as the matter lies deep when it is necessary to open the abscess the incision must be made deep to reach the suppuration 2682 woundsthere are several kinds of wounds which are called by different names according to their appearance or the manner in which they are produced as however it would be useless and even hurtful to bother the readers head with too many nice professional distinctions we shall content ourselves with dividing wounds into three classes 2683 1 incised wounds or cutsthose produced by a knife or some sharp instrument 2684 2 lacerated or torn woundsthose produced by the claws of an animal the bite of a dog running quickly against some projecting blunt object such as a nail c 2685 3 punctured or penetrating woundsthose produced by anything running deeply into the flesh such as a sword a sharp nail a spike the point of a bayonet c 2686 class 1 incised wounds or cutsthe danger arising from these accidents is owing more to their position than to their extent thus a cut of half an inch long which goes through an artery is more serious than a cut of two inches long which is not near one again a small cut on the head is more often followed by dangerous symptoms than a much larger one on the legstreatment if the cut is not a very large one and no artery or vein is wounded this is very simple if there are any foreign substances left in the wound they must be taken out and the bleeding must be quite stopped before the wound is strapped up if the bleeding is not very great it may easily be stopped by raising the cut part and applying rags dipped in cold water to it all clots of blood must be carefully removed for if they are left behind they prevent the wound from healing when the bleeding has been stopped and the wound perfectly cleaned its two edges are to be brought closely together by thin straps of common adhesive plaster which should remain on if there is not great pain or heat about the part for two or three days without being removed the cut part should be kept raised and cool when the strips of plaster are to be taken off they should first be well bathed with lukewarm water this will cause them to come away easily and without opening the lips of the wound which accident is very likely to take place if they are pulled off without having been first moistened with the warm water if the wound is not healed when the strips of plaster are taken off fresh ones must be applied great care is required in treating cuts of the head as they are often followed by erysipelas taking place round them they should be strapped with isinglass plaster which is much less irritating than the ordinary adhesive plaster only use as many strips as are actually requisite to keep the two edges of the wound together keep the patient quite quiet on low diet for a week or so according to his symptoms purge him well with the no 2 pills five grains of blue pill mixed with the same quantity of compound extract of colocynth make into two pills the dose for an adult if the patient is feverish give him two tablespoonfuls of the fevermixture three times a day the fevermixture we remind our readers is thus made mix a drachm of powdered nitre 2 drachms of carbonate of potash 2 teaspoonfuls of antimonial wine and a tablespoonful of sweet spirits of nitre in half a pint of water a person should be very careful of himself for a month or two after having had a bad cut on the head his bowels should be kept constantly open and all excitement and excess avoided when a vein or artery is wounded the danger is of course much greater those accidents therefore should always be attended to by a surgeon if he can possibly be procured before he arrives however or in case his assistance cannot be obtained at all the following treatment should be adoptedraise the cut part and press rags dipped in cold water firmly against it this will often be sufficient to stop the bleeding if the divided artery or vein is not dangerous when an artery is divided the blood is of a bright red colour and comes away in jets in this case and supposing the leg or arm to be the cut part a handkerchief is to be tied tightly round the limb above the cut and if possible the two bleeding ends of the artery should each be tied with a piece of silk if the bleeding is from a vein the blood is much darker and does not come away in jets in this case the handkerchief is to be tied below the cut and a pad of lint or linen pressed firmly against the divided ends of the vein let every bad cut especially where there is much bleeding and even although it may to all appearance have been stopped be attended to by a surgeon if one can by any means be obtained 2687 class 2 lacerated or torn woundsthere is not so much bleeding in these cases as in clean cuts because the bloodvessels are torn across in a zigzag manner and not divided straight across in other respects however they are more serious than ordinary cuts being often followed by inflammation mortification fever and in some cases by lockedjaw foreign substances are also more likely to remain in themtreatment stop the bleeding if there is any in the manner directed for cuts remove all substances that may be in the wound keep the patient quite quiet and on low dietgruel arrowroot and the like purge with the no 1 pills and the no 1 mixture the no 1 pill mix 5 grains of calomel and the same quantity of antimonial powder with a little breadcrumb and make into two pills which is the dose for an adult the no 1 mixture dissolve an ounce of epsom salts in half a pint of senna tea a quarter of the mixture is a dose if there are feverish symptoms give two tablespoonfuls of fevermixture see above every four hours if possible bring the two edges of the wound together but do not strain the parts to do this if they cannot be brought together on account of a piece of flesh being taken clean out or the raggedness of their edges put lint dipped in cold water over the wound and cover it with oiled silk it will then fill up from the bottom if the wound after being well washed should still contain any sand or grit of any kind or if it should get red and hot from inflammation a large warm bread poultice will be the best thing to apply until it becomes quite clean or the inflammation goes down when the wound is a very large one the application of warm poppy fomentations is better than that of the lint dipped in cold water if the redness and pain about the part and the general feverish symptoms are great from eight to twelve leeches are to be applied round the wound and a warm poppy fomentation or warm bread poultice applied after they drop off 2688 class 3 punctured or penetrating woundsthese for many reasons are the most serious of all kinds of woundstreatment the same as that for lacerated wounds pus matter often forms at the bottom of these wounds which should therefore be kept open at the top by separating their edges every morning with a bodkin and applying a warm bread poultice immediately afterwards they will then in all probability heal up from the bottom and any matter which may form will find its own way out into the poultice sometimes however in spite of all precautions collections of matter abscesses will form at the bottom or sides of the wound those are to be opened with a lancet and the matter thus let out when matter is forming the patient has cold shiverings throbbing pain in the part and flushes on the face which come and go a swelling of the part is also often seen the matter in the abscesses may be felt to move backwards and forwards when pressure is made from one side of the swelling to the other with the first and second fingers the middle and that next the thumb of each hand medical memoranda 2689 advantages of cleanlinesshealth and strength cannot be long continued unless the skinall the skinis washed frequently with a sponge or other means every morning is best after which the skin should be rubbed very well with a rough cloth this is the most certain way of preventing cold and a little substitute for exercise as it brings blood to the surface and causes it to circulate well through the fine capillary vessels labour produces this circulation naturally the insensible perspiration cannot escape well if the skin is not clean as the pores get choked up it is said that in health about half the aliment we take passes out through the skin 2690 the tomato medicinalto many persons there is something unpleasant not to say offensive in the flavour of this excellent fruit it has however long been used for culinary purposes in various countries of europe dr bennett a professor of some celebrity considers it an invaluable article of diet and ascribes to it very important medicinal properties he declares1 that the tomato is one of the most powerful deobstruents of the materia medica and that in all those affections of the liver and other organs where calomel is indicated it is probably the most effective and least harmful remedial agent known in the profession 2 that a chemical extract can be obtained from it which will altogether supersede the use of calomel in the cure of diseases 3 that he has successfully treated diarrhoea with this article alone 4 that when used as an article of diet it is almost a sovereign remedy for dyspepsia and indigestion 2691 warm waterwarm water is preferable to cold water as a drink to persons who are subject to dyspeptic and bilious complaints and it may be taken more freely than cold water and consequently answers better as a diluent for carrying off bile and removing obstructions in the urinary secretion in cases of stone and gravel when water of a temperature equal to that of the human body is used for drink it proves considerably stimulant and is particularly suited to dyspeptic bilious gouty and chlorotic subjects 2692 cautions in visiting sickroomsnever venture into a sickroom if you are in a violent perspiration if circumstances require your continuance there for the moment your body becomes cold it is in a state likely to absorb the infection and give you the disease nor visit a sick person especially if the complaint be of a contagious nature with an empty stomach as this disposes the system more readily to receive the contagion in attending a sick person place yourself where the air passes from the door or window to the bed of the diseased not betwixt the diseased person and any fire that is in the room as the heat of the fire will draw the infectious vapour in that direction and you would run much danger from breathing it 2693 necessity of good ventilation in rooms lighted with gasin dwellinghouses lighted by gas the frequent renewal of the air is of great importance a single gasburner will consume more oxygen and produce more carbonic acid to deteriorate the atmosphere of a room than six or eight candles if therefore when several burners are used no provision is made for the escape of the corrupted air and for the introduction of pure air from without the health will necessarily suffer legal memoranda chapter xliv 2694 humorists tell us there is no act of our lives which can be performed without breaking through some one of the many meshes of the law by which our rights are so carefully guarded and those learned in the law when they do give advice without the usual fee and in the confidence of friendship generally say pay pay anything rather than go to law while those having experience in the courts of themis have a wholesome dread of its pitfalls there are a few exceptions however to this fear of the laws uncertainties and we hear of those to whom a lawsuit is on agreeable relaxation a gentle excitement one of this class when remonstrated with retorted that while one friend kept dogs and another horses he as he had a right to do kept a lawyer and no one had a right to dispute his taste we cannot pretend in these few pages to lay down even the principles of law not to speak of its contrary exposition in different courts but there are a few acts of legal import which all menand women toomust perform and to these acts we may be useful in giving a right direction there is a house to be leased or purchased servants to be engaged a will to be made or property settled in all families and much of the welfare of its members depends on these things being done in proper legal form 2695 purchasing a housefew men will venture to purchase a freehold or even a leasehold property by private contract without making themselves acquainted with the locality and employing a solicitor to examine the titles but many do walk into an auctionroom and bid for a property upon the representations of the auctioneer the conditions whatever they are will bind him for by one of the legal fictions of which we have still so many the auctioneer who is in reality the agent for the vendor becomes also the agent for the buyer and by putting down the names of bidders and the biddings he binds him to whom the lot is knocked down to the sale and the conditionsthe falling of the auctioneers hammer is the acceptance of the offer which completes the agreement to purchase in any such transaction you can only look at the written or printed particulars any verbal statement of the auctioneer made at the time of the sale cannot contradict them and they are implemented by the agreement which the auctioneer calls on the purchaser to sign after the sale you should sign no such contract without having a duplicate of it signed by the auctioneer and delivered to you it is perhaps unnecessary to add that no trustee or assignee can purchase property for himself included in the trust even at auction nor is it safe to pay the purchase money to an agent of the vendor unless he give a written authority to the agent to receive it besides handing over the requisite deeds and receipts 2696 the laws of purchase and sale of property are so complicated that lord st leonards devotes five chapters of his book on property law to the subject the only circumstances strong enough to vitiate a purchase which has been reduced to a written contract is proof of fraudulent representation as to an encumbrance of which the buyer was ignorant or a defect in title but every circumstance which the purchaser might have learned by careful investigation the law presumes that he did know thus in buying a leasehold estate or house all the covenants of the original lease are presumed to be known it is not unusual says lord st leonards to stipulate in conditions of sale of leasehold property that the production of a receipt for the last years rent shall be accepted as proof that all the lessors covenants were performed up to that period never bid for one clogged with such a condition there are some acts against which no relief can be obtained for example the tenants right to insure or his insuring in an office or in names not authorized in the lease and you should not rely upon the mere fact of the insurance being correct at the time of sale there may have been a prior breach of covenant and the landlord may not have waived his right of entry for the forfeiture and where any doubt of this kind exists the landlord should be appealed to 2697 interest on a purchase is due from the day fixed upon for completing where it cannot be completed the loss rests with the party with whom the delay rests but it appears when the delay rests with the seller and the money is lying idle notice of that is to be given to the seller to make him liable to the loss of interest in law the property belongs to the purchaser from the date of the contract he is entitled to any benefit and must bear any loss the seller may suffer the insurance to drop without giving notice and should a fire take place the loss falls on the buyer in agreeing to buy a house therefore provide at the same time for its insurance common fixtures pass with the house where nothing is said about them 2698 there are some wellrecognized laws of what may be called goodneighbourhood which affect all properties if you purchase a field or house the seller retaining another field between yours and the highway he must of necessity grant you a right of way where the owner of more than one house sells one of them the purchaser is entitled to benefit by all drains leading from his house into other drains and will be subject to all necessary drains for the adjoining houses although there is no express reservation as to drains thus if his happens to be a leading drain other necessary drains may be opened into it in purchasing land for building on you should expressly reserve a right to make an opening into any sewer or watercourse on the vendors land for drainage purposes 2699 constructionsamong the cautions which purchasers of houses land or leaseholds should keep in view is a not inconsiderable array of constructive notices which are equally binding with actual ones notice to your attorney or agent is notice to you and when the same attorney is employed by both parties and he is aware of an encumbrance of which you are ignorant you are bound by it even where the vendor is guilty of a fraud to which your agent is privy you are responsible and cannot be released from the consequences 2700 the relations of landlord and tenant are most important to both parties and each should clearly understand his position the proprietor of a house or house and land agrees to let it either to a tenantatwill a yearly tenancy or under lease a tenancyatwill may be created by parol or by agreement and as the tenant may be turned out when his landlord pleases so he may leave when he himself thinks proper but this kind of tenancy is extremely inconvenient to both parties where an annual rent is attached to the tenancy in construction of law a lease or agreement without limitation to any certain period is a lease from year to year and both landlord and tenant are entitled to notice before the tenancy can be determined by the other this notice must be given at least six months before the expiration of the current year of the tenancy and it can only terminate at the end of any whole year from the time at which it began so that the tenant entering into possession at midsummer the notice must be given to or by him so as to terminate at the same term when once he is in possession he has a right to remain for a whole year and if no notice be given at the end of the first halfyear of his tenancy he will have to remain two years and so on for any number of years 2701 tenancy by sufferancethis is a tenancy not very uncommon arising out of the unwillingness of either party to take the initiative in a more decided course at the expiry of a lease or agreement the tenant remains in possession and continues to pay rent as before and becomes from sufferance a tenant from year to year which can only be terminated by one party or the other giving the necessary six months notice to quit at the term corresponding with the commencement of the original tenancy this tenancy at sufferance applies also to an undertenant who remains in possession and pays rent to the reversioner or head landlord a six months notice will be insufficient for this tenancy a notice was given in right v darby itr 159 to quit a house held by plaintiff as tenant from year to year on the 17th june 1840 requiring him to quit the premises on the 11th october following or such other day as his said tenancy might expire the tenancy had commenced on the 11th october in a former year but it was held that this was not a good notice for the year ending october 11 1841 a tenant from year to year gave his landlord notice to quit ending the tenancy at a time within the halfyear the landlord acquiesced at first but afterwards refused to accept the notice the tenant quitted the premises the landlord entered and even made some repairs but it was afterwards held that the tenancy was not determined a notice to quit must be such as the tenant may safely act on at the time of receiving it therefore it can only be given by an agent properly authorized at the time and cannot be made good by the landlord adopting it afterwards an unqualified notice given at the proper time should conclude with on failure whereof i shall require you to pay me double the former rent for so long as you retain possession 2702 leasesa lease is an instrument in writing by which one person grants to another the occupation and use of lands or tenements for a term of years for a consideration the lessor granting the lease and the lessee accepting it with all its conditions a lessor may grant the lease for any term less than his own interest a tenant for life in an estate can only grant a lease for his own life a tenant for life having power to grant a lease should grant it only in the terms of the power otherwise the lease is void and his estate may be made to pay heavy penalties under the covenant usually the only one onerous on the lessor for quiet enjoyment the proprietor of a freeholdthat is of the possession in perpetuity of lands or tenementsmay grant a lease for 999 years for 99 years or for 3 years in the latter case the lease may be either verbal or in writing no particular form and no stamps being necessary except the usual stamp on agreements so long as the intention of the parties is clearly expressed and the covenants definite and well understood by each party the agreement is complete and the law satisfied in the case of settled estates the court of chancery is empowered to authorize leases under the 19 20 vict c 120 and 21 22 vict c 77 as follows 21 years for agriculture or occupation 40 years for waterpower 99 years for buildingleases 60 years for repairingleases 2703 a lessor may also grant an underlease for a term less than his own to grant the whole of his term would be an assignment leases are frequently burdened with a covenant not to underlet without the consent of the landlord this is a covenant sometimes very onerous and to be avoided where it is possible by a prudent lessee 2704 a lease for any term beyond three years whether an actual lease or an agreement for one must be in the form of a deed that is it must be under seal and all assignments and surrenders of leases must be in the same form or they are void at law thus an agreement made by letter or by a memorandum of agreement which would be binding in most cases would be valueless when it was for a lease unless witnessed and given under hand and seal the last statute 8 9 vict c 106 under which these precautions became necessary has led to serious difficulties the judges says lord st leonards feel the difficulty of holding a lease in writing but not by deed to be altogether void and consequently decided that although such a lease is void under the statute yet it so far regulates the holding that it creates a tenancy from year to year terminable by half a years notice and if the tenure endure for the term attempted to be created by the void lease the tenant may be evicted at the end of the term without any notice to quit an agreement for a lease not by deed has been construed to be a lease for a term of years and consequently void under the statute and yet says lord st leonards a court of equity has held that it may be specifically enforced as an agreement upon the terms stated the law on this point is one of glorious uncertainty in making any such agreement therefore we should be careful to express that it is an agreement and not a lease and that it is witnessed and under seal 2705 agreementsit is usual where the lease is a repairing one to agree for a lease to be granted on completion of repairs according to specification this agreement should contain the names and designation of the parties a description of the property and the term of the intended lease and all the covenants which are to be inserted as no verbal agreement can be made to a written agreement it should also declare that the instrument is an agreement for a lease and not the lease itself the points to be settled in such an agreement are the rent term and especially covenants for insuring and rebuilding in the event of a fire and if it is intended that the lessors consent is to be obtained before assigning or underleasing a covenant to that effect is required in the agreement in buildingleases usually granted for 99 years the tenant is to insure the property and even where the agreement is silent on that point the law decides it so it is otherwise with ordinary tenements when the tenant pays a full or what the law terms rackrent the landlord is then to insure unless it is otherwise arranged by the agreement 2706 it is important for lessee and lessor also that the latter does not exceed his powers a lease granted by a tenant for life before he is properly in possession is void in law for although a court of equity according to lord st leonards will by force of its own jurisdiction support a bon fide lease granted under a power which is merely erroneous in form or ceremonies and the 12 13 vict c 26 and 13 14 vict c 19 compel a new lease to be granted with the necessary variations while the lessor has no power to compel him to accept such a lease except when the person in remainder is competent and willing to confirm the original lease without variations yet all these difficulties involve both delay costs and anxieties 2707 in husbandry leases a covenant to cultivate the land in a husbandlike manner and according to the custom of the district is always implied but it is more usual to prescribe the course of tillage which is to be pursued in the case of houses for occupation the tenant would have to keep the house in a tenantable state of repair during the term and deliver it up in like condition this is not the case with the tenant at will or from year to year where the landlord has to keep the house in tenantable repair and the tenant is only liable for waste beyond reasonable wear and tear 2708 insuranceevery lease or agreement for a lease should covenant not only who is to pay insurance but how the tenement is to be rebuilt in the event of a fire for if the house were burnt down and no provision made for insurance the tenant supposing there was the ordinary covenant to repair in the lease would not only have to rebuild but to pay rent while it was being rebuilt more than this supposing under the same lease the landlord had taken the precaution of insuring he is not compelled to lay out the money recovered in rebuilding the premises sir john leach lays it down that the tenants situation could not be changed by a precaution on the part of the landlord with which he had nothing to do this decision lord campbell confirmed in a more recent case in which an action was brought against a lessee who was not bound to repair and neither he nor the landlord bound to insure admitting an equitable defence the court affirmed sir john leachs decision holding that the tenant was bound to pay the rent and could not require the landlord to lay out the insurance money in rebuilding this is opposed to the opinion of lord st leonards who admits however that the decision of the court must overrule his dictum such being the state of the law it is very important that insurance should be provided for and that the payment of rent should be made to depend upon rebuilding the house in the event of a fire care must be taken however that this is made a covenant of the lease as well as in the agreement otherwise the tenant must rebuild the house 2709 the law declares that a tenant is not bound to repair damages by tempest lightning or other natural casualty unless there is a special covenant to that effect in the lease but if there is a general covenant to repair the repair will fall upon the tenant lord kenyon lays it down in the case of a bridge destroyed by a flood the tenant being under a general covenant to repair that where a party by his own contract creates a duty or charge upon himself he is bound to make it good because he might have guarded against it in the contract the same principle of law has been applied to a house destroyed by lightning it is therefore important to have this settled in the insurance clause 2710 lord st leonards asserts that his policies against fire are not so framed as to render the company legally liable generally the property is inaccurately described with reference to the conditions under which you insure they are framed by companies who probably are not unwilling to have a legal defence against any claim as they intend to pay what they deem just claim without taking advantage of any technical objection and intending to make use of their defence only against what they believe to be a fraud although they may not be able to prove it but says his lordship do not rely upon the moral feelings of the directors ascertain that your house falls strictly within the conditions even having the surveyor of the company to look over your house before the insurance will not save you unless your policy is correct this is true but probably his lordships legal jealousy overshoots the mark here assurance companies only require an honest statement of the facts and that no concealment is practised with their surveyor and the case of his own which he quotes in which a glass door led into a conservatory rendering it according to the view of the company hazardous and consequently voiding the policy when a fire did occur the company paid rather than try the question but even after the fire they demurred when called upon to make the description correct and indorse on the policy the fact that the drawingroom opened through a glass door into conservatories one of two inferences is obvious here either his lordship has overcoloured the statement or the company could not be the respectable one represented the practice with all reputable offices is to survey the premises before insurance and to describe them as they appear but no concealment of stoves or other dangerous accessories or inflammable goods should be practised this certainly binds the office so long as no change takes place but the addition of any stove opening or door through a party wall the introduction of gunpowder saltpetre or other inflammable articles into the premises without notice very properly voids the policy the usual course is to give notice of all alterations and have them indorse on the policy as additions to the description of the property there is little fear where this is honestly done that any company would adopt the sharp practice hinted at in lord st leonards excellent handy book 2711 breaks in the leasewhere a lease is for seven fourteen or twentyone years the option to determine it at the end of the first term is in the tenant unless it is distinctly agreed that the option shall be mutual according to lord st leonards 2712 noxious tradesa clause is usually introduced prohibiting the carrying on of any trade in some houses and of noxious or particular trades in others this clause should be jealously inspected otherwise great annoyance may be produced it has been held that a general clause of this description prohibited a tenant from keeping a school for which he had taken it although a lunatic asylum and publichouse have been found admissible the keeping an asylum not being deemed a trade which is defined as conducted by buying and selling it is better to have the trades or class of trades objected to defined in the lease 2713 fixturesin houses held under lease it has been the practice with landlords to lease the bare walls of the tenement only leaving the lessee to put in the stoves cupboards and such other conveniences as he requires at his own option those except under particular circumstances are the property of the lessee and may either be sold to an incoming tenant or removed at the end of his term the articles which may not be removed are subject to considerable doubt and are a fruitful source of dispute mr commissioner fonblanque has defined as tenants property all goods and chattels 2ndly all articles slightly connected one with another and with the freehold but capable of being separated without materially injuring the freehold 3rdly articles fixed to the freehold by nails and screws bolts or pegs are also tenants goods and chattels but when sunk in the soil or built on it they are integral parts of the freehold and cannot be removed thus a greenhouse or conservatory attached to the house by the tenant is not removable but the furnace and hotwater pipes by which it is heated may be removed or sold to the incoming tenant a brick flue does not come under the same category but remains windowblinds grates stoves coffeemills and in a general sense everything he has placed which can be removed without injury to the freehold he may remove if they are separated from the tenement during his term and the place made good it is not unusual to leave the fixtures in their place with an undertaking from the landlord that when again let the incoming tenant shall pay for them or permit their removal in a recent case however a tenant having held over beyond his term and not removed his fixtures the landlord let the premises to a new tenant who entered into possession and would not allow the fixtures to be removedit was held by the courts on trial that he was justified a similar case occurred to the writer he left his fixtures in the house taking a letter from the landlord undertaking that the incoming tenant should pay for them by valuation or permit their removal the house was let the landlord died his executors on being applied to pleaded ignorance as did the tenant and on being furnished with a copy of the letter the executors told applicant that if he was aggrieved he knew his remedy namely an action at law he thought the first loss the least and has not altered his opinion 2714 taxeslandtax sewersrate and propertytax are landlords taxes but by 30 geo ii c 2 the occupier is required to pay all rates levied and deduct from the rent such taxes as belong to the landlord many landlords now insert a covenant stipulating that landtax and sewersrate are to be paid by the tenants and not deducted this does not apply to the propertytax all other taxes and rates are payable by the occupier 2715 waterrate of course is paid by the tenant the watercompanies as well as gascompanies have the power of cutting off the supply and most of them have also the right of distraining in the same manner as landlords have for rent 2716 notice to quitin the case of leasing for a term no notice is necessary the tenant quits as a matter of course at its termination or if by tacit consent he remains paying rent as heretofore he becomes a tenant at sufferance or from year to year half a years notice now becomes necessary as we have already seen to terminate the tenancy except in london and the rent is under forty shillings when a quarters notice is sufficient either of these notices may be given verbally if it can be proved that the notice was definite and given at the right time form of notice is quite immaterial provided it is definite and clear in its purport 2717 tenancy for less than a year may be terminated according to the taking thus when taken for three months a three months notice is required when monthly a months notice and when weekly a weeks notice but weekly tenancy is changed to a quarterly tenure if the rent is allowed to stand over for three months when taken for a definite time as a month a week or a quarter no notice is necessary on either side 2718 dilapidationsat the termination of a lease supposing he has not done so before a landlord can and usually does send a surveyor to report upon the condition of the tenement and it becomes his duty to ferret out every defect a litigious landlord may drag the outgoing tenant into an expensive lawsuit which he has no power to prevent he may even compel him to pay for repairing improvements which he has effected in the tenement itself if dilapidations exist when the lessor covenants to do all repairs and fails to do so the lessee may repair and deduct the cost from the rent 2719 recovery of rentthe remedies placed in the hands of landlords are very stringent the day after rent falls due he may proceed to recover it by action at law by distress on the premises or by action of ejectment if the rent is half a year in arrear distress is the remedy usually applied the landlord being authorized to enter the premises seize the goods and chattels of his tenant and sell them on the fifth day to reimburse himself for all arrears of rent and the charges of the distress there are a few exceptions but generally all goods found on the premises may be seized the exceptions aredogs rabbits poultry fish tools and implements of a mans trade actually in use the books of a scholar the axe of a carpenter wearing apparel on the person a horse at the plough or a horse he may be riding a watch in the pocket loose money deeds writings the cattle at a smithy forge corn sent to a mill for grinding cattle and goods of a guest at an inn but curiously enough carriages and horses standing at livery at the same inn may be taken distress can only be levied in the daytime and if made after the tender of arrears it is illegal if tender is made after the distress but before it is impounded the landlord must abandon the distress and bear the cost himself nothing of a perishable nature which cannot be restored in the same conditionas milk fruit and the like must be taken 2720 the law does not regard a day as consisting of portions the popular notion that a notice to quit should be served before noon is an error although distraint is one of the remedies it is seldom advisable in a landlord to resort to distraining for the recovery of rent if a tenant cannot pay his rent the sooner he leaves the premises the better if he be a rogue and wont pay he will probably know that nine out of ten distresses are illegal through the carelessness ignorance or extortion of the brokers who execute them many if not most of the respectable brokers will not execute distresses and the business falls into the hands of persons whom it is by no means desirable to employ 2721 powers to relieve landlords of premises by giving them legal possession are given by 19 20 vict cap 108 to the county courts in cases where the rent does not exceed 50 per annum and under the circumstances hereinafter mentioned ie 1 where the term has expired or been determined by notice to quit 2 where there is one halfyears rent in arrear and the landlord shall have right by law to enter for the nonpayment thereof as proof of this power is required the importance of including such a power in the agreement for tenancy will be obvious in the county courts the amount of rent due may be claimed as well as the possession of the premises in one summons 2722 when a tenant deserts premises leaving one halfyears rent in arrear possession may be recovered by means of the policecourt the rent must not exceed 20 per annum and must be at least threefourths of the value of the premises in cases in which the tenant has not deserted the premises and where notice to quit has been given and has expired the landlord must give notice to the tenant of his intended application the annual rent in this case also must not exceed 20 2723 the i o uthe law is not particular as to orthography in fact it distinctly refuses to recognize the existence of that delightful science you may bring your action against mr jacob phillips under the fanciful denomination of jaycobb fillipse if you like and the law wont care because the law goes by ear and although it insists upon having everything written things written are only supposed in law to have any meaning when read which is after all a commonsense rule enough so instead of i owe you persons of a cheerful disposition so frequently found connected with debt used to write facetiously i o u and the law approved of their so doing an i o u is nothing more than a written admission of a debt and may run thus 15th october 1860 to mr w brown i o u ten pounds for coals 10 john jones if to this you add the time of payment as payable in one month from this date your i o u is worthless and illegal for it thus ceases to be a mere acknowledgment and becomes a promissory note now a promissory note requires a stamp which an i o u does not many persons nevertheless stick penny stamps upon them probably for ornamental effect or to make them look serious and authoritative if for the former purpose the postagestamp looks better than the receipt stamp upon blue paper if you are w brown and you didnt see the i o u signed and cant find anybody who knows joness autograph and jones wont pay the i o u will be of no use to you in the county court except to make the judge laugh he will however allow you to prove the consideration and as of course you wont be prepared to do anything of the sort he will if you ask him politely adjourn the hearing for a week when you can produce the coalheavers who delivered the article and thus gain a glorious victory 2724 apprenticesby the statute 5 eliz cap 4 it is enacted that in cases of illusage by masters towards apprentices or of neglect of duty by apprentices the complaining party may apply to a justice of the peace who may make such order as equity may require if for want of conformity on the part of the master this cannot be done then the master may be bound to appear at the next sessions authority is given by the act to the justices in sessions to discharge the apprentice from his indentures they are also empowered on proof of misbehaviour of the apprentice to order him to be corrected or imprisoned with hard labour 2725 husband and wifecontrary to the vulgar opinion second cousins as well as first may legally marry when married a husband is liable for his wifes debts contracted before marriage a creditor desirous of suing for such a claim should proceed against both it will however be sufficient if the husband be served with process the names of both appearing therein thusjohn jones and ann his wife a married woman if sued alone may plead her marriage or as it is called in law coverture the husband is liable for debts of his wife contracted for necessaries while living with him if she voluntarily leaves his protection this liability ceases he is also liable for any debts contracted by her with his authority if the husband have abjured the realm or been transported by a sentence of law the wife is liable during his absence as if she were a single woman for debts contracted by her 2726 in civil cases a wife may now give evidence on behalf of her husband in criminal cases she can neither be a witness for or against her husband the case of assault by him upon her forms an exception to this rule 2727 the law does not at this day admit the ancient principle of allowing moderate correction by a husband upon the person of his wife although this is said to have been anciently limited to the use of a stick not bigger than the thumb this barbarity is now altogether exploded he may notwithstanding as has been recently shown in the famous agapemone case keep her under restraint to prevent her leaving him provided this be effected without cruelty 2728 by the divorce and matrimonial causes act 1857 a wife deserted by her husband may apply to a magistrate or to the petty sessions for an order to protect her lawful earnings or property acquired by her after such desertion from her husband and his creditors in this case it is indispensable that such order shall within ten days be entered at the county court of the district within which she resides it will be seen that the basis of an application for such an order is desertion consequently where the parties have separated by common consent such an order cannot be obtained any previous cruelty or misconduct on the husbands part notwithstanding 2729 when a husband allows his wife to invest money in her own name in a savingsbank and he survives her it is sometimes the rule of such establishments to compel him to take out administration in order to receive such money although it is questionable whether such rule is legally justifiable widows and widowers pay no legacyduty for property coming to them through their deceased partners 2730 receipts for sums above 2 should now be given upon penny stamps a bill of exchange may nevertheless be discharged by an indorsement stating that it has been paid and this will not be liable to the stamp a receipt is not as commonly supposed conclusive evidence as to a payment it is only what the law terms prim facie evidence that is good until contradicted or explained thus if a sends wares or merchandise to b with a receipt as a hint that the transaction is intended to be for ready money and b detain the receipt without paying the cash a will be at liberty to prove the circumstances and to recover his claim the evidence to rebut the receipt must however be clear and indubitable as after all written evidence is of a stronger nature than oral testimony 2731 books of accounta tradesmans books of account cannot be received as evidence in his own behalf unless the entries therein be proved to have been brought under the notice of and admitted to be correct by the other party as is commonly the case with the passbooks employed backwards and forwards between bakers butchers and the like domestic traders and their customers the defendant may however compel the tradesman to produce his books to show entries adverse to his own claim 2732 willsthe last proof of affection which we can give to those left behind is to leave their worldly affairs in such a state as to excite neither jealousy nor anger nor heartrendings of any kind at least for the immediate future this can only be done by a just clear and intelligible disposal of whatever there is to leave without being advocates for every man being his own lawyer it is not to be denied that the most elaborately prepared wills have been the most fruitful sources of litigation and it has even happened that learned judges left wills behind them which could not be carried out except in cases where the property is in land or in leases of complicated tenure very elaborate details are unnecessary and we counsel no man to use words in making his will of which he does not perfectly understand the meaning and import 2733 all men over twentyone years of age and of sound mind and all unmarried women of like age and sanity may by will bequeath their property to whom they please infants that is all persons under twentyone years of age and married women except where they have an estate to their own separate use are incapacitated without the concurrence of the husband the law taking the disposal of any property they die possessed of a person born deaf and dumb cannot make a will unless there is evidence that he could read and comprehend its contents a person convicted of felony cannot make a will unless subsequently pardoned neither can persons outlawed but the wife of a felon transported for life may make a will and act in all respects as if she were unmarried a suicide may bequeath real estate but personal property is forfeited to the crown 2734 except in the case of soldiers on actual service and sailors at sea every will must be made in writing it must be signed by the testator or by some other person in his presence and at his request and the signature must be made or acknowledged in the presence of two or more witnesses who are required to be present at the same time who declare by signing that the will was signed by the testator or acknowledged in their presence and that they signed as witnesses in testators presence 2735 by the act of 1852 it was enacted that no will shall be valid unless signed at the foot or end thereof by the testator or by some person in his presence and by his direction but a subsequent act proceeds to say that every will shall as far only as regards the position of the signature of the testator or of the person signing for him be deemed valid if the signature shall be so placed at or after or following or under or beside or opposite to the end of the will that it shall be apparent on the face of it that the testator intended to give it effect by such signature under this clause a will of several sheets all of which were duly signed except the last one has been refused probate while on the other hand a similar document has been admitted to probate where the last sheet only and none of the other sheets was signed in order to be perfectly formal however each separate sheet should be numbered signed and witnessed and attested on the last sheet this witnessing is an important act the witnesses must subscribe it in the presence of the testator and of each other and by their signature they testify to having witnessed the signature of the testator he being in sound mind at the time wills made under any kind of coercion or even importunity may become void being contrary to the wishes of the testator fraud or imposition also renders a will void and where two wills made by the same person happen to exist neither of them dated the maker of the wills is declared to have died intestate 2736 a will may always be revoked and annulled but only by burning or entirely destroying the writing or by adding a codicil or making a subsequent will duly attested but as the alteration of a will is only a revocation to the extent of the alteration if it is intended to revoke the original will entirely such intention should be declaredno merely verbal directions can revoke a written will and the act of running the pen through the signatures or down the page is not sufficient to cancel it without a written declaration to that effect signed and witnessed 2737 a will made before marriage is revoked thereby 2738 a codicil is a supplement or addition to a will either explaining or altering former dispositions it may be written on the same or separate paper and is to be witnessed and attested in the same manner as the original document 2739 witnessesany persons are qualified to witness a will who can write their names but such witness cannot be benefitted by the will if a legacy is granted to the persons witnessing it is void the same rule applies to the husband or wife of a witness a bequest made to either of these is void 2740 form of willsform is unimportant provided the testators intention is clear it should commence with his designation that is his name and surname place of abode profession or occupation the legatees should also be clearly described in leaving a legacy to a married woman if no trustees are appointed over it and no specific directions given that it is for her sole and separate use free from the control debts and incumbrances of her husband the husband will be entitled to the legacy in the same manner a legacy to an unmarried woman will vest in her husband after marriage unless a settlement of it is made on her before marriage 2741 in sudden emergencies a form may be useful and the following has been considered a good one for a deathbed will where the assistance of a solicitor could not be obtained indeed few solicitors can prepare a will on the spur of the moment they require time and legal forms which are by no means necessary before they can act i ab of no 10 street in the city of gentleman builder or grocer as the case may be being of sound mind thus publish and declare my last will and testament revoking and annulling all former dispositions of my property i give and bequeath as followsto my son jb of i give and bequeath the sum of to my daughter m the wife of j of i give and bequeath the sum of if intended for her own

remaining property i die possessed of i leave to my dear wife m b for her sole and separate use during her natural life together with my house and furniture situate at no 10 street aforesaid at her death i desire that the said house shall be sold with all the goods and chattels therein or i give and bequeath the said house with all the goods and chattels therein to and the money realized from the sale together with that in which my said wife had a lifeinterest i give and bequeath in equal moieties to my son and daughter before named i appoint my dear friend ts of and tb of together with my wife mb as executors to this my last will and testament signed by ab this 10th day of october 1861 in our presence both being present together and both having signed as witnesses in the presence of the testatorab ts witness fm witness it is to be observed that the signature of the testator after this attestation has been signed by the witnesses is not a compliance with the act he must sign first 2742 stampdutiesin the case of persons dying intestate when their effects are administered to by their family the stampduty is half as much more as it would have been under a will freehold and copyhold estates are now subject to a special impost on passing by the stamp act of 1857 2743 the legacyduty only commences when it amounts to 20 and upwards and where it is not directed otherwise the duty is deducted from the legacy 2744 you cannot compound for past absence of charity by bequeathing land or tenements or money to purchase such to any charitable use by your last will and testament but you may devise them to the british museum to either of the two universities of oxford and cambridge to eton winchester and westminster and you may if so inclined leave it for the augmentation of queen annes bounty you may however order your executors to sell land and hand over the money received to any charitable institution 2745 in making provision for a wife state whether it is in lieu of or in addition to dower 2746 if you have advanced money to any child and taken an acknowledgment for it or entered it in any book of account you should declare whether any legacy left by will is in addition to such advance or whether it is to be deducted from the legacy 2747 a legacy left by will to any one would be cancelled by your leaving another legacy by a codicil to the same person unless it is stated to be in addition to the former bequest 2748 your entire estate is chargeable with your debts except where the real estate is settled let it be distinctly stated out of which property the real or personal they are paid where it consists of both 2749 whatever is devised let the intention be clearly expressed and without any condition if you intend it to take effect 2750 attestation is not necessary to a will as the act of witnessing is all the law requires and the will itself declares the testator to be of sound mind in his own estimation but wherever there are erasures or interlineations one becomes necessary no particular form is prescribed but it should state that the testator either signed it himself or that another signed it by his request or that he acknowledged the signature to be his in their presence both being present together and signed as witnesses in his presence when there are erasures the attestation must declare thatthe words interlined in the third line of page 4 and the erasure in the fifth line of page 6 having been first made these are the acts necessary to make a properly executed will and being simple in themselves and easily performed they should be strictly complied with and always attested 2751 a witness may on being requested sign for testator and he may also sign for his fellowwitness supposing he can only make his mark declaring that he does so but a husband cannot sign for his wife either as testator or witness nor can a wife for her husband end of the project gutenberg ebook the book of household management updated editions
