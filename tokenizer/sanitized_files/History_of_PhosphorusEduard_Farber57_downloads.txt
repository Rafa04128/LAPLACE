nuclein and nucleic acids 192 phosphates in biological processes 197 medicines and poisons 198 eduard farber history of phosphorus the cold light produced by phosphorus caused it to be considered a miraculous chemical for a long time after its discovery about 1669 during the intervening three centuries numerous other chemical miracles have been found yet phosphorus retains a special aura of universal importance in chemistry many investigators have occupied themselves with this element and its diverse chemical compounds further enlightenment and insight into the ways of nature can be expected from these efforts not only is the story of phosphorus a major drama in the history of chemistry it also illustrates in a spectacular example the growth of this science through the discovery of connections between apparently unrelated phenomena and the continuous interplay between basic science and the search for practical usage the author eduard farber is a research professor at american university washington dc and has been associated with the smithsonian institution as a consultant in chemistry when phosphorus was discovered nearly three centuries ago it was considered a miraculous thing the only event that provoked a similar emotion was the discovery of radium more than two centuries later the excitement about the phosphorus igneus boyles icy noctiluca was slowly replaced by or converted into chemical research yet if we would allow room for emotion in research we could still be excited about the wondrous substance that chemical and biological work continues to reveal as vitally important it is a fundamental plant nutrient an essential part in nerve and brain substance a decisive factor in muscle action and cell growth and also a component in fastacting powerful poisons the importance of phosphorus was gradually recognized and the means by which this took place are characteristic and similar to other developments in the history of science this paper was written in order to summarize these various means which led to the highly complex ways of present research the element from animals and plants it was a little late to search for the philosophers stone in 1669 yet it was in such a search that phosphorus was discovered wilhelm homberg 16521715 described it in the following manner brand a man little known of low birth with a bizarre and mysterious nature in all he did found this luminous matter while searching for something else he was a glassmaker by profession but he had abandoned it in order to be free for the pursuit of the philosophical stone with which he was engrossed having put it into his mind that the secret of the philosophical stone consisted in the preparation of urine this man worked in all kinds of manners and for a very long time without finding anything finally in the year 1669 after a strong distillation of urine he found in the recipient a luminant matter that has since been called phosphorus he showed it to some of his friends among them mister kunkel sic1 neither the name nor the phenomenon were really new organic phosphorescent materials were known to aristotle and a lithophosphorus was the subject of a book published in 1640 based on a discovery made by a shoemaker vicenzo casciarolo on a mountainside near bologna in 16302 was the substance new which brand showed to his friends johann gottfried leonhardi quotes a book of 1689 in which the author kletwich claims that this phosphorus had already been known to fernelius the court physician of king henri ii of france 115411893 to the same period belongs the ordinatio alchid bechil saraceni philosophi in which ferdinand hoefer found a distillation of urine with clay and carbonaceous material described and the resulting product named escarbuncle4 it would be worth looking for this source although bechil would still remain an entirely unsuccessful predecessor it does seem strange that in all the distillations of arbitrary mixtures the conditions should never before 1669 have been right for the formation and the observation of phosphorus illustration figure 1the alchemist discovers phosphorus a painting by joseph wright 17341779 of derby england for brands contemporaries at least the discovery was new and exciting the philosopher gottfried wilhelm von leibniz 16461716 considered it important enough to devote some of his time between his work as librarian in hanover and wolfenbttel his efforts to reunite the protestant and the catholic churches and his duties as privy councellor in what we would call a department of justice to a history of phosphorus this friend of huygens and boyle tried to prove that kunckel was not justified in claiming the discovery for himself5 since then it has been shown that johann kunckel 16301703 actually worked out the method which neither brand nor his friend kraft wanted to disclose boyle also developed a method independently published it and instructed gottfried hankwitz in the technique later on jean hellot 16851765 gave a meticulous description of the details and a long survey of the literature6 illustration figure 2galleyoven 1869 the picture is a cross section through the front of the oven showing one of the 36 retorts the receivers for the distillate and the space in the upper story used for evaporating the mixture of acid solution of calcium phosphate and coal according to anselme payen prcis de chimie industrielle paris 1849 reproduced from hugo fleck die fabrikation chemischer produkte aus thierischen abfllen vieweg braunschweig 1862 page 80 of volume 2 2nd group of p bolleys handbuch der chemischen technologie to obtain phosphorus a good proportion of coal regarded as a type of phlogiston was added to urine previously thickened by evaporation and preferably after putrefaction and the mixture was heated to the highest attainable temperature it was obvious that phlogiston entered into the composition of the distillation product the question remained whether this product was generated de novo in his research of 1743 to 1746 andreas sigismund marggraf 17091782 provided the answer he found the new substance in edible plant seeds and he concluded that it enters the human system through the plant food to be excreted later in the urine he did not convince all the chemists with his reasoning in 1789 macquer wrote there are some who even at this time hold that the phosphorical phosphorische acid generates itself in the animals and who consider this to be the animalistic acid7 although marggraf was more advanced in his arguments than these chemists yet he was a child of his time the luminescent and combustible almost waxlike substance impressed him greatly my thoughts about the unexpected generation of light and fire out of water fine earth and phlogiston i reserve to describe at a later time these thoughts went so far as to connect the new marvel with alchemical wonder tales when marggraf used the essential salt of urine also called sal microcosmicum and admixed silver chloride horny silver to it for the distillation of phosphorus he expected a partial conversion of silver by phlogiston and the added fine vitrifiable earth but no trace of a more noble metal appeared8 robert boyle had already found that the burning of phosphorus produced an acid he identified it by taste and by its influence on colored plant extracts serving as indicators hankwitz9 described methods for obtaining this acid and marggraf showed its chemical peculiarities they did not necessarily establish phosphorus as a new element to do that was not as important at that time as to conjecture on analogies with known substances underlying all its unique characteristics was the analogy of phosphorus with sulfur like sulfur phosphorus can burn in two different ways either slowly or more violently and form two different acids the analogy can therefore be extended to explain the results in both groups in the same way in the process of burning the combustible component is removed and the acid originally combined with the combustible is set free whether the analogy should be pursued even further remained doubtful although some suspicion lingered on for a while that phosphoric acid might actually be a modified sulfuric acid analogies and suspicions like these were needed to formulate new questions and stimulate new experiments they are cited here for their important positive value in the historical development and not for the purpose of showing how wrong these chemists were from our point of view a point of view which they helped to create the widespread interest in the burning of sulfur and of phosphorus naturally caught lavoisiers attention in his first volume of opuscules physiques et chimiques 1774 he devoted 20 pages to his experiments on phosphorus he amplified them a few years later10 when he attributed the combustion to a combination of phosphorus with the eminently respirable part of air in the mthode de nomenclature chimique of 1787 the column of undecomposed substances lists sulfur as the radical sulfurique and phosphorus correspondingly as the radical phosphorique the acids are now shown to be compounds of the undecomposed radicals the complete reversion of the previous concept of this relationship a part of the old analogy remained as far as the acids are concerned sulfuric acid corresponds to phosphoric sulfurous acid to phosphorous acid with less oxygen than in the former11 early uses in the 18th century phosphorus was a costly material it was produced mostly for display and to satisfy curiosity guillaume franois rouelle 17031770 demonstrated the process in his lectures and as macquer reports he very often succeeded in making it12 robert boyle had the idea of using phosphorus as a light for underwater divers13 a century later instant lights were sold with molten phosphorus as the igniter but they proved cumbersome and unreliable14 because white phosphorus is highly poisonous an active development of the use in matches occurred only after the conversion of the white modification into the red had been studied by mile kopp 1844 by wilhelm hittorf 18241914 and in its practical application by anton schrtter 1802187515 illustration figure 3distillation apparatus 1849 for refining crude phosphorus the crude phosphorus is mixed with sand under hot water

receives the distilled phosphorus from hugo fleck die fabrikation chemischer produkte page 90 the most exciting early use however was in medicine it is not surprising that such a use was sought at that time any new material immediately became the hope of ailing mankindand of striving inventors16 phosphorus was prescribed in liniments with fatty oils or as solution in alcohol and ether for external and internal application a certain dr kramer found it efficient against epilepsy and melancholia 1730 a professor hartmann recommended it against cramps17 however in the growing production of phosphorus for matches the workers experienced the poisonous effects in the plant of black and bell at stratford this was prevented by inhaling turpentine experiments on dogs were carried out to show that poisoning by phosphorus could be remedied through oil of turpentine18 illustration figure 4apparatus for converting white phosphorus into the red allotropic form 1851 redistilled phosphorus is

1851 reproduced from hugo fleck die fabrikation chemischer produkte page 112 chemical constitution of phosphoric acids in a long article on phosphorus edmond willm wrote in 1876 for a century urine was the only source from which phosphorus was obtained after gahn in 1769 recognized the presence of phosphoric acid in bones scheele indicated the procedure for making phosphorus from them19 actually gahn used at first hartshorn cornu cervi ustum and scheele doubted until he checked it himself that his esteemed friend was right a few years later scheele corrected gahns assumption that the sal microcosmicum was an ammonia salt instead it is a tertiary neutral salt consisting of alkali minerali fixo ie sodium alkali volatili and acido phosphori20 in the years after 1770 phosphorus was discovered in bones and many other parts of various animals treatment with sulfuric acid decomposed these materials into a solid residue and dissolved phosphoric acid many salts of this acid were produced in crystalline form heat resistance had been considered one of the outstanding characteristics of phosphoric acid now however in the processes of drying and heating certain phosphates it became clear that three kinds of phosphoric acids could be produced ortho pyro and meta berzelius cited these acids as examples of compounds which are isomeric this word was intended to designate compounds which contain the same number of atoms of the same elements but combined in different manners thereby explaining their different chemical properties and crystal forms it was in 1830 that berzelius propounded this companion of the concept isomorphism which was to collect all cases of equal crystal form in compounds in which equal numbers of atoms of different elements are put together in the same manner together the two concepts of isomerism and isomorphism seemed to cover all the known exceptions from the simplest assumption as to specificity and chemical composition however only a few years later thomas graham 18051869 proved that the three phosphoric acids are not isomeric he used the proportion of 2 p to 5 o in the oxide which berzelius had thought justified at least until an example of the contrary could be sufficiently established21 refining the techniques of gaylussac 1816 and several other investigators graham characterized the three phosphoric acids as a terphosphate a biphosphate and phosphate of water actually this was the wrong terminology for what he meant and formulated as trihydrate bihydrate and monohydrate of phosphorus oxide in his manner of writing the formulas each dot over the symbol for the element was to indicate an atom of oxygen thus he wrote h3 p h2 p and h p22 illustration figure 5oven for the calcination of bones about 1870 the

manufacturers in 1867 page 288 graham had come to this understanding of the phosphoric acids through his previous studies of alcoates definite compounds of salts and alcohol analogous to the hydrates 1831 liebig started from analogies he saw with certain organic acids when he formulated the phosphoric acids with a constant proportion of water aq and varying proportions of phosphoric acid p as follows 2 p 3 aq phosphoric acid 3 p 3 aq pyrophosphoric acid 6 p 3 aq metaphosphoric acid illustration figure 7florida hardrock phosphate mining from carroll d wright the phosphate industry of the united states sixth special report of the commissioner of labor government printing office washington 1893 plate facing page 43 salts are formed when a basis ie a metal oxide replaces water when potassiumacid sulfate is neutralized by sodium base the acidsalt divides into glaubers salt and potassium sulfate which proves the acidsalt to be a mixture of the neutral salt with its acid sodiumacid phosphate behaves quite differently after neutralization by a potassium base hydroxide the salt does not split up a uniform sodiumpotassium phosphate is obtained therefore phosphoric acid is truly threebasic23 this result has later been confirmed but the analogy by means of which it had been obtained was very weak in certain parts quite wrong the acids from the two lower oxides of phosphorus were also considered as threebasic adolphe wurtz 18171884 formulated them in 1846 according to the theory of chemical types po o3 phosphoric acid h3 pho o2 phosphorus acid h2 ph2o o hypophosphorous acid24 h further proof for these constitutions was sought in the study of the esters formed when the acids react with alcohols among the analogies and generalizations by which the research on phosphoric acid was supported and to the results of which it contributed a full share was the new theory of acids not oxygen lavoisiers general acidifier but reactive hydrogen determines the character of acids in this brief survey it seems sufficient just to mention this connection without describing it in detail the study of phosphoric acids led to important new concepts in theoretical chemistry the finding of polybasicity was extended to other acids and formed the model that helped to recognize the polyfunctionality in other compounds like alcohols and amines the hydrogen theory of acids was fundamental for further advance in another dimension it is particularly interesting to see that largescale applications followed almost immediately and directly from the new theoretical insight the first and foremost of these applications was in agriculture phosphates as plant nutrients one hundred years after the discovery of cold light the presence of phosphorus in plants and animals was ascertained and its form was established as a compound of phosphoric acid this knowledge had little practical effect until the nature of the acid in its various forms was explained through the work of thomas graham from it there started a considerable technical development at about that time 1833 the duke of richmond proved that the fertilizing value of bones resided not in the gelatin nor in the calcium but in the phosphoric acid thus he confirmed what thodore de saussure had said in 1804 that we have no reason to believe that plants can exist without phosphorus unknowingly at first the farmer had supplied this element by means of the organic fertilizers he used manure excrements bones and horns now with the value of phosphorus known a search began for mineral phosphates to be applied as fertilizers jean baptiste boussingault 18021887 an agricultural chemist in lyons traveled to peru to see the guano deposits garcilaso de la vega ca 1540 to ca 1616 noted in his history of peru 1604 that guano was used by the incas as a fertilizer two hundred years later alexander von humboldt revived this knowledge and humphry davy wrote about the benefits of guano to the soil yet the application of this fertilizer developed only slowly until justus liebig sang its praise imports into england rose and far exceeded those into france where between 1857 and 1867 about 50000 tons were annually received the other great advance in the use of phosphatic plant nutrients started with liebigs recommendation 1840 to treat bones with sulfuric acid for solubilization this idea was not entirely new since 1832 a production of a superphosphate from bones and sulfuric acid had been in progress at prague at rothamsted in 1842 john bennet lawes obtained a patent on the manufacture of superphosphate other manufactures in england followed and were successful although james muspratt 17931886 at newton lost much time and some thousands of pounds on liebigs idea of a mineral manure illustration figure 8florida landpebble phosphate mining from carroll d wright the phosphate industry of the united states plate facing page 58 it was difficult enough to establish the efficacy of bones and artificially produced phosphates in promoting the growth of plants under special conditions of soils and climate therefore the question as to the action of phosphates in the growing plant was not even seriously formulated at that time the beneficial effects were obvious enough to increase the use of phosphates as plant nutrients and to call for new sources of supply active developments of phosphate mining and treating started in south carolina in 1867 and in florida in 188825 in a reciprocal action more phosphate application to soils stimulated increasing research on the conditions and reactions obtaining in the complex and varying compositions called soil the findings of bacteriologists made it clear that physics and chemistry had to be amplified by biology for a real understanding of fertilizer effects after 1900 for example julius stoklasa 18571936 pointed out that bacterial action in soil solubilizes waterinsoluble phosphates and makes them available to the plants26 illustration figure 9florida riverpebble phosphate mining from carroll d wright the phosphate industry of the united states plate facing page 64 the insight into the importance of phosphorus in organisms especially since liebigs time is reflected in the work of friedrich nietzsche 18441900 this revaluator of all values who modestly said of himself i am dynamite once explained the human temperaments as caused by the inorganic salts they contain the differences in temperament are perhaps caused more by the different distribution and quantities of the inorganic salts than by everything else bilious people have too little sodium sulfate the melancholics are lacking in potassium sulfate and phosphate too little calcium phosphate in the phlegmatics courageous natures have an excess of iron phosphate see volume 12 of nietzsches works edit naumannkrner leipzig 1886 in this strange association of inorganic salts with human temperaments the role of iron phosphate as a producer of courage is particularly interesting what would a modern philosopher conclude if he followed the development of insight into the composition and function of complex phosphate compounds in organisms from inorganic to organic phosphates by the middle of the 19th century the source of phosphorus in natural phosphates and the chemistry of its oxidation products had been established the main difficulty that had to be overcome was that these oxidation products existed in so many forms not only several stages of oxidation but in addition aggregations and condensations of the phosphoric acids once the fundamental chemistry of these acids was elucidated the attention of chemists and physiologists turned to the task of finding the actual state in which phosphorus compounds were present in the organisms it had been a great advance when it had been shown that plants need phosphates in their soil this led to the next question concerning the materials in the body of the plant for which phosphates were being used and into which they were incorporated similarly the knowledge that animals attain their phosphates from the digested plant food called in the next step of scientific inquiry for information on the nature of phosphates produced from this source the method used in this inquiry was to subject anatomically separated parts of the organisms to chemical separations the means for such separations had to be more gentle than the strong heat and destructive chemicals that had been considered adequate up to then the interpretation of the new results naturally relied on the general advance of chemistry the development of new methods for isolating substances of little stability of new concepts concerning the arrangements of atoms in the molecules and of new apparatus to measure their rates of change in the system of chemistry as it developed in the first half of the 19th century the new development can be characterized as the turn from inorganic to organic phosphates from the substance of minerals and strong chemical interactions to the components in which phosphate groups remained combined with carboncontaining substances illustration figure 10electric furnace for

1874 page 575 phosphatides and phosphagens the important phosphorus compounds in organisms are much more complex than the simple salts to which nietzsche attributed such influence on mans character long before he wrote it was known that phosphoric acid combines not only with inorganic bases to form salts but with alcohols to form esters in the middle of the 19th century thophile juste pelouze 18071867 extended this knowledge to an ester of glycerol this proved to be significant in several respects glycerol had been shown by michel chevreul 17861889 as the substance in fats that is released in the process of soap boiling when the fatty acids are converted into their salts that it has the nature of an alcohol had been demonstrated by marcellin berthelot instead of one alcoholic hydroxyl group oh like ethanol the alcohol of fermentation or two hydroxyl groups like ethylene glycol glycerol contains three such groups it was the only natural alcohol known at that time that this alcohol would combine with phosphoric acid could be predicted but that the ester as obtained by pelouze still contained free acidic functions and formed a watersoluble barium salt was a new experience

fermentation according to albert jan kluyver 18881956 presented before the society of chemical industry in the royal institution march 7 1951 in chemistry industry 1952 page 136 ff kluyver restates that the fermentation of one molecule of glucose is indissolubly connected with the formation of two molecules of adenosine triphosphate atp out of two molecules of adenosine diphosphate adp shortly after this experience had been gained it became valuable for understanding the chemical nature of a new substance extracted from a natural organ this substance was named lecithin by its discoverer nicolas thodore gobley27 18111876 because he obtained it from egg yolk in greek lkidos he used ether and alcohol for this extraction had he used water and mineral acid instead he would not have found lecithin but only its components as gobley and slightly later oscar liebreich 18391908 subjected lecithin to treatment with boiling water and acid they separated it into three parts one of them was the glycerophosphoric acid of pelouze the second was the wellknown stearic acid of chevreul but the third was somewhat mysterious this third substance was the same as one previously noticed when nerves had been subjected to an extraction by boiling water and acid and therefore called nervesubstance or neurine adolf friedrich strecker 18221871 established the identity of this neurine with a product he had extracted from bile and which went under the name of choline adolphe wurtz 18171884 succeeded in synthesizing this substance from ethylene oxide ch2och2 and trimethylamine nch3328 thus all three parts were identified and strecker put them together to construct a chemical formula for lecithin glycerophosphoric acid combined with a fatty acid and with choline a hydrate of neurine oh n

neutralization takes place between the amino group and the free acidic residue this is expressed in his lecithin formula of 1918 ch2or ch2or2 och2ch2 ch2opo nch33 o illustration lecithin 1918 when the aim was to distill elementary phosphorus out of an organic material it did not matter whether this was fresh or putrified for obtaining lecithin out of egg yolk and similar materials it was essential to use it in fresh condition otherwise enzymes would have decomposed it through more recent work four enzymes have been separated which act specifically in decomposing lecithin enzyme a removes one fatty acid and leaves a complex residue called lysolecithin intact enzyme b attacks this residue and splits off the remaining fatty acid group from it enzyme c liberates only the choline from lecithin and enzyme d opens lecithin at the ester bond between glycerol and phosphoric acid this is shown in the following diagram enzymatic splitting of lecithins enzyme substrate products a lecithin lysolecithin and fatty acids b lysolecithin glycerophosphocholine and fatty acids c lecithin phosphatidic acid and choline d lecithin phosphoryl choline and diglyceride several fatty acids can be present in lecithin from various sources palmitic and oleic acid besides the stearic acid which at first had been thought the only one involved in another group of extracts from brain or nerve tissue aminoethanol h2nch2ch2oh is found instead of the choline of lecithin the variations include the alcohol to which the fatty acids and choline phosphate are attached for example glycerol can be replaced by the socalled meatsugar inositol which has six hydroxyl groups in its hexagonshaped molecule c6h6oh6 illustration figure 14eduard buchner 18601917 received the nobel prize in chemistry for his discovery of cellfree fermentation the first step in finding the role of phosphate in fermentations 1907 the generally similar behavior of these phosphateand fatcontaining substances was emphasized by ludwig thudichum 18291901 he coined the name phosphatides for this group of substances from seeds and nerves29 his work on the phosphates in brain substance aroused particular interest when william crookes drew his highly imaginative picture of an evolution of the chemical elements he put into it phosphorus for the brain salt for the sea clay for the solid earth30 but phosphatides occur in many places of organisms in bacteria in leaves and roots of plants in fat and tissues of animals and where phosphatides are found there are also enzymes that specifically act on them they are called phosphatases to imply that they split the phosphatides in addition enzymes are present which transfer phosphate groups from one compound to another they are more abundant in seeds of high fat content than in the more starchcontaining seeds but even potatoes and orange juice have phosphatases31 thus from phosphatides phosphoric acid is generated and they could also be called phosphagens since 1926 however the name phosphagens has been reserved for a group of organic substances that release their phosphoric acid very readily the link between phosphorus and carbon is provided by oxygen in the phosphatides by nitrogen in the phosphagens in vertebrates the basis for the phosphoric acid is creatine whereas invertebrates have arginine instead h oh oh npo nhpo cnh oh cnh oh nch2cooh nh ch3 ch2 creatine phosphate ch2 ch2 chnh2 cooh arginine phosphate nuclein and nucleic acids all parts of an organism are essential for life only with this in mind does it make sense to say that the most important part of the cell is its nucleus from the nuclei of cells in pus and in salmon sperm johann friedrich miescher 18111887 obtained a peculiar kind of substance which he named nuclein 1868 its phosphate content was easily discovered but to find the exact proportions and the nature of the other components required special methods of separation from phosphatides and other proteins it was difficult to develop such methods at a time when little was known about the properties and particularly the stability of a nuclein for preparing nuclein from yeast cells felix hoppeseyler 18251895 described the following details yeast is dispersed in water to extract soluble materials like salts or sugars after a few hours the insoluble material is separated washed once more with water and then extracted with a very dilute solution of sodium hydroxide the slightly alkaline solution freed from insoluble residues is slowly added to a weak hydrochloric acid a precipitate forms which is separated by filtration washed with dilute acid then with cold alcohol and finally extracted by boiling alcohol the dried residue is the nuclein32 it contains six percent phosphorus a little more washing with water a slightly longer treatment with acid or alcohol gives products of lower phosphorus content many experimental variations were necessary to establish the procedure that leads to purification without alteration of the natural substance this was also true for the methods of chemical degradation carried out in order to find the components of nucleins in their highest state of natural complexity it was learned for example that the special kind of carbohydrate present in nucleins was very susceptible to change under the conditions of hydrolysis by acids phoebus aaron theodor levine 18691940 therefore used the digestion by a living organism with e s london he introduced a solution of nucleic acid into eg the gastrointestinal segment of a dog through a gastric fistula and withdrew the product of digestion through an intestinal fistula fortunately the products obtained in such degradations were not new in themselves the carbohydrate in this nucleic acid proved to be identical with dribose which emil fischer had artificially made from arabinose and named ribose to indicate this relationship 1891 the nitrogenous products of the degradation were identical with substances previously prepared in the long study of uric acid in the course of this study emil fischer established uric acid and a number of its derivatives as having the elementary skeleton of what he called pure uric acid abbreviated to purine out of adolf baeyers work on barbituric acid came the knowledge of pyrimidine and its derivatives illustration figure 15albrecht kossel 18531927 received the nobel prize in medicine and physiology in 1910 for his work on nucleic substances which contain a high proportion of phosphorus the chemical bonds of this phosphorus in the molecules of nucleic substances were determined in later work photo courtesy national library of medicine washington dc from these findings together with what oswald schmiedeberg 18381921 had established concerning the presence of four phosphate groups in the molecule 1899 robert feulgen 18841955 constructed the following scheme of a nucleic acid feulgens formula of 1918 is phosphoric acidcarbohydrateguanine

compound of adenine ribose and phosphoric acid was found in yeast blood and in skeletal muscle of mammals from 100 grams of such muscle 035040 grams of this compound were isolated if the muscle is at rest the compound contains three molecules of phosphoric acid linked through oxygen atoms it was named adenosine triphosphate or adenyltriphosphoric acid34 usually abbreviated by the symbol atp it releases one phosphoric acid group very easily and goes over in the diphosphate adp but it can also lose 2 pgroups as pyrophosphoric acid and leave the monophosphate amp ncnh2 hc cn o ch oh oh h oh

guanine cytosine and uracil were also found and they are active in the temporary transfer of phosphoric acid groups in biological processes thus the study of organic phosphates progressed from the comparatively simple esters connected with fatty substances of organisms to the proteins and the nuclear substances of the cell the proportional amount of phosphorus in the former was larger than in the latter the actual importance and function in the life of organisms however is not measured by the quantity but determined by the special nature of the compounds illustration figure 16otto meyerhof 18841951 received onehalf of the nobel prize in medicine and physiology in 1922 for his discovery of the metabolism of lactic acid in muscle which involves the action of phosphates especially

the nobel prize in medicine and physiology in 1947 for their study on glycogen conversion in the course of this study they identified glucose 1phosphate now usually referred to as cori ester and its function in the glycogen cycle photo courtesy national library of medicine washington dc the study of this function is the newest phase in the history of phosphorus and represents the culmination of the previous efforts this newest phase developed out of an accidental discovery concerning one of the oldest organicchemical industries the production of alcohol by the fermentative action of yeast on sugar a transition of carbohydrates through phosphate compounds to the end products of the fermentation process was found and it gradually proved to be a kind of model for a host of biological processes specific phosphates were thus found to be indispensable for life in reverse the wrong kind of phosphates can destroy life as a result an important part of the new phase in phosphorus history consisted in the studyand useof antibiotic phosphorus compounds phosphates in biological processes the first indication that phosphorus is important for life came from the experience that plants take it up from the substances in the soil they incorporate it in their body substance what makes phosphorus so important that they cannot grow without it the next insight was that animals acquire it from their plant food it is then found in bones in fat and nerve tissue in all cells and particularly in the cell nuclei what are its functions there the answers to such questions were developed from the study of a longknown process the conversion of carbohydrates into carbon dioxide and alcohol by yeast it started with eduard buchners discovery of 1890 that fermentation is produced by a preparation from yeast in which all living cells have been removed when yeast is deadground and pressed out the juice still has the ability to produce fermentation it is strange but in many ways characteristic for the process of science that the riddle of phosphorus in life was solved by first eliminating life in such lifeless fermentations arthur harden found that the conversion of sugar begins with the formation of a hexose phosphate 1904 the ferment of yeast called zymase proved to be a composite of several enzymes hans von eulerchelpin isolated one part of zymase which remains active even after heating its solution to the boiling point from 1 kilogram of yeast he obtained 20 milligrams of this heatstable enzyme which he called cozymase and identified as a nucleotide composed of a purine a sugar and phosphoric acid36 in the years between the two world wars zymase was further resolved into more enzymes one of them the coenzyme i which was shown to be adp connected with another molecule of ribose attached to the amide of nicotinic acid or diphosphopyridine nucleotide nh2 n conh2 n n n n hc hc hcoh hcoh o o hcoh hcoh hc o o hc ch2opopoch2 o oh coenzyme i illustration figure 20fritz a lipmann b 1899 shared with hans adolf krebs the nobel prize in medicine and physiology in 1953 for his work on coenzyme a he discovered acetyl phosphate as the substance in bacteria which transfers phosphate to adenylic acid illustration figure 21alexander r todd b 1907 received the nobel prize in chemistry in 1957 for his research on nucleotides he determined the position of the phosphate groups in the molecule and confirmed it by synthesis of dinucleotide phosphates its function is connected with the transfer of hydrogen between intermediates formed through phosphatetransferring enzymes fermentation proceeds by a cascade of processes in which phosphate groups swing back and forth and equilibria between atp with adp play a major role many of the enzymes are closely related to vitamins thus cocarboxylase a which takes part in the separation of carbon dioxide from an intermediate fermentation product is the phosphate of vitamin b1 others of the b vitamins contain phosphate groups for example those of the b2 and b6 group and in b12 one lonely phosphate forms a bridge in the large molecule that contains one atom of cobalt c63h90n14o14pco the formation of vitamin a from carotine occurs under the influence of atp the first stages in fermentation are like those in respiration which ends with carbon dioxide and water these two are the materials for the reverse process in photosynthesis when light is absorbed by the chlorophyll of green plants one of the initial reactions is a transfer of hydrogen from water to a triphosphopyridine nucleotide which later acts to reduce the carbon dioxide under the influence of atp phosphoglyceric acid is synthesized and further built up by way of carbohydrate phosphates to hexose sugars and finally to starch in many starchy fruits a small proportion of phosphate remains attached to the end product the synthesis of proteins is under the control of deoxyribonucleic acid or ribonucleic acid abbreviated by the symbols dna and rna the genes in the nucleus are parts of a giant dna molecule rna is a universal constituent of all living cells where protein synthesis is intense the content in rna is high thus the spinning glands of silkworms are extraordinarily rich in rna37 in his research on the radioactive isotope p32 george de hevesy gained some insight into the surprising mobility of phosphates in organisms a phosphate radical taken up with the food may first participate in the phosphorylation of glucose in the intestinal mucose soon afterwards pass into the circulation as free phosphate enter a red corpuscle become incorporated with an adenosine triphosphoricacid molecule participate in a glycolytic process going on in the corpuscle return to circulation penetrate into the liver cells participate in the formation of a phosphatide molecule after a short interval enter the circulation in this form penetrate into the spleen and leave this organ after some time as a constituent of a lymphocyte we may meet the phosphate radical again as a constituent of the plasma from which it may find its way into the skeleton38 much has been added in the last 30 years to complete this picture in many details and to extend it to other biochemical processes including even the changes of the pigments in the retina in the visual process or in the conversion of chemical energy to light by bacteria and insects medicines and poisons in the delicate balance of these processes disturbances may occur which can be remedied by specific phosphatecontaining medicines thus adenosine phosphate has been recommended in cases of angina pectoris and marketed under trade names like sarkolyt or in compounds named angiolysine a considerable number of physiologically active organic phosphates can be found in the patent literature39 yeast itself is considered to be a valuable food additive on the other hand there are phosphate compounds that act as poisons one group of such compounds was discovered in 1929 by w lange who wrote of interest is the strong action of monofluorophosphate esters on the human bodythe effect is produced by very small quantities40 diisopropyl fluorophosphate has since become a potential agent for chemical warfare it inactivates an enzyme which controls the transmission of nerve impulses to muscle acetylcholine esterase organic esters of phosphoric acids are used as insecticides the hexaethylester of tetraphosphoric acid prepared by gerhard schrader by heating triethylphosphate with phosphorus oxychloride41 actually contains tetraethylpyrophosphate
