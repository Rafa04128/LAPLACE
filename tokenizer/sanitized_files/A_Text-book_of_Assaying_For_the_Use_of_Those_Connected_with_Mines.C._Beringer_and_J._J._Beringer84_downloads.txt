limited exeter street strand 1904 all rights reserved publishers note to the ninth edition the continued popularity of the present work the last edition of which was published only a little over a year ago continues to be a source of gratification to the publishers who have much pleasure in issuing the present edition january 1904 preface to the sixth edition the principal changes in this edition are additions to the articles on gold cyanides and nickel and a much enlarged index the additional matter covers more than forty pages j j beringer camborne january 1900 preface the textbook now offered to the public has been prepared to meet the existing want of a practical handy book for the assayer to mining men the word assaying conveys a sufficiently clear meaning but it is difficult to define some writers limit it to the determination of silver and gold and others imagine that it has only to do with furnacework these limitations are not recognised in practice in fact assaying is becoming wider in its scope and the distinction between assayers and analysts will in time be difficult to detect we have endeavoured rather to give what will be of use to the assayer than to cover the ground within the limits of a faulty definition at first our intention was to supply a description of those substances only which have a commercial value but on consideration we have added short accounts of the rarer elements since they are frequently met with and occasionally affect the accuracy of an assay under the more important methods we have given the results of a series of experiments showing the effect of varying conditions on the accuracy of the process such experiments are often made by assayers but seldom recorded statements like those generally madethat this or that substance interferesare insufficient it is necessary to know under what conditions and to what extent students learning any particular process cannot do better than repeat such a series of experiments by this means they will at the same time acquire the skill necessary for performing an assay and a confidence in their results based upon work under different conditions the electrolytic method of copper assaying given under copper is a modification of luckows it was introduced by us into the offices of the rio tinto copper company and has been in use for many years with success this modification is now employed in copperworks in spain germany and england and is used in place of the dry assay for the commercial valuation of copper ores we have adhered to the gram and the cc as the units of weight and volume those who prefer working with grains and grainmeasures can use the figures given multiplied by ten for examplewhen 1 gram is mentioned 10 grains should be used and 10 grainmeasures take the place of 1 cc it is not advisable to mix the two systems as by using gram weights and grainmeasures we have intentionally to a large extent omitted to mention the names of those who have originated or modified the various processes the practice of naming a process after its discoverer has developed of late years and is becoming objectionable it is a graceful thing to name a gasburner after bunsen or a condenser after liebig but when the practice has developed so far that one is directed to finkenerise a residue or to use the reichertmeisslwollny process it is time to stop we are indebted to the standard works of allen crookes fresenius lunge michell percy and sutton and wish to express our sense of special indebtedness to mr richard smith of the royal school of mines one or two of the illustrations are taken from mr sextons excellent little book on qualitative analysis our obligation to some others is mentioned in the text finally we have to thank for assistance in the experimental

c a lecture on the theory of sampling 444 index 450 a textbook of assaying chapter i introductory assaying has for its object the determination of the quantities of those constituents of a material which add to or detract from its value in the arts and manufactures the methods of assaying are mainly those of analytical chemistry and are limited by various practical considerations to the determination of the constituents of a small parcel which is frequently only a few grains and rarely more than a few ounces in weight from these determinations calculations are made which have reference to a mass of material of perhaps hundreds of tons but in all cases whether the mass under consideration be large or small whether the material be obtained by mining grown or manufactured the assayer is supposed to receive a small quantity called the sample which is or ought to be the exact counterpart of the mass of material that is being dealt with the taking and making of this sample is termed sampling and the men whose special work it is to select such samples are the samplers but although sampling is thus distinct from assaying the assayer should be familiar with the principles of sampling and rigorous in the application of these principles in the selecting from the sample sent him that smaller portion upon which he performs his operations samplingin the case of gases there is absolutely no trouble in mixing the only difficulty is in drawing off a fair sample where as in flues the body of the gas is in motion and varies a little in composition from time to time in this case care must be taken to draw off uniformly a sufficient volume of the gas during a prolonged period any portion of this larger volume may then be taken for the analytical operation in the case of liquids which mix more or less easilyand this class includes metals c in the state of fusionmore or less severe agitation followed by the immediate withdrawal of a portion will yield a fairly representative sample in the case of solids the whole mass must be crushed and if not already of fairly uniform quality mixed before sampling can take place most of the material which a sampler is called upon to deal with is however in a more or less divided state and fairly uniform in practice it is assumed that 5 per cent of the whole 120th if taken in portions of equal weight and at frequent and regular intervals will represent the mass from which it was taken taking a heap of ore a and selecting one out of every twenty spade bag barrow or wagonfuls according to the quantity of stuff in the heap there is obtained a second heap b containing onetwentieth of the stuff of the heap a if we crush the stuff in b until this heap contains approximately the same number of stones as a didwhich means crushing every stone in b into about twenty piecesb will become the counterpart of a selecting in the same manner 5 per cent of b there is got a third heap c this alternate reduction and pulverising must be carried on until a sample of suitable size is obtained this may be expressed very clearly thus a 1000 tons of rocks and lumpy ore b 50 rough stones 120th of a c 25 small stones 120th of b d 0125 coarse powder 120th of c illustration fig 1 cone partly reduced cone plan of frustrum divided elevation of frustrum divided if the material to be sampled is already a dry powder 5 per cent of it should be heaped in a cone each lot being added on the apex of the cone already formed so that it may distribute itself by falling evenly in all directions when the cone is completed convert it into a low frustrum of a cone by drawing stuff uniformly and in a direct line from the centre to the circumference draw two diameters at right angles to each other and reserving any two alternate quarters reject the others mix and form another cone and proceed until a sample is got of the bulk required this is the usual plan and all samples should be treated in this way when the stuff is fine enough to fall evenly down the sides of a cone samples as they reach the assay office are seldom in a fit state for the work of the assayer they are generally too coarse and ought always to be more than he wants for any particular determination the portion he requires should never be taken at haphazard the sample must be reduced systematically to the quantity required 1 if the sample is a liquid it is sufficient to shake the bottle and take out a measured or weighed quantity for the assay 2 if a liquid with a solid in suspension measure the whole of it filter make up the filtrate with the washwater or water to the original bulk assay it dry and weigh the residue and make a separate assay of it 3 if of a creamy consistency free from heavy particles mix well spread out evenly on a glazed tile take up equal portions at equal distances mix and assay 4 if a mud of coarse and fine particles or of particles of unequal density weigh and transfer to a porcelain dish or weigh in the dish dry at 100 c weigh treat the residue as a solid capable of being powdered 5 if a solid capable of being powdered or already powdered heap up into a cone flatten with a spatula divide along two diameters at right angles and carefully reject the whole of two alternate quarters brushing away any fine powder mix the other quarters and repeat if necessary for small quantities a fine state of division is essential 6 if a solid with metallic particles powder and pass through a sieve the metallic particles will not pass through weigh both portions and assay separately sifting should be followed by a very thorough mixing 7 if a metal or alloy in bar or ingot clean the upper surface of the bar and bore through the bar use the borings if the ingot or bar is small cut it through and file the section filings must be freed from fragments of the file by means of a magnet and from oil if any be present by washing with a suitable solvent1 where practicable metals and alloys are best sampled by melting and granulating the student must carefully avoid any chance of mixing dirt or particles of other samples with the particular sample which he is preparing one ore should be done at a time and when finished it should be labelled and wrapped up or bottled before starting on a fresh sample when an ore requires to be very finely ground in an agate mortar it is often advisable to mix with a little pure alcohol and rub until free from grit dry at 100 c and mix well before weighing when an assay is required of a quantity of ore made up of parcels of different weight and quality each parcel should be separately sampled and parts of each sample bearing to each other the same proportion by weight as the original parcels should be taken and mixed for example a lot of ore is made up of one parcel of a 570 tons one of b 180 tons and another of c 50 tons a sample representing the whole may be got by mixing 57 parts of a sample of a with 18 parts of a sample of b and 5 parts of a sample of c illustration fig 2 a bruising plate like that in fig 2 is convenient for general office work the slab is of cast iron about an inch thick it is firmly supported on a solid block of wood and pivoted for convenience in emptying the bruisinghammer is steelfaced about 4 inches square and 112 inch thick the block is firmly fixed to a small table or tressel so that the slab is about 2 feet 6 inches from the ground the slab is cleaned and the sample collected with the help of a stiffhaired brush drying determination of moisturein practice the moisture is generally determined by the samplers and the proportion is specified in grains per pound on the label attached to the sample when it reaches the assay office the method adopted is usually to dry 1 lb 7000 grs of the ore in a fryingpan heated over a gas flame or in an ordinary oven until a cold bright piece of metal or glass is no longer damped when held over it the loss of weight in grains moisture properly however this work should be done by the assayer if only for the following reason it is assumed that the dry ore of the sampler and of the assayer are the same thing according to the nature of the ore this may or may not be the case the assayer however uses the sample which he has dried for his moisturedetermination as the dry ore on which he makes his other assays and no variation in moisture would influence the other and more important determinations some ores are sent to the smelter with from 5 to 15 per cent of adherent water in these cases it is best to spread out the sample and taking equal portions fairly at regular intervals weigh into a berlin dish 20 grams this should then be dried over a sandbath or if the ore is likely to be injured by excess of heat over a waterbath until the weight is constant the loss of weight multiplied by 5 gives the percentage of water present example weight of dish wolfram 3267 grms dish 1267 wolfram 2000 dish wolfram 3267 dried 3015 water 252 252 5 126 126 there are other ores which are not apparently wet but in the state called airdried it is easier to take fair samples of these and consequently it is not necessary to use so large a quantity as 20 grams but with a smaller quantity extra precautions must be taken all dry solids at ordinary temperatures absorb moisture from the air the amount varies with the nature of the material and with the quantity of surface exposed light bulky powders absorb more than heavy ones because of the greater condensing surface it is on this account that it is well to weigh substances which have been dried between closefitting watchglasses the method of determining moisture is to weigh out into the glasses 5 grams of ore and dry in the wateroven until there is no further loss of weight on taking the glasses out of the oven they should be at once closed the clip put on and after cooling in a desiccator weighed if after a second trial the loss is the same or only increased by a milligram the determination is finished example weight of glasses pyrites 310470 grms glasses 260470 pyrites 50000 glasses pyrites dried 1 hour 308965 dried 112 308957 310470 dried 308957 moisture 01513 01513 20 3026 302 illustration fig 3 sometimes it may be advisable to dry 10 grams in which case multiplying the loss by 10 will give the percentage the dried ore should be transferred to a weighingtube fig 3 and reserved for the subsequent determinations the weighingtube with the ore must be marked and kept in a desiccator most ores and inorganic substances can be dried and their moisture determined by the loss in this way when however the substance contains another somewhat volatile ingredient it is exposed over sulphuric acid in a desiccator for two days if in vacuo all the better and the loss determined moisture in dynamite should be determined in this way when water is simply mechanically mixed with a substance it presents but little difficulty the combined water is a different matter slaked lime even when perfectly dry contains much water and if the water of soda crystals were separated and frozen it would occupy a volume equal to that of the original crystals perfectly dry substances may contain much water and this combined water is retained by different materials with very unequal vigour sodium sulphate and sodium phosphate crystals lose water even when exposed under ordinary conditions to dry air soda crystals when heated melt and at a moderate temperature give off their water with ebullition the temperature at which all the water is given up varies with each particular salt the actual determination of the water in each case will require somewhat different treatment such determinations however are seldom required and from a practical point of view this combined water causes no trouble in assaying ores we term moisture all water which is lost by exposure in a wateroven at 100 c and the dry ore is the ore which has been dried at this temperature no advantage but rather endless confusion would be caused by varying the temperature with the object of estimating the whole of the water which a hydrated salt may contain the results of the assay of the other components should be calculated on the dry ore one advantage of this is obviousthe dry ore has a constant composition and the results of all assays of it will be the same no matter when made the moisture however may vary from day to day and would be influenced by a passing shower of rain it is well to limit this variability to the moisture by considering it apart and thus avoid having the percentage say of copper rising and falling under the influence of the weather in the case of certain salts however such as soda crystals and hydrated sulphate of copper when these constitute the bulk of the substance to be assayed it is as well to perform the assay on the moist or at any rate airdried substance2 it would be equally convenient to calculate on the substance dried at 100 c but in this case it would be well in order to avoid a somewhat shallow criticism to replace the term moisture by the longer but equivalent phrase water lost at 100 c calculation and statement of resultsby far the most generally convenient method of stating the results of an assay is that of the percentage or parts in a hundred and to avoid a needlessly troublesome calculation it is well to take such a quantity of ore for each assay as by a simple multiplication will yield the percentage in these calculations decimals are freely employed and students should make themselves familiar with the methods of using them other methods of statement are in use and have advantages in certain special cases with bullion the parts in a thousand are given and in those cases in which the percentage is very small as in water analysis it is convenient to report on parts in 100000 or even on parts per 1000000 these are easily got from the corresponding percentages by shifting the decimal point one three or four places to the right thus 925 per cent is 925 per thousand and 00036 per cent is 36 per 100000 or 36 per million with ores of tin silver and gold the result is stated as so many cwts lbs or ozs in the ton with dressed tin ores as they are sent to the smelter the produce is given in cwts and quarters to the ton the corresponding percentage may be obtained by multiplying by five or inversely if the percentage is given the produce may be got by dividing by five a produce of 1312 equals a percentage of 1355 675 and a percentage of 700 equals a produce of 705 14 with tin ores as raised in which the percentage is small the reduction must be carried to pounds per ton one per cent equals 224 lbs to the ton consequently if we multiply the percentage by 224 the produce will be given thus if an ore contains 67 per cent of oxide of tin the produce is 67224 150 lbs or 1 cwt 1 quarter and 10 lbs to the ton with gold and silver ores the proportion of precious metal is small and it is necessary to carry the reduction to ozs and dwts to the ton and since gold and silver are sold by troy weight whilst the ton is avoirdupois it is of importance to remember that the ounces in the two systems are not the same a ton contains 15680000 grains which equal 6533333 dwts or 326666 ozs troy the following rules are useful to get ozs troy per ton multiply parts per 100000 by 0327 to get dwts per ton multiply parts per 100000 by 653 to get grains per ton multiply parts per 100000 by 1568 where liquids are being assayed cubic centimetres are held to be equivalent to grams and the usual method of statement is so many parts by weight in so many by measure where the statement is made as grams per litre or grains per gallon there can be no doubt as to what is meant and even if it be expressed in parts per 100000 parts by weight in a measured volume must be understood unless the contrary is expressly stated in some cases where the density of the solution differs greatly from that of water the percentage by weight may be given and in others mixtures of two or more liquids the percentages may be given by volume or by weight as so many cc in 100 cc or as so many grams in 100 grams or even as so many grams in 100 cc in such cases it must be distinctly shown which method of statement is adopted one grain per gallon means 1 grain in 70000 grainmeasures or one part in 70000 dividing by 7 and multiplying by 10 will convert grains per gallon into parts per 100000 inversely dividing by 10 and multiplying by 7 will convert parts per 100000 into grains per gallon grams per litre are parts per 1000 multiplying by 100 will give parts per 100000 and multiplying by 70 will give grains per gallon among foreign systems of weights the french is by far the best kilograms 2205 lbs per quintal 2205 lbs are parts per cent and grams 1543 grs per quintal are parts per 100000 from the rule already given grams per quintal may be converted into ounces to the ton by multiplying by 0327 the german loths per centner 12 oz avoirdupois to 100 lbs equal parts per 3200 they are converted into parts per cent by dividing by 32 or into ounces troy per ton by multiplying by 10208 in the united states as a sort of compromise between the avoirdupois and metric systems a ton is taken as 2000 lbs there too the custom is adopted of reporting the gold and silver contents of an ore as so many dollars and cents to the ton in the case of gold an ounce is considered to be worth 206718 dollars with silver the nominal value is 12929 dollars per ounce but frequently in assay reports it is taken as one dollar the practice is objectionable the prices of metals vary with the fluctuations of the market and if the assayer fixed the price the date of his report would be all important if on the other hand he takes a fixed price which does not at all times agree with the market one it leaves a path open for the deception of those unacquainted with the custom american dollars on the ton of 2000 lbs may be converted into ounces in the ton of 2240 lbs by dividing by 11544 in the case of silver and by 18457 in the case of gold laboratory books and report formsthe record which the assayer makes of his

any particular assay depends largely upon the method of assay adopted there are however some general considerations which should be remembered and some devices for simplifying the calculations which should be discussed the smaller the percentage of the substance to be determined the larger should be the amount of the ore taken the following table will give a general idea as to this percentage of the substance amount of ore c to to be determined be weighed 10010 1 gram 105 2 grams 51 5 101 10 01001 20 illustration assay note the rougher the method of assay adopted the larger should be the quantity of ore taken if the degree of accuracy attainable with the methods and instruments at the assayers service is known it is easy to calculate what quantity should be taken for any particular case if the results are good within 0001 gram then taking 1 gram of ore we can report within 01 per cent or if they are good within 00002 gram taking 20 grams of ore we can report within 1 part per 100000 or very closely within 612 dwt to the ton if it is wished to be yet more particular in reporting larger quantities must be taken the difficulty of manipulating very small or very large precipitates c must be borne in mind so too must the fact that the greater the weight of the final product of an assay the less as a rule is the percentage error the distinction between absolute and percentage error often overlooked is important if 05 gram of silver be cupelled with 20 grams of lead there may be obtained a button of 0495 gram the absolute loss is 0005 gram and this equals 1 per cent of the silver present similarly cupelling 01 gram the resulting button may be 0098 the absolute loss is only 0002 gram but this equals 2 per cent of the silver present in the same way the student should see that the two results 915 per cent and 920 per cent are really more concordant than the results 91 per cent and 92 per cent a device often adopted in practice where a large number of assays of one kind are made and the report is given as so many ounces or pounds to the ton is that known as the assay ton the assay ton may be any arbitrary and convenient weight but its subdivisions must bear to it the same relations as pounds and ounces bear to the actual ton on the other hand in a laboratory where many kinds of work are performed different sets of weights of this kind would only tend to confusion even if they were not unnecessary with a set of gram weights and its subdivisions anything may be done if it is desired to report as pounds to the ton then since there are 2240 lbs to the ton a weight of 2240 grams may be taken as the assay ton and each 0001 gram yielded will equal 1 lb or 224 grams may represent the ton and each 001 gram a pound similarly since there are 326666 ozs troy to the ton if we take 326667 grams as the assay ton each 0001 gram will equal 1 oz to the ton in some cases it may be convenient to have in addition to the usual gram weights one or other of the assay tons mentioned above but generally it is better to work on a purely decimal system and convert when required into ounces per ton c either by actual calculation or by reference to a set of tables practical exercises the student should practise such calculations as the following 1 calculate the percentages in the following cases a ore taken 2 grams copper found 02155 b 15 gram iron found

assaying are best classed under two heads gravimetric and volumetric in the former of which the final results are weighed whilst in the latter they are measured a commoner and older division is expressed in the terms much used in practicewet assays and dry assays wet assays include all those in which solvents c liquid at the ordinary temperature are mainly used and dry assays those in which solid reagents are almost exclusively employed dry assays form a branch of gravimetric work and we shall include under this head all those assays requiring the help of a wind furnace wet assays as generally understood would include not only those which we class as wet gravimetric assays but also all the volumetric processes gravimetric methods aim at the separation of the substance from the other matters present in the ore so that it may be weighed and therefore they must yield the whole of the substance in a pure state it is not necessary that a metal should be weighed as metal it may be weighed in the form of a compound of definite and well known composition for example one part by weight of silver chloride contains and if pure always contains 07527 part of silver and a quantity of this metal can be as exactly determined by weighing it as chloride as by weighing it in the metallic state but in either case the metal or its chloride must be pure exact purity and complete separation are not easily obtained and methods are used which are defective in one or both of these respects it is well to note that an impure product increases the result whilst a loss of the substance decreases it so that if both defects exist in a process they tend to neutralise each other of dry methods generally it may be said that they neither give the whole of the substance nor give it pure so that they are only calculated to show the amount of metal that can be extracted on a manufacturing scale and not the actual quantity of it present their determinations are generally rough and always low the gold and silver determinations however will compare very favourably with any of the other processes for the estimation of these metals in their ores the calculation of the results of a gravimetric assay has already been referred to if the result is to be stated as percentage it may always be done by the following rulemultiply the weight of the substance got by the percentage of metal it contains and divide by the weight of ore taken gravimetric methods are divided into three groups 1 mechanical separations 2 dry methods and 3 wet methods mechanical separationsunder this head are classed the method of assaying tin ores known as vanning and the amalgamation assay for gold a set of sieves to determine the relative proportion of powders of different degrees of fineness is sometimes useful a set with 10 20 40 and 80 meshes to the inch is convenient dry assaysan important distinction between wet and dry methods of assaying is that in the former the substance is got into the liquid state by solution whilst in the latter fusion is taken advantage of the difference between solution and fusion is easily illustrated a lump of sugar heated over a candleflame melts or fuses suspended in water it dissolves many substances which are insoluble or infusible of themselves become soluble or fusible when mixed with certain others thus in this way solution is got with the aid of reagents and fusion with the help of fluxes for example lead is insoluble in water but if nitric acid be added the metal rapidly disappears it is convenient but somewhat inaccurate to say that the acid dissolves the lead if the lead be acted on by nitric acid alone without water it is converted into a white powder which does not dissolve until water is added in this case it is obvious that the water is the solvent the function of the acid is to convert the lead into a soluble compound fluxes may act as true solvents fused carbonate of soda dissolves baric carbonate and perhaps in many slags true solution occurs but in the great majority of cases a flux is a solid reagent added for the purpose of forming a fusible compound with the earthy or stony minerals of the ore few of the minerals which occur in the gangue of an ore are fusible and still fewer are sufficiently fusible for the purposes of the assayer consequently the subject is one of importance and it ought to be treated on chemical principles an idea of the composition of some of the more frequently occurring rocks may be gathered from the following table which represents rough averages oxidelime and silicaalumina of magnesiaalkalies iron sandstone grit quartzite c 80100 granite gneiss quartzporphyry fireclay c 7075 1320 2 2 58 less in fireclay micaschist 65 18 5 3 3 trachyte syenite 60 17 7 47 69 clayslate 60 18

silicates of alumina of lime and of magnesia are practically infusible the silicates of soda of potash and of iron are easily fusible if the base soda potash or oxide of iron be present in sufficient quantity and if in the case of the iron it is present mainly as lower oxide ferrous silicate the addition of lime oxide of iron or alkali to silicate of alumina results in the formation of a double silicate of alumina and lime or of alumina and iron c all of which are easily fusible similarly if to a silicate of lime we add oxide of iron or soda or even alumina a fusible double silicate will be formed thus lime soda oxide of iron and clay are fluxes when properly used but since lime clay and oxide of iron if there be any tendency to form peroxide are of themselves infusible any excess of these fluxes would tend to stiffen and render pasty the resulting slag so too soda which is a very strong base may act prejudicially if it be in sufficient excess to set free notable quantities of lime and magnesia which but for that excess would exist in combination as complex fusible silicates there are many minerals which with but little soda form a glass but with more yield a lumpy scoriacious mass there are many minerals too which are already basic for example calcite and which when present demand either a less basic or an acid flux according to the proportions in which they exist for purposes of this kind borax or glass or clay with more or less soda may be used and of these borax is by far the most generally useful an objection to too basic a slag and a very important one is the speed with which it corrodes ordinary crucibles these crucibles consisting of quartz and clay are rapidly attacked by lime soda and bases generally illustration fig 4 in considering what is and what is not a good slag certain chemical properties are of importance if a mixture of many substances be fused and allowed to solidify in a crucible there will be found some or all of the following at the bottom of the crucible fig 4 a button of metal resting on this a speise then a regulus next a slag made up of silicates and borates and metallic oxides and lastly on the top another layer of slag mainly made up of fusible chlorides and sulphates in assaying operations the object is generally to concentrate the metal sought for in a button of metal speise or regulus and to leave the earthy and other impurities as far as possible in the slag whether there be one or two layers of slag is a matter of indifference3 but the chemical action of the lower layer upon the speise or regulus or metal is of great importance a regulus is a compound of one or more of the metals with sulphur it is usually brittle often crystalline and of a dull somewhat greasy lustre it is essential that the slag when solid shall be so much more brittle than the regulus that it shall be easy to crumble and remove it without breaking the latter and it must not be basic the effect of fusing a regulus with a basic slag is well seen when sulphide of lead is fused with carbonate of soda the result is a button of metal more or less pure and a slag containing sulphides of lead and sodium and again if sulphide of lead be fused with an excess of oxide of lead a button of lead will be got and a slag which is simply oxide of lead with whatever it may have taken up from the crucible or if a sufficient excess has not been used oxide of lead mixed with some sulphide when as is most frequently the case the desire is to prevent the formation of regulus these reactions may be taken advantage of but otherwise the use of a flux having any such tendency must be avoided a good slag from which a regulus may be easily separated may be obtained by fusing say 20 grams of ore with borax 15 grams powdered glass 15 grams fluor spar 20 grams and lime 20 grams by quenching the slag in water as soon as it has solidified it is rendered very brittle sulphide of iron formed during an assay will remain diffused through the slag instead of fusing into a button of regulus if the slag contain sulphide of sodium the same is true of other sulphides if not present in too great a quantity and if the temperature is not too high speises are compounds of a metal or metals with arsenic they are chiefly of interest in the metallurgy of nickel cobalt and tin they are formed by heating the metal or ore in covered crucibles with arsenic and if necessary a reducing agent the product is fused with more arsenic under a slag consisting mainly of borax they are very fusible brittle compounds on exposure to the air at a red heat the arsenic and the metal simultaneously oxidize when iron cobalt nickel and copper are present in the same speise they are eliminated in the order mentioned slags from which metals are to be separated should not be too acid at least in those cases in which the metal is to be reduced from a compound as well as separated from earthy impurities where the object is simply to get a button of metal from a substance in which it is already in the metallic state but mixed with dross made up of metallic oxides such as those of zinc or iron from which it is desired to separate it an acid flux like borax is best or if the metal is easily fusible and there would be danger of loss of metal by oxidation or volatilising it may be melted under a layer of resin or fat common salt is sometimes used with a similar object and is often useful under certain conditions however it has a tendency to cause the formation of volatile chlorides with a consequent loss of metal in the great majority of cases the fusion of the metal is accompanied by reduction from the state of oxide in these the slag should be basic it is not easy to reduce the whole of a reducible oxide say oxide of copper or of iron from a slag in which it exists as a borate or silicate there should be at least enough soda present to liberate it when the object is to separate one metal say copper without reducing an unnecessary amount of another iron at the same time a slag with a good deal of borax is a distinct advantage the slag then will probably not be free from copper so that it will be necessary to powder and mix the slag with some soda and a reducing agent and to again fuse the slag in order to separate this residual metal in all those cases in which the slag retains an oxide of a heavy metal this cleaning of the slag is advisable and in the case of rich ores necessary slags containing sulphides are especially apt to retain the more easily reducible metals the following are the ordinary and most useful fluxes sodathe powdered bicarbonate sold by druggists as carbonate of soda is generally used it gives off its water and excess of carbonic acid readily and without fusion where the melting down is performed rapidly the escaping gas is apt to cause trouble by frothing and so causing waste of the material ordinary carbonate of soda when hydrated soda crystals melts easily and gives off its water with ebullition it is unfit for use in assaying but when dried it can be used instead of the bicarbonate one part of the dried carbonate is equivalent to rather more than one and a half parts of the bicarbonate from two to four parts of the flux are amply sufficient to yield a fluid slag with one part of earthy matter this statement is also true of the fluxes which follow borax is a hydrated biborate of soda containing nearly half its weight of water when heated it swells up loses its water and fuses into a glass the swelling up may become a source of loss in the assay by pushing some of the contents out of the crucible to avoid this fused or dried borax may be used in which case a little more than half the amount of borax indicated will suffice borax will flux almost anything but it is especially valuable in fluxing lime c and metallic oxides as also in those cases in which it is desired to keep certain of the latter in the slag and out of the button of metal oxide of lead in the form of red lead or litharge is a valuable flux it easily dissolves those metallic oxides which are either infusible or difficultly fusible of themselves such as oxides of iron or copper the resulting slag is strongly basic and very corrosive no crucible will long withstand the attack of a fused mixture of oxides of lead and copper with silicates also it forms very fusible double silicates but in the absence of silicates and borates it has no action upon lime or magnesia whether the lead be added as litharge or as red lead it will exist in the slag as monoxide litharge the excess of oxygen of the red lead is thus available for oxidising purposes if this oxidising power is prejudicial it may be neutralised by mixing the red lead with 1 per cent of charcoal glass broken beakers and flasks cleaned dried and powdered will do it should be free from lead fluor fluorspar as free as possible from other minerals powdered it helps to flux phosphate of lime c and infusible silicates lime should be fresh and powdered it must not be slaked powdered white marble carbonate of lime will do but nearly double the quantity must be taken one part of lime produces the same effect as 18 parts of the carbonate of lime tartar and black flux are reducing agents as well as fluxes the black flux which may be obtained by heating tartar is a mixture of carbonate of potash and charcoal reducing agentsthe distinction between reducing agents and fluxes too often ignored is an important one fluxes yield slags reducing agents give buttons of regulus or of metal the action of a reducing agent is the separation of the oxygen or sulphur from the metal with which it is combined for example the mineral anglesite lead sulphate is a compound of lead sulphur and oxygen by carefully heating it with charcoal the oxygen is taken away by the charcoal and a regulus of lead sulphide remains if the regulus be then fused with metallic iron the sulphur is removed by the iron and metallic lead is left the charcoal and the iron are reducing agents but in defining a reducing agent as one which removes oxygen or sulphur from a metallic compound so as to set the metal free it must be remembered that sulphur itself will reduce metallic lead from fused litharge and that oxygen will similarly set free the metal in fused lead sulphide there is no impropriety in describing sulphur as a reducing agent but it is absurd to call oxygen one some confusion will be avoided if these substances and those which are opposite to them in property be classed as oxidising and deoxidising sulphurising and desulphurising agents most oxidising agents also act as desulphurisers the deoxidising agents most in use are the following charcoalpowdered wood charcoal it contains more or less hygroscopic moisture and about 3 or 4 per cent of ash the rest may be considered carbon carbon heated with metallic oxides takes the oxygen at low temperatures it forms carbon dioxide and at higher ones carbon monoxide other conditions besides that of temperature have an influence in producing these results and as the quantity of charcoal required to complete a definite reaction varies with these it should be calculated from the results of immediate experience rather than from theoretical considerations flourordinary wheat flour is convenient in use on being heated it gives off inflammable gases which have a certain reducing effect and a residue of finely divided carbon is left it is likely to vary in the quantity of moisture it contains two parts of flour should be used where one part of charcoal would be otherwise required tartarthis is crude hydric potassic tartrate the purified salt cream of tartar may be used on being heated it gives off inflammable gases and leaves a residue formed of potassic carbonate mixed with finely divided carbon five parts of tartar should be used in the place of one of charcoal anthracite or culm is a kind of coal containing 90 per cent or more of carbon it gives off no inflammable gas it is denser and takes longer in burning than charcoal its reducing effect is little inferior to that of charcoal almost any organic substance can be used as a reducing agent but it is well not to select one which melts swells up or gives off much water and gas when heated in the furnace potassic cyanide is an easily fusible and somewhat volatile salt which when fused readily removes oxygen and sulphur from metallic compounds and forms potassic cyanate or sulphocyanate as the case may be commercial samples vary much in purity some contain less than 50 per cent of the salt for assaying only the better qualities should be used iron is a desulphurising rather than a deoxidising agent iron is used in the form of rods 12inch in diameter or of nails or of hoop iron in the last case it should be thin enough to be bent without difficulty wrought iron crucibles are very useful in the processes required for making galena assays the chief oxidising agents which are also desulphurisers are the following nitre or potassic nitratethis salt fuses very easily to a watery liquid it oxidises most combustible substances with deflagration and thereby converts sulphides into sulphates arsenides into arsenates and most metals into oxides in the presence of strong bases such as soda the whole of the sulphur is fully oxidised but in many cases some arsenic is apt to escape and to give rise to a peculiar garliclike odour the sulphates of soda and potash are thus formed and float as a watery liquid on the surface of the slag red lead is an oxide of lead about onequarter of its oxygen is very loosely held and hence is available for oxidising purposes without any separation of metallic lead the rest of the oxygen is also available but for each part of oxygen given off about 13 parts of metallic lead are deposited in silver assays this power of readily giving up oxygen is made use of the residual oxide litharge acts as a flux hot air is the oxidising agent in roasting operations the sulphur and arsenic of such minerals as mispickel and pyrites are oxidised by the hot air and pass off as sulphur dioxide and white arsenic the metals generally remain in the form of oxide mixed with more or less sulphate and arsenate the residue may remain as a powdery substance a calx in which case the process of roasting is termed calcination or it may be a pasty mass or liquid in the calcination of somewhat fusible minerals the roasting should be done at a low temperature to avoid clotting arsenic and sulphur being with difficulty burnt off from the clotted mineral a low temperature however favours the formation of sulphates and these if not removed would reappear in a subsequent reduction as sulphides these sulphates may be decomposed by a higher temperature towards the end of the operation their removal is rendered more certain by rubbing up the calx with some culm and reroasting or by strongly heating the calx after the addition of solid ammonic carbonate in roasting operations as large a surface of the substance as possible should be exposed to the air if done in a crucible the crucible should be of the cornish type short and open not long and narrow for calcinations roasting dishes are useful these are broad and shallow not unlike saucers but unglazed in those cases in which the products of the roasting are liquid at the temperature used a scorifier fig 38 is suitable if it is desired to keep the liquid but if the liquid is best drained off as quickly as it is formed a cupel fig 5 should be used illustration fig 5 a scorifier is essentially a roasting dish sufficiently thick to resist for a time the corrosive action of the fused metallic oxides it is to contain the essential property of a cupel is that it is sufficiently porous to allow the fused oxide to drain into it as fast as it is formed it should be large enough to absorb the whole of the liquid and of course must be made of a material upon which the liquid has no corrosive action cupels do not bear transport well hence the assayer generally has to make them or to supervise their making a quantity of bone ash is carefully mixed with water so that no lumps are formed and the mixture is then worked up by rubbing between the hands the bone ash is sufficiently wet when its cohesion is such that it can be pressed into a lump and yet be easily crumbled into powder cupel moulds should be purchased they are generally made of turned iron or brass they consist of three parts 1 a hollow cylinder 2 a disc of metal and 3 a piston for compressing the bone ash and shaping the top of the cupel the disc forms a false bottom for the cylinder this is put in its place and the cylinder filled or nearly so with the moistened bone ash the bone ash is then pressed into shape with the piston and the cupel finished with the help of three or four smart blows from a mallet before removing the piston turn it halfway round upon its axis so as to loosen and smooth the face of the cupel the cupel is got out by pressing up the disc of metal forming the false bottom the removal is more easily effected if the mould is somewhat conical instead of cylindrical in form the cupels are put in a warm place to dry for two or three days a conveniently sized cupel is 114 inches in diameter and about 34 inch high the cavity of the cupel is about 14 inch deep and something of the shape shown in fig 5 illustration fig 6 illustration fig 7 illustration fig 8 there are two kinds of furnaces required the wind and muffle furnaces these are built of brick firebrick of course being used for the lining they are connected with a chimney that will provide a good draught figure 6 shows a section of the wind furnace fig 7 a section of the muffle furnace and fig 8 a general view of a group comprising a muffle and two wind furnaces suitable for general work when in operation the furnaces are covered with ironbound tiles the opening under the door of the muffle is closed with a loosely fitting brick the floor of the muffle is protected with a layer of boneash which absorbs any oxide of lead that may be accidentally spilt the fire bars should be easily removable few tools are wanted the most important are some castiron moulds tongs fig 9 stirrers for calcining fig 10 and light tongs of a special form for handling scorifiers and cupels see silver illustration fig 9 illustration fig 10 the coke used should be of good quality the formation of a fused ash clinker in any quantity causes ceaseless trouble and requires frequent removal the coke should be broken into lumps of a uniform size about 2 in across before being brought into the office the furnace should be well packed by stirring raising the coke and not ramming it and it should be uniformly heated not hot below and cold above in lighting a furnace a start is made with wood and charcoal this readily ignites and sets fire to the coke which of itself does not kindle easily in commencing work add if necessary fresh coke and mix well make hollows and into these put old crucibles pack around with coke so that the surface shall be concave sloping upwards from the mouths of the crucibles to the sides of the furnace close the furnace and when uniformly heated substitute for the empty crucibles those which contain the assays it is rarely advisable to have a very hot fire at first because with a gradual heat the gases and steam quietly escape through the unfused mass while with too strong a heat these might make some of the matter in the crucible overflow moreover if the heat should be too strong at first the flux might melt and run to the bottom of the crucible leaving the quartz c as a pasty mass above with a gentler heat combination is completed and the subsequent fiercer heat simply melts the fusible compound into homogeneous slag the fused material may be left in the crucible and separated from it by breaking when cold it is generally more convenient to pour it into castiron moulds these moulds should be dry and smooth they act best when warmed and oiled or blackleaded air entering through the firebars of a furnace and coming in contact with hot coke combines with it forming a very hot mixture of carbonic acid and nitrogen this ascending comes in contact with more coke and the carbonic acid is reduced to carbonic oxide at the top of the furnace or in the flue the carbonic oxide meeting fresh air combines with the oxygen therein and reforms carbonic acid in the first and third of these reactions much heat is evolved in the second the furnace is cooled a little it must always be remembered that the carbonic oxide of the furnace gases is a reducing agent when these gases are likely to exert a prejudicial effect and a strongly oxidising atmosphere is required the work is best done in a muffle footnotes 3 there is an exception to this as when the slag is liable to be acted on when exposed to the air and to the gases of the furnace in this case a layer of fused common salt floating on the slag so as to protect it from the air and furnace gases is a distinct advantage chapter iii wet gravimetric methods in dry assays the metal is almost always separated and weighed as metal in wet gravimetric assays the metal is more usually weighed in the form of a definite compound of known composition the general methods of working resemble those of ordinary chemical analysis and their successful working is greatly helped by a knowledge of at any rate those compounds of the metal which enable it to be separated and of those which are the most convenient forms in which it can be weighed but the work of the assayer differs from that of the analyst inasmuch as the bulk of his estimations are made upon material of practically the same kind varying only in richness consequently in assaying it is possible and necessary to work on such a definite plan as will involve the least amount of labour in weighing and calculating the assayer connected with mining has generally two classes of material to deal with those comparatively rich and those comparatively poor for example silver in bullion and in ores copper precipitates or regulus and copper ores and slags and black tin and tin ores he is only occasionally called on to assay the intermediate products it is indispensable that he should have an approximate knowledge of the substance to be determined with new ores this information is best got by a qualitative testing knowing that only certain bodies are present it is evident that the number of separations can be reduced and that simple methods can be devised for arriving at the results sought for the best method is that which involves the least number of separations the reactions must be sharp and complete and yet not be liable to error under varying conditions to bring the richer and poorer materials under the same conditions for the assay a small weight say 1 gram of the richer and a larger weight 5 or 10 grams of the poorer substance is weighed up a method is then adopted which will concentrate the whole of the metal either during or after solution in a product which need not necessarily be pure the work on this product is comparatively easy in separating small quantities of a substance from a large bulk of impurities the group separations must not as a rule be too much relied on very large precipitates carry down small quantities of bodies not belonging to the group more especially when there is a tendency to form weak double compounds the redissolving and reprecipitating of bulky precipitates should be avoided when a large number of assays of the same kind have to be carried out a plan something like the following is adoptedthe samples after having been dried are placed in order on a table at the left hand of the assayer he takes the first marks it with a number samples and weighs up the quantity required and transfers it to a flask which is similarly marked as the weighings are finished the samples are placed in the same order on his right hand the assistant takes the flasks in batches of four or five at a time to the fume cupboard where he adds a measured quantity of acid when solution has been effected dilution with a measured volume is generally necessary the assayer sees to this and whilst the funnels and filters are being prepared makes any separation that is necessary the filters are arranged in order on a rack fig 11 and need not be marked unless the precipitates or residues have subsequently to be dried the filters are washed with hot water and if the filtrates are wanted flasks are placed beneath if not the solution is drained off down the sink precipitation or reduction or whatever it may be is now made the assistant filters the prepared samples one at a time whilst the assayer is engaged with the others the same style of work is continued until the assays are completed if one should be spoiled it is better to allow it to stand over for assaying along with the next batch if one filters slowly or is in any way less forward than the rest it may lessen the accuracy of the other assays owing to oxidation c it should therefore be put on one side the assays are dealt with in batches of ten or twenty so that a large quantity of work can be quickly finished illustration fig 11 when the assays are finished it is the duty of the assistant to clean the apparatus with reagents if necessary and to put the vessels in the place set apart for them flasks are best kept inverted on a rack so that they may be dry and clean by the next morning berlin crucibles must be cleaned and ignited the amount of apparatus employed should be as little as is feasible the assay should be carried out as much as possible in the same flask the bench must be clean and altogether free from apparatus not in actual use crucibles and dishes in which weighings are made should be marked with numbers or letters and their weights recorded together with the date of weighing in a small ledger which is kept in the drawer of the balance by this means a record of the wear of each piece of apparatus is obtained and what is more important much weighing is saved and increased confidence is gained the weight of each piece of apparatus need not be taken daily it will be seen from the record in the book and a knowledge of the use it has been put to how often a checking of the weight is necessary the entries are made in black lead as follows dish a feb 3 94210 grams 5 94225 6 94230 7 94200 platinum vessels and apparatus lose and porcelain ones slightly gain weight with continued use the special details of the work is given under each assay certain general instructions will be given here solutionit is not always necessary to get the whole of the mineral in solution provided the body sought for is either completely dissolved or altogether left in the residue it is often only by a qualitative examination of the solution or residue as the case may be that the assayer can satisfy himself that it is free from the substance sought but previous experience with the same kind of ore will show to what extent this testing is necessary solution is generally best effected in flasks but where the resulting liquid has afterwards to be evaporated to dryness and ignited evaporating dishes fig 12 are used with them clock glasses are used as covers during solution to avoid loss through effervescence evaporating dishes are also best when an insoluble residue has to be collected since it is difficult to wash out most residues from a flask bumping occurs less frequently in dishes than in flasks illustration fig 12 after the addition of the acid and mixing by agitation the vessel containing the substance is heated this is best done on the hot plate fig 13 this consists of a slab of cast iron about half or threequarters of an inch thick supported on loose fire bricks and heated by two or three ring burners figs 14 and 15 the burners are connected to the gas supply by means of lead tubing to which they are soldered flasks and dishes after being put on the plate are not further handled until solution is complete or the evaporation is carried to dryness the hot plate is contained in a cupboard so as to be out of the reach of cold draughts illustration fig 13 illustration fig 14 illustration fig 15 the action of the acids and other solvents is described in the chapter on reagents precipitationin precipitating add sufficient of the reagent to complete the reaction the student must be on his guard against adding a very large excess which is the commoner error in some reactions the finishing point is obvious enough either no more precipitate is formed or a precipitate is completely dissolved or some wellmarked colour or odour is developed or removed in those cases in which there is no such indication theoretical considerations should keep the use of reagents within reasonable limits the solutions of the reagents see reagents are generally of five or ten per cent strength a small excess over that demanded by theory should be sufficient illustration fig 16 illustration fig 17 illustration fig 18 illustration fig 19 filtrationsolutions are best filtered hot whenever the assay allows of this being so done the precipitate should be allowed to settle and the clear liquid decanted on the filter with the aid of a glass rod if necessary the filterpaper must not be too large but at the same time it must not be overloaded with the precipitate there should be ample room for washing for general use three sizes of filterpaper are sufficient common quick filteringpaper english is best for most work in assaying the specially prepared paper swedish or rhenish is used for collecting those precipitates which have to be weighed the papers are folded as shown in fig 16 and should not project above the funnel the filterpaper works better if damped with hot water in special cases filtering is hastened by means of an airpump the apparatus used consists of a waterjet fig 17 which is connected with the tap as also with a bottle fitted as shown in fig 18 the pump draws the air out from the bottle and atmospheric pressure forces the liquid through the filterpaper the bottom of the funnel is provided with a platinum cone which supports the filterpaper and prevents its breaking the pump is only used in exceptional cases nearly all the filtrations required by the assayer can be made without it the usual methods of supporting the funnel during filtration are shown in fig 19 where the filtrate is not wanted pickle bottles make convenient supports after the precipitate has been thrown on the filter it is washed in washing several washings with a small quantity of water are more effective than a few with a larger quantity of that fluid the upper edge of the filterpaper is specially liable to escape complete washing excessive washing must be avoided the point at which the washing is complete is found by collecting a little of the filtrate and testing it the precipitate is removed from the filterpaper for further treatment by opening out the paper and by washing the precipitate with a jet of water from a washbottle into a beaker or back through the funnel into the flask in some cases when the precipitate has to be dissolved in anything in which it is readily soluble solution is effected in the filter itself allowing the liquid to run through as it is formed drying and ignitingprecipitates as a rule require drying before being ignited with small precipitates the filterpaper may be opened out and placed on a warm asbestos slab till dry or the funnel and the filter with the precipitate is placed in a warm place and supported by any convenient means the heat must never be sufficient to char the paper some precipitates must be dried at a temperature not higher than 100 c these are placed in the wateroven fig 20 and when apparently dry they are taken from the funnel placed between glasses and then left in the oven till they cease to lose weight such precipitates are collected on tared filters those precipitates which will stand a higher temperature are dried in the hotair oven at a temperature of from 120 to 150 the drying is continued until they appear to be free from moisture and until the precipitate ceases to adhere to the filter in drying sulphides the heat must not be raised to the melting point of sulphur since if there is any free sulphur present it fuses and filters through illustration fig 20 the precipitate having been dried is transferred to a watchglass the filterpaper is opened out over a sheet of notepaper and with a camelhair brush the precipitate is gently brought into the glass most precipitates come away easily and the transfer can be made without apparent loss the watchglass is covered by the funnel and the filterpaper folded into a quadrant held by the tweezers and set fire to with the flame of a bunsen burner it is allowed to burn over the crucible into which the black bulky ash is allowed to drop and two or three drops of nitric acid are then added the crucible is placed on a pipestem triangle fig 21 supported on a tripod it is at first heated gently with a bunsen burner and afterwards more strongly until the residue is free from carbon it is cooled and treated with any acid necessary to convert the small amount of precipitate into the state in which it is to be weighed heated again and cooled the main precipitate is transferred to the crucible and the heating repeated very gently at first but more strongly towards the end of the operation it is next placed in the muffle and after two or three minutes at a red heat it is removed and allowed to cool in the desiccator before weighing this is for bodies that will bear a red heat for those compounds that require a lower temperature the heating in the muffle is omitted the muffle used for this purpose must not be used at the same time for cupelling a gas muffle fig 22 such as one of fletchers is best a desiccator fig 23 is an airtight vessel which prevents access of moisture c to the substance usually the air in it is kept dry by means of a basin containing sulphuric acid illustration fig 21 illustration fig 22 illustration fig 23 the crucible is removed from the muffle with the tongs and carried to the desiccator it is best in an office to have a large desiccator permanently fixed alongside the balance into which all substances may be put before being weighed the substance is removed from the bench or muffle in the small hand apparatus generally sold and carried to the balance room to be transferred to the large desiccator where it is allowed to become thoroughly cold before being weighed twenty minutes is generally the time allowed after ignition before it is advisable to weigh bodies allowed to cool in the air after they have been ignited will absorb moisture and hot bodies placed in the balancepan will disturb the equilibrium and show false results compounds that absorb moisture must be weighed quickly they should therefore be weighed in covered vessels such compounds are detected by their continuallyincreasing weight they should be ignited and weighed again in a wellcovered dish substances that have been washed with alcohol ether or any readily volatile liquid are dried in the water oven they quickly dry if there is no water present and are generally fit for weighing in less than one hour sometimes drying for a few minutes only will be sufficient the weight of the crucible and precipitate having been obtained the weight of the crucible and ash is deducted for example crucible and precipitate 10183 grams crucible and ash 9527 0656 the weight of the ash is best added to that of the crucible the amount of ash in filterpapers must not be neglected although papers are now made almost free from ash and the amount to be deducted is found by taking eight or ten papers and burning them until they become white and then weighing the ash the amount varies from 0004 to 00005 gram for different papers having determined the ash place in the balancedrawer three of the filterpapers pinned together with the weights marked on them in the way shown in fig 24 so as to be readily seen when there is occasion to refer to them illustration fig 24 it must be remembered that the determination of small quantities of substances generally involves the use of reagents which are often contaminated as an impurity with the body sought for thus in assaying silver the oxide of lead or metallic lead used is rarely free from silver and in the case of arsenic the acids zinc or ferric chloride are sure to contain arsenic the same observation applies to the precipitation of lead by zinc c the errors caused by these impurities are more marked in the determination of material having small quantities of metal than in that of ores which contain larger quantities errors of this kind are counteracted or neutralised by blank or blind determinations these consist in carrying out by the side of and during the assay a duplicate experiment with the reagents only which are thereby subjected to the same processes of solution evaporation filtration c the final result thus obtained is deducted from that given by the assay the difference gives the corrected result in some cases where it is desired or necessary to have a tangible residue or precipitate some pure inert material is added chapter iv volumetric assays these have been already described as those in which the results are got by measuring either1 the volume of a reagent required to complete some reaction or 2 the volume of the resulting product for example if a permanganate of potash solution be added to a solution containing a weighed amount of iron dissolved in sulphuric acid the strong colour of the permanganate of potash will be removed until a certain quantity of it has been added repeating the experiment it will be found that the same amount of iron decolorises the same volume of the permanganate solution within certain narrow limits of variation known as error of experiment this error is due to variation in the method of working and to slight differences in the weighings and measurings it is present in all experimental methods although the limits of variation are wider in some than in others apart from this error of experiment however it is certain that a given volume of the permanganate of potash solution corresponds to a definite weight of iron so that if either is known the other may be calculated similarly if a known weight of zinc or of carbonate of lime be dissolved in hydrochloric acid a gas will be given off which can be measured and so long as the conditions of the experiment do not vary the same weight of zinc or of carbonate of lime gives off the same volume of gas the weight of the one can be determined from the volume of the other or again the quantity of some substances may be measured by the colour of their solutions on the principle that other things being equal the colour of a solution depends upon the quantity of colouring matter present so that if two solutions of the same substance are equally coloured they are of equal strength in this way an unknown may be compared with a known strength and a fairly accurate determination may be made these three illustrations serve as types of the three chief classes of volumetric assaystitrometric gasometric and colorimetric titrometric assayswithin the limits of the error of experiment a definite volume of a solution or gas represents a certain weight of metal or other substance hence the exact weight may be determined by experiment the error of experiment may be reduced to insignificant dimensions by repeating the experiment and taking the mean of three or four determinations this will at the same time show the amount of variation thus if 05 gram of iron were dissolved and found to require 503 cubic centimetres of the solution of permanganate of potash and if on repeating 504 502 and 503 cc were required the experimenter would be justified in saying that 503 cc of the permanganate solution represent 05 gram of iron and that his results were good within 02 cc of the permanganate solution so that if in an unknown solution of iron 505 cc of the permanganate solution were used up he could state with confidence that it contained a little more than 05 gram of iron with a larger experience the confidence would increase and with practice the experimental error will diminish but supposing that the unknown solution required say 1005 instead of 505 cc he would not be justified in saying that since 503 cc are equivalent to 05 gram 1006 cc are equivalent to twice that amount and that consequently the unknown solution contained a little less than 1 gram of iron or at least he could not say it except he or some one else had determined it by experiment but if on dissolving 1 gram of iron he found it to require 1006 cc of the solution and in another experiment with 08 gram of iron that 805 cc of the solution were required he would be justified in stating that the volume of solution required is proportional to the quantity of metal present there are a large number of volumetric assays of which this is true but that it is true in any particular case can only be proved by experiment even where true it is well not to rest too much weight upon it and in all cases the quantity of metal taken to determine the strength of the solution used should not differ widely from that present in the assay there are certain terms which should be explained here when the solution of a reagent is applied under such conditions that the volume added can be correctly determined the operation is called titrating the solution of the reagent used the standard solution and the process of determining the strength of the standard solution is standardising the standard is the quantity of metal equivalent to 100 cc of the standard solution standard solutionsin making these the salt is accurately weighed and transferred to a litre flask or to the graduated cylinder and dissolved the method of dissolving it varies in special cases and instructions for these will be found under the respective assays generally it is dissolved in a small quantity of liquid and then diluted to the mark for those substances that require the aid of heat the solution is made in a pint flask cooled and transferred after which the flask is well washed out after dilution the liquids in the measuring vessel must be thoroughly mixed by shaking this is more easily and better done in the cylinder than in the litre flask the solution is next transferred to a dry winchester bottle and labelled the label may be rendered permanent by waxing it standard solutions should not be kept in a place exposed to direct sunlight oxidising and reducing solutions such as those of permanganate of potash ferrous sulphate iodine hyposulphite of soda c gradually weaken in strength the solutions of other salts are more stable while those of potassium bichromate and baric chloride are almost permanent solutions of potassium permanganate may be kept for a month or so without much change the solutions of hyposulphite of soda and of iodine should be examined weekly ferrous sulphate solutions if acidulated with sulphuric acid may be depended on for two or three weeks without fresh standardising before filling the burette the winchester bottle should be well shaken and a portion of about 50 or 100 cc poured into a dry beaker or testglass besides the standard solutions which are required for titrating an assay permanent solutions of the metal or acid of equivalent strength are very useful when the finishing point of a titration has been overstepped ie the assay has been overdone a measured volume say 5 or 10 cc of a solution containing the same metal may be added the titration can then be continued but more cautiously and the value in cc for the quantity added be deducted from the final reading standardisingsuppose the object is to standardise a solution of permanganate similar to that referred to above a convenient quantity of iron say 05 gram would be weighed out dissolved in dilute sulphuric acid and the solution titrated suppose 496 cc of the permanganate solution are required then 496 05 100 x x 1008 gram this result 1008 gram is the standard when a gas is measured the standard may be calculated in the same way for example with 0224 gram of zinc 758 cc of gas were obtained then the quantity of zinc equivalent to 100 cc of the gas is got by the proportion 758 0224 100 x x 02955 gram using the term standard in this sense the following rules hold good to find the weight of metal in a given substancemultiply the standard by the number of cc used and divide by 100 for example a piece of zinc was dissolved and the gas evolved measured 739 cc then by the rule 02955739100 should give the weight of the piece of zinc this gives 02184 gram to find the percentage of metal in a given substancemultiply the standard by the number of cc used and divide by the weight of substance taken for example if 2 grams of a mineral were taken and if on titrating with the permanganate solution standard 1008 604 cc were required then 10086042 3044 this is the percentage if the standard is exactly 1 gram and 1 gram of ore is always taken these calculations become very simple the cc used give at once the percentage or divided by 100 give the weight of metal if it is desired to have a solution with a standard exactly 10 gram it is best first to make one rather stronger than this and then to standardise carefully divide 1000 by the standard thus obtained and the result will be the number of cc which must be taken and be diluted with water to 1 litre for example suppose the standard is 1008 then 10001008 gives 992 and if 992 cc be taken and diluted with water to 1000 cc a solution of the desired strength will be obtained the standard of this should be confirmed a simpler calculation for the same purpose is to multiply the standard by 1000 this will give the number of cc to which 1 litre of the solution should be diluted in the above example a litre should be diluted to 1008 cc it has been assumed in these rules that the titration has yielded proportional results but these are not always obtained there can be no doubt that in any actual reaction the proportion between any two reagents is a fixed one and that if we double one of these then exactly twice as much of the other will enter into the reaction but in the working it may very well be that no reaction at all will take place until after a certain excess of one or of both of the reagents is present in titrating lead with a chromate of potash solution for example it is possible that at the end of the titration a small quantity of the lead may remain unacted on and it is certain that a small excess of the chromate is present in the solution so too in precipitating a solution of silver with a standard solution of common salt a point is reached at which a small quantity of each remains in solution a further addition either of silver or of salt will cause a precipitate and a similar phenomenon has been observed in precipitating a hydrochloric acid solution of a sulphate with baric chloride the excess of one or other of the reagents may be large or small or in some cases they may neutralise each other considerations like these emphasise the necessity for uniformity in the mode of working whether a process yields proportional results or not will be seen from a series of standardisings having obtained these the results should be arranged as in the table placing the quantities of metal used in the order of weight in the first column the volumes measured in the second and the standards calculated in the third if the results are proportional these standards will vary more or less according to the delicacy of the process but there will be no apparent order in the variation the average of the standards should then be taken weight volume found standard 02160 gram 729 cc 02963 02185 739 02957 02365 799 02959 02440 823 02964 02555 859 02974 any inclination that may be felt for obtaining an appearance of greater accuracy by ignoring the last result must be resisted for although it would make no practical difference whether the mean standard is taken as 02961 or 02963 it is well not to ignore the possibility that an error of 04 cc may arise a result should only be ignored when the cause of its variation is known in this series the results are proportional but the range of weights 021602555 gram is small all processes yield fairly proportional results if the quantities vary within narrow limits as to results which are not proportional it is best to take some imaginary examples and then to apply the lesson to an actual one a series of titrations of a copper solution by means of a solution of potassic cyanide gave the following results copper taken cyanide used standard 01 gram 119 cc 08403 02 237 08438 03 356 08426 04 476 08403 these are proportional but by using a larger quantity of acid and ammonia in the work preliminary to titration we might have had to use 1 cc of cyanide solution more in each case before the finishing point was reached the results would then have been copper taken cyanide used standard 01 gram 129 cc 07752 02 247 08097 03 366 08191 04 486 08230 it will be noted that the value of the standard increases with the weight of metal used and calculations from the mean standard will be incorrect by subtracting the lowest standardising from the highest a third result is got free from any error common to the other two thus 04 gram 486 cc cyanide 01 129 03 357 and the standard calculated from this corrected result is 08404 further if 03 gram requires 357 cc then 01 gram should require 119 cc or 10 cc less than that actually found we may therefore use the following rules for working processes which do not yield proportional results make a series of two or three titrations using very different quantities of metal in each subtract the lowest of these from the highest and calculate the standard with the remainder calculate the volume required by this standard in any case and find the excess or deficit as the case may be if an excess subtract it from the result of each titration if a deficit add it and use the standard in the usual way the following table shows an actual example chalk taken gas obtained standard 00873 gram 178 cc 04904 01305 273 04780 01690 358 04721 01905 404 04715 02460 525 04686 03000 640 04687 it will be seen that the standard decreases as the quantity of chalk increases this points to a deficiency in the quantity of gas evolved then 03000 640 cc 00873 178 02127 462 and 02127100462 04604 then multiplying the weight of chalk taken by 100 and dividing by 04604 we get the calculated results of the following table chalk taken gas found gas calculated difference 00873 gram 178 cc 189 cc 11 cc 01305 273 283 10 01690 358 367 09 01905 404 414 10 02460 525 534 09 03000 640 651 11 by adding 1 cc to the quantity of gas obtained and taking 04604 as the standard the calculated results will agree with those found with a variation of 01 cc when a large number of assays of the same kind are being made this method of calculation is convenient when however only one or two determinations are in question it is easier to make a couple of standardisings taking quantities as nearly as possible the same as those present in the assays sometimes it is necessary to draw up a table which will show without calculation the weight of substance equivalent to a given volume of gas or of solution the substance used for standardising should be whenever possible a pure sample of the substance to be determinedthat is for copper assays pure copper should be used for iron assays pure iron and so on but when this cannot be got an impure substance may be used provided it contains a known percentage of the metal and that the impurities present are not such as will interfere with the accuracy of the assay including compounds with these the standard may be calculated by multiplying the standard got in the usual way by the percentage of metal in the compound or impure substance and dividing by 100 if for example the standard 1008 gram was obtained by using a sample of iron containing 997 per cent of metal the corrected standard would be 1008997100 1005 in volumetric analysis the change brought about must be one in which the end of the reaction is rendered prominent either by a change of colour or by the presence or absence of a precipitate if the end of the reaction or finishingpoint is not of itself visible then it must be rendered visible by the use of a third reagent called an indicator for example the action of sulphuric acid upon soda results in nothing which makes the action conspicuous if however litmus or phenolphthalein be added the change from blue to red in the first case or from red to colourless in the second renders the finishingpoint evident some indicators cannot be added to the assay solution without spoiling the result in which case portions of the assay solution must be withdrawn from time to time and tested this withdrawal of portions of the assay solution if rashly done must result in loss if however the solution is not concentrated and if the portions are only withdrawn towards the end of the titration the loss is very trifling and will not showup on the result the usual plan adopted is to have a solution of the indicator placed in drops at fairly equal intervals distributed over a clean and dry white porcelainplate a drop or two of the solution to be tested is then brought in contact with one of these and the effect noted another plan is to have thin blottingpaper moistened with a solution of the indicator and dried a drop of the solution to be tested placed on this shows the characteristic change when the assay solution contains a suspended solid which interferes with the test a prepared paper covered with an ordinary filterpaper answers very well a drop of the solution to be tested is placed on the filterpaper and sinking through shows its effect on the paper below except when otherwise stated all titrations should be made at the ordinary temperature cooling if necessary by holding the flask under the tap when a titration is directed to be made in a boiling solution it must be remembered that the standard solution is cold and that every addition lowers the temperature of the assay on running the solution from the burette into the assay do not let it run down the side of the flask if a portion of the assay has to be withdrawn for testing shake the flask to ensure mixing and then take out a drop with the testrod the neglect of these precautions may give a finishingpoint too early this is generally indicated by a sudden finish in which case on shaking the flask and again testing no reaction is got do not remove the drop on the point of the burette with the testrod let it remain where it is or drop it into the solution by carefully opening the clip generally the methods of working are as follows 1 when the finishingpoint depends on a change of colour in the solutionincrease the bulk of the assay up to from 100 to 150 cc with water boil or cool as the case may be run in the standard solution from a burette speedily until the reagent appears to have a slower action and shake or stir all the time then run 1 cc or so at a time still stirring and finally add drops until the colour change is got 2 when an outsideindicator is usedpour the standard solution from a burette into the assay until 5 or 6 cc from the finishingpoint then run in 1 cc at a time stirring and testing on the plate between each until the indicator shows the change wanted and deduct 05 cc for excess when greater accuracy is sought for a duplicate assay is made in this case the standard solution is run in close up to the end and the operation is finished off with a few drops at a time 3 where the finishingpoint depends upon the absence of a precipitate and no outsideindicator is usedas in the last case run in the standard solution up to within a few cc of the end then run in 1 cc at a time until a precipitate is no longer formed but here 15 cc must be deducted for excess since it is evident that the whole of the last cc must have been and a portion of the previous one may have been in excess indirect titrationthe action of permanganate of potash upon a ferrous solution is one of oxidation hence it is evident that if any other oxidising agent is present it will count as permanganate in such a case the titration can be used indirectly to estimate the quantity of such oxidising agent by determining how much less of the permanganate is used for example suppose that 1 gram of iron dissolved in sulphuric acid requires 100 cc of standard permanganate to fully oxidise it but that the same amount of iron only requires 356 cc of the same standard permanganate if it has been previously heated with 05 gram of black oxide of manganese here it is evident that 05 gram of black oxide does the work of 644 cc4 of the permanganate solution and that these quantities are equivalent moreover if 644 cc correspond with 05 gram then 100 cc correspond with 07764 which is the standard on theoretical grounds and by a method of calculation which will be explained further on under the heading calculations from formul it can be found that if the standard for iron is 1 gram that for the black oxide will be 07764 gram the principles of these indirect titrations become clearer when expressed in a condensed form thus in the example selected and using the formul fe iron kmno4 permanganate of potash and mno2 oxide of manganese we have 1 1 gram fe 100 cc kmno4 2 1 gram fe 356 cc kmno4 05 gram mno2 100 cc kmno4 356 cc kmno4 05 gram mno2 100356 cc kmno4 05 gram mno2 644 cc kmno4 05 gram mno2 the iron does not enter into the calculation if the same quantity is present in the two experiments an indirect titration thus requires three determinations but if more than one assay is to be carried on two of these need not be repeated the standard is calculated in the usual way colorimetric assaysthese are assays in which the colour imparted to a solution by some compound of the metal to be determined is taken advantage of the depth of colour depending on the quantity of metal present they are generally used for the determination of such small quantities as are too minute to be weighed the method of working is as followsa measured portion of the assay solution generally 23 12 13 or 14 of the whole coloured by the substance to be estimated is placed in a white glass cylinder standing on a sheet of white paper or glazed porcelain into an exactly similar cylinder is placed the same amount of reagents c as the portion of the assay solution contains and then water is added until the solutions are of nearly equal bulk next a standard solution of the metal being estimated is run in from a burette the mixture being stirred after each addition until the colour approaches that of the assay the bulk of the two solutions is equalised by adding water then more standard solution is added until the tints are very nearly alike next the amount added is read off from the burette still more is poured in until the colour is slightly darker than that of the assay and the burette read off again the mean of the readings is taken and gives the quantity of metal added it equals the quantity of metal in the portion of the assay if this portion was onehalf of the whole multiply by two if onethird multiply by three and so on when the quantity of metal in very dilute solutions is to be determined it is sometimes necessary to concentrate the solutions by boiling them down before applying the reagent which produces the coloured compound such concentration does not affect the calculations gasometric assaysgasometric methods are not much used by assayers and therefore those students who wish to study them more fully than the limits of this work will permit are recommended to consult winkler and lunges textbook on the subject the methods are without doubt capable of a more extended application in measuring liquids ordinary variations of temperature have but little effect and variations of atmospheric pressure have none at all whereas with gases it is different thus 100 cc of an ordinary aqueous solution would if heated from 10 c to 20 c expand to about 10015 cc 100 cc of a gas similarly warmed would expand to about 1035 cc and a fall of one inch in the barometer would have a very similar effect and in measuring gases we have not only to take into account variations in volume due to changes in temperature and atmospheric pressure but also that which is observed when a gas is measured wet and dry water gives off vapour at all temperatures but the amount of vapour is larger as the temperature increases by ignoring these considerations errors of 3 or 4 per cent are easily made but fortunately the corrections are simple and it is easy to construct a piece of apparatus by means of which they may be reduced to a simple calculation by the rule of three the volume of a gas is in practice usually reduced to that which it would be at a temperature of 0 c when the column of mercury in the barometer is 760 mm high but although convenient this practice is not always necessary the only thing required is some way of checking the variations in volume and of calculating what the corrected volume would be under certain fixed conditions suppose that at the time a series of standardisings is being made 100 cc of air were confined in a graduated tube over moist mercury these 100 cc would vary in volume from day to day but it would always be true of them that they would measure 100 cc under the same conditions as those under which the standardisings were made if then in making an actual assay 354 cc of gas were obtained and the air in the tube measured 105 cc we should be justified in saying that if the conditions had been those of the standardising the 105 cc would have measured 100 cc and the 354 cc would have been 337 for 105 100 354 337 the rule for using such a piece of apparatus for correcting volumes ismultiply the cc of gas obtained by 100 and divide by the number of cc of air in the apparatus if it is desired to calculate the volumes under standard conditions that is the gas dry at 0 c and 760 mm barometric pressure the calculations are easily performed but the temperature and pressure must be known correction for moisturethe vapour tension of water has been accurately determined for various temperatures and it may be looked upon as counteracting the barometric pressure for example at 15 c the vapour tension equals 127 millimetres of mercury if the barometer stood at 750 mm the correction for moisture would be made by subtracting 127 from 750 and taking 7373 mm to be the true barometric pressure the vapour tensions for temperatures from 0 c to 20 c are as follows temp tension temp tension temp tension 0 46 mm 7 75 mm 14 119 mm 1 49 mm 8 80 mm 15 127 mm 2 53 mm 9 86 mm 16 135 mm 3 57 mm 10 92 mm 17 144 mm 4 61 mm 11 98 mm 18 153 mm 5 65 mm 12 105 mm 19 163 mm 6 70 mm 13 112 mm 20 174 mm the correction for pressure ismultiply the volume by the actual pressure and divide by 760 the correction for temperaturemultiply the volume by 273 and divide by the temperature in degrees centigrade added to 273 for all three corrections the following rules hold good to reduce to 0 c and 760 mm dry volume

resulting volume pressure tension as an example we will suppose that it is desired to enclose in the apparatus referred to on p 45 a volume of air which when dry at 0 c and 760 mm shall measure 100 cc

644 chapter v weighing and measuring weighingthe system of weights and measures which we have adopted is the french or metric system in this the gram 1543 grains is the unit of weight the only other weight frequently referred to is the milligram which is 0001 or 11000 gram the unit of volume is the cubic centimetre which is approximately the volume of 1 gram of water and which thus bears to the gram the same relation as grainmeasures bear to grains it is usual to write and even pronounce cubic centimetre shortly as cc and the only other denomination of volume we shall have occasion to use is the litre which measures 1000 cc and is roughly 134 pints the weights used are kept in boxes in a definite order so that the weights on the balance can be counted as well by noting those which are absent from the box as by counting those present on the scalepan the weights run 50 20 10 10 5 2 1 1 and 1 grams and are formed of brass the fractions of the gram are generally made of platinum or of aluminium and are arranged in the following order05 02 01 01 and 005 002 001 001 these may be marked in this way or they may be marked 500 200 100 100 50 20 10 10 the 500 meaning 500 milligrams some makers send out weights in the series 50 20 20 10 c weights of less than 001 gram are generally present in a box but it is much more convenient to work with a rider this is a piece of wire which in the pan weighs 001 gram it is made in such a form that it will ride on the beam and its effective weight decreases as it approaches the centre if the arm of the beam is divided into tenths then each tenth counting from the centre outward equals 0001 gram or 1 milligram and if these tenths be further subdivided the fractions of a milligram are obtained and these give figures in the fourth place of decimals a fairly good balance should be sensitive to 00001 gram the weights must never be touched with the fingers and the forceps for moving them is used for no other purpose when not in actual use the box is kept closed the weights must not be allowed to remain on the pan of the balance the balancecase must not be open without some reason it must be fixed level and once fixed must not be needlessly moved the bench on which it stands should be used for no other purpose and no one should be allowed to lean upon it illustration fig 25 when using a balance sit directly in front of it ordinarily the substance to be weighed is best put on the pan to the users left the weights and the rider are then easily manipulated powders c should not be weighed directly on the balance a counterpoised watchglass or metal scoop fig 25 should be used in some cases it is advisable to use a weighingbottle this is a light wellstoppered bottle fig 3 containing the powdered ore it is first filled and weighed then some of the substance is carefully poured from it into a beaker or other vessel and it is weighed again the difference in the two weighings gives the weight of substance taken a substance must always be cold when weighed and large glass vessels should be allowed to stand in the balancebox a little while before being weighed always have the balance at rest when putting on or taking off anything from the pans put the weights on systematically in using the rider except you have a reason to the contrary put it on at the 5 if this is too much then try it at the 3 if then the weights are too little try at the 4 if still not enough the correct weight must be between the 4 and 5 try halfway between it is best to work with the balance vibrating equilibrium is established when the vibration to the left is the mean of the preceding and succeeding vibrations to the right for example if it vibrates 6 divisions to the right on one swing and 5 divisions on the next the intermediate vibration to the left should have been 512 note whether the substance increases in weight whilst on the balance if it does it may be because it was put on warm and is cooling or it may be because it is taking up moisture from the air substances which take up moisture rapidly should be weighed in clipped watchglasses or in lightweighing bottles or tubes students in recording the weights should first read off those missing from the box writing down each order of figures as determined first tens then units and so on remember that the first four platinum weights give the figures of the first place of decimals the second four give the second place and that the third and fourth places are given by the rider having taken down the figures confirm them by reading off the weights as you put them back into the box do not rest a weight on the palm of your hand for convenience in reading the mark upon it remember one weight lost from a box spoils the set do not take it for granted that the balance is in equilibrium before you start weighing try it illustration fig 26 measuring liquidsfor coarse work such as measuring acids for dissolving ores graduated glasses similar to those used by druggists may be used it is well to have two sizesa smaller graduated into divisions of 5 cc fig 26 and a larger with divisions equal to 10 cc no measurement of importance should be made in a vessel of this kind as a slight variation in level causes a serious error graduated flasks must be used when anything has to be made up to a definite bulk or when a fixed volume has to be collected if for example a certain weight of substance has to be dissolved and diluted to a litre or if the first 50 cc of a distillate has to be collected a flask should be used each flask is graduated for one particular quantity the most useful sizes are 1000 cc 500 cc 200 cc 100 cc and 50 cc the mark should be in the narrowest part of the neck and should be tangential to the curved surface of the liquid when the flask contains the exact volume specified the level of a curved surface of liquid is at first somewhat difficult to read the beginner is in doubt whether the surface should be taken at a b or c fig 27 it is best to take the lowest reading c in some lights it is difficult to find this in such cases a piece of white paper or card held behind and a little below so as to throw light up and against the curved surface will render it clear in reading one should look neither up at nor down upon the surface but the eye should be on the same level with it it must be kept in mind that flasks contain the quantity specified but deliver less than this by the amount remaining in them and damping the sides if it is desired to transfer the contents say of a 100 cc flask to a beaker it will be necessary to complete the transfer by rinsing out the flask and adding the washings otherwise there will be a sensible loss graduated cylinders fig 28 are convenient for preparing standard solutions illustration fig 27 illustration fig 28 illustration fig 29 pipettes and burettes are graduated to deliver the quantities specified the principle of the pipette and the advantages and disadvantages of its various forms may be understood by considering the first form shown in fig 29 it is essentially a bulbed tube drawn out to a jet at its lower end and having on each side of the bulb a mark so placed that when the surface of the liquid falls from the upper to the lower mark the instrument shall deliver exactly 100 cc the bore of the jet should be of such a size as will allow the level of the liquid to fall at the rate of about one foot in two minutes if it runs more quickly than this an appreciable error arises from the varying amount of liquid remaining and damping the sides of the bulb the flow of liquid from a pipette must not be hastened by blowing into it the lower tube or nose of the pipette should be long enough to reach into the bottle or flask containing the liquid about to be measured the pipette is filled by sucking at the open end with the mouth this method of filling renders the use of the instrument dangerous for such liquids as strong acids ammonia and such poisonous solutions as that of potassic cyanide one attempt with a fairly strong solution of ammonia will teach the beginner a very useful lesson as soon as the liquid rises above the upper mark in the pipette the mouth is withdrawn and the pipette quickly closed by pressing the upper aperture with the index finger of the right hand it is well to have the finger slightly moist but not damp the neck of the pipette should be long enough to allow its being firmly grasped by the fingers and thumb of the right hand without inconvenience the pipette is first held in a vertical position long enough to allow any moisture outside the tube to run down and then the liquid is allowed to run out to the level of the upper mark this is easily effected by lessening the pressure if the finger is wet the flow will be jerky and good work impossible the pipette is next held over the vessel into which the 100 cc are to be put and the liquid allowed to run out when the bulb is nearly empty the flow should be checked by replacing the finger and the liquid allowed to escape slowly until the lower mark is reached the pipette is then withdrawn it is in the withdrawing that the disadvantage of this particular form5 makes itself felt it must be withdrawn very steadily as the slightest shock causes the remaining column of liquid to vibrate whereby air is drawn in and the liquid is forced out this disadvantage is got rid of by making the mouth of the jet the lower limit or in other words allowing the instrument to empty itself there are two forms of such pipettes in the one generally recommended in gaylussacs silver assay the last shown in fig 29 the nose is replaced by a jet this is most conveniently filled by stopping the jet with the finger and allowing the liquid to flow in a fine stream into the neck until the pipette is filled and then working as just described the other form is the one in general use in fact a long nose to a pipette is so convenient that it may almost be said to be necessary but the accuracy is slightly diminished a long narrow tube makes a poor measuring instrument because of the amount of liquid it finally retains a defect possessed by both forms is the retention of a drop of varying size in the nozzle whatever method is adopted for removing this drop must be always adhered to the most convenient form is the one last described and the most useful sizes are 100 cc 50 cc 20 cc 10 cc and 5 cc ten cc pipettes graduated into tenths of a cubic centimetre are very useful those are best in which the graduation stops short of the bottom all measurements should be made at the ordinary temperature and before being used the pipette should be rinsed out with a cubic centimetre or so of the solution to be measured after using it should be washed out with water burettes differ mainly from pipettes in having the flow of liquid controlled from below instead of from above the best form is that known as mohrs one kind of which is provided with a glass stopcock while the other has a piece of indiarubber tube compressed by a clip the latter cannot be used for solutions of permanganate of potash or of iodine or of any substance which acts on indiarubber but in other respects there is little to choose between the two kinds a burette delivering 100 cc and graduated into fifths ie each division 02 cc is a very convenient size for some kinds of work 50 cc divided into tenths ie each division 01 cc may be selected burettes may be fixed in any convenient stand they must be vertical and should be so placed that the assayer can read any part of the graduated scale without straining when not in use they should be kept full of water when using a burette the water must be run out the burette is next rinsed with some of the solution to be used and drained and then it is filled with the solution next squeeze the indiarubber tube so as to disentangle airbubbles and by smartly opening the clip allow the tube and jet to be filled see that no bubbles of air are left then run out cautiously until the level of the liquid in the burette stands at zero in reading the level with very darkcoloured liquids it is convenient to read from the level a fig 27 and provided it is done in each reading there is no objection to this the accuracy of the reading of a burette is sensibly increased by the use of an erdmann float this is an elongated bulb weighted with mercury and fitting somewhat loosely the tube of the burette it floats in the solution and is marked with a horizontal line this line is taken as the level of the liquid if the burette is filled from the top the float rises with aggravating slowness and this is its chief disadvantage the float must come to rest before any reading is made illustration fig 30 a convenient plan for filling a burette from below is shown in fig 30 the diagram explains itself the bottle containing the standard solution is connected with the burette by a syphon arrangement through the glass tube and tpiece the flow of liquid into the burette is controlled by the clip when this clip is opened the burette fills and when it is closed the burette is ready for use in the ordinary way measuring gaseslanges nitrometer fig 69 is a very convenient instrument for many gasometric methods it requires the use of a fair quantity of mercury in fig 31 there is a representation of a piece of apparatus easily fitted up from the ordinary material of a laboratory it is one which will serve some useful purposes it consists of a widemouthed bottle fitted by preference with a rubber cork the cork is perforated and in the perforation is placed a glass tube which communicates with the burette the burette is connected by a rubber tube and a ypiece either with another burette or with a piece of ordinary combustiontube of about the same size the widemouthed bottle contains either a short testtube or an ordinary phial with its neck cut off in working the apparatus the weighed substance is put in the bottle and the reagent which is to act on it in the testtube the cork is then inserted the liquid in the two burettes is next brought to the same level either by pouring it in at a or running it out at b the level of the liquid in the apparatus for correcting variation in volume is then read and noted next after seeing that the level of the liquid in the burette has not changed turn the bottle over on its side so that the reagent in the testtube shall be upset into the bottle then as the volume of the gas increases lower the liquid in the burette by running it out at b and at the same time keep the level in a half an inch or so lower than that in the burette when the action has finished bring the liquid in the two vessels to the same level and read off the burette this part of the work must always be done in the same manner illustration fig 31 the volume corrector for gas analysis is a graduated glass tube of 120 cc capacity inverted over a narrow glass cylinder of mercury it contains 02 or 03 cc of water and a volume of air which if dry and under standard conditions would measure 100 cc the actual volume varies from day to day and is read off at any time by bringing the mercury inside and outside to the same level this is done by raising or lowering the tube as may be required any volume of gas obtained in an assay can be corrected to standard temperature and pressure by multiplying by 100 and dividing by the number of cc in the corrector at the time the assay is made footnotes 5 it is best to use this form with a glass stopcock or with an indiarubber tube and clip after the manner of a mohrs burette chapter vi reagentsacids etc acetic acid hac or c2h4o2 sp gr 1044 containing 33 per cent real acidan organic acid forming a class of salts acetates which are for the most part soluble in water and which on ignition leave the oxide or carbonate of the metal it is almost always used in those cases where mineral acids are objectionable to convert for example a solution of a substance in hydrochloric acid into a solution of the same in acetic acid alkali should be added in excess and then acetic acid many compounds are insoluble in acetic acid which are soluble in mineral acids such as ferric phosphate ferric arsenate zinc sulphide calcium oxalate c so that the use of acetic acid is valuable in some separations the commercial acid is strong enough for most purposes and is used without dilution aqua regia is a mixture of 1 part by measure of nitric acid and 3 parts of hydrochloric acid the acids react forming what is practically a solution of chlorine6 the mixture is best made when wanted and is chiefly used for the solution of gold and platinum and for opening up sulphides when solutions in aqua regia are evaporated chlorides are left bromine br sp gr 30 practically pure bromineit is a heavy reddishbrown liquid and very volatile it boils at 60 c and consequently must be kept in a cool place it gives off brown irritating vapours which render its use very objectionable generally it answers the same purpose as aqua regia and is employed where the addition of nitric acid to a solution has to be specially avoided it is also used for dissolving metals only from ores which contain metallic oxides not desired in the solution bromine water is simply bromine shaken up with water till no more is dissolved carbonic acid co2a heavy gas somewhat soluble in water it is mainly used for providing an atmosphere in which substances may be dissolved titrated c without fear of oxidation it is also used in titrating arsenic assays with iodine when a feeble acid is required to prevent the absorption of iodine by the alkaline carbonate it is prepared when wanted in solution by adding a gram or so of bicarbonate of soda and then as much acid as will decompose the bicarbonate mentioned when a quantity of the gas is wanted it is prepared in an apparatus like that used for sulphuretted hydrogen by acting on fragments of marble or limestone with dilute hydrochloric acid citric acid h3ci or c6h8o7h2o is an organic acid which occurs in colourless crystals soluble in less than their weight of water the solution must be freshly prepared as it gets mouldy when kept it forms a comparatively unimportant class of salts citrates it is used in the determination of phosphoric acid chiefly for the purpose of preventing the precipitation of phosphates of iron and alumina by ammonia and in a few similar cases the commercial crystals are used they should be free from sulphuric acid and leave no ash on ignition hydrochloric acid hcl in water sp gr 116 it contains 32 per cent of hydrogen chlorideit is sometimes called muriatic acid and when impure spirit of salt the acid solution should be colourless and free from arsenic iron and sulphuric acid it forms an important family of salts the chlorides it is the best acid for dissolving metallic oxides and carbonates and is always used by the assayer when oxidising agents are to be avoided the acid is used without dilution when no directions are expressly given to dilute it it has no action on the following metals gold platinum arsenic and mercury it very slightly attacks antimony bismuth lead silver and copper tin is more soluble in it but with difficulty whilst iron zinc nickel cobalt cadmium and aluminium easily dissolve with evolution of hydrogen and the formation of the lower chloride if the metal forms more than one class of salts all the metallic oxides except a few of the native and rarer oxides are dissolved by it with the formation of chlorides of the metal and water dilute hydrochloric acid is made by diluting the strong acid with an equal volume of water this is used for dissolving precipitates obtained in the general course of analysis and the more easily soluble metals hydrofluoric acid hfa solution in water may be purchased in guttapercha or lead bottles it is of variable strength and doubtful purity it must always be examined quantitatively for the residue left on evaporation it is used occasionally for the examination of silicates it attacks silica forming fluoride of silicon which is a gas when the introduction of another base will not interfere with the assay the substance may be mixed in the platinum dish with fluoride of ammonium or of potassium or of calcium and hydrochloric acid instead of treating it with the commercial acid it is only required in special work the fumes and acid are dangerous and of course glass or porcelain vessels cannot be used with it iodine ithis can be obtained in commerce quite pure and is often used for standardising it is very slightly soluble in water but readily dissolves in potassium iodide solution it closely resembles chlorine and bromine in its properties and can be used for dissolving metals without at the same time attacking any oxide which may be present it is chiefly used as an oxidizing agent in volumetric work being sharp in its reactions and easily detected in minute quantities it cannot be used in alkaline solutions since it reacts with the hydrates and even with the carbonates to form iodides and iodates iodine is soluble in alcohol nitric acid hno3 sp gr 142 boiling point 121 c contains 70 per cent by weight of hydrogen nitrateit is convenient to remember that one cc of this contains 1 gram of real acid it combines the properties of an acid and of an oxidising agent one cc contains 076 gram of oxygen most of which is very loosely held and easily given up to metals and other oxidisable substances consequently it will dissolve many metals c upon which hydrochloric acid has no action all sulphides that of mercury excepted are attacked by it and for the most part rendered soluble it has no action on gold or platinum and very little on aluminium the strong acid at the ordinary temperature does not act on iron or tin and in most cases it acts better when diluted some nitrates being insoluble in nitric acid form a protecting coat to the metal which hinders further action where the strong acid does act the action is very violent so that generally it is better to use the dilute acid when iron has been immersed in strong nitric acid it not only remains unacted on but assumes a passive state so that if after being wiped it is then placed in the dilute acid it will not dissolve tin and antimony are converted into insoluble oxides while the other metals with the exception of those already mentioned dissolve as nitrates during the solution of the metal red fumes are given off which mainly consist of nitrogen peroxide the solution is often coloured brown or green because of dissolved oxides of nitrogen which must be got rid of by boiling generally some ammonium nitrate is formed especially in the cases of zinc iron and tin when these are acted on by cold dilute acid sulphur phosphorus and arsenic are converted into sulphuric phosphoric and arsenic acids respectively when boiled with the strong acid dilute nitric aciddilute 1 volume of the strong acid with 2 of water oxalic acid h2o or h2c2o42h2othis is an organic acid in colourless crystals it forms a family of saltsthe oxalates it is used in standardising being a crystallised and permanent acid it can be readily weighed it is also used in separations many of the oxalates being insoluble for general use make a 10 per cent solution use the commercially pure acid on ignition the acid should leave no residue illustration fig 32 sulphuretted hydrogen hydrosulphuric acid sh2a gas largely used in assaying since by its action it allows of the metals being conveniently classed into groups it is soluble in water this liquid dissolving at the ordinary temperature about three times its volume of the gas the solution is only useful for testing in separations a current of the gas must always be used it is best prepared in an apparatus like that shown in fig 32 by acting on ferrous sulphide with dilute hydrochloric acid when iron has to be subsequently determined in the assay solution the gas should be washed by bubbling it through water in the smaller bottle but for most purposes washing can be dispensed with the gas is very objectionable and operations with it must be carried out in a cupboard with a good draught when the precipitation has been completed the apparatus should always be washed out the effect of this acid on solutions of the metals is to form sulphides all the metallic sulphides are insoluble in water but some are soluble in alkaline and some in acid solutions if sulphuretted hydrogen is passed through an acid solution containing the metals till no further precipitation takes place a precipitate will be formed containing sulphides insoluble in the acid on filtering adding ammonia to render the filtrate alkaline and again passing the gas a further precipitate will be obtained consisting of sulphides insoluble in an alkaline solution but not precipitable in an acid one the filtrate may also contain sulphides not precipitable in an acid solution which are soluble in an alkaline one these will be thrown down on neutralising again the metals precipitated in the acid solution form sulphides which may be divided into groups the one consisting of those which are soluble and the other of those which are not soluble in alkalies this classification is shown in the following summary 1 precipitable in an acid solution a soluble in alkaliessulphides of as sb sn au pt ir mo te and se b insoluble in alkaliessulphides of ag pb hg bi cu cd pd rh os and ru 2 not precipitated in an acid solution but thrown down in an alkaline one sulphides of mn zn fe ni co in tl and ga these can again be divided into those which are dissolved by dilute acids and those which are not 3 not precipitated in an acid or alkaline solution but thrown down on neutralising the latter sulphides of v and w sulphuretted hydrogen is a strong reducing agent ferric salts are thereby quickly reduced to ferrous in hot solutions nitric acid is decomposed these changes are marked by a precipitation of sulphur and the student must be careful to pass the gas sufficiently long and not be too hasty in concluding that no sulphide will form because it does not at once make its appearance the best indication that it has been passed long enough is the smell of the gas in the solution after shaking sulphurous acid h2so3the reagent used may be regarded as a saturated solution of sulphur dioxide in water it may be purchased and keeps for a long time it may be made by heating copper with sulphuric acid and passing the gas formed into water the heat should be withdrawn when the gas is coming off freely it is used as a reducing agent and should not be diluted sulphuric acid h2so4 sp gr 184 containing 96 per cent of real acid h2so4this acid forms insoluble sulphates with salts of lead strontium and barium it has a high boiling point 290 c and when evaporated with salts of the more volatile acids converts them into sulphates when nitrates or chlorides are objectionable in a solution evaporation with sulphuric acid removes them in working with this acid caution is necessary since on mixing with water great heat is evolved and if either the acid or water has been previously heated a serious accident may result in diluting the acid it should be poured into cold water glass vessels containing boiling sulphuric acid should be handled as little as possible and should not be cooled under the tap the action of diluted sulphuric acid on metals closely resembles that of dilute hydrochloric acid magnesium aluminium iron zinc nickel cobalt manganese and cadmium dissolve with evolution of hydrogen in the cold acid or when warmed the action of hot and strong sulphuric acid is altogether different it acts as an oxidising agent and is itself reduced to sulphur dioxide or even to sulphur the following metals are attacked in this waycopper bismuth mercury silver antimony tin and lead gold platinum and arsenic are not affected this property is made use of in parting silver from gold and platinum metallic sulphides are similarly attacked but this method of opening up minerals has the disadvantage of giving rise to the formation of anhydrous sulphates of iron c which are not readily dissolved when afterwards diluted the use of sulphuric acid in assaying is for these reasons to be avoided its chief use is as a drying agent since it has a strong affinity for water air under a bell jar may be kept dry by means of a basin of sulphuric acid and gases bubbled through it are freed from watervapour dilute sulphuric acidthis is made by diluting 1 volume of the strong acid with 4 of water tartaric acid h2t or c4h6o6a crystallised organic acid soluble in less than its own weight of water or in less than three parts of alcohol it is used for the same purposes as citric acid is the solution is made when required bases salts c alcohol c2h6o commercial alcohol of sp gr 0838 it contains 84 per cent by weight of alcoholit should burn with a nonluminous flame and leave no residue it is used for washing precipitates where water is inapplicable and for facilitating drying ammonia nh3 commercial ammonia a solution having a sp gr of 088 to 089 and containing about 33 per cent of ammoniait is used as an alkali more commonly than soda or potash since an excess of it is easily removed by boiling the salts of ammonium formed by it may be removed by igniting or by evaporating in a porcelain dish with an excess of nitric acid it differs in a marked way from soda or potash in its solvent action on the oxides or hydrates of the metals salts of the following metals are soluble in an ammoniacal solution in the presence of ammonic chloridecopper cadmium silver nickel cobalt manganese zinc magnesium sodium potassium and the alkaline earths dilute ammonia is made by diluting 1 vol of commercial ammonia with 2 of water the dilute ammonia is always used but in assays for copper a stronger solution 1 of strong ammonia to 1 of water is required ammonic carbonate am2co3 is prepared by dissolving one part of the commercial sesquicarbonate of ammonia in four parts of water and adding one part of strong ammonia ammonic bicarbonate hamco3 is prepared by saturating a solution of the sesquicarbonate of ammonia with carbon dioxide ammonic chloride amcluse the commercial salt in a 20 per cent solution in water the salt should leave no residue on ignition ammonic molybdatethe solution is prepared as followsdissolve 100 grams of the powdered commercial salt in 200 cc of dilute ammonia and pour the solution in a slow stream into 750 cc of dilute nitric acid make up to 1 litre and allow the mixture to settle before using it is used for the purpose of separating phosphoric oxide from bases and from other acids and also as a test for phosphates and arsenates in using this solution the substance must be dissolved in nitric acid and a considerable excess of the reagent added 50 cc is sufficient to precipitate 01 gram p2o5 when the phosphate is in excess no precipitate will be got the precipitate is phosphomolybdate of ammonia ammonic nitrate amno3 is used in the separation of phosphoric oxide by the molybdate method and occasionally for destroying organic matter it is soluble in less than its own weight of water the solution is made when wanted ammonic oxalate am2c2o42h2o is used chiefly for the separation of lime the solution is made by dissolving 15 grams of the salt in 100 cc of water ammonic sulphide may be purchased in the state of a strong solution it is yellow and contains the disulphide s2am2 it serves the same purpose as is obtained by passing a current of sulphuretted hydrogen through an ammoniacal solution but has the disadvantage of loading the solution with sulphur which is precipitated when the solution is subsequently acidified it is useful for dissolving the lower sulphide of tin sns baric carbonate baco3 is sometimes used for precipitating the weaker bases it should be prepared when wanted by precipitating a solution of baric chloride with ammonic carbonate and washing the moist precipitate is used without drying baric chloride bacl22h2oa crystallised salt soluble in 212 parts of water it is used for the detection and separation of sulphates make a 10 per cent solution black fluxa mixture of finely divided carbon with carbonate of potash or with carbonates of potash and soda it is prepared by heating tartar or rochelle salt until no more combustible gas is given off one gram will reduce about 2 grams of lead from litharge borax na2b4o710h2oit is chiefly used as a flux in dry assaying as already described it is also used in testing before the blowpipe many metallic oxides impart a characteristic colour to a bead of borax in which they have been fused calcium chloridethe crystallised salt is cacl26h2o dried at 200 c it becomes cacl22h2o and when fused it becomes dehydrated the fused salt broken into small lumps is used for drying gases it combines with water giving off much heat and dissolves in a little more than its own weight of water strong solutions may be used in baths in which temperatures above the boilingpoint of water are required one part of the salt and 2 of water give a solution boiling at 112 and a solution of 2 parts of the salt in 1 of water boils at 158 the salt is very little used as a reagent calcium fluoride or fluor spar caf2the mineral is used as a flux in dry assaying it renders slags which are thick from the presence of phosphates c very fluid mixed with hydrochloric acid it may sometimes be used instead of hydrofluoric acid calcium carbonate caco3it is precipitated in a pure state by ammonic carbonate from a solution of calcium chloride it is used for standardising in the impure state as marble or limestone it is used in the preparation of carbonic acid calcium hydrate or lime waterthis is used in testing for carbon dioxide and in estimating the amount of that gas present in air it may be made by slaking quicklime and digesting the slaked lime with water one hundred cc of water at 15 c dissolves 01368 grams of the hydrate cah2o2 and hot water dissolves still less milk of lime is slaked lime suspended in water cobalt nitrate cono326h2o is used in a 10 per cent solution for the detection of oxides of zinc aluminium c on ignition with which it forms characteristically coloured compounds copper cupure copper as obtained by electrolysis can be purchased this only should be used copper oxide cuoit occurs as a black heavy and gritty power and is used for the oxidation of carbon and hydrogen in organic substances it should be ignited and cooled out of contact with air just before using since it is hygroscopic oxide of copper which has been used may be again utilised after calcination copper sulphate cuso45h2o contains 254 per cent of copper it is used in the outer cell of a daniellbattery the commercial salt is used for this purpose the recrystallised and pure salt is used for preparing the anhydrous sulphate which is used for detecting moisture in gases for this purpose it is dried at 200 c till no trace of green or blue colour remains it must be prepared when wanted it may be conveniently used in the form of pumicestone saturated with a solution of the salt and dried traces of moisture develop a green colour ferric chloride fe2cl6 when crystallised fe2cl66h2othe solution is prepared as described under iron the commercial salt contains arsenic and since the chief use of ferric chloride is for the determination of this substance it must be purified see under arsenic ferric sulphate fe2so43 is a yellowish white deliquescent salt it is used as an indicator in volumetric silver assaying and for the separation of iodine from bromine it may be purchased as iron alum am2fe2so4424h2o but it is best prepared by adding strong sulphuric acid to ferric hydrate in equivalent proportions use it as a solution containing 2 or 3 per cent of iron ferrous sulphate feso47h2othe granulated form is best and can be purchased pure it is used for standardising it keeps better in crystals than in solution it is readily soluble in water but the solution is best made with the help of a little free acid as a reagent use a 10 per cent solution the crystals should be clear bluishgreen if their colour is dark green brown or blue they should be rejected ferrous sulphide fes is used for the preparation of sulphuretted hydrogen it may be purchased and broken in small lumps nutsize for use fusion mixture k2co3na2co3 is a mixture of potassic and sodic carbonates in the proportions of 13 of the former to 10 of the latter by weight it is hygroscopic a mixture of the bicarbonates is better being purer and less apt to get damp gallic acid c7h6o5h2o is an organic acid occurring as a pale fawncoloured crystalline powder soluble in 100 parts of cold water or in 3 parts of boiling water it is used for the determination of antimony a 10 per cent solution in warm water is made when required hydrogen h is a gas it is obtained by acting on zinc with dilute hydrochloric or sulphuric acid it is used as a reducing agent and for providing an atmosphere free from oxygen it reduces metallic oxides at a high temperature it must be freed from water and special precautions should be taken to prevent an admixture with air it is generally required in a current which can be continued for an hour or more without interruption the preparation can be conveniently carried out in the apparatus shown fig 33 a quart bottle is half filled with sheet zinc and connected with bulbs filled with sulphuric acid and with a calcium chloride tube the last is connected with the apparatus through which the gas has to be passed dilute hydrochloric acid mixed with a few cubic centimetres 20 cc to 1 pint of stannous chloride sol to fix any dissolved oxygen is placed in the funnel and let into the bottle by opening the stopcock when required care must be taken to let the hydrogen escape for some time before starting the reduction illustration fig 33 gold augold obtained by cupelling and parting is for most purposes sufficiently pure it is best kept in the shape of foil when the purer metal is required gold should be dissolved in aqua regia the solution evaporated to a paste diluted allowed to stand and filtered the filtered solution is acidified with hydrochloric acid warmed and precipitated with sodium sulphite the precipitate is collected washed and fused on charcoal iron fethe soft wire thin is used for standardising rods are used in dry assays as a desulphurising agent steel must not be used since it is not pure and contains a variable amount of iron

equations are a kind of short hand for expressing briefly and in the language of the atomic theory the facts of chemical composition and reaction the convenience of this method of expressing the facts justifies a short description of it here on comparing the percentage composition of a series of compounds the proportions in which the elements combine appears to be regulated by no simple law for example realgar orpiment mispickel pyrites arsenic 714 609 460 sulphur 286 391 196 533 iron 344 467 1000 1000 1000 1000 but if in these examples the composition is calculated not on 100 parts but on 107 246 163 and 120 parts respectively evidence of a simple law becomes apparent realgar orpiment mispickel pyrites arsenic 750 1500 750 sulphur 320 960 320 640 iron 560 560 1070 2460 1630 1200 it will be seen that the proportion of arsenic is 75 or twice 75 that of iron is 56 and that of sulphur 32 or some simple multiple of 32 the series of examples might be extended indefinitely and it would still be found that the combining proportions held good the number 75 is spoken of as the combining weight or more frequently as the atomic weight of arsenic similarly 56 is the atomic weight of iron and 32 the atomic weight of sulphur the importance of this law of chemical combination is altogether independent of the atomic theory but this theory furnishes the simplest explanation of the facts according to it a chemical compound is made up of exactly similar groups of particles the particles of each elementary substance are all alike but differ from those of other elements in weight ultimate particles are called atoms and the groups of atoms are called molecules the atomic weight of any particular element is the weight of its atom compared with the weight of an atom of hydrogen the atom of sulphur for instance is 32 times as heavy as the atom of hydrogen and the atomic weight of sulphur is 32 the molecular weight is the sum of the atomic weights of the group the molecule of pyrites contains two atoms of sulphur and one of iron on referring to the table of atomic weights it will be seen that the atomic weights aresulphur 32 and iron 56 the molecular weight therefore is 323256that is 120 the meaning of this is 120 parts by weight of iron pyrites contain 64 parts of sulphur and 56 parts of iron and this is true whether the parts by weight be grains or tons the symbol or formula of an atom is generally the initial letter or letters of the latin or english name of the substance the atom of hydrogen is written h that of oxygen o of sulphur s of iron ferrum fe and so on a list of these symbols is given in the table of atomic weights the formula of a molecule is obtained by placing together the symbols of the contained atoms thus fe represents an atom of iron s an atom of sulphur while fes represents the molecule of sulphide of iron as containing one atom of each element when more than one atom of an element is present this is shown by writing a figure under and after the symbol thus fes2 represents a molecule with one atom of iron and two atoms of sulphur fe2s3 similarly shows one with two atoms of iron and three of sulphur when a group of atoms is enclosed in brackets a figure after and under the bracket multiplies all within it for example pbno32 is another way of writing pbn2o6 sometimes it is convenient to represent the atoms of a molecule as divided into two or more groups this may be done by writing the formul of the groups and separating each simple formula by a full stop slaked lime for instance has the formula cah2o2 or as already explained we may write it caho2 or if for purposes of explanation we wished to look on it as lime cao and water h2o we could write it caoh2o a plus sign has a different meaning cao h2o indicates quantities of two substances water and lime which are separate from each other the sign of equality is generally used to separate a statement of the reagents used from another statement of the products of the reaction it may be translated into the word yields or becomes the two statements form an equation ignoring the quantitative relation the meaning of the equation cao h2o caoh2o is lime and water yield slaked lime by referring to a table of atomic weights we can elicit the quantitative relations thus cao h2o cah2o2 v v v ca 40 h2 2 12 ca 40 o 16 o 16 h2 2 12 o2 32 162 56 18 74 or putting it in words 56 parts of lime combine with 18 parts of water to form 74 parts of slaked lime this equation enables one to answer such a question as thishow much lime must be used to produce 1 cwt of slaked lime for if 74 lbs of slaked lime require 56 lbs of lime 112 lbs will require 5611274 or about 8434 lbs as another example having a closer bearing on assaying take the following questionin order to assay 5 grams of black tin sno2 by the cyanide process how much potassic cyanide kcn will be required the reaction is sno2 2kcn sn 2kcno v v sn 118 k 39 o2 32 c 12 n 14 150 652 130 what is sought for here is the relation between the quantities of sno2 and kcn note that a figure before a formula multiplies all that follows up to the next stop or plus or equality sign the question is now resolved to this if 150 grams of oxide of tin require 130 grams of cyanide how much will 5 grams require 150 130 5 x x 433 grams a problem of frequent occurrence is to find the percentage composition of a substance when its formula has been given for example what percentage of iron is contained in a mineral having the formula 2fe2o33h2o bringing this formula together we have fe4h6o9 find the molecular weight fe4 224 564 h6 6 16 o9 144 169 374 then we get 374 parts of the mineral contain 224 of iron how much will 100 contain 374 224 100 x x 5989 and the answer to the question is 5989 per cent again suppose the question is of this kindhow much crystallised copper sulphate cuso45h2o will be required to make 2 litres of a solution 1 cc of which shall contain 00010 gram of copper a litre is 1000 cc so therefore 2 litres of the solution must contain 0001 gram 2000 or 2 grams how much crystallised copper sulphate will contain this amount of metal cu 633 s 320 o4 640 164 5h2o 900 185 2493 if 633 grams of copper are contained in 2493 grams of sulphate in how much is 2 grams contained 633 2493 2 grams x x 78769 grams the answer is 78769 grams must be taken as a sample of another class of problem similar in nature to the last but a little more complicated take the followingwhat weight of permanganate of potash must be taken to make 2 litres of a solution 100 cc of which shall be equivalent to 1 gram of iron in the first place the 2 litres must be equivalent to 20 grams of iron for there are 20 100 cc in two litres in the titration of iron by permanganate solution there are two reactions first in dissolving the iron fe h2so4 feso4 h2 v 56 and second in the actual titration 10feso4 2kmno4 9h2so4 2mnso4 5fe2so43 2khso4 8h2o v k 39 mn 55 o4 64 158 2 316 as before attention is confined to the two substances under considerationviz fe and kmno4 in the second equation we find 316 parts of the permanganate are required for 10 molecules of feso4 and in the first equation 56 parts of iron are equivalent to one molecule of feso4 therefore 560 of iron are equivalent to 316 of permanganate and the question is how much of the permanganate will be equivalent to 20 grams of iron 560 316 20 grams x x 11286 grams the answer is 11286 grams very similar to this last problem is the question suggested under the head indirect titration p 43 if 100 cc of the standard permanganate solution are equivalent to 1 gram of iron how much peroxide of manganese will they be equivalent to the equation for dissolving the iron is already given the second equation is 2feso4 mno2 2h2so4 fe2so42 mnso4 2h2o v mn 55 o2 32 87 it will be seen that 87 grams of peroxide of manganese are equivalent to 112 grams of iron how much then is equivalent to 1 gram of iron 112 87 1 gram x x 07767 gram it is sometimes convenient to calculate the formula of a substance from its analysis the method of calculating is shown by the following example required the formula of a mineral which gave the following figures on analysis cupric oxide cuo 1058 ferrous oxide feo 1569 zinc oxide zno 035 sulphuric oxide so2 2882 water h2o 4471 10015 first find the molecular weights of cuo feo c and divide the corresponding percentages by these figures thus cuo 63316 793 and 1058 divided by 793 gives 01334 similarly feo 5616 72 and 1569 divided by 72 gives 02179 treated in the same way the oxide of zinc sulphuric oxide and water give as results 00043 03602 and 2484 classify the results as follows bases acids water cuo 01334 so3 03602 h2o 2484 feo 02179 zno 00043 ro 03556 ro3 03602 r2o 2484 the figures 03556 03602 and 2484 should be then divided by the lowest of themie 03556 or where as in this case two of the figures are very near each other the mean of these may be takenie 03579 whichever is taken the figures got will be approximately 1 1 and 7 the formula is then roso37h2o in which r is nearly 25ths copper 35ths iron and a little zinc this formula requires the following percentage composition which for the sake of comparison is placed side by side with the actual results calculated found cupric oxide 1129 1058 ferrous oxide 1537 1569 zinc oxide nil 035 sulphuric oxide 2847 2882 water 4484 4471 9997 10015 trimming the results of an analysis to make them fit in more closely with the calculations from the formula would be foolish as well as dishonest there can be no doubt that the actual analytical results represent the composition of the specimen much more closely than the formula does although perhaps other specimens of the same mineral would yield results which would group themselves better around the calculated results than around those of the first specimen analysed it must be remembered that substances are rarely found pure either in nature or in the arts so that in most cases the formula only gives an approximation to the truth in the case of hydrated salts there is generally a difficulty in getting the salt with exactly the right proportion of water practical exercises the following calculations may be made 1 calculate standards in the following cases a silver taken 1003 gram standard salt used 10015 cc b iron taken 07 gram bichromate used 696 cc 2 calculate percentages a ore taken 1 gram solution used 652 cc standard 0987 gram b ore taken 1 gram barium sulphate got 1432 gram barium sulphate contains 1373 per cent of sulphur and the percentage of sulphur in the ore is wanted c barium sulphate is baso4 calculate the percentage of sulphur it contains for use in the preceding question 3 a method of estimating the quantity of peroxide in a manganese ore is based on the following reactions 1 mno2 4hcl mncl2 cl2 2h2o 2 cl ki kcl i to how much mno2 is 1 gram of iodine i equivalent 4 a mineral has the following

crystals must be taken to give 04 gram of copper 6 how much ferrous sulphate crystals feso47h2o must be taken to yield 2 litres of a solution 100 cc of which shall contain 056 gram of iron 7 galena is pbs and hmatite fe2o3 what percentages of metal do these minerals contain chapter viii specific gravity the relation of the weight of a substance to its volume should be kept in mind in all cases where both weight and volume are dealt with students are apt to imagine that on mixing equal volumes of say sulphuric acid and water an acid of half the strength must be obtained if the statement of strength is in parts by weight this will lead to considerable error for example 100 cc of sulphuric acid containing 98 per cent by weight of real acid will if diluted with 100 cc of water yield a solution containing not 49 per cent by weight but about 635 per cent of the acid the reason is this the 100 cc of sulphuric acid weighs 184 grams and contains 18032 grams of real acid while the 100 cc of water weighs only 100 grams the mixed water and acid weighs 284 grams and contains 18032 of real acid which is equivalent to nearly 635 per cent by weight if however the method of statement be volumetric it would be correct to say that doubling the volume halves the strength if 100 cc of brine contains 10 grams of salt and is diluted with water to 200 cc it would be of onehalf the former strength that is 100 cc of the solution would contain 5 grams of salt this confusion is avoided by always stating the strengths as so many grams or cc in 100 cc of the liquid but obviously it would be advantageous to be able to determine quickly the weight of any particular substance corresponding to 1 cc or some other given volume moreover in descriptions of processes the strengths of acids and solutions are frequently defined neither by their gravimetric nor volumetric composition but by a statement either of specific gravity or of the degrees registered by twaddells or beaums hydrometer thus in the description of the process of gold parting one writer gives the acid should be of 12 specific gravity and another says the acid must not be stronger than 32 beaum these considerations justify an account of the subject in such a work as this and on other grounds the determination of a specific gravity is one of the operations with which an assayer should be familiar the meaning of specific gravity is present in the mind of every one who uses the sentence lead is heavier than water this is meaningless except some such phrase as bulk for bulk be added make the sentence quantitative by saying bulk for bulk lead is 1136 times heavier than water and one has the exact meaning of the specific gravity of lead is 1136 a table of the specific gravities of liquids and solids shows how many times heavier the substances are than water it is better however to look upon the specific gravity written shortly sp g as the weight of a substance divided by its volume in the metric system 1 cc of water at 4 c weighs with sufficient exactness 1 gram consequently the sp g which states how many times heavier than water the substance is also expresses the weight in grams of one cc of it so that if a 100 cc flask of nitric acid weighs after the weight of the flask has been deducted 120 grams 1 cc of the acid weighs 12 gram and the sp g is 12 the specific gravity then may be determined by dividing the weight of a substance in grams by its volume in cc but it is more convenient in practice to determine it by dividing the weight of the substance by the weight of an equal volume of water and since the volumes of all substances water included vary with the temperature the temperature at which the sp g is determined should be recorded even then there is room for ambiguity to the extent that such a statement as the following the specific gravity of the substance at 50 c is 09010 may mean when compared with water at 50 c or 4 c or even 155 c for practical purposes it should mean the first of these for in the actual experiments the water and the substance are compared at the same temperature and it is well to give the statement of results without any superfluous calculation in the metric system the standard temperature is 4 c for it is at this point that 1 cc of water weighs exactly 1 gram in england the standard temperature is 60 f 155 c which is supposed to be an average temperature of the balanceroom the convenience of the english standard however is merely apparent it demands warming sometimes and sometimes cooling for most purposes it is more convenient to select a temperature sufficiently high to avoid the necessity of cooling at any time warming to the required temperature gives very little trouble determination of specific gravitythere is a quick and easy method of determining the density or sp g of a liquid based upon the fact that a floating body is buoyed up more by a heavy liquid than by a light one the method is more remarkable for speed than accuracy but still is sufficiently exact the piece of apparatus used for the purpose is endowed with a variety of namessp g spindle hydrometer areometer salimeter alcoholimeter lactometer and so on according to the special liquid upon which it is intended to be used it consists of a float with a sinker at one end and a graduated tube or rod at the other it is made of metal or glass generally two are required one for liquids ranging in sp g from 1000 to 2000 and another which will indicate a sp g between 0700 and 1000 the range depends on the size of the instrument for special work in which variations within narrow limits are to be determined more delicate instruments with a narrower range are made illustration fig 34 in using a hydrometer the liquid to be tested is placed in a cylinder fig 34 tall enough to allow the instrument to float and not too narrow the temperature is taken and the hydrometer is immersed in the fluid the mark on the hydrometer stem level with the surface of the liquid is read off with transparent liquids it is best to read the mark under and over the water surface and take the mean the graduation of hydrometers is not made to any uniform system those marked in degrees baum or twaddell or according to specific gravity are most commonly used the degrees on baums hydrometer agree among themselves in being at equal distances along the stem but they are proportional neither to the specific gravity nor to the percentage of salt in the solution they may be converted into an ordinary statement of specific gravity by the following formul sp g 14431443degrees baum or putting the rule in words subtract the degrees baum from 1443 and divide 1443 with the number thus obtained for example 32 baum equals a sp g of 1285 1443144332 14431123 1285 this rule is for liquids heavier than water for the lighter liquids the rule is as follows sp g 146136 degrees baum or in words divide 146 by the number of degrees baum added to 136 for example ammonia of 30 beaum has a sp g of 0880 nearly 14613630 146166 08795 a simple series of calculations enables one to convert a beaum hydrometer into one showing the actual sp g graduation according to sp g is the most convenient for general purposes in these instruments the distances between the divisions become less as the densities increase twaddells hydrometer is graduated in this way each degree twaddell is 0005 in excess of unity to convert into sp g multiply the degrees twaddell by 0005 and add 1 for example 25 twaddell equals a sp g of 1125 25005 0125 1000 1125 there is a practice which ignores the decimal point and speaks of a sp g of 1125 instead of 1125 in some cases it is convenient and inasmuch as no substance has a real sp g of much over 20 it can lead to no confusion the figures expressed in this way represent the weight of a litre in grams some hydrometers are graduated so as to show at a glance the percentage composition of the liquid they are intended to be used with gaylussac designed one to show the alcoholic strength of mixtures of alcohol and water the construction of others upon the same principle is easy and perhaps useful but when the principle is applied to complex liquids and mixed solutions it is misleading the various methods of graduation ought all to give place to one showing a simple statement of the sp g the method of determining sp g with the hydrometer is obviously inapplicable to the case of solids and in the case of liquids it should not be used where exact figures are required there are several other methods which may be used but on the whole those with the specific gravity bottle are most convenient illustration fig 35 the specific gravity bottle fig 35 is a light flask of about 25 cc capacity provided with a wellfitting perforated stopper it is essentially a graduated flask which measures a constant volume but it does not much matter what the volume is in taking the sp g of a liquid or what is the same thing a fused solid there is wanted the weights 1 of the flaskful of water and 2 of the flaskful of the liquid dividing the second by the first gives the required sp g the actual weighings required are 1 of the dry and empty flask 2 of the flask filled with water and 3 of the flask filled with the liquid the weighing of the flask once made need not be often repeated it is well to do so now and then for safetys sake but one weighing will serve for a large number of determinations the same remarks apply to the weighing of the bottle filled with water the bottle is dried by rinsing out first with alcohol and afterwards with ether ether is very volatile and a short exposure in a warm place will soon drive off the little remaining about the sides the ether vapour should be sucked out through a glass tube see that the bore of the stopper is dry as well as the bottle let the dry bottle stand in the box of the balance for a minute or two before weighing the weight is strictly speaking not that of the empty bottle but of the bottle filled with air the empty bottle would weigh from 20 to 30 milligrams less correcting for this would in most cases only make a difference in the fourth place of decimals8 so that it is better to ignore the error the weight of the flask filled with water is got by filling it with distilled water and inserting the stopper the excess of water will overflow at the margin and through the bore the bottle is wiped with a soft dry cloth taking care not to squeeze or warm the bottle the bottle will remain filled to the top of the stopper it is allowed to stand in the balance box for a minute or two and then weighed distilled water as stated should be used the use of ordinary water may increase the weight by 5 or 6 milligrams many waters if they have not previously been boiled give off bubbles of air which render the weighing worthless the temperature of the water is of greater importance lowering the temperature 2 will increase the weight by 10 or 12 milligrams a beaker of water may be warmed or cooled to the required temperature then the bottle is filled from it and quickly weighed if the balanceroom is cooler than the water the latter will draw back into the bottle and a few small bubbles of air will enter but even in extreme cases this will only increase the weight by a very small fraction of a milligram there is more trouble caused when the room is warmer for the liquid then expands and protrudes as a drop resting on the top of the stopper there will in this case be loss by evaporation which in the case of the more volatile liquids such as alcohol is serious to prevent this loss as well as any that may arise by overflow the stopper should be dilated above into a small cup a fig 36 which may itself be stoppered in a bottle of this kind the neck of the stopper is graduated and the bottle is considered full when the liquid stands at the level of the mark in the neck on inserting the stopper the liquid rises into the cup and is reduced to the level of the mark by absorption with pieces of filterpaper illustration fig 36 for most purposes however there is no need for cooling and allowing room for subsequent expansion the assayer as a rule can select his own standard temperature and may choose one which will always necessitate warming it will be handier in this case to have a bottle with a thermometer stopper of the two types shown in fig 37 that with the external thermometer tube a is more generally useful illustration fig 37 the bottle is filled at a lower temperature and is then gently warmed so as to slowly raise the temperature to the required degree the superfluous liquid is then at once wiped off and the bottle cooled and weighed the weight of the flask filled with the liquid whose sp g has to be determined is ascertained in a similar way of course the temperature must be the same if the liquid does not mix with water the bottle should be dried before filling but otherwise the flask need only be rinsed out two or three times with the liquid having obtained the three weighings deduct the weight of the bottle from each of the others to get the weights of the water and liquid respectively divide the latter by the former the result shows the sp g as an example take the following in which a rather large sp g bottle was used 1 weight of bottle 39299 gram 2 weight of bottle and water 81884 3 weight of bottle and paraffin 73146 by subtracting 1 from 2 and 3 the result is as follows 81884 grams 73146 grams 39299 39299 42585 of water 33847 of paraffin divide the weight of the paraffin by that of the water 4258533847007948 298095 the sp g of the paraffin is 07948 the sp g of a fusible solid may be obtained in the same way at a temperature some degrees above its fusing point the sp g of a solid in powder or gravel sufficiently fine to pass through the neck of the bottle is easily determined if the bottle filled with water weighs 50 grams and there is placed on the pan alongside of it 20 grams of a sand the weight of the two together will of course be 70 grams but if the sand is put in the bottle it evidently displaces its own bulk of water and if on again weighing the weight is found to be 62 instead of 70 grams it is because the 20 grams of sand has displaced 8 grams of water bulk for bulk the sand is 212 times as heavy in practice the weight of the bottle filled with water will probably be already known if not it must be determined a certain quantity say 20 grams of the powdered substance is then transferred carefully to the bottle the bottle need not be dry inside but its neck and outside must be in making this transference a careful worker will make no loss and the mode of working saves a little time but it is better to weigh the dry flask put into it 10 to 20 grams of the powder and weigh again the increase in weight gives accurately the weight of powder in the bottle about twothirds fill the bottle with distilled water and mix with the powder by gentle shaking air bubbles will disentangle themselves and rise to the surface of the water wash back anything adhering to the stopper with a jet of water and fill the bottle almost to overflowing allow it to stand for a minute or so replace the stopper warm to the required temperature take off the superfluous moisture wipe and weigh as an example take the following 1 weight of bottle 12681 grams 2 bottle filled with water 37708 3 bottle with wolfram 40821 4 bottle with wolfram and water 61199 subtract 1 from 3 to get the weight of wolfram taken 40821 grams 12681 28140 add the weight of the wolfram to the weight of the bottle filled with water 28140 grams 37708 65848 subtract 4 from this to get the weight of water displaced 65848 grams 61199 4649 divide the weight of the wolfram by the weight of the water displaced to get sp g 4649281406053 27894 if the solid is soluble in water or has a tendency to float some liquid other than water is used paraffin oil or oil of turpentine will do the process is as followsthe weight of the dry and empty bottle having been determined add a sufficiency of the substance and weigh again to find how much has been added fill up with paraffin oil and weigh again clean out the substance by rinsing with paraffin fill up and weigh calculate the sp g as if water had been used and multiply by the sp g of the paraffin for example 1 weight of bottle 39299 grams 2 bottle and nitre 57830 3 bottle and paraffin 73146 4 bottle and paraffin and nitre 84665 5 bottle and water 81884 first from 13 and 5 calculate the sp g of the paraffin as already shown it will be 07948 deduct 1 from 2 to get the weight of the nitre 57830 grams 39299 18531 add this to 3 18531 grams 73146 91677 and deduct 4 to find the weight of the equal bulk of paraffin 91677 grams 84665 7012 divide the weight of the nitre by the weight of the paraffin 70121853126427 the sp g taking paraffin as the standard instead of water is 26427 multiply this by the sp g of paraffin 07948 and the result is 21004 as the sp g of nitre compared with water similarly a sp g compared with water at say 50 c can be converted into one compared with water at standard temperature by multiplying by the sp g of water at 50 c the following table gives the sp g of water at various temperatures degrees degrees degrees centigradesp gcentigradesp gcentigradesp g 4 10000 20 09982 40 09923 10 09997 25 09971 50 09881 15 09991 30 09957 100 09586 if for example a substance at 50 c has a sp g of 09010 as compared with water at 50 c it will have compared with water at 4 c a sp g of 0901009881 or 08903 the figures 08903 represent the sp g of the substance at 50 c compared with water at 4 c except in comparing the sp gravities of the same substance at different temperatures a calculation of this kind serves no useful purpose in taking the specific gravity of a solid not in powder a lump of it is freed from loose particles and its exact weight determined by means of a horse hair with a slip knot it is suspended to the balance and beneath it is placed out of contact with the balance pan a beaker of distilled water the horse hair must be long enough to keep the mineral well beneath the surface of the water so as to allow the balance to vibrate air bubbles are removed by touching with a camelhair pencil whilst the mineral is suspended in water the weight is again taken it will weigh less than before and the difference between the two weighings gives the weight of water and consequently the volume displaced by the mineral the weight in air divided by the difference is the specific gravity thus weight in air 32170 grams weight in water 27050 difference 05120 gram 3217005120 equals 628 the sp g the sp g of a substance depends mainly on its composition but is affected by certain conditions the effect of temperature has been already considered air holes and empty spaces lessen the specific gravity of otherwise solid bodies and metals which after fusion become imperfect solids have their density increased by hammering or rolling but metals when free from pores have their density diminished when rolled without annealing the effects of these conditions are slight when compared with those due to the presence of impurities for simple substances or mixtures of only two substances a determination of sp g is a sufficient check on the composition for many practical purposes and with more complex mixtures such as slags and some of the products of dressing operations in which the material does not differ much in its nature from time to time such a determination will yield information of considerable value and afford a check upon the proper working of a process when the mixing of two substances is accompanied by a change in volume the sp g of the mixture can only be learnt by experiment but when the substances have no such action on each other the resulting sp g can be calculated some of these calculations have a practical interest as well as an educational value students should practise them so as to become familiar with the relations between weight and volume when substances are mixed by volume the sp g of the mixture is the mean of those of its constituents and may be calculated in the usual way for obtaining averages 1 cc of a substance having a sp g of 14 mixed with 1 cc of another having a sp g of 10 will yield 2 cc of a substance having a sp g of 12 if however we write gram instead of cc in the above statement the resulting sp g will be 116 the simplest plan is to remember that the sp g is the weight divided by the volume sp g wv and the sp g of a mixture is the sum of the weights divided by the sum of the volumes sp g w w w cv v v c in the above example the sum of the volumes is 2 cc the weights got by multiplying each volume by its corresponding sp g are 14 gram and 1 gram the sum of the weights divided by the sum of the volumes is 242 or 12 the sp g of a mixture of 10 cc of a substance having a sp g of 12 with 15 cc of another having a sp g of 15 may be thus found sp g 122251015 138 multiply each volume by its sp g to get its weight 1012 12 1515 225 add these together 12225 345 and divide by the sum of the volumes 1015 25 25345138 25 95 c the sp g will be 138 provided the mixture is not accompanied by any change of volume the same formula will serve when the proportion of the ingredients is given by weight a mixture of 4 parts by weight of galena sp g 75 with 5 parts of blende sp g 4 will have a sp g of 506 sp g 45053125 9178 506 it is necessary in this case to calculate the volumes of the galena and of the blende which is done by dividing the weights by the sp gravities thus 4 divided by 75 gives 053 and 5 divided by 4 gives 125 the converse problem is a little more difficult given the sp g of a mixture and of each of the two ingredients the percentage by weight of the heavier ingredient may be ascertained by the following rule which is best expressed as a formula there are three sp gravities given if the highest be written h the lowest l and that of the mixture m then percentage of heavier mineral 100hmlmhl suppose a sample of tailings has a sp g of 30 and is made up of quartz sp g 26 and pyrites sp g 51 then the percentage of pyrites is 27 1005132635126 51004325 20475 272 the same problem could be solved with the help of a little algebra by the rule already given as thus the sp g of a mixture equals the sum of the weights of the constituents divided by the sum of the volumes then 100 grams of the tailings with x per cent of pyrites contain 100x per cent of quartz the sum of the weights is 100 the volume of the pyrites is x51 and of the quartz 100x26 then we have by the rule 3 100x51100x26 3 132651025x 204 75x and x 272 if the percentage p and sp g h of one constituent and the sp g m of the mixture are known the sp g of the other constituent may be calculated by the following formula in which x is the required sp g x 100pmh100hpm for example tailings sp g 30 containing 272 per cent of pyrites sp g 51 will contain 100272 728 per cent of earthy matter having a mean sp g of x x 100272351100512723 1113844284 26 the differences in sp g corresponding to differences in strength have been carefully determined and tabulated in the case of the stronger acids and of many other liquids such tables are given at the end of this book to calculate the weight of a measured volume of mineral or rockmultiply the cubic feet by 624 and then multiply by the sp g of the stuff the answer gives the weight in pounds for example 100 cubic feet of quartz weighs 10062426 16224 lbs the weight of any mass of mineral of known extent and sp g is ascertained in this way the following table gives the specific gravities of some of the commoner minerals barytes 45 blende 40 calcite 26 cassiterite 69 chalybite 38 copper pyrites 42 fluor 31 galena 75 hmatite 50 mispickel 62 pyrites 50 quartz 26 footnotes 8 the difference of 20 or 30 milligrams is disregarded here because it detracts equally from the actual weight of the water and liquid to be determined if the liquid is a heavy one the difference shows itself in the third or second place of decimals the correction may be made by deducting from the weight of the flask 00012 grams for each gram of water it holds part iithe metals chapter ix silver gold cyanides platinum mercury silver silver is widely diffused and has been found in most mining districts it occurs native in sufficient quantity to constitute one of the chief ores of the metal it also occurs combined with sulphur as in argentite with sulphur and antimony as in stephanite or brittle silver ore and in pyrargyrite or ruby silver and with copper sulphur antimony and arsenic as in polybasite chloride of silver occurs native as horn silver or kerargyrite silver is found in the ores of other metals such as fahlerz which sometimes contains from two to ten per cent of the metal and galena which is an important source of it in fact galena is never found entirely free from silver it is present also in greater or less quantity in the ores of copper and zinc silver dissolves readily in nitric acid forming silver nitrate it only forms one family of salts and of these the chloride and nitrate are of chief importance to the assayer the formation of the chloride of silver on the addition of hydrochloric acid or a soluble chloride to the nitric acid solution serves for the recognition and separation of silver the precipitated chloride is white becoming violet on exposure to light insoluble in nitric acid soluble in ammonia hyposulphite of soda or concentrated solutions of chlorides the best confirmatory test is made by wrapping the precipitate in a little sheet lead and cupelling when the silver will be left in the metallic state and is easily recognized dry assaythis assay is made up of two parts 1 the concentration of the silver in a button of lead and 2 the cupellation of the resulting alloy the concentration of the button of lead may be effected either by scorification or by fusion in a crucible the scorification assay is performed in a scorifier which is a shallow openmouthed dish about 212 inches across with a very thick bottom to enable it to withstand the corrosive action of the slag a charge of more than 3 or 5 grams of the ore cannot be worked in one and with such small charges the unavoidable variations have a serious effect on the figures reported a difference of one milligram on the weight of the button of silver got represents a difference of 6 or 10 ounces per ton with rich ores such variation is unavoidable under any conditions and the only safe plan is to take the mean of several assays but with poorer ores the accuracy of the assay as well as convenience in working is much increased by working in a crucible with larger charges in scorification the proportion of lead required for scorifying 1 gram of ore is in average cases from 10 to 15 grams sinking in the case of galena to 2 grams and rising with earthy and refractory substances to from 30 to 40 grams but by fusing in a crucible with wellselected fluxes a proportion of 4 of flux to 1 of ore is generally sufficient and not only is the proportion of added matter less but it is also easier to manipulate large quantities in crucibles so that although in some cases the crucible assay is more troublesome and less satisfactory yet with poor and earthy ores it is the best method of dealing with them while when properly worked it yields results as accurate as scorification does as a general rule if more than 5 grams of ore must be taken the crucible assay should be adopted illustration fig 38 scorification assaythe charge of ore is usually 3 grams sometimes 5 the lead varies from 30 to 70 grams and the quantity of soda borax or powdered glass added varies from 03 to 3 or 4 grams it is generally recommended to have the lead granulated9 and to mix the ore with about half of it in the scorifier then to put on the rest of the lead and finally to sprinkle the borax or glass on the top it answers just as well however to use the lead in the shape of foil and wrap the ore up in it and if the ore contains much sulphur the borax may with advantage be added wrapped in a little tissue paper some five or ten minutes after the operation has started illustration fig 39 the process of scorification is as followsa scorifier fig 38 of convenient size having been selected one 212 inches across is most generally useful it is dried at a gentle heat for about ten minutes the charge is then put into it and it is introduced with the help of a scorifier tongs fig 39 into a muffle heated considerably above redness the muffle is then closed and when the metal has melted down it is opened but the temperature is kept up a ring of slag will after a time form around the metal and when this appearance known as the eye presents itself the temperature may be lowered when the eye has disappearedthat is when the layer of slag has quite closed ina pinch of powdered culm wrapped in tissue paper is added as soon as the slag has again become tranquil the scorifier is taken out and its contents are poured into a mould fig 40 the slag is detached and saved if the button of metal weighs more than 30 grams its size is reduced by another scorification in the same scorifier which should have been replaced in the muffle immediately after the contents had been poured out if the ore is not a very rich one the button of lead will carry practically all the silver but with rich ores it is more satisfactory to save the slag and subsequently to melt it down with the cupel on which the lead has been treated so as to recover the silver lost in the slag together with that absorbed in the cupel at one operation or if the cupellation loss is neglected or calculated in some other manner the slag or slags from the scorifier may be powdered and mixed with 20 grams of oxide of lead 5 grams of borax and 1 gram of charcoal this should be melted down in a small crucible and the resulting button of lead cupelled illustration fig 40 if the scorification has been unsatisfactory the quantity of silver obtained from the slag will be by no means inconsiderable the usual explanation is that with sulphury ores compounds of metallic oxides and sulphides oxysulphides are formed which remain in the slag retaining considerable quantities of the precious metal it is said that under certain conditions such a slag may contain as much as 10 per cent of silver an excess of lead and a high temperature prevents the formation of these oxysulphides but if much silver is present in the ore the slag cannot be safely thrown away even if sulphur is absent and the process has been satisfactorily performed if the crust which appears on the surface of the lead does not clear add a small lump of borax and 20 grams more lead then close the muffle and keep the temperature as high as possible if the slag forms properly but shows unfused or only halffused lumps even when the scorification has proceeded for some time add more borax and stir with an iron rod the slag adhering to the rod must be detached by hammering and replaced in the scorifier if the ore consists largely of quartz soda should be added instead of borax or if it contains much copper powdered quartz may be used if the scorifier at the end of an operation is more than usually corroded the borax should be replaced in subsequent assays on similar ores by powdered glass or quartz if a fairly fluid slag is formed which does not clear from the metal and show the eye more lead and a higher temperature is wanted as a general rule it may be stated that when a scorification is unsatisfactory what is wanted is more heat more lead or more borax it is a safe plan when work has to be done on a strange ore to make three or four assays with varying quantities of lead the proportion of lead is right when a further addition does not yield a higher result the proper proportion having been found a note of it should be made for future use pot assays the object of the fusion in a crucible like that of scorification is to concentrate the silver in a button of lead which is to be subsequently cupelled and to retain the earthy and waste matters in the slag it is necessary to consider the quality of the slag and the weight and quality of the lead the slag when fused should be liquid and homogeneous and not too corrosive on the crucible the button of lead should be soft malleable and free from a coating of regulus10 in weight it should not differ much from the ore taken with 20 grams of ore for example a button of lead weighing from 18 to 25 grams will be satisfactory less than this would leave an undue proportion of silver in the slag and more would be unnecessarily large for cupelling and would increase the loss in that operation with average ores take 20 grams of the powdered ore and mix with 30 grams of soda 40 grams of redlead or litharge 5 grams of borax and from 2 to 25 grams of flour and place in an e crucible battersea round put these in the furnace at a red heat cover the crucible and gradually raise the temperature until the whole charge has melted down and is in a state of tranquil fusion pour into a mould and replace the crucible in the furnace as soon as the lead is solid detach the slag and put it back into the crucible and when it is again fluid charge on to it with a copper scoop a mixture of 20 grams of oxide of lead and 1 gram of charcoal when fusion has again become tranquil pour and detach the button of lead the lead buttons should be hammered into discs with rounded edges and be freed from slag if too big for a cupel they may be scorified together in a small scorifier but it is better to cupel them separately ores containing metallic oxidesperoxides of iron manganese and copper interfere by counteracting the effect of the charcoal or flour and thus reducing the size of the lead button peroxide of iron will reduce the weight of lead by a little more than its own weight and peroxide of manganese has about twice this effect when these oxides are present an additional quantity of flour must be used and precautions must be taken to prevent reoxidation of the slag by the furnace gases this may best be prevented by using a layer of common salt as a cover to the charge when the ores contain a good deal of quartz or stony matter the fluxes just given for average ores will do but the proportion of soda should be diminished and that of the borax oxide of lead and flour increased as the quantity of metallic oxides become greater if the ore contains practically no quartz the soda may be altogether omitted and some glass or powdered quartz added the following charge may be taken as an example weigh up 20 grams of the powdered ore 15 grams each of soda and borax 60 grams of oxide of lead and 5 grams of flour mix and place them in an e crucible and cover with a layer of from a quarter to half an inch of common salt place in the furnace as before the salt will give off a considerable amount of fume which will to a certain extent conceal the state of the charge when the crucible has been in the furnace for about 25 minutes remove it and pour out the contents immediately with ores that produce a thick slag the addition of 5 grams of fluor spar will be an advantage it may happen that with an unknown ore the first assay will be more or less unsatisfactory but from it the necessity for adding more or less flour will be learnt and a second assay with the necessary modification of the charge should give a good result ores containing much sulphidesores of this class may be easily recognized either by the appearance of the minerals they contain or by the odour of sulphurous oxide so2 which they evolve when roasted on a spatula the sulphides most commonly present in addition to the sulphurized minerals of silver are pyrites galena blende and mispickel when they are present in only a moderate amount their effect is simply to increase the weight of the button of lead and this is easily counteracted by reducing the amount of flour or by omitting it when in larger amounts they not only yield large buttons but also render the metal sulphury sometimes even giving a button of regulus instead of lead this last evil may be remedied 1 by putting in a rod of iron as soon as the charge has fused or 2 it may be counteracted by a proper addition of nitre or 3 when the sulphides present are only those of iron or copper the sulphur may be removed by calcining and the ore converted into one of the class containing metallic oxides the calcination is effected as followsweigh up 20 grams of the powdered ore and place it in a widemouthed crucible sufficiently large to perform the subsequent melting down in the roasting must be done at a gentle heat at first so as to avoid clotting the mouth of the crucible should project considerably above the coke and should slope forward towards the worker the charge must be occasionally stirred with the stirrer fig 10 so as to expose fresh surfaces to the action of the air and to prevent adhesion to the sides of the crucible the stirrer should not be removed till the calcination is finished the temperature should be raised at the end to a good red heat and to ensure the decomposition of any sulphate that may be formed the roasted ore should be rubbed up in a mortar with a pinch of anthracite and again calcined it is then mixed with fluxes as described and fused in the same crucible the calcination of an ore is a work occupying a good deal of time and in most cases it is better to take advantage of the desulphurizing power of red lead or nitre red lead by itself will do but a large quantity of it will be required 1 part of a metallic sulphide needs from 20 to 50 parts of red lead to yield a button free from sulphur whereas at most from 2 to 212 parts of nitre are sufficient there is sometimes an advantage in having a considerable excess of oxide of lead in the slag but where there is no such reason 2 parts of red lead to 1 of ore is enough a charge which will do for most sulphides is the following 20 grams of ore 40 to 100 grams of red lead 20 grams of soda 5 of borax and sufficient nitre or perhaps flour to give a button of about 25 grams of lead how much this must be if not already known may be approximately determined by fusing 3 grams of the ore and 3 grams of soda in a small crucible c with 50 grams of litharge not red lead under a cover of salt and weighing the resulting button of lead subtract 3 from the weight of lead obtained and the difference multiplied by 13 will give the quantity in grams of nitre required if the button of lead weighs less than 3 grams flour must be added if this is not satisfactory repeat the assay adding an extra gram of nitre for each 4 grams of lead in excess of that required or 1 gram of flour for a 12gram deficiency in the method in which iron is used as a desulphurising agent only as much oxide of lead should be added as will give a button of lead of the required size rather a large button of lead should be got and the slag should be strongly alkaline if the ore does not already carry a large amount of sulphur some should be added the fusion should be performed at a low temperature similar to that for a galena assay and should be continued for some time after it has become tranquil take 20 grams of the ore 40 grams of soda 40 grams of oxide of lead and 5 or 10 grams of borax place this mixture in a crucible with a rod of iron as in the galena assay cover and fuse for about half an hour take out the rod washing it in the slag and in a minute or two pour clean and cupel the button of lead general remarks on the fusionother things being equal the smaller the quantity of the slag the better provided there is sufficient to cover the metal the presence of peroxides of the heavy metals is prejudicial since they tend to increase the quantity of silver retained in the slag it may be given as a general rule that when iron copper manganese c are present there is a more than ordinary need for cleaning the slags and care must be taken to keep these metals in the state of lower oxide in selecting the fluxes it should be remembered that soda is the best for quartz and borax for lime and metallic oxides and that with ores almost free from gangue some quartz or glass should be added to protect the crucible two parts of soda are enough to flux 1 part of quartz whilst of borax or oxide of lead 4 parts are barely sufficient oxide of lead has the advantage of being heavy and so does not occupy much space in the crucible on the other hand if the melting down be performed too quickly or if oxide of lead only is used this high specific gravity is a disadvantage for the lighter earthy matter floats as a pasty mass on the more fluid oxide of lead and thus escapes its action when metallic sulphides are present in the ore an excess of oxide of lead helps to keep the sulphur out of the button of metal in addition to the oxide of lead required as a flux some will be required to provide the lead in which the silver is to be collected oxide of lead mixed with charcoal or flour yields when heated a multitude of minute buttons of metal uniformly distributed through the mass of the charge as the charge melts down these run together and fall to the bottom this shower of lead collects the silver more easily than a single button at the bottom of the crucible could do only that portion of the oxide of lead which remains in the slag can be considered as a flux very often the first indication of an excessive reduction of lead is the pastiness of the slag rendered thick by the withdrawal of the oxide of lead which would have kept it fluid if in an assay it is found that 5 parts of flux are not sufficient for 1 part of ore the remedy lies in using a different flux rather than in taking a larger quantity on the reducing effect of charcoal flour and tartarthe weight to be got from a given charge will depend provided sufficient oxide of lead is present upon the proportion of the reducing agents in it we have thought it well to illustrate this part of the subject by a series of experiments which the learner will do well to practise for himself before proceeding to the assay of actual ores take 80 grams of litharge and 20 grams of a mixture of borax and soda fuse three lots 1 with 15 gram of charcoal 2 with 3 grams of flour and 3 with 75 grams of tartar weigh the buttons of lead obtained and divide each by the weight of reducing agent used the results will differ somewhat with the dryness and quality of the flour etc used in one series of experiments they were as follows gram grams gram grams 15 charcoal gave 340 lead 1 charcoal 226 lead 30 flour 335 1 flour 112 75 tartar 380 1 tartar 50 the use of flour as a reducing agent has many advantages and it is well to remember that 1 gram of flour reduces about 11 grams of lead and that charcoal has twice and tartar onehalf this reducing effect on the reducing effect of charcoal c on red leadit is often easier to obtain red lead of good quality than it is litharge and by a large number of assayers red lead is the form of oxide of lead always used red lead however contains an excess of oxygen which will use up some of the reducing agent before lead separates out on making a series of experiments similar to the last but using 80 grams of red lead instead of the litharge the results were with the same quantities of the reducing agents with charcoal 18 grams of lead flour 18 tartar 22 comparing these with the results with litharge in the previous table it will be seen that the same quantity of reducing agent has in each case brought down 16 grams less of lead so that a larger amount of the reducing agent must be added to get a button of the same weight as that obtained with litharge to get a button of a desired weight say 22 grams we must add reducing agent sufficient to throw down 22 16 or 38 grams of lead which would require 34 grams of flour if this amount of flour is fused with 80 grams of red lead a button of lead weighing 22 grams will be formed the other 16 grams being kept up by the oxygen of the red lead if the quantity of red lead differs from 80 grams this rule must be modified with 40 grams of red lead for example we should add an excess of reducing agent sufficient to throw down 8 grams of lead instead of 16 similarly with 160 grams of red lead we should add enough to throw down 32 grams the following rule will enable one to calculate the weight of flour required to produce a button of lead of any desired weight from any given quantity of red lead each 5 grams of red lead present diminishes the weight of the lead by 1 gram if then we divide the weight of red lead in a charge by 5 and add this to the weight of lead required the sum divided by 11 will give the weight of flour which must be added using 80 grams of red lead and wanting a button of 20 grams we should add 33 grams of flour 805 16 1620 36 3611 33 nearly the following are some results obtained which will illustrate the rule red lead used flour used lead got 40 grams 3 grams 250 grams 100 3 135 80 4 300 80 5 400 on the reducing effect of metallic sulphides and the counteracting effect of nitrethe sulphides found in ores will reduce a button of lead from oxide of lead just as flour does and as charcoal flour and tartar differ in their reducing power so equal weights of the different mineral sulphides throw down different weights of lead one gram of iron pyrites yields about 11 grams of lead one gram of copper pyrites blende fahlerz or mispickel yields 7 or 8 grams of lead whilst 1 gram of antimonite will give 6 and 1 gram of galena only a little over 3 grams it is evident that if an ore carries much of these sulphides the quantity of lead reduced will be very much larger than that required for an assay to counteract this effect nitre is added 1 gram is added for each 4 grams of lead in excess of that required for example with a 20gram charge of an ore containing 50 per cent of pyrites if no nitre were added 110 grams of lead would be got or if there was not sufficient oxide of lead to yield this quantity of metal the button would be sulphury to reduce the weight of the button by 80 grammes we should add 20 grams of nitre if litharge were used or if red lead were used we should add 16 grams of nitre since the oxidizing effect of 20 grams of red lead is equivalent to that of 1 of nitre and since 80 grams of red lead are generally used in a charge two assays of an ore of this kind with these quantities of nitre gave 260 grams of lead with litharge and 225 grams with red lead it is best to use in these assays 80 grams of red lead 20 of soda and 5 of borax with 20 grams of the ore if the lead got by the preliminary fusion in a small crucible with litharge described under ores containing much sulphides is known the following table will indicate the quantity of nitre or flour to be added with this charge lead got in preliminary fusion flour to be added nitre to be added with 3 grams of ore to the assay to the assay 00 gram 33 grams none 30 grams 13 gram 60 none 40 grams 90 90 120 140 150 190 180 240 210 290 if litharge is used in the assay instead of red lead 4 grams more nitre or 15 gram less flour must be used when more than a few grams of nitre are added to a charge the proportion of soda and borax should be increased because one of the products of the reaction of nitre upon sulphides in the presence of soda is sulphate of soda and because the soda thus used up no longer serves as a flux more borax should be added as it is the best flux for the metallic oxides which are formed in the process if in an assay too large a button of lead is got even after this calculation has been made and the assay is repeated add 1 gram more nitre for each 4 grams of lead in excess sometimes the assay appears tranquil before the nitre has produced its full effect in such cases it is well to seize the crucible with the tongs and mix its fused contents by rotating them if this causes an effervescence the crucible should be replaced in the fire and the fusion continued the following experiments will illustrate the extent to which the above rules may be relied on in all of them the standard flux was used viz80 grams of red lead 20 of soda and 5 of

15 5 nitre 5 5 75 11 lead got 335 335 130 140 195 227 the variation in some of these experiments in which we might have expected similar results is due to the fact that the sulphur and in some cases the metals are capable of two degrees of oxidation for example theoretically 1 gram of iron pyrites fes2 would yield 86 grams of lead if the sulphur were oxidised to sulphurous oxide so2 and the iron to ferrous oxide feo whilst if the sulphur were oxidised to sulphate so3 and the iron to ferric oxide 129 grams of lead will be thrown down similarly the yield with copper pyrites would be 75 or 116 with blende 64 or 85 with antimonite 55 or 8 and with galena 26 or 34 as regards the metals the lower oxide will always be formed if the assay is carried out properly fused under a cover and with a sufficiency of reducing agent but the proportion of sulphur oxidised completely will vary with the conditions of the assay with a slag containing much soda the tendency will be to form sulphate and in consequence a big reduction of lead whilst with an acid slag containing much quartz the tendency will be for the sulphur to go off as sulphurous oxide so2 in a fusion with litharge alone all the sulphur will be liberated as the lower oxide whilst with much soda it will be wholly converted into sulphate for example 3 grams of an ore containing a good deal of pyrites and a little galena gave when fused with litharge 165 grams of lead a similar charge containing in addition 200 grams of soda gave 225 grams of lead it will be noted from the experiments that 1 gram of nitre kept up on the average 4 grams of lead the range being from 32 with acid slags to 53 with very basic ones these facts serve to explain some apparently irregular results got in practice cupellation the process is as followsthe cupels which should have been made some time before and stored in a dry place are first cleaned by gentle rubbing with the finger and blowing off the loose dust and then placed in a hot muffle and heated to redness for from 5 to 10 minutes before the alloy to be cupelled is placed on them the reasons for this are sufficiently obvious the sudden evolution of much steam will blow a cupel to pieces and if the whole of the water has not been removed before the cupel is filled with molten lead the escaping steam will bubble through and scatter about particles of the metal if some particles of unburnt carbon remain in the bone ash a similar result will be produced by the escape of bubbles of carbonic acid as soon as the fused litharge comes in contact with them the cupels having been prepared are arranged in a definite order in the muffle and the assay buttons are arranged in a corresponding order on some suitable tray cupel tray fig 41 the heat of the muffle being at bright redness then with the help of the tongs fig 42 the assay buttons should be placed each in its proper cupel a note having been previously made of the position it is to occupy and the door of the muffle closed illustration fig 41 this part of the work should be done promptly so as not to unduly cool the muffle the start requires a fairly high temperature and is a critical part of the process a black crust forms at once on the surface of the lead but this ought soon to fuse and flow in greasy drops from off the face of the metal so as to leave the latter fluid with a welldefined outline and much brighter than the cupel if this clearing does not take place the buttons are said to be frozen in which case the temperature must be raised some pieces of charcoal put in the muffle and the door closed if they still do not clear the heat must have been much too low and it is best to reject them and repeat the assays illustration fig 42 when the buttons have cleared it is well to check the draught of the furnace and to partly open the door of the muffle so as to work at as low a temperature as is compatible with the continuation of the process11 too low a temperature is indicated by the freezing of the buttons and the consequent spoiling of the assays experience soon enables one to judge when the heat is getting too low a commoner error is to have the heat too high it should be remembered that that which was high enough to clear the buttons at starting is more than sufficient to keep the process going at the finish a higher temperature is again required therefore the door of the muffle should be closed and the furnace urged the finish is easily recognised the drops of litharge which in the earlier stages flow steadily from the surface of the alloy thin off later to a luminous film at the end this film appears in commotion then presents a brilliant play of colours and with a sudden extinction the operation is finished the metal again glows for an instant whilst becoming solid if the button is a small one the cupel is withdrawn at once and placed on that square of the cupel tray which corresponds to the position it occupied in the muffle if however it is fairly large precautions must be taken to prevent spirting molten silver dissolves oxygen from the air and gives it off on solidifying the escape of the gas on sudden cooling is violent and by throwing off particles of the metal may cause loss this is called vegetation or spirting the silver is apparently solid when spirting takes place the crust breaks suddenly and some of the metal is forced out the evil is best guarded against by slow cooling and avoiding draughts with large buttons of silver precautions should never be omitted one plan is to allow the cupels to cool in the muffle itself the mouth being closed with hot charcoal another is to cover the cupel with another cupel previously heated to redness in this case the silver cools between two hot cupels and of course cools slowly a third plan is to withdraw the cupel to the door of the muffle holding it until it begins to get solid and then immediately to put it back into the hotter part of the muffle silver remains after cupellation in flattened elliptical buttons adhering but only slightly to the cupel its upper surface should show faint markings as if it were crystalline the presence of platinum renders it still more crystalline but removes the characteristic lustre and renders the metal dull and grey copper if not completely removed has a very marked effect on the appearance of the button the metal is spread out damping as it were and firmly adhering to the cupel which latter in the neighbourhood of the metal is almost black with oxide of copper sometimes the silver button is globular or even more sharply rounded on its under than on its upper surface it is said that this is due to the presence of lead gold may be present even to the extent of 50 per cent without showing any yellow colour the appearance of the cupel affords some useful information the presence of cracks evidently due to shrinkage indicates a badly made cupel if however they are accompanied by a peculiar unfolding of the cupel the margin losing its distinctness it is because of the presence of antimony when lead is the only easily oxidisable metal present the stained portion of cupel is yellow when cold a greenish tint may be due to small quantities of copper or perhaps nickel cobalt or platinum larger quantities of copper give a greenish grey or almost black colour a dark green and corroded cupel may be due to iron rings of palecoloured scoria may be due to tin zinc antimony or arsenic when the cupel shows signs of the presence of these metals in objectionable quantity it is well to repeat the assay and scorify so as to remove them before cupellation the button should be detached from the cold cupel by seizing with a pair of pliers the under surface should be distorted by squeezing or hammering the button so as to loosen the adhering bone ash the cleaning is easily completed by rubbing with a clean hard brush after cleaning the buttons are best put on a tray of marked watchglasses and then taken to the balance and weighed the weight of silver got needs a small correction 1 by deducting for the amount of silver introduced by the lead or oxide of lead used in the assay12 and 2 by adding for the cupellation loss loss in cupellationduring the whole process of cupelling a silver lead alloy a more or less abundant fume may be observed rising from the cupel this furnishes an evident loss of lead and a possible loss of silver for although silver at the temperature of cupellation gives off no appreciable vapour it is known that such fume formed on a large scale contains silver it is however difficult to believe that the small amount of lead vapourised carries with it a weighable amount of silver that it does not do so in the ordinary way of working is shown by the fact that a button of silver equal in weight to the silver lost in cupelling may be got by smelting the cupel and cupelling the resulting button of lead the loss of silver by volatilisation is altogether inconsiderable unless the temperature at which the operation is performed is much too high another possible source of loss is the infiltration of small particles of alloy into the cupel the cupel is necessarily porous and particles of metal may perhaps drain into it more especially if the bone ash is not in fine powder but if this is the main source of loss it is hard to see why in cupelling equal weights of silver and gold the loss is not equal in each case it is not easy to believe that the mere filtration of the fused alloy will effect such a change in the proportion of the metals as that which actually occurs for example a cupel on which an alloy consisting of 080 gram of silver 047 gram of gold and 25 grams of lead had been cupelled was found to contain 712 milligrams of silver and rather less than half a milligram of gold assuming for the sake of argument that the gold present had filtered into the cupel in the form of small drops of alloy it would have been accompanied by less than a milligram of silver and the presence of the extra 6 or 7 milligrams of silver must have been due to a different cause there can thus be little doubt that the cause of the greater part of the cupellation loss is a chemical one and cannot be counteracted by a mechanical contrivance13 in cupellation then there is a loss apart from imperfect working inherent in the process itself and as the amount of this loss varies under different conditions it is necessary to study it somewhat in detail the following experiments are taken without selection from the work of one student three experiments were made for each determination and the mean result is given by range is meant the difference between the highest and lowest result and the percentage loss is calculated on the silver present the silver added in the lead used has been deducted effect of varying leadin each experiment 04 gram of silver was taken and cupelled with the lead the silver loss and range are expressed in milligrams lead used silver lost range percentage loss grams 10 65 10 162 20 70 10 175 40 120 15 300 60 127 05 317 the loss increases with the lead used effect of varying temperature04 gram of silver was cupelled with 20 grams of lead temperature silver lost range percentage loss bright red 70 10 175 clear yellow 173 17 432 the difference in temperature in these experiments was much greater than would occur even with careless work effect of varying silver20 grams of lead were used in each cupellation silver taken silver lost range percentage loss milligrams 125 07 02 56 250 14 01 56 500 16 04 32 1000 29 03 29 2000 56 05 28 4000 70 10 17 8000 97 10 12 it will be seen that although the quantity of silver lost increases with the silver present the percentage loss is greater on the smaller buttons the following results are often quotedcupelling 1 grain of silver with 10 grains of lead the loss was 122 per cent 10 grains of silver with 100 grains of lead loss 113 per cent 25 grains of silver cupelled with 250 grains of lead lost 107 per cent the proportion of silver to lead was the same in the three experiments and the largest button gave the best result evidently if the quantities of lead had been the same in the three experiments say 250 grains in each case the loss on the smaller quantities of silver would appear worse in the comparison in judging these results it must be borne in mind that it is difficult to regulate the temperature c in consecutive experiments so as to get exactly similar results so that the range in consecutive cupellations is greater than that in a batch cupelled side by side effect of copper and antimony01 gram of silver was cupelled with 20 grams of lead and to one batch 05 gram of antimony and to another 05 gram of copper was added loss in silver lost range percentage without addition 29 03 29 with antimony 32 02 32 with copper 49 17 49 perhaps the antimony has so small an effect because it is eliminated in the earlier part of the process while the silver is still alloyed with and protected by a large proportion of lead whilst the copper on the other hand makes its fiercest attack towards the close when the silver is least capable of resisting it the ill effects of copper are most strongly felt when the quantity of lead present is not sufficient to remove it the coppery button of silver got under these conditions is very considerably less than the weight of silver originally taken although the above is a fair statement of the loss attending average work it will not do in very important and exact work to place too much reliance on the figures given or indeed on any other set of figures with the object of correcting the result of an assay each man must rely on his own work it is easy to determine what allowance must be made for the loss in cupellation by cupelling side by side with the assay piece an alloy of similar and known composition for if the two pieces are very nearly alike we may justly conclude that the loss on each will be the same and if further we take the average of three or four such determinations we shall get results accurate within 01 per cent the method of getting such results may be best explained by one or two illustrations this method of working is termed assaying by checks suppose we have an alloy of silver and lead in unknown proportions and that by cupelling two lots of 10 grams each there is got from i 01226 gram of silver and from ii 01229 gram we should know from general experience that the actual quantity of silver present was from 2 to 4 milligrams more than this to determine more exactly what the loss is the following plan is recommendedthe two silver buttons are wrapped up each in 10 grams of lead and cupelled side by side with two other lots of 10 grams of the original alloy if now the two buttons i and ii weigh 01202 and 01203 they will have suffered in this second cupellation an average loss of 25 milligrams suppose the two fresh lots of alloy gave 01233 and 01235 of silver the average loss on these would also be 25 milligrams add this loss to each result and take the mean which is in this case 01259 if copper is present in the alloy as well as silver it is necessary to add about the same quantity of copper to the checks as is supposed or known to be present in the assays if the substance to be assayed is an alloy of silver and copper first cupel 05 gram of it with say 10 grams of lead and weigh the resulting button of silver in order to get an approximate knowledge of its composition suppose the button weighs 03935 gram we know that this is below the truth for the sake of round numbers take it as 04 and assume that the rest of the alloy 01 gram was copper two check pieces are then weighed out each containing 04 gram silver and 01 gram of copper wrapped in 5 grams of lead of course the silver must be pure and there is also weighed out two or better four assay pieces each containing half a gram of the alloy wrapped in 5 grams of lead the whole lot are then cupelled as nearly as possible under the same conditions with four assay pieces the cupels should be placed close together in two rows of three across the muffle the two check pieces are put in the middle cupels suppose the buttons of silver got weighed as follows check pieces i 03940 ii 03945 assay pieces i 03905 ii 03912 iii 03910 iv 03909 the average loss on the two check pieces is 57 milligrams and the average result of the four assay pieces is 03909 add the average loss to the average result and there is got the corrected result 03966 and if 05 gram of alloy contain 03966 of silver 1000 will contain 7932 of silver and this is the degree of fineness a correction for the loss in cupellation is always made in this way when rich alloys are being assayed and in the case of rich ores it may be done after the manner of the first of the above illustrations there is another method of working which relies more on experiment this is to smelt the cupel as described further on p 114 and to again cupel the resulting button of lead the button of silver got in this second cupellation is added to that first obtained it will sometimes but not often happen that the two buttons together will slightly exceed in weight the silver which was actually present this is because of the retention in the buttons of a small quantity of lead it has been stated that the proportion of lead thus retained may be as much as 1 of the silver present this however can only be under exceptional conditions a determination of the actual silver in the buttons got in the series of cupellations quoted on pages 102 103 gave an average percentage of 9985 so that even with the larger buttons the effect of the retained lead would be only to increase the weight by about 1 milligram in the method of working with checks the retained lead has no disturbing influence the proportion of lead required for the cupellation of any particular alloy requires consideration with too much lead the time occupied in the process is increased and so is the loss of silver on the other hand too little lead is of greater disadvantage than too much from 8 to 16 parts of lead are required for each part of silver alloy or if gold is present about twice as much as this must be used for the cupellation of 1 gram of a silver copper alloy containing different percentages of copper the following quantities of lead should be used percentage of copper in alloy lead required 5 6 grams 10 8 20 10 30 12 40 14 50100 1618 the alloy in not too large pieces is wrapped in the required weight of lead foil and charged into the cupel at once or the lead may be put in first and when the cupellation has fairly started the alloy may be added wrapped in tissue paper or a portion of the lead may be first started and the alloy wrapped in the remaining lead and subsequently added the cupellation of large quantities of alloy or of alloys which contain tin antimony iron or any substance which produces a scoria or corrodes the cupel must be preceded by a scorification the advantages of this are that the slag is poorer in precious metal than that found on a cupel and is more easily collected and cleaned that larger quantities of metal can be treated and that even if the substance is in part infusible or produces at the start a clinkery mass or scoria the oxide of lead gradually accumulates fluxes the solid matters and produces a good final result but if the oxide of lead by itself is not sufficient for the purpose borax or some other flux can be easily added if the button of silver got is very small its weight may be estimated from its size but it must be remembered that the weight varies as the cube of the diameter if one button has twice the diameter of another it is eight times as heavy and so on scales specially constructed for measuring silver and gold buttons may be purchased but it is much better to make the measurement with the help of a microscope provided with an eyepiece micrometer if the length of the long diameter of a silver button be taken the following table will give the corresponding weight in milligrams diameter weight diameter weight 004 inch

gold is got by multiplying by 225 these figures are based on those given by plattner and apply only to buttons of such shape as those left after cupellation a sphere of silver 001 inch in diameter would weigh 009 milligram and a similar sphere of gold weighs 0167 milligram it is safer however to compare with a micrometer the diameter of the button whose weight has to be determined with that of a standard button of nearly equal size whose weight is known the weights of the two buttons are proportional to the cubes of their diameters this plan of working is described more fully in appendix b page 440 calculation of the resultsafter deducting for the silver added and correcting for the cupellation loss the calculation is made in the usual way reporting as so many parts per thousand in the case of rich alloys and as so many ounces and pennyweights or better as ounces and decimals of an ounce in the case of poor alloys and ores in this last case however it is less fatiguing to refer to a set of tables which give either directly or by means of simple addition the produce corresponding to any weight obtained from certain given weights of the substance the following table gives the produce in ounces and decimals of an ounce per ton of 2240 pounds weight of ore taken weight of metal got 3 grams 5 grams 20 grams 50 grams 100 grams 00001 109 065 016 006 003 00002 218 131 033 013

by 5 for example 040 of an ounce is 8 dwts the fraction of a dwt similarly expressed may be converted into grains with sufficient exactness by dividing by 4 thus 163 ozs equal 1 oz 1260 dwts or 1 oz 12 dwts 15 grains in england it is usual to report in ounces and decimals of an ounce the way to use the table is best shown by an example suppose a button of silver weighing 00435 gram was obtained from 20 grams of ore look down the 20gram column of the table and select the values corresponding to each figure of the weight thus 004 6533 ozs to the ton 0003 490 00005 082 00435 7105 add these together the produce is 7105 ozs or 71 ozs 1 dwt to the ton or suppose an ore is known to contain 124 per cent of silver look down the 100gram column select the values and add them together as before 10 32667 ozs per ton 02 6533 004 1307 124 40507 this gives 405 ozs 1 dwt 10 grains to the ton the calculation becomes more complicated when as is frequently the case the ore contains metallic particles these show themselves by refusing to pass through the sieve when the ore is powdered when they are present a large portion or if feasible the whole of the sample is powdered and sifted the weights of the sifted portion and of the metallics or prills are taken the sum of these weights gives that of the whole of the sample taken it is very important that nothing be lost during the operation of powdering each portion has to be assayed separately it is usual to assay a portion of the sifted sample say 20 or 50 grams and to add to the produce of this its share of the metallics this way of calculating which is more convenient than correct is illustrated by the following example weight of whole sample 400 grams made up of sifted portions 399 metallics 1 400 twenty grams of the sifted portion when assayed gave 01050 gram of silver the whole of the metallics scorified and cupelled gave 0842 gram of silver since the 20 grams assayed was 120th of the whole 120th part of the 0842 gram of silver from the metallics must be added to its produce we thus get 01471 gram 01050 00421 referring to the 20 gram column we get 01 16333 004 6533 0007 1143 00001 016 01471 24025 ounces per ton a more legitimate method of calculation is as followscalculate separately the produce of each fraction as if they were from different ores multiply each produce best stated in per cents by the

that was 038 oz or between 7 and 8 dwts too high with ores containing metallics it is of great importance to powder the whole of the selected sample without loss during the process and of even greater importance to well mix the sifted portion of which the last portions to come through the sieve are apt to be more than ordinarily rich through the grinding down of some portions of the metallic prills remarks on cupellationcupellation is at once the neatest and the most important of the dry methods of assaying its purpose is to remove easily oxidisable metals such as lead and copper from silver and gold which are oxidisable with difficulty metals of the first class are often spoken of as base and gold and silver as noble metals when lead is exposed to the action of air at a temperature a little above redness it combines with the oxygen of the air to form litharge an oxide of lead which at the temperature of its formation is a liquid consequently if the lead rests on a porous support which allows the fused litharge to drain away as fast as it is formed a fresh surface of the lead will be continually exposed to the action of the air and the operation goes on until the whole of the lead has been removed silver or gold exposed to similar treatment does not oxidise but retains its metallic condition so that an alloy of lead and silver similarly treated would yield its lead as oxide which would sink into the support while the silver would remain as a button of metal the porous support which is called a cupelfig 5 should absorb the slag oxide of lead etc just as a sponge absorbs water but must be sufficiently finegrained to be impervious to the molten metal at first sight it appears difficult to filter as it were a fluid slag from a fluid metal but an ordinary filterpaper damped with oil will allow oils to run through and yet retain the water but damped with water it will allow water to run through and retain oils similarly fused slags damp and filter through a cupel but the molten metal not damping it withdraws itself into a button which is retained although of course if the cupel is very coarsegrained the metal may sink into the hollows copper antimony tin and most other metals form powdery oxides which are not of themselves easily fusible and it is necessary when these are present to add some solvent or flux to render the oxide sufficiently fluid fortunately oxide of lead is sufficient for the purpose hence mixed oxides of copper and lead provided the lead is present in proper proportion form a fluid slag in separating copper from silver or gold advantage is taken of this fact for although we cannot cupel an alloy of copper and silver it is easy to cupel an alloy of copper silver and lead if however the lead is not present in sufficient quantity the whole of the copper will not be removed and the button of silver still retaining copper will be found embedded in a coating of black oxide of copper copper oxidises less easily than lead does and consequently the alloy which is being cupelled becomes relatively richer in copper as the operation proceeds it is on this account that the illeffects of the copper make themselves felt at the close of the operation and that the oxide of copper is found accumulated around the button of silver tin and antimony on the other hand are more easily oxidised and the tendency of their oxides to thicken the slag makes itself felt at the commencement if the button of alloy once frees itself from the ring or crust of unfused oxide first formed the cupellation proceeds quietly and leaves a clean button of silver in the centre but in either case the cupellation is imperfect and should be repeated with a larger proportion of lead an unfused and consequently unabsorbed slag tends to retain small buttons of alloy or metal and thus cause serious loss there is a principle underlying many of the phenomena of dry silver assaying which the student should endeavour to understand and which serves to emphasise and explain some facts which without an explanation may present difficulties if a button of melted lead be covered with a layer of slag rich in oxide of lead and a second metal be added this other metal distributes itself between the metal and slag in proportions which depend mainly upon the ease with which it is oxidised and to a large extent upon the relative quantities of material present easily oxidisable metals such as zinc iron antimony and tin will go mainly into the slag and if the proportion of the slag is large very little will go into the metal on the other hand with metals oxidisable with difficulty such as silver gold and platinum the reverse holds true nearly the whole of the metals will go into the lead and very little into the slag if however the slag be very rich say in antimony the lead will contain antimony and on the other hand if the lead be very rich in silver the slag will contain silver in appreciable quantity copper which is near lead in the facility with which it is oxidised will serve for the purpose of a detailed example the results of actual analyses of metal and slag formed in contact with each other are shown in the following table percentage composition percentage composition of the metal of the slag lead copper lead copper 68 932 714 214 200 800 780 170 280 720 800 125 320 680 860 67 850 150 900 36 it will be seen from this table that the slag is always much richer in lead and poorer in copper than the metal with which it is in contact the ratio of lead to copper in these five samples is in the metal in the slag 1 14 1 03 1 4 1 02 1 25 1 016 1 2 1 008 1 016 1 004 assuming these figures to be correct the following statement is approximately true on oxidising an alloy of 10 grams of copper and 10 grams of lead and pouring off the slag when 3 grams of lead have gone into it there will be a loss of owing to the slag carrying it off about 02 gram of copper on repeating the operation the next 3 grams of lead will carry with them about 05 gram of copper and on again repeating 3 grams of lead will remove 08 gram of copper finally the last gram of lead will carry with it 03 gram of copper and there will be left a button of copper weighing 83 grams the slag will have carried off altogether 17 gram of copper which is 17 per cent of the metal originally present with the more perfect exposure to the air and quicker removal of the slag which results from heating on a cupel the loss would be heavier karsten got by actual experiment on cupelling copper and lead in equal proportions a loss of 2125 per cent going back to the example if the slag were collected and fused with a suitable reducing agent so as to convert say half of it into metal that half would contain nearly the whole of the copper such a reduction is called cleaning the slag on reoxidising this metal another button of copper is formed which added to the first would reduce the loss from 17 per cent to say 7 or 8 per cent and it is conceivable that by a series of similar operations almost the whole of the 10 grams of copper originally taken might be recovered in practice the problem is as far as the copper is concerned not how to save but how most easily to remove it and since the removal of this metal is quicker from an alloy containing not too much lead it is evident that two or three operations with small quantities of lead will be more effectual than a single treatment with a larger quantity with those metals tin antimony c which pass quickly into the slag the contrary is true hence with these it is necessary to have enough lead present so that the slag formed at the outset shall contain enough oxide of lead to make it fluid as silver is so much less easily oxidised than copper we should reasonably expect that the proportion of silver carried off in the oxide of lead would be considerably less than that of the copper indicated in the above example indeed there are one or two facts which tend to encourage the hope that the operation may be conducted without any loss if a piece of pure silver foil is exposed on a cupel to air at the usual temperature of cupellation it undergoes very little change it does not even fuse it loses nothing in weight and does not oxidise in fact even if oxide of silver were formed under these conditions it could not continue to exist for it is decomposed into silver and oxygen at a temperature considerably below redness on the other hand oxide of silver is not reduced to metal by heat alone when mixed with an excess of oxide of lead while metallic silver is converted into oxide when heated with the higher oxides of lead copper and some other metals that silver and even gold which is more difficult to oxidise than silver may be carried off in the slag in this way is in agreement with general experience if 10 grams of silver are cupelled with 10 grams of lead there will be a loss of about 50 milligrams of silver which is in round numbers 130th of the corresponding copper loss with 10 grams of gold and 10 grams of lead the loss will be 4 or 5 milligrams which is about 112th of the corresponding silver loss determination of silver in assay

buttons of silver add the mean loss on the two check pieces to the mean weight of the four assay pieces this multiplied by 1000 will give the degree of fineness determination of silver in copperthe silver is best separated in the wet way before cupelling but if the proportion is not too small it can be found by cupellation weigh up 3 grams of the metal wrap in 30 grams of sheet lead and cupel

silver in silver precipitatethis substance contains in addition to metallic silver and gold sulphates of lead and lime oxides of zinc copper and iron and more or less organic matter the sample as

button of lead should weigh about 50 grams cupel and weigh the silver the litharge may be replaced by red lead in which case another gram of charcoal powder must be added in our experience the results obtained by this method are about 20 per cent less than the actual content of the ore the results of two assays after deducting for the silver in the litharge used were 39 and 41 milligrams and a third assay in which 54 milligrams of silver had been added gave 92 which after deducting the added silver leaves 38 milligrams the average of the three results is 39 milligrams from the 100 grams of ore two lots of 100 grams of the same ore treated in the wet way gave 52 and 50 milligrams of silver burnt ores from spanish pyrites carry about 0005 per cent of silver wet methods silver is got into solution from its ores by attacking with nitric acid but it is best after dissolving to cautiously add dilute hydrochloric acid and to carefully avoid excess if the quantity of silver is very small the solution is allowed to stand twentyfour hours but otherwise it is warmed and filtered as soon as it clears dry the residue and concentrate the silver in a button of lead by pot method or scorification according to the amount of stony matter present cupel the lead and the resulting button will be free from all metals except perhaps gold it may be weighed or dissolved in nitric acid and the silver determined gravimetrically in the diluted and filtered solution it is better to weigh the metal and afterwards to determine the gold in it estimating the silver by difference silver alloys are dissolved in dilute nitric acid free from chlorides diluted and filtered the solution is then ready for gravimetric determination sulphuretted hydrogen precipitates silver like copper completely even from fairly acid solutions gravimetric determination add dilute hydrochloric acid in small excess to the hot dilute solution which must contain free nitric acid heat and stir until the solution clears decant through a small filter and wash with hot water acidulated at first with a little nitric acid if bismuth is suspected to be present dry quickly transfer as much as possible of the precipitate to a watchglass burn and ignite the filter paper treating the ash first with two drops of nitric acid and then with one of hydrochloric and again dry add the rest of the silver chloride and heat slowly over a bunsen burner until it begins to fuse cool and weigh the precipitate is silver chloride agcl and contains 7527 per cent of silver the moist precipitate is heavy and curdy it is decomposed by direct sunlight becoming violet under its influence when heated it is yellowish and since it is volatile at a high temperature it must not in drying be heated above its fusing point the fused chloride can be removed from the crucible to which it adheres strongly by digesting with dilute acid and zinc for the determination of silver in nearly pure bullion the following process is usedweigh up 15054 gram of the alloy with this amount of alloy each 2 milligrams of silver chloride formed is equivalent to 1 degree of fineness so that the weight of the silver chloride obtained stated in milligrams and divided by 2 will give the degree of fineness transfer to a bottle known as bottles for the indian mint assay and dissolve in 10 cc of dilute nitric acid then make up with water to 200 cc and add 3 cc of dilute hydrochloric acid allow to stand a few minutes and then shake fill the bottle completely with water allow to settle and syphon off the clear liquid pour on more water shake gently to break up the lumps and again fill the bottle with water invert over the mouth of the bottle a porous wedgwood crucible somewhat similar to those used in gold parting take firm hold of the crucible and bottle and invert promptly so that the silver chloride may be collected in the crucible allow to stand a little while for the precipitate to settle and then carefully remove the crucible under water14 drain off most of the water and break up the silver chloride with the help of a wellrounded glass rod this greatly facilitates the subsequent drying dry first on the water bath and then on the iron plate remove the dried silver chloride by inverting the crucible and weigh it as an example 3 determinations of silver in a coin carried out in this way gave 1 18500 gram

and pass a current of sulphuretted hydrogen till the iron is reduced the copper and silver precipitated and the liquor smells of the gas this takes about one hour and a half filter off the precipitate rejecting the solution and wash with warm water dry and transfer to an evaporating dish adding the ashes of the filter paper heat gently with a bunsen burner until the sulphur burns and then calcine until no more sulphurous oxide comes off when cold add 30 cc of nitric acid boil and dilute to 100 cc add 1 cc of very dilute hydrochloric acid 1 to 10015 stir well and allow to stand overnight decant on to a swedish filter paper dry and calcine mix the ashes with 100 grams of litharge and 1 gram of charcoal and fuse in a small crucible detach the button of lead and cupel weigh and make the usual corrections as an example 100 grams of ore treated in this way gave 58 milligrams of silver deducting 08 for the silver added in the oxide of lead leaves 5 milligrams obtained from the ore another experiment on 100 grams of the same ore to which 5 milligrams of silver had been added gave 110 milligrams deduct 58 for the silver added this leaves 52 milligrams as the silver obtained from the ore these give as a mean result 00051 per cent or 166 ounce per ton determination of silver in commercial copperfor the method of doing this with an example and experiment see under the heading of examination of commercial copper volumetric methods there are two of these one adapted for the determination of silver in alloys of approximately known composition and the other of more general application the first of these generally known as gaylussacs method is as regards its working perfect in principle but it requires a practically constant quantity of silver that is one which varies by a few milligrams only in each determination it is a confirmatory method rather than a determinative one the other is known as volhards and resembles in principle and method an ordinary volumetric process gaylussacs method is based on the precipitation of silver from a nitric acid solution by a solution of sodium chloride the point at which the whole of the silver is precipitated being recognised by the standard solution ceasing to give a precipitate the process depends for its success upon 1 the ease which silver chloride separates out from the solution leaving it clear after shaking and 2 the cloudiness produced by the reaction of very small quantities of silver nitrate and sodium chloride in working a quantity of the sodium chloride solution equal to 1 gram of silver is added at once to the assay and when the solution has been rendered clear by shaking the residual silver which should not exceed a few milligrams is estimated with the help of a weaker solution of sodium chloride the success in working evidently depends upon the accuracy with which the first addition of the salt solution is made on this account the standard solution is run in from a special pipette capable of delivering a practically invariable volume of solution it is not so important that this shall deliver exactly 100 cc as that in two consecutive deliveries the volume shall not differ by more than 005 cc the dilute salt solution is onetenth of the strength of that first run in and 1 cc of it is equivalent to 1 milligram of silver ordinarily it is run in 1 cc at a time and an ordinary burette may be used for this purpose shaking between each addition until it ceases to give a precipitate if many such additions have to be made the operation not only becomes tedious but the solution also ceases to clear after shaking so that it becomes impossible to determine the finishing point if the assay contains less than one gram of silver the first addition of the dilute salt solution of course produces no precipitate five milligrams of silver in solution 5 cc is then added and the assay proceeded with in the usual way 5 milligrams of silver being deducted from the amount found there is required for the assay a standard solution of sodium chloride which is prepared by dissolving 54162 grams of the salt made by neutralizing carbonate of soda with hydrochloric acid in water and diluting to one litre 100 cc of this is equivalent to 1 gram of silver the weaker solution of salt is made by diluting 100 cc of the stronger one to one litre one cc of this will equal 1 milligram of silver or 01 cc of the stronger solution a standard solution of silver equivalent to the dilute salt solution is made by dissolving 1 gram of fine silver in 10 cc of dilute nitric acid and diluting with water to one litre illustration fig 44 the solution of salt is standardised as followsweigh up 1003 gram of fine silver and dissolve in 25 cc of dilute nitric acid in a bottle provided with a wellfitting flatheaded stopper heat on the water bath to assist solution resting the bottle in an inclined position when dissolved blow out the nitrous fumes with the help of a glass tube bent at right angles run in from a stoppered pipette as shown in fig 44 100 cc of the standard salt solution and shake vigorously until the solution clears fill an ordinary burette with the weaker standard salt solution and run 1 cc into the assay bottle letting it run down the side so that it forms a layer resting on the assay solution if any silver remains in solution a cloudy layer will be formed at the junction where the two liquids meet this is best observed against a black background if a cloudiness is seen shake to clear the liquid and run in another cc of salt and continue this until a cloudiness is no longer visible deduct 15 cc from the amount of the weaker sodium chloride solution run in divide the corrected reading by 10 and add to the 100 cc this will give the volume of strong salt solution equivalent to the silver taken if the first addition of the weaker salt solution causes no cloudiness add 5 cc of the silver solution from an ordinary pipette shake and then run in the weaker salt solution working as before these 5 milligrams of silver added must be allowed for before calculating as an example10100 gram of fine silver was taken for standardising a solution and 4 cc of the weaker salt solution were run in deducting 15 and dividing by 10 gives 025 cc to be added to the 100 cc 10025 10100 100 x x 10075 which is the standard of the salt solution the method of working an assay may be gathered from the following examplein the determination of silver in some buttons left after cupellation it was assumed that these would contain 995 per cent of silver for the assay it was necessary to take a quantity that should contain a little more than 10075 grams of silver then 995 100 10075 x x 10125 to ensure a slight excess there was taken 10150 gram of the buttons which was treated in exactly the same way as for the standardising the quantity of the weaker salt solution required was 7 cc deducting 15 cc and dividing by 10 gives 10055 cc of strong salt solution which is equivalent to 10130 gram of silver this being obtained from 1015 gram of alloy is equal to 998 per cent or 9980 fine the effect of temperaturethe standardising and the assay must be done at the same time since a difference of 5 c makes a difference of 01 cc in measuring the 100 cc of strong solution of salt it is always best to prepare a standard with each batch of assays sulphocyanate methodvolhards process is based upon the precipitation of silver in nitric acid solutions with potassium sulphocyanate the finishing point being the development of a reddishbrown colour produced by the action of the excess of sulphocyanate upon ferric sulphate the white sulphocyanate settles readily leaving the liquor clear and a persistent brown coloration in the liquid indicates the finish the assay must be carried out in the cold and water free from chlorides16 must be used the standard sulphocyanate of potassium solution is made by dissolving 412 or 5 grams of the salt kcys in water and diluting to 1 litre 100 cc are about equivalent to 05 gram of silver the standard silver nitrate solution is made by dissolving 5 grams of fine silver in 50 cc of dilute nitric acid boiling off nitrous fumes and diluting to 1 litre the indicator is a saturated solution of iron alum or a solution of ferric sulphate of equivalent strength made by titrating acid ferrous sulphate with potassium permanganate use 2 cc for each assay the sulphocyanate solution is standardised by placing 50 cc of the silver nitrate solution in a flask with 20 cc of dilute nitric acid diluting to 100 cc with water and running in the sulphocyanate until the greater part of the silver is precipitated then adding 2 cc of the ferric indicator and continuing the titration until a reddishbrown colour is developed and remains permanent after shaking continuously the assay is similarly performed the silver being used in the state of a nitric acid solution the effect of variations in the conditions of the assay may be seen from the following experiments in which 20 cc of standard silver nitrate were used effect of varying temperature temperature 10 c 30 c 70 c 100 c sulphocyanate reqd

494 cc 990 cc this method is valuable for determining silver in salts alloys and solutions where no more than an ordinary degree of accuracy is demanded it is easy and applicable under most of the usual conditions its greatest disadvantage is the brown coloration produced by the sulphocyanate when the assay is nearly but not quite finished and the slowness with which this is removed on shaking up with the precipitate this is worse with large quantities of precipitate and if about 1 gram of silver is present it gives an indefiniteness to the finish which lowers the precision of the process to about 1 in 500 this is useless for the assays of bullion one writer states that this inconvenience is due to portions of liquid being entangled in the precipitate but it appears much more likely to be due to the action of the precipitate itself in attempting to apply the process to the assay of bullion by working it on the principle of a gaylussac assay it was found that a very considerable excess of silver was required to complete the reaction in these experiments 100 cc of sulphocyanate very accurately measured was run into the solution containing the weighed portion of bullion fine silver and after shaking the solution was filtered in the filtrate the remaining silver if there should be any was determined by the ordinary titration but with sulphocyanate of onetenth the strength this final titration was quite satisfactory the amount of silver precipitated by the first 100 cc however varied with the quantity of silver present as in the following series17 silver present silver precipitated 11342 gram 11322 gram 11375 11335 11405 11351 11484 11379 these of course preclude a method of the kind aimed at and at the same time emphasise the importance of uniformity of work in the ordinary process in the determination of chlorides in seawater dittmar used a combined method precipitating the bulk of the silver as chloride and after filtering determining the small excess of silver by sulphocyanate this modification answers admirably when applied to the assay of bullion in the ordinary gaylussac method the precipitation of the bulk of the silver by the 100 cc of salt solution leaves nothing to be desired either as to ease in working or accuracy of result the silver precipitate settles quickly and leaves a clear liquor admirably fitted for the determination of the few milligrams of silver remaining in solution but the method of determining this residual silver by adding successive small quantities of salt so long as they continue to give a precipitate is unsatisfactory and judged on its own merits apart from the rest of the process could hardly escape condemnation it is clumsy in practice for the continued adding of small portions of salt solution is laborious and becomes impossible with more than a few milligrams of silver in solution the proposed modification is simple having precipitated the silver with the 100 cc of salt solution as described under gaylussacs method page 120 shake till the liquor clears and filter into a flask washing with a little distilled water add 2 cc of ferric indicator to the filtrate and titrate with a standard sulphocyanate solution made by diluting the ordinary standard solution to such an extent that 100 cc after diluting shall be equivalent to 01 gram of silver18 calculate the weight of silver found by sulphocyanate and add it to the weight which 100 cc of the salt solution will precipitate an advantage of this modification is that an excess of 15 milligrams may be determined as easily and exactly as 5 in standardising the salt solution then weigh up say 10150 gram of pure silver dissolve and titrate suppose 135 cc of sulphocyanate required then these are equivalent to 0135 gram of silver 100 cc 1 the silver precipitated by the salt is 101500135ie 10015 gram which is the standard application of the method to assays for arsenicif silver nitrate be added to a neutral solution of an arsenate of one of the alkali metals silver arsenate ag3aso4 is thrown down as a darkred precipitate if after adding excess of silver nitrate to insure a complete precipitation the arsenate of silver be filtered off the weight of the arsenic could be estimated from the weight of silver arsenate formed but this may be done much more conveniently by dissolving the precipitate in nitric acid and titrating with sulphocyanate the silver found will be to the arsenic present as 324 1083 is to 75 the mineral is best treated by the method given in the third paragraph on page 382 but the solution after being acidified with nitric acid should be made exactly neutral with ammonia a small excess of silver nitrate should then be added and since acid is liberated in the reaction the liquor must again be neutralised19 the precipitate must then be filtered off and washed with distilled water then dissolve it in the paper by slowly running over it 20 cc of dilute nitric acid wash the filter with distilled water collecting with the filtrate in a small flask add 2 cc of ferric indicator and titrate if the sulphocyanate solution be made up with 11 or 12 grams of the potassium salt to the litre and be then standardised and diluted so that for 100 cc it shall equal 108 gram of silver see p 38 then it will also equal 25 gram of arsenic as except for ores rich in arsenic it will be better to work with a solution one half this strength the standard as calculated from an experiment with pure silver should be checked by another using pure resublimed white arsenic as2o3 which contains 7575 of the metal the quantity of white arsenic taken 1 or 2 gram should contain about as much arsenic as will be present in the assays it is converted into sodium arsenate by evaporating to a small bulk with nitric acid and neutralising with soda the precipitation and titration of the silver arsenate should be exactly as in the assays the difficulty of the method is in the neutralising which has to be very carefully done since silver arsenate is soluble in even faintly acid solutions one drop of nitric acid in 100 cc of water is enough to produce an absolutely worthless result and an excess of acid much less than this is still very prejudicial the addition of a little sodium acetate to the solution after the final neutralising has a good effect arsenic in mispickelweigh up 250 gram of the finelypowdered ore and place in a berlin crucible about 114 or 112 inch in diameter treat with 10 or 12 drops one drop at a time of strong nitric acid warm very gently but avoid much heating put on a thin layer of nitre and rather more than half fill the crucible with a mixture of equal parts of soda and nitre heat quickly in the blowpipe flame and when the mass is fused and effervescing withdraw and allow to cool boil out with water filter and wash insert a piece of litmus paper and cautiously neutralise with nitric acid using ammonia to neutralise any accidental excess of the acid add a gram or so of ammonium nitrate and silver nitrate in excess neutralise again with ammonia and add two or three grams of sodium acetate filter off the precipitate wash and titrate in the fusion care should be taken to avoid much effervescence an excess of the soda mitigates this and the operation should be stopped as soon as the whole has entered into fusion colorimetric determination there is properly speaking no colorimetric method but the following which is sometimes used is based on similar principles it is useful for the determination of small quantities of silver in substances which yield clear solutions with nitric acid dissolve a weighed quantity of the substance in nitric acid and dilute to a definite bulk divide into two equal parts to one add a drop or two of dilute hydrochloric acid stir and filter to the other add a similar amount of dilute acid and then to the filtered portion run in from a burette standard silver nitrate 1 cc 05 milligram silver until the solutions are equally turbid calculate in the usual way gold gold occurs in nature chiefly as metal it always contains more or less silver and in alluvial sands c may be associated with platinum and iridium gold is insoluble in hydrochloric or nitric acid but is dissolved by aqua regia or by solutions of iodine bromine or chlorine it is taken up by mercury forming an amalgam from which the mercury may be driven off by heat when gold occurs in particles of any size it is readily detected by its appearance but when finely disseminated through a large quantity of rock it is separated and detected by the amalgamation assaydescribed belowor by a process of washing somewhat similar to vanning or by the following testpowder and if necessary roast 50 to 100 grams of the ore put on it three or four crystals of iodine and enough alcohol to cover it allow to stand for half an hour a piece of filter paper moistened with the liquid and burnt leaves an ash with a distinctly purple tint if any gold is present it is better however to filter off the solution evaporate and ignite then either take up with mercury and ignite the amalgam so as to get a speck of the metallic gold or treat with a few drops of aqua regia and test the solution with stannous chloride a purple coloration indicates gold amalgamation assaythis does not attempt to give the total produce of gold but rather the quantity which can be extracted on a large scale therefore it should imitate as closely as possible the process adopted in the mine or district for extracting the metal take 2 lbs of the ore in powder and roast make into a stiff paste with hot water and rub up for an hour or so with a little mercury wash off the sand carefully and collect the amalgam drive off the mercury by heat and weigh the residual gold it is best to cupel it with lead before weighing in an experiment on a lot of ore which contained 0189 gram of gold 0179 gram was obtained by the above process equal to about 9412 per cent recovered with ores generally the yield may be from 80 to 90 per cent of the actual gold present dry assay the dry assay of gold ores resembles in its main particulars the dry assay for silver by the crucible method and for much that is of importance in its discussion the student is referred to what is written under silver on pp 90113 size of assay chargesgold ores rarely contain more than a few ounces often only a few pennyweights of gold to the ton consequently the button of gold obtainable from such quantities of ore as may be conveniently worked by assaying methods is often so small as to require more than ordinary care in its manipulation one milligram of gold forms a button of about the size of one of the fullstops on this page and compared with a million similar particles of quartz about four ounces represents a produce of a quarter of an ounce to the ton a proportion such as the assayer is frequently called on to determine it is evident therefore that a charge of half an ounce or less of the ore such as is usual with silver ores would demand of the worker both skill and care in the handling of the minute quantity of gold to be obtained from it fortunately the work is simple and precise so that in practised hands and with only a 5gram charge the assay of a 5dwt ore is practicable with so small a charge however the result is barely perceptible on a sensitive balance the button of gold should be measured under a microscope it follows therefore that larger charges of say 50 100 or even 200 grams have an advantage in that they lessen the strain on the workers attention and except in the case of the poorest mineral bring the button of gold within the scope of the balance on the other hand the inconvenience of the larger charges lies in the amount of fluxes and consequent size of the crucibles required to flux them samplinga further consideration in favour of the larger charges is the matter of sampling in preparing his ore the student should ask himself what reasonable expectation he has that the portion he puts in the furnace will be of average richness the larger charges are likely to be nearer than the smaller ones to the average of the parcel of ore from which they are taken in explanation of this let us suppose a large heap of 5dwt ore in sand of the coarseness of fullstops and containing all its gold in particles of 1 milligram as uniformly distributed as care and labour in the mixing can accomplish such a heap could not possibly occur in practice but it will serve for purposes of illustration now one ton of the sand however taken would contain appreciably the same quantity of gold as any other ton for a ton would contain about 8000 particles of gold and even if two separate tons differed by as much as 100 particles which they are just likely to do this would mean only a difference of 1 or 2 grains to the ton on the other hand two portions of 14 lbs which should contain on the average 50 particles of gold are likely enough to differ by 10 particles and this calculated on a ton means a difference of 1 dwt it is easy to see that something like this should be true for on calculating the 14lb lot up to a ton the deviation from the average whatever it may be is multiplied by 160 whereas if the ton were made up by adding 14lb lot to 14lb lot up to the full tale then a large proportion of the errors some being in excess and some in defect would neutralise each other an average which is practically true when dealing with thousands and perhaps sufficiently exact with hundreds would be merely misleading when applied to tens and units reasonable safety in sampling then is dependent largely on the number of particles of gold in the charge taken and the risk of an abnormal result is less the larger the charge taken by doubling the charge however we merely double the number of particles powdering finely is much more effective for since the weight of a particle varies as the cube of the diameter halving the diameter of the particles increases their number eightfold if now we modify our illustration by assuming the particles to have only onesixth the diameter of a fullstop which would represent a powder of a fineness not unusual in ores prepared for assaying we should multiply the number of particles by 200 6 6 6 216 we should then reasonably expect a 14lb parcel of the powder to give as safe a sample as a ton of the sand would give and portions of a size fit for crucible work say 50 or 100 grams would be as safe as 10 or 20lb samples of the coarser stuff for example 60 grams of such powder would contain for a 5dwt ore about 100 particles and in the majority of cases the error due to sampling would be less than 10 or 12 grains to the ton and would only occasionally exceed a pennyweight with richer ores the actual deviation stated as so much to the ton of ore might be greater but it would represent a smaller proportion stated in percentage of the gold actually present and would ultimately fall within the limits of unavoidable error it will be seen that the size of the quartz particles has no direct bearing on the argument and in fact the coarseness of the quartz only interferes by preventing the uniform mixing of the sand and by binding together several particles of gold in this last case particles so united must of course count as one larger particle now there are some natural ores in which the gold particles are all very small with these fine powdering and mixing yields a product from which a sample may be safely taken then again in tailings before or after treatment with cyanide we have a similar material inasmuch as the coarser gold has been removed by previous amalgamation with these it is not unusual to take the portion for assay without any further powdering since they are poor in gold and have already been stamped and passed through a sieve of say thirty holes to the inch linear but there are other ores in lump showing no visible gold which contain the gold in all possible degrees of fineness from say prills of a milligram or so down to a most impalpable powder the treatment of these cannot be so simple and straightforward suppose a parcel of 1000 grams say 2 lbs of such ore in fine powder containing on an average 1 particle of 1 milligram the presence or absence of which makes a difference of 6 dwt on the ton 10 others of about 5 milligram each representing 3 dwt and 100 others which are too coarse to pass through an 80 sieve and having an average weight of 1 milligram each 06 dwt and that the rest of the gold equivalent altogether to 2 ounces to the ton is so finely divided that a charge of 50 grams may be taken without any considerable risk of its interfering with the sampling then in a 50gram charge there would be one chance in twenty of getting the milligram particle in which case the result would be 1235 dwts too high on the other hand if it were not present the result would on this account be 65 dwt too low of the ten 5milligram particles it is as likely as not that one will be present and its presence or absence would cause an error of 33 dwts more or less of the 100 particles of 1 milligram there would probably be from 3 to 7 instead of 5 the proper number this would mean a variation of 26 dwts from the true proportion so that the probable result would range about 5 dwts more or less than the 212 ozs which is the true produce and there are possibilities of astounding results it is true that the majority of the results would be well within these limits and now and again the heart of the student would be gladdened by a beautiful concordance in duplicate assays nevertheless there can be no reasonable expectation of a good assay and to work in this way on a 50gram charge would be to court failure the coarse gold must ruin the assay the difficulty may be met by concentrating the whole of the coarse gold in a small fraction of the ore by sifting and making a separate assay of this fraction a portion of the ore of about 1000 grams is ground to a very fine powder and passed through an 80 sieve regrinding when necessary until only 20 or 30 grams is left of the coarser powder this is mixed with fluxes and carried through as a separate assay the sifted portion is thoroughly mixed and a portion of it say 30 or 50 grams taken for assay the weights of the two portions must be known and care must be taken that nothing is lost in the powdering the method of calculating the mean result from the two assays is shown on page 109 in this way of working there is no advantage in continuing the grinding until the coarser fraction is reduced to a gram or sorather the contrary and rubbing on until all the gold is sent through the sieve is to be distinctly avoided the student must bear in mind that what he is aiming at is the exclusion of all coarse gold from the portion of ore of which he is going to take only a fraction the question of the smaller sampling of gold ores has been dwelt on at considerable length as befits its importance in order that the student may be impressed with a sense of its true meaning sampling is not a mystery nor does the art lie in any subtle manner of division it is of course absolutely necessary that the stuff to be sampled shall be well mixed and the fractions taken so that each part of the little heap shall contribute its share to the sample moreover it must be remembered that tossing about is a poor sort of mixing and that everything tending to separate the large from the small the light from the heavy or the soft from the hard as happens in sifting must be avoided or if unavoidable must be remedied by subsequent mixing with a welltaken sample we may rely on a great majority of our results falling within normal limits of error but nothing can be more certain than that in a moderately large experience we shall get now and again deviations much more considerable these erratic assays can only be met by the method of working duplicates which call attention to the fault by discordant results such faulty assays should be repeated in duplicate so that we may rest the decision on three out of four determinations the likelihood of two very faulty assays being concordant is remote but with very important work as in selling parcels of ore even this risk should be avoided as concordance in these cases is demanded in the reports of two or more assayers the following actual reports on a disputed assay will illustrate this a 5 ozs 1 dwt b 5 ozs 10 dwts 12 grains c 5 ozs 11 dwts c 5 ozs 11 dwts 12 grs the mean result of several assays unless there be some fault in the method will be very fairly exact and individual assays with an uncertainty of 1 in 20 may by repetition have this reduced to 1 in 100 or less assay tons etchaving decided on taking a larger or smaller portion the exact quantity to be used will be either some round number of grams such as 50 or 100 easily calculable into percentage or it will be that known as the assay ton see page 13 or some simple multiple or fraction of it which is easily calculable into ounces the reports too are at least as often made as ounces in the short ton of 2000 lbs as on the more orthodox ton of 2240 lbs now the short ton is equal to 291666 troy ounces and the corresponding assay ton is got from it by replacing ounces by milligrams the advantage of its use is that if one assay ton of ore has been taken the number of milligrams of gold obtained is also the number of ounces of gold in a ton of the ore and there is absolutely no calculation even if half an assay ton has been taken the only calculation needed is multiplying the milligrams by two on the other hand with a charge of two assay tons the milligrams need halving where weights of this kind ie assay tons are not at hand they may be easily extemporised out of buttons of tin or some suitable metal and it is better to do this than to array out the grams and its fractions at each weighing the sets of assay tons however are easily purchased as stated on page 13 the assay ton for 2240 lbs is 326667 grams and for the short ton 291667 grams if however the round number of grams be used and the result brought by calculation to the produce on 100 grams the conversion to ounces to the ton may be quickly effected by the help of the table on page 107 as this table only deals with the ton of 2240 lbs it is supplemented here by a shortened one dealing only with the produce of 100 grams and stating the result in ounces troy to the short ton of 2000 lbs estimation of small quantities of goldby the balance in estimating minute quantities of gold there are one or two points of importance to an assayer only in this assay where they will often allow one to avoid the working of inconveniently large charges one of these is known as weighing by the method of vibrations table for calculating ounces to the short ton from the yield of gold from 100 grams of ore milligramounces

rest in perfect equilibrium with the pointer exactly over the middle point of the scale let the scale be a series of points at equal distances along a horizontal line then if a small weight be placed on one pan the pointer will deviate from its vertical position and come to rest opposite some definite part of the scale which will depend upon the magnitude of the weight added the law determining this position is a very simple one the deviation as measured along the points of the scale varies directly as the weight added for example with an ordinarily sensitive balance such as is used for general purposes one milligram will move the pointer along say three divisions of the scale then two milligrams will move it six divisions half a milligram one and a half divisions and so on of course with a more sensitive balance the deviations will be greater now the point at which the needle comes to rest is also the middle point about which it vibrates when swinging for example if the needle swings from the third to the seventh division on the right then 732 it will come to rest on the fifth in working by this method the following conventions are useful always place the button to be weighed on the left pan of the balance the weights on the right count the divisions of the scale from the centre to right and left marking the former and the latter thus 5 is the fifth division to the left then the position of rest is half the algebraic sum of two readings for example let the readings be 7 to the right and 3 to the left then 732 2 the mean division is the second division to the right if the student will place himself in front of a balance and repeat the following observations and replace the figures here given by his own he will have no difficulty in grasping the method first determine the bias of the balance suppose the unloaded balance swings 125 and 1 the bias then is 12512 125 or oneeighth of a division to the right now having put on the button to be weighed let the readings be 75 and 925 and 759252 8375 then the effect of the button has been to move the pointer from 125 to 8375 or 825 divisions to the right we should therefore add the weight equivalent of 825 divisions to the weights whatever they may be on the right hand pan of the balance if the divisions were to the left divisions we should subtract the value of 1 division is easily determined suppose the button in the example were a 1 milligram weight then we should have found that 1 milligram 825 divisions 1 division 121 milligram this method of working adds very considerably to the power of a balance in distinguishing small quantities illustration fig 44a by the microscopethe use of the microscope also is a real advantage in estimating the weights of minute buttons of gold where there is no undue risk in sampling and where an error of say 1 in 20 on the quantity of gold is tolerable for ores with copper lead zinc c as well as for tailings rather poor in gold this leaves a wide field of usefulness the method is described on page 440 but the description needs supplementing for those who are not accustomed to the use of a microscope the eyepiece of a microscope fig 44a a unscrews at a showing a diaphragm at b which will serve as a support for an eyepiece micrometer this last b is a scale engraved on glass and may be purchased of any optical instrument maker though it may be necessary to send the eyepiece to have it properly fitted when resting on the diaphragm it is in focus for the upper lens so that on looking through the microscope the scale is clearly seen in whatever position the instrument may be as regards the object being looked at suppose this to be a small button of gold on a shallow flat watchglass on the stage of the microscope bring the button under the objective ie the nose of the microscope which should be about a quarter of an inch above the watchglass then looking through the instrument raise the tube until the button of gold or at least some dust on the glass comes into focus if the button is not in the field rest the thumbs and index fingers using both hands on the edge of the watchglass pressing lightly but steadily and give the glass a slow short sweeping motion the button will perhaps appear as an illdefined blackness because not quite in focus bring this into the centre of the field raise or lower the microscope until the button appears with sharp outlines if the scale does not cover the button rotate the eyepiece this will bring the scale into a new position since the divisions over the button are less distinct than the others it is best to read the latter thus in fig 44b there are 36 divisions on one side of the button and 35 on the other making altogether 71 the whole scale is 80 therefore the diameter of the button is 9 divisions the value of each division obviously varies with the magnifying power employed with most microscopes there is a telescopic arrangement whereby the tube may be lengthened if this be done and the button again brought in focus it will be seen that as measured on the scale the button is much larger than before it is evident therefore the micrometer must always be used in the same way the method given in the appendix page 440 for finding the value of the scale when gold buttons are to be measured is easy and satisfactory when the button of gold is so small that there is considerable risk of losing it in transferring to a watchglass it may be measured on the cupel but for this purpose it must be well illuminated this is best done by concentrating light on it with a lens or with what comes to the same thing a clean flask filled with water illustration fig 44b most assayers however using a micrometer in this way would like to know its absolute value to do this a stage micrometer must be purchased this is like an ordinary microscope slide fig 44a c and when looked at through a microscope it shows fig 44c lines ruled on the glass at distances of tenths and hundredths of a millimetre ten of each so that the full scale is 11 mm in the case illustrated 60 divisions of the scale in the eyepiece are just equal to the 11 mm therefore 1 division equals 0183 mm a cube of this diameter would contain 018301830183 0000061285 cubic mm the corresponding sphere is got by multiplying by 5236 this gives 000003209 cb mm the weight of 1 cb mm of water is 1 milligram and since gold is 192 times as heavy as water sp g 192 the contents in cb mm must be multiplied by 192 this gives 0000616 milligram as the weight of a sphere of gold measuring 1 division illustration fig 44c if every result had to be calculated in this way the method would be very laborious but having the figures for the first division those of the others may be calculated by multiplying by the cube of the corresponding number thus for the third division 333 27 the content of the cube 000006128527 is 0001655 cb mm the content of the sphere 00000320927 is 0000866 cb mm and the corresponding sphere of gold 000061627 is 00166 milligram with the help of a table of cubes the whole calculation for 25 or 30 divisions may be made in half an hour and the results preserved in the form of a table will simplify all future work assay operationsthe actual work of the assay resolves itself into three operations1 the fusion of the ore and concentration of the fine metal ie gold and silver in a button of lead 2 the cupellation of the lead whereby a button of fine metal is obtained and 3 the parting of the gold which separates it from the accompanying silver the following description takes the order as here given but the student in learning the method should first practise cupellation if he has not already done so next he should practise the separation of gold from silver taking known weights of fine gold p 63 varying from 5 or 3 gram down to quite minute quantities and not resting satisfied until a sensitive balance can barely distinguish between the weights of gold taken and found it may be noted here that if he has not a flatting mill at his disposal then for large buttons it is better to make an alloy with eight or nine parts of silver to one of gold and attack it with acid without previous flattening rather than accept the risk and labour of beating out a less easily attacked alloy to the necessary thinness with a hammer it is only after a sense of security in gold parting has been acquired that the attack of an ore can be profitably accomplished and even then simple and easy ores should be first taken passing on to others more difficult either because of a more complex mineral composition or a difficulty in sampling concentration of the fine metal in leadthe best flux for quartz which makes up the earthy matter of most gold ores is soda and this is best added as carbonate or bicarbonate by theory20 50 grams of quartz will require 885 grams of the carbonate or 140 grams of the bicarbonate to form sodium silicate which is a glassy easilyfusible substance making a good slag if the bicarbonate is used and heat is applied gradually steam and carbonic acid are given off at a comparatively low temperature and the carbonate is left at a higher temperature about 800 c or a cherryred heat the carbonate fuses attacking the quartz and giving off more carbonic acid as the heat increases and the attack on the quartz which of itself is infusible becomes complete the whole mass settles down to a liquid sodium silicate which is sufficiently fluid to allow the gold and lead to settle to the bottom the fluid slag does to a certain extent dissolve some of the crucible but not seriously in a perfect working of this experiment the first evolution of gases steam and carbonic acid should be gentle so as to run no risk of its blowing the fine powder out of the crucible and the heat at which the second evolution of carbonic acid is produced should be maintained until the reaction is completed so that there may be little or no formation of gas in the fused mass to cause an effervescence which may force some of the charge over the edges of the crucible of course in practice the ideal fusion is not attained but there is no difficulty in approaching it closely enough to prevent the charge at any time rising above the level it reached at first in the crucible and this should be accomplished it is usual with quartzose ores to rely mainly on the action of carbonate of soda but not entirely litharge is also used it forms on fusion with quartz a silicate of lead which is a yellow glass easily fusible and more fluid in the furnace than silicate of soda is by theory 50 grams of quartz would require 186 grams of litharge21 the reaction takes place without evolution of gas and in its working the only point is to so regulate the heat that the litharge shall not fuse and drain under the unattacked quartz leaving it as a pasty mass on the surface now if in making up a charge for 50 grams of ore we took 100 grams of bicarbonate of soda equivalent to about 63 grams of the carbonate this being fivesevenths of 140 grams which by itself would be sufficient leaves twosevenths of the quartz to be fluxed by other reagents twosevenths of 186 grams say 52 grams of litharge would serve for this purpose but if we used 10 grams of borax which has a fluxing action about equal to that of the litharge then 40 grams of the latter or making an allowance for the quartz being not quite pure say 35 grams will suffice the fluxes then for the 50 grams of ore would be bicarbonate of soda 100 grams litharge 35 grams and borax 10 grams we could decrease any of these and proportionately increase either or both of the others and still rely on getting a fusible slag which is the whole of the function of a flux considered simply as a flux it should be remembered however that the slag is a bisilicate or acid slag and that its acid character is increased by increasing the proportion of borax but in addition to the fluxes there is required about 30 or 40 grams of lead to collect the silver and gold this is best added as litharge say 40 grams and flour 4 grams or charcoal powder 2 grams see pages 93 and 94 the full charge then would be ore 50 grams bicarbonate of soda 100 litharge 75 borax 10 flour 4 these should be mixed placed in a suitable crucible a g battersea round will do and heated at first at a red heat but finally much hotter so as to get a fluid and clean slag when the charge has been in tranquil fusion for some little time take it out and pour it into an iron mould when cold detach the button of lead the slag should be glassy all through alike and easily separable from the metal with ordinary ores this slag may be considered as free from gold in an experiment in which 90 milligrams of gold were added the full amount was obtained from the lead produced by the first fusion but in certain cases more especially where large amounts of metallic oxides are present the slag is not so clean and with these the slag should be powdered mixed with 40 grams of litharge and 4 of flour and melted again it is an advantage to add a small prill of say 2 or 3 milligrams of silver to the charge as it insures a visible product in the cupellation indeed this last precaution is a good one to be taken wherever there is reason to expect very small buttons it has the further advantage that if the quantity of silver necessary for inquartation is known the right quantity may be added here so as to save a subsequent operation ores containing oxides of ironof the metallic oxides likely to be present in a slag oxide of iron is the most important gold is occasionally found in a matrix of this substance and in the assay of concentrates largely made up of pyrites this oxide will be formed in the preliminary calcination now the lower oxide of iron ferrous oxide feo is easy to deal with fused borax will dissolve about its own weight of it and a silicate of soda such as makes up the bulk of a slag in a gold assay will take up at least half as much but the higher oxide ferric oxide fe2o3 is more refractory even 6 parts of borax yields a poor product and slags with any considerable percentage of it are not satisfactory a student attempting to recover gold from some hmatite in which there was about half an ounce of the metal found in the slag nearly a gram of gold although in the first fusion the slag appeared perfectly fluid there is however no difficulty in getting good slags even with large quantities of iron for example with 50 grams of ferric oxide 10 of quartz 30 of borax 30 of soda22 50 of litharge and 7 of flour the result was quite satisfactory so too was 25 of quartz 50 of soda 50 of litharge and 7 of flour it is well however in such cases to have an ample proportion of flux and to aim at a larger button of lead than usual by increasing the proportion of flour or charcoal see also page 91 a charge used on the randt for roasted concentrates which we may roughly speak of as quartz and ferric oxide is one assay ton about 30 grams each of ore soda and borax and one and a half assay ton of litharge and 2 grams of charcoal whilst for the same material from which most of the gold has been extracted by chloridising 25 tons each of ore borax and soda 4 of litharge and 4 grams of charcoal are needed this quantity requires a large crucible i battersea round in this the proportion of silicate of soda and borax counted together is to the oxide of iron as 4 to 1 on the supposition that the quartz and oxide of iron of the ore are in about equal quantities but in the larger charge especially much oxide of lead would also remain as a flux ores containing sulphidesin assaying ores containing a large proportion of pyrites or mispickel or both the best plan is to take a portion and calcine so as to convert it into a product of the kind just considered the weighed portion of ore should be placed in a clean crucible and be heated to incipient redness with pyrites the first effect is to drive off about half the sulphur as vapour which burns as flame over the ore at this stage care should be taken that there is no great increase of temperature otherwise there may be more or less fusion which would spoil the operation when the sulphur flame ceases the solid sulphide of iron burns with visible incandescence and the charge should now be stirred with a flattened iron rod so as to expose fresh portions to the air the top of the furnace must be open so that air may have free access to the crucible when stirring is no longer followed by visible burning the heat may be raised to full redness the crucible is then lifted out the stirrer still resting in it and if the charge gives off no odour of burning sulphur it is shaken out into an iron mortar and mixed with the fluxes taking care to clean the stirrer in the mixture the charge is then replaced in the crucible in which the roasting was done and fused in the furnace the resulting button of lead is cupelled for fine metal ores rich in sulphides requiring this treatment are frequently concentrates for their assay take 1 assay ton 30 grams calcine and mix with an equal weight of soda and of borax 30 grams each and half as much again of litharge 15 tons or 45 grams and with 2 grams of charcoal or 5 grams of flour where the sulphides are present in smaller proportion 10 per cent or less they may be taken as serving the purpose of flour or charcoal see page 95 the sulphur and iron are oxidised at the expense of the litharge with a consequent separation of lead as metal if the proportion of sulphides is not sufficient to give a large enough button of lead some charcoal or flour should be added on the other hand if they are in small excess and give a button of lead somewhat sulphury ie hard and brittle it may be remedied by the judicious addition of nitre this last reagent however should not be used in large quantity a plan much used to prevent sulphury buttons is to insert an iron rod or a nail in the charge in the crucible the iron takes the sulphur forming sulphide of iron which in moderate quantity does not form a separate layer of matte but dissolves in the slag a slag formed of 50 grams of quartz 100 soda and some borax may take up in this way some 10 or 12 grams of sulphide of iron if however an ore gives a layer of matte or speise it is best to repeat the assay by the method of calcining before fusion cyanide charges etcin assaying the tailings which are to be treated in a cyaniding plant the following charge is used tailings 3 assay tons or 100 grams litharge 45 150 soda 45 150 borax 75 25 the sand is assayed without any further crushing and the assay is made in duplicate the residues after treatment with cyanide differing from the tailings merely in being poorer in gold because of the extraction by the solution of cyanide are run down with the same fluxes in the same relative proportions but four charges of 25 assay tons say 75 grams are worked and two of the resulting buttons are scorified together and then cupelled etc so as to give duplicate assays on charges of 5 assay tons this is one of the cases in which it is desirable to add a small portion of silver before cupelling in assaying the cyanide liquors for gold 2 assay tons of the liquor are measured out 583 cc for the ton of 2000 lbs 653 cc for the other and are evaporated to dryness in a lead dish weighing about 35 grams such a dish is easily extemporised out of a piece of lead foil if the ordinary vessel is not at hand but care must be taken that the lead is free from gold the dish with the dried residue is then scorified and the resulting button of lead is cupelled illustration fig 44c in some cases the fusion of the ore may be replaced by a treatment with solution of cyanide of potassium and the gold recovered from the solution in the way just described for this purpose the ore should be in not too fine powder otherwise there will be great difficulty in filtering a sand which will pass a 30 sieve and having no large proportion of very fine stuff will do not less than 200 grams should be taken and as an extraction apparatus a bell jar capable of holding half as much again may be used such a jar may be extemporised by cutting off the bottom of a bottle by leading a crack around it with a red hot poker or a lamp chimney will serve the purpose the smaller mouth of the jar is closed by a perforated cork provided with a clipped tube after the manner of a burette see fig 44c in the jar just over the cork put a plug of loose asbestos or glass wool or a piece of sponge to act as a filter a layer of broken glass coarse at the bottom and fine at the top will serve the same purpose on this place the charge of ore to be extracted prepare a solution of cyanide of potassium in water with 5 or 10 grams of the salt to the litre it may be that the whole point of the assay depends on the solution being of a definite strength as for example where the relative efficiency of solutions of different strengths is being determined when it will be best to estimate the quantity of cyanide of potassium in the dilute solution by the method given at the end of this article page 160 pour the cyanide solution on to the ore letting the first portions to come through run into the beaker but as soon as the ore is thoroughly wetted close the clip and allow to stand for several hours then opening the clip run through more cyanide solution and then water so as to wash the goldcarrying liquor thoroughly into the beaker it is no matter if the liquor is a little bit turbid transfer it to a lead dish evaporate scorify and cupel in the usual fashion the assay of goldzinc slimes which is the precipitate formed by zinc acting on cyanide solutions of gold may be made by wrapping 2 or 3 grams in 40 grams of sheet lead and scorifying cupelling c the amount of impurity in the stuff varies greatly it is usually calcined and mixed thoroughly with soda 40 per cent borax 30 per cent and sand 10 per cent and melted in graphite pots the buttons of bullion obtained are afterwards remelted with borax and run into bars the fineness of which varies from 600 to 830 thousandths the bars are sampled by chipping off diagonally opposite corners or better by drilling the drillings being freed from pieces of steel with the help of a magnet cupellation23the cupellation of lead for gold differs very little from that of lead carrying silver when the gold is accompanied by a larger proportion of silver and both have to be determined the cupellation must be conducted exactly as in a silver assay the usual precautions being taken to moderate the temperature so as to lessen the cupellation loss and to promote a slow and undisturbed solidification in order to avoid spirting if however the gold predominates the finish should be effected at a higher heat as the meltingpoint of gold is 100 higher than that of silver the bad effect of a higher temperature in increasing the cupellation loss need hardly be considered in the case of such small buttons of gold as are obtained in assaying gold ores as any loss there may be is hardly appreciable by the balance with larger quantities of gold however as in assaying gold bullion this loss becomes important and it is therefore necessary to very carefully regulate the temperature of the muffle so as to minimise the loss the cupels are made of wellburnt boneash of the fineness of coarse wheat flour moistened with onetwelfth its weight of water and compressed into shape in suitable moulds the moulds sold for this purpose are often of unsuitable shape since lead has a specific gravity of over 11 a cup to hold from 15 to 25 grams of molten lead need not have a capacity of more than about 2 cc a hollow about 1 inch across and 14 inch deep is sufficient and the body of the cupel to absorb this weight of lead should itself weigh from 20 to 25 grams the button of lead in a gold assay may be twice as heavy as this for these larger buttons a hollow 113 inch across and 13 inch deep will be sufficient if these larger cupels are not at hand the larger buttons will have to be reduced in size by a scorification before cupelling in some cases this preliminary scorification is advantageous or even necessary this may be because the lead is hard and impure or it may be that a very small button of gold is expected in the latter case it is best to scorify the lead down to something less than 1 gram and to perform the cupellation on a specially prepared small fine cupel these small cupels are best made by grinding the unsaturated portion of a used cupel to a fine powder and compressing the dry powder into a small berlin crucible or scorifier the face should be made quite smooth by pressure from a pestle on such cupels a small speck of gold less than 01 milligram will be left in a good shape and easily visible but the cupel must be withdrawn from the muffle as soon as the cupellation is finished to make sure of always getting the button in good condition in places such as mints where large numbers of bullion assays are regularly made a special form of cupel is used so that not less than six dozen assays may all be cupelled at the same time in a muffle of ordinary size these cupels are square blocks a little less than 2 inches across and a little more than three quarters of an inch deep each block carries four hollows of about 7 inch across and 3 inch deep a muffle on a floor space of 6 inches by 12 would take 3 of these blocks abreast and 6 deep and thus provide the means for 72 assays24 cupels made with wet boneash should be slowly dried and if in the muffle they can be slowly brought to an orangered heat it is all the better under no circumstances must the lead be placed on the cupel before the latter has been so thoroughly heated that it can no longer give off steam or gas of any kind for this gas bubbling through the molten metal spatters it thus spoiling one assay and throwing doubt on all the rest again the risk of freezing at the start is much greater with a cupel which has not been properly heated the best plan is to do all the cupellations in batches after the muffle has cooled down for the withdrawal of the last batch and the old cupels have been taken out the new cupels for the next batch should be put in their place the furnace should then be stoked and made ready for the next cupellations by the time the furnace is ready the cupels will be ready also there should be no unnecessary handling of the cupels once they have been placed in the muffle the cupellation temperature for gold is an orangered heat or perhaps a little hotter beginners who are apt to overheat their furnace should avoid a heat which can properly be called yellow dr tk rose25 has determined the temperature of a muffle during the cupellation of goldsilver alloys at the royal mint in one muffle the temperature ranged from 1065 to 1095 c the lower temperature was of course in the front of the muffle in another it ranged from 1022 to 1062 and here the muffle appeared to the eye decidedly cooler than usual the alloy left after cupelling was made up of 1 part of gold to 212 parts of silver and was fused at 952 hence the usual temperature of cupellation was say 120 or 130 above the meltingpoint of the residual metal to obtain some real knowledge as to the meaning of these figures the student should prepare pointed pieces of the following metals silver which melts at 945 gold which melts at 1035 and an alloy half silver half gold which melts at 990 these should be placed on clean cupels in a muffle almost entirely closed the temperature should be very slowly raised and the appearance of the muffle when each metal begins to melt should be carefully noted the cupelling temperature in dr roses experiment was as much above the meltingpoint of gold as this is above that of the silvergold alloy the finish of the cupellation of gold or goldsilver alloys is practically the same as with pure silver there is the same thinning out of the litharge into a luminous film which becomes iridescent before the brightening but the danger of spirting decreases as the proportion of gold becomes greater and disappears when the gold is much over 30 per cent nevertheless it is well to let such buttons become solid undisturbed and protected from draughts in the body of the muffle this means closing the muffle and allowing the furnace to cool down somewhat before withdrawing the cupels buttons solidified in this way are more malleable than when they are withdrawn promptly on the finish of the cupellation this is important with large buttons as in a bullion assay on the other hand very small buttons especially such as have to be measured rather than weighed should be withdrawn as soon as the luminous film has disappeared for when this is done the button can be loosened from the cupel by merely touching it with the point of a pin and is then safely and easily transferred to a watch glass by touching it with the head of a pin which has been moistened it adheres to this and if the pin is not too wet comes off at once on touching the glass or in any case will do so on gentle warming molten gold with little or no silver has a peculiar colour which is easy to recognise it is more globular than a button of silver of the same size would be and it shows less adhesion to the cupel just after becoming solid it glows beautifully and this is so marked that it is a valuable help in finding the position of a button when it is more than ordinarily minute if the button left from cupellation is yellow it is at least half gold and a rough guess as to the proportion of gold may be made from its yellowness the rest of the metal is generally silver the presence of platinum or one of the platinum group of metals makes the surface of the button dull and crystalline the native alloy of osmium and iridium does not alloy with gold however but falls to the bottom of the molten metal it shows itself in the subsequent parting as a black spot or streak on the under surface the buttons are removed from the cupel with a pair of pliers and then brushed to remove adherent litharge and boneash some assayers advise cleaning by dipping in warm dilute hydrochloric acid followed by washing in water and drying the button is next weighed when the quantity of silver obtained is not required to be known the weighing may sometimes be omitted the next operation in either case is parting either with or without a previous inquartation the loss of gold in cupellation is by no means always inconsiderable in three cupellations of 1 gram of gold with 20 grams of lead made purposely at a very high temperature the cupel absorbed 604 620 and 645 milligrams of gold hence at a high temperature there may easily be a loss of more than half a per cent of the gold in ten cupellations with the same quantities of gold and lead but at an ordinary temperature the gold recovered from the cupels varied from 137 to 192 milligrams and gave an average of 159 milligrams in round numbers the cupellation loss of pure gold is 15 per cent but if the gold be alloyed with silver the loss is diminished as is shown by the following experiments gold 3 gram was cupelled with 10 grams of lead and varying amounts of silver and the cupels were assayed for gold with the following results silver in the alloy 3 gram 6 gram 9 gram gold in the cupel 47 milligram 32 milligram 17 milligram these calculated on the 3 gram of gold give the loss as 157 107 and 057 per cent respectively the effect of copper on the other hand is to increase the cupellation loss which silver being absent may from this cause rise to 3 per cent even when the temperature is not excessive in the ordinary assay of goldcopper alloys a constant weight of the alloy is always taken hence as the weight of copper in a cupel charge increases the weight of gold decreases the silver on the other hand is always very nearly two and a half times as much as the gold whatever its quantity may be but the cupellation loss is smaller with less gold and greater with more copper and it so happens in these assays that these two opposites nearly neutralise one another mr wf lowe26 found the gold recoverable from the cupels on which 20 grains of gold bullion had been treated varied only between 014 and 015 grain ie from 07 to 075 per cent of the bullion treated although the quality of the bullion varied from 9 to 22 carat27 but in the poorest bullion there was only 75 grains of pure gold while in the richest there were 183 grains yet each lost on the cupel the same weight of gold viz 014 grain when reckoned in percentages of the actual gold present the losses are 187 per cent and 076 per cent respectively the heavier percentage loss is mainly due to the increased quantity of copper as with silver so with gold the predominant cause of the cupellation loss is the solution of the metal in the molten litharge which passes into the cupel three lots of 1 gram of gold cupelled each with 20 grams of lead repeatedly so as to make 13 cupellations in all lost in actual weight 3572 milligrams the gold recovered from the cupels amounted altogether to 3456 milligrams this shows that compared with the absorption by the cupel the other causes of loss are inconsiderable the loss of gold by volatilisation is however a real one the dust from the flues of assay furnaces has been tested on several occasions and found to contain gold though in small quantity thus mr lowe found 073 per cent of silver and 00033 per cent of gold in such a material the lead volatilised from a gold bullion assay would need to be ten times as rich as this to account for a loss of gold equal to the hundredth part of a milligram dr rose in the paper already quoted believes that on a 5 gram charge of standard bullion the loss from volatilisation is not less than 025 nor more than 05 milligram of gold by way of conclusion it may be said that the cupellation loss of gold is about 07 per cent and that it is largely met or even over corrected by a compensating error due to silver retained in the gold after parting inquartationthe method of separating the gold from the silver in goldsilver alloys by boiling with nitric acid does not act equally well in all cases an alloy half silver half gold rolled to thin sheet and boiled for half an hour with nitric acid may still retain more than twothirds of its silver an alloy of 1 part gold and 17 parts of silver gives up practically the whole of its silver under similar treatment the gold is left in a coherent though easily broken sheet retaining the shape of the original alloy the gold thus left is quite spongy and porous so that the acid can penetrate into its innermost portions but if the silver is in large excess in the alloy the removal of the silver is less complete and the residual gold instead of holding together in a form easy to manipulate falls to a powder which requires care and time in its treatment the older assayers therefore added silver to their gold in such proportion that the alloy for parting should be one quarter gold to three quarters silver this operation they called inquartation the modern practice is to aim at getting an alloy with 212 parts of silver and 1 part of gold in gold bullion assays this proportion should be obtained with fair exactness and in the parting of such gold buttons as are obtained in assaying ores it is well to aim at this proportion though absolute precision is not a matter of importance if the button left on cupelling the lead from an assay of an ore appears white it is best to assume that it already contains at least a sufficiency of silver in the absence of any knowledge to the contrary this will be true in almost all cases but if on parting it does not lose at least twothirds of its weight this indicates that the assumption was not justified and also what quantity of silver must be added to the button before again attempting to part generally the fault will be in the other direction the silver will be in excess and the gold will break up and demand very careful treatment if however such a button is yellow then from its weight and depth of colour a rough estimate can be made of how much gold is contained in it silver must be added to make the total weight 312 times as much as that of the gold supposed to be present thus if the button weighs 10 milligrams and is supposed to contain 8 milligrams of gold then 8 multiplied by 312 is 28 the button must in such case be made up to 28 milligrams by adding 18 milligrams of silver in judging of the quality of the gold button no ordinary error will very seriously affect the result if in the example just given the quantity of gold present was really 7 or even 9 milligrams of gold the resulting alloy would still have been suitable for such partings in fact in routine assays where the quantity as well as the quality of the gold is known within fair limits it is often the custom to add the silver for inquartation to the lead during the first cupellation but in the assay of rich gold alloys such approximate work will not do if the composition is not already known with a fair degree of accuracy preliminary assays must be made weigh up two lots of 100 milligrams of the alloy and wrap each in 3 grams of lead to one add 300 milligrams of silver cupel both the button containing the added silver must be flattened and boiled with 15 cc of nitric acid and the resulting gold must be washed dried ignited and weighed this in milligrams gives directly the percentage of gold the weight of the other button gives the percentage of gold and silver the difference between the two gives the percentage of silver the rest will perhaps be copper the composition of the alloy being known or having been determined as just described the calculation of how much silver must be added is fairly simple the following is an example suppose the bullion contains 92 per cent of gold 1 per cent of silver and 7 per cent of copper and that 5 gram of it is to be taken for an assay the 5 gram then will contain gold 460 gram silver 005 copper 035 but the total silver required is 46 gram 25 this equals 115 allowing for the 005 gram of silver already present 1145 gram of silver must be added the silver is incorporated with the gold and at the same time the copper is eliminated by cupelling with sheet lead how much sheet lead must be used will depend partly on how much bullion is taken partly on how much copper it contains four grams of lead will do for a 5 gram charge and for a 3 gram charge 3 grams may be used but with 20 per cent of copper these amounts should be doubled with 40 per cent of copper they should be trebled and with over 60 per cent of copper four times as much lead should be used for small buttons of gold as little lead as may be relied on to start cupelling may be taken the lead may conveniently be in the form of little cups made by folding lead foil on a piece of glass rod with a large number of bullion assays systematically worked and checked a simple plan would be to always use the quantity of lead required by the alloy containing most copper which turns up for assay this weight cut out of lead foil would be kept in stock folded into little bags ready to receive the bullion and silver the silver used for inquartation must of course be free from gold and is best prepared by the assayer who is to use it see p 66 it should not be in long strips or angular pieces likely to perforate the lead in which it is folded when wrapped in the lead it should be in the middle and should make as compact a parcel as possible each little parcel as completed should be placed on a tray in its properly numbered compartment its position here should correspond to that it will occupy in the muffle and eventually in the cupel tray the cupellation must be made with all the requisite precautions a good smooth malleable button is needed for the next operation which is known as flatting illustration fig 45 flattingsmall buttons such as are got in assaying most gold ores are placed on a polished steel anvil and flattened by one or two blows with a hammer the flattened discs are heated to dull redness on a clean cupel and are then ready for parting somewhat larger buttons may be similarly treated but they should be annealed ie heated to redness and allowed to cool during the flattening the silvergold alloy left from the cupellation is soft and bends like lead but after hammering or rolling it becomes harder gets a spring in it like a piece of mainspring and cracks or splits somewhat easily there should be no cracks or stripping or even roughness on the flattened metal since such defects may cause the loss of small particles either during the flattening or in the subsequent treatment with acid the softness of the metal is restored by heating in bullion assays the flatting of the buttons requires care and practice for its skilful working the strips of alloy for parting should be of uniform thickness and condition so that the action of the acid shall be equal in all cases the button is taken from the cupel cleaned and placed on the anvil it is then struck a heavy blow which widens it to about 34 inch in diameter this blow is followed by two others one a little in front the other behind which lengthen the disc and give a very blunt rooflike slope to its upper face it should then be annealed this may be done by putting it in a just redhot scorifier heated in a muffle it very soon attains the right heat and may then be transferred to a cold scorifier the hot scorifier should be put back into the muffle the softened disc is then taken to the rolls fig 45 the rolls are loosened until the disc can be pressed between them looking through the interval between them the rolls should appear exactly parallel if they are not one adjusting screw should be loosened and the other tightened until parallelism is obtained the rolls are now turned and the disc should be drawn through without any great effort beginners are apt to err by trying to do too much with one turn of the handle it is easy to stop whilst the rolls are only just gripping the metal and then to bring the disc back by reversing the action if the disc was originally level and the rolls are parallel the metal will appear as a strip which has been merely lengthened if the rolls are tighter on one side the strip will be bowed the tighter side will correspond with the outer curve of the crescent a mistake of this kind may be amended by passing the strip through the rolls the other way so as to reverse the irregularity and so straighten the strip the screw on the looser side should then be tightened until parallelism is obtained after which more care should be taken to tighten the two screws equally the rolling should be stopped when the strip is 3 or 4 inches long and of the thickness of an ordinary visiting card the strip should be annealed during the rolling and again at the finish partingthe thin sheet of metal is dropped into hot dilute nitric acid and boiled for five or six minutes after the brisk action of the acid on the metal has ceased at this stage nearly all the silver has gone into solution as nitrate of silver and the acid is charged with this salt this acid is poured off and the residual metal is again boiled for from 20 to 30 minutes with a second lot of stronger acid this leaves the gold almost pure though it may still retain from 05 to 1 per cent of silver treatment with the first acid only would probably leave three or four times as much the nitric acid used should be free from hydrochloric sulphuric iodic and telluric acids in testing it for the first of these add nitrate of silver and dilute with distilled water there should be no turbidity in testing for the others evaporate three lots in dishes over a waterbath test one for sulphates by adding water and barium chloride test another for iodates by taking up with a little water adding a few drops of starch paste and then dilute sulphurous acid solution a little at a time there should be no blue colour test the third for tellurium by heating with 1 cc of strong sulphuric acid until dense fumes come off allow to cool considerably a piece of tin foil added to the warm acid develops a fine purple colour if only a trace of tellurium is present the presence of lower oxides of nitrogen which impart a brown colour to the acid is objectionable they however are removed by boiling the diluted acid before using it for parting it is usual to keep a stock of the acid suitably diluted to the two strengths required for the parting these are known as the parting acids the first parting acid is the weaker and is used in the first attack on the metal the specific gravity generally recommended for it is about 12 it may be prepared either by diluting the strong acid with about its own volume of distilled water or by suitably diluting the second parting acid which has been already used in an assay the small proportion of silver this contains is not harmful for this purpose the second parting acid has a specific gravity of about 13 and may be made by diluting the strong acid with half its volume of distilled water parting in flasksflasks are most convenient for the larger partings as in bullion assays and should always be used for this purpose unless some of the special parting apparatus like that used in mints is available many assayers use flasks though of a smaller size for the ordinary partings in assaying gold ores the flasks are either bulbs with long necks fig 46 which ought to be heated on rose burners of special construction or they are small flatbottomed conical flasks which may be conveniently heated on a hotplate and are in this respect much easier to deal with in general work the following instructions apply to the parting of an alloy containing a few decigrams of gold together with the proper proportion of silver illustration fig 46 the strip from the rolls after being softened by annealing is folded on itself on a glass rod into a roll or cornet it should be so plastic that it will retain the shape thus given it and not spring open on removing the pressure of the fingers about 50 cc of the first parting acid are placed in a 6ounce conical flask and heated to boiling the flask is then withdrawn and tilted a little to one side whilst the cornet is cautiously dropped into it there will be a sudden issue of hot vapours and a prompt withdrawal of the hand is advisable the flask is replaced on the hot plate and the acid is kept boiling for 10 or 15 minutes the flask is then withdrawn and the acid diluted with about an equal volume of distilled water if the flask has a thick glass band around its neck a little way down28 care must be taken to use hot water for any sudden chill will certainly crack the flask where it is thus thickened the liquor is carefully decanted into a clean beaker and is then thrown into a jar marked waste silver about 40 cc of the second parting acid heated to boiling is then poured into the flask which is then replaced on the hot plate the boiling is continued for 15 or 20 minutes or even longer at this stage bumping has to be specially guarded against after a little experience it is easy to see when this is imminent and the flask should be withdrawn to a cooler part of the plate it is better to prolong the heating at a temperature below boiling than to run the risk of disaster some of the older writers however are rather insistent on vigorous boiling with large bubbles the addition of a small ball of wellburnt clay of about the size of a pea has been recommended as it lessens the tendency to irregular and dangerous boiling at the end of the treatment with the second acid the flask is withdrawn from the plate and the acid is diluted with an equal volume of distilled water the liquor is carefully decanted into a beaker and then poured into a jar or winchester marked acid waste it serves for making the first parting acid the flask is then washed twice with hot distilled water the washings must be carefully decanted from the gold the flask is then filled with water a parting cup size b is then placed over its mouth like a thimble on the tip of a finger this cup is of unglazed porous earthenware of such texture that it absorbs the last few drops of water left on drying and with a surface to which the gold does not adhere even on ignition the gold should fall out cleanly and completely on merely inverting the cup over the pan of the balance the flask and cup are then inverted so that the flask stands mouth down in the cup a little of the water from the flask flows into the cup but only a little the gold falls steadily through the water into the cup when time has been allowed for even the finest of the gold to have settled into the cup the flask is removed this is easiest done under water the cup with the flask still resting in it is dipped under water in a basin as soon as the neck of the flask is immersed the crucible can safely be drawn away from under it and then lifted out of the water the flask should not be taken away first for the rush of water from it may easily sweep the gold out of the cup the water in the cup is then drained off and the cup is dried at not too high a temperature for if the last drop or two of water should boil there is danger of spattering the gold out of the crucible when it is dry the cup is heated on a pipeclay triangle over a bunsen burner or on a slab of asbestos in a muffle to a dullred heat this brings the gold to colour that is the loose tender dark coloured gold becomes bright yellow and coherent and is in a state fit to be transferred to the balance and weighed all unnecessary transferences must be avoided as soon as the cup is cool it may be inverted over the pan of the balance when the gold will fall out cleanly or at the worst a gentle tap with the finger will be sufficient to detach it parting in testtubes or in the smaller conical flasks is used in the assay of gold ores of ordinary richness the work is exactly like that just described in all its main features generally speaking much less acid will be used for example in testtubes and for small buttons 3 or 4 cc of each acid is quite enough again the action need not be so prolonged 10 or 15 minutes in each acid is sufficient so too the heating may be less it is very convenient to support the testtubes in a waterbath or merely to rest them in a beaker of boiling water and there is no serious objection to doing this a smaller parting cup should be used the a size is suitable the button on the other hand should be beaten thinner than is needed for the larger partings if the silver should be in excess and the gold becomes much broken up ample time should be given for subsidence from the testtube or flask into the parting cup parting in glazed crucibles or dishesthis method of working has the advantage that there is no transference of the gold until it is placed on the pan of the balance on the other hand in the boiling more care is required in adjusting the temperature the following instructions apply to the treatment of very small buttons to which the method is more particularly applicable but very little modification is needed for the treatment of larger buttons the smallest sized berlin crucibles answer admirably they should be cleaned by treatment with hot and strong sulphuric acid followed by washing in distilled water the comfort and ease of working mainly depends on the thoroughness of this cleaning the crucible onethird full with the first parting acid is heated on the hot plate until the acid is almost boiling the flattened and annealed button is dropped into it and the heating continued with at most gentle boiling for a few minutes the crucible is then filled with distilled water which cools it enough for easy handling and when the gold has settled the liquor is poured off along a glass rod into a clean beaker any greasiness of the crucible makes itself felt here and is very objectionable the crucible is then onethird filled with the second parting acid and the heating resumed care being taken not to raise the temperature too high this should be continued much longer than before say for five or ten minutes or even longer according to the size of the button distilled water is again added and when it is drained off the washing with distilled water is twice repeated it will not be possible to drain off the last drop of water but if the gold is coherent the crucible can be so inclined that this drop drains away from the gold in which case the drying can be done rapidly the boiling of the water will do no harm but when the gold is much broken up it will collect in the middle of this drop and the drying must be done gently best by putting the crucible in a warm place when dry the crucible is heated till the gold changes colour but the heat must be kept well below redness when cold the gold is transferred directly to the pan of the balance with minute specks of gold which will require measuring it is best to put a small piece of lead foil say 1 gram in the crucible over the gold and then heat the crucible to above redness over a blowpipe whilst the lead is oxidising it is easily swept round in a bath of molten litharge by merely tilting the crucible in this way any separated specks of gold can be taken up with certainty when the worker is satisfied that the lead has had ample opportunity for taking up the gold the lead must be kept in one place and the heat slowly lowered by this means the button becomes supported in comparatively pure litharge and when solid can be picked out quite easily with a pair of pliers and in a very clean condition the lead button is then cupelled on a very fine cupel as already described the method of working last described destroys the crucible if the gold is not quite so small this may be avoided a small piece of lead foil should be hammered out until it is perfectly flexible it is then shaped into a tray and the gold is transferred to it the lead is then folded over with the help of two pins and cupelled if the crucible shows a black stain on heating it is because some silver remains through bad washing it shows poor work and the assay should be repeated the silver retained in the gold after parting is in bullion assays an important matter it is roughly equal to the loss of gold due to absorption by the cupel mr lowe working on 5 oz of gold obtained by parting in assaying bullion found it to contain 123 per cent of silver dr rose in some special assay pieces found by a less direct method of assaying from 06 to 09 per cent of silver the proportion of silver retained varies in a marked way with the proportion of gold to silver in the alloy before parting it is generally stated that the retained silver is least when this proportion is 1 to 212 and more or less silver than this leads to a less pure gold after parting platinum in an alloy being parted is dissolved along with the silver either altogether or in part it imparts a straw yellow colour to the parting acid palladium gives an orange colour to the acid the loss of gold by solution in the acid during parting is small but easily demonstrable on a 500milligram charge of bullion it may amount to from 05 to 15 milligram ie from 01 to 03 per cent it is due to gold actually dissolved and not merely held in suspension assaying with checks surchargeit will be seen from what has been stated that the errors in gold parting are of two kinds viz 1 a loss of gold on the cupel and to a less extent by solution in the acid and 2 an apparent gain of gold due to the retention of silver in the parted material both errors are small and as they are of an opposite character they tend to neutralise each other hence they are altogether without effect on the accuracy of the assays of ores when the total gold is reckoned in milligrams and even with the larger amounts present in bullion assays their influence is so small that an uncorrected result is still fairly accurate the resultant error would not be more than one part in two or three thousand it is customary to report the purity of bullion or its fineness as it is called in parts per thousand of bullion the sum of the errors of an assay which is called the surcharge is reported in the same way thus a surcharge of 3 means that the gold as weighed was 3 part per 1000 more than the gold actually present but a surcharge 3 means that on the whole there was a loss of 3 part per 1000 in the assay speaking roughly the retained silver will vary with the weight of gold present if one alloy contains twice as much gold as another the retained silver will be about twice as much also on the other hand as already explained the cupellation loss on the poorer alloy is as much as or even more than with the richer one because of the copper c present with rich gold alloys the silver more than compensates for the loss and the surcharge is positive but with poorer alloys the loss is greater and the surcharge is negative in mints and places where bullion assays must be made with the highest attainable accuracy the surcharge is determined by experiment and the proper correction is made in the reports on the bullion this is done by making assays of gold of the highest degree of purity alongside of those of the bullion whose quality has to be determined these checks are so made that they do not differ from the actual assays in any material point thus being of the same quality and weight and undergoing exactly the same treatment they may reasonably be expected to have the same surcharge as the assays they imitate suppose the bullion being assayed varies only a little up or down from 900 gold and 100 copper in the thousand and that 5 gram of it is used in each assay a quantity of gold differing only a little from 450 gram would be very exactly weighed and placed with 050 gram of copper in the same weight of lead as is being used in the other assays it would be cupelled parted c as nearly as possible under the same conditions as the actual assays suppose the pure gold weighed 45016 gram and the parted gold weighed 45025 gram the gain in weight 00009 gram would be deducted from the actual assays a surcharge correction is never applied except to bullion of the same quality as that represented by the check assay it was calculated from it is evident that unless the gold is of the highest degree of purity these check assays will introduce an error almost equal to that which it is designed to remedy moreover to work the checks to the greatest advantage a very systematic and uniform method of working must be adopted parting in special apparatusone plan for obtaining greater uniformity is to stamp each cornet with a number for purposes of identification and to treat several including one or more check assays in the same acid contained in a beaker all the assays under these conditions evidently receive precisely the same acid treatment such a plan can of course only be adopted where there is no risk of the gold breaking up during the parting an improvement on this is to have a porcelain basin29 about 812 inches in diameter and with a capacity of about 112 litres it is provided with a porcelain cover with 30 numbered holes through which tubes dip into the acid the cover is removable the tubes are like testtubes and are supported by the cover their bottoms are perforated with holes or slits the acid is placed in the basin and boiled over a flat burner it enters the tubes through the slits the cornets are placed each in its proper tube when the boiling is finished the cover with the tubes is lifted and at the same time the acid drains back into the basin a dip into a basin of distilled water washes at one operation all 30 assays the cover is then put on a basin containing the stronger parting acid which is already boiling this boiling is continued for half an hour the cover with the 30 cornets is then lifted out from the acid and dipped two or three times in distilled water to wash off the last traces of acid to transfer the cornets from the tubes to the porous cups the whole of the tube must be dipped under the water otherwise the operation is exactly as when working with testtubes a still simpler method of working is to use small platinum cups30 provided with fine slits which admit the acid but retain the gold a number of these say 60 are supported on a platinum tray the parting acids are boiled in platinum dishes under a hood and the 60 cornets each in its proper cup are placed in the acid all at once the tray carrying the cups is provided with a handle suitable for this purpose after a proper boiling the tray is lifted out of the weaker acid into the stronger one where it undergoes the second boiling it is next dipped several times in distilled water and lastly after a gentle drying it is raised to an annealing temperature which must not be too high for fear of the gold sticking to the platinum after cooling the cornets are transferred from the platinum cups directly to the pan of the balance here all 60 cornets have exactly the same treatment and the checks may be compared with great exactness with the other assays accompanying them there is too a great saving of labour31 silver c in gold bullionthe base metals are generally determined by cupelling 5 gram of the alloy with 5 grams of lead the loss in cupellation having been allowed for by any of the usual methods see p 104 the gold and silver contents are given by deducting the gold the proportion of silver is obtained the silver is generally determined by difference in this way if it is desired to dissolve out the copper silver c and to determine them in the wet way the gold must first be alloyed with a sufficiency of some other metal to render it amenable to the attack by acid cadmium is the metal generally recommended and the alloy is made by melting together a weighed portion of the gold with five or six times its weight of cadmium in a berlin crucible and under a thin layer of potassium cyanide lead with gold or silverlarge quantities of lead carrying gold and silver are sold to refiners in bars weighing about 100 lbs each the assay of these alloys presents no special difficulties but the sampling of them is a question which may be profitably discussed32 a molten metal may be conceived to have all the physical states observed in ordinary liquids although these cannot be actually seen owing to its opaqueness there is no doubt that pure lead at a temperature only a little above its meltingpoint can contain a large proportion of gold in such a manner that it may in a figurative way be spoken of as a clear solution any small portion withdrawn from the molten metal would afford a perfect sample the same would be true of any pure alloy of lead and silver in which the silver does not exceed the proportion of 212 per cent33 on the other hand if the molten metal contains much more than 5 per cent of zinc more than 1 per cent of copper or a larger quantity of silver it may be likened to a turbid liquor the resemblance holds good so far that if the molten lead be further heated whereby its solvent power on the added metal is increased the turbidity will disappear or at least be considerably diminished a portion taken at random from such a molten metal may or may not give a good sample the suspended insoluble matter will tend to concentrate itself in the upper or lower parts of the liquid according to whether it is heavier or lighter than it and this separation may occur with extreme slowness or with fair rapidity however it is generally agreed that in the case of such alloys as occur in practice samples taken in this way are quite satisfactory and are the best obtainable the precautions insisted on are that the lead shall be made as hot as practicable that it shall be stirred up at the time of taking the sample and that the portion withdrawn shall be taken out with a ladle at least as hot as the molten metal the further precaution that if any dross be on the surface of the metal it shall be skimmed off and separately sampled and assayed is almost too obvious to require mention an alternative and perhaps better way of taking the sample is to withdraw portions at equal intervals from the stream of metal whilst the pot is being emptied equal weights taken from these portions and mixed by melting or in some other way give a fair sample of the whole in addition separate assays of each portion will show to what extent the metal lacks uniformity in composition for example samples taken at the beginning middle and end of a run gave the following results in ozs of silver per ton 475 472 466 showing an average result of 471 ozs fifteen fractions taken at regular intervals during the same pouring ranged from 475 ozs to 464 ozs the average result was 4698 ozs the same lead cast into bars and sampled by sawing gave an average of 470 ozs34 in another case35 samples drawn at the beginning middle and end of a run gave 1345 ozs 1335 ozs and 1331 ozs the mean result in such cases is always a reasonably safe one but evidently where the metal varies a good deal it is safer to take more than three dips imagine such lead run into moulds and allowed to become solid as bars the difference between bar and bar would not be greater than that between corresponding dip samples but in each bar the distribution of the silver and gold is very seriously affected during solidification chips taken from the same bar of auriferous lead may show in one place 23 ozs of gold to the ton in another 39 ozs similarly with silver they may vary as much as from 900 ozs to 1500 ozs to the ton this rearrangement of the constituents of a bar takes place whilst the lead is partly solid partly liquid the most useful conception of such halfsolidified metal is that of a felted spongy mass of skeleton crystals of comparatively pure lead saturated with a still fluid enriched alloy if the solidification of an ingot of impure tin be watched it will be evident that the frosted appearance of the surface is due to the withdrawal of the fluid portion from a mat of crystals of purer tin which have been for some time solid and a contraction of the mass the shrinking of the last part to become solid is further shown by the collapse of the surface of the ingot where weakest that is a furrow is formed on the flat surface in other cases of fused metal there is expansion instead of contraction in this final stage of the solidification and the enriched alloy then causes the upper face of the ingot to bulge outwards there are other causes effecting the redistribution of the metals through the ingot there can be no general rule of wide application showing which part of a bar is richest and which poorest in the precious metals this will depend on the quantities of gold or silver on the quantities and kinds of other metals present and on the manner of casting the student is advised to consult mr claudets paper which has been already referred to the best method of sampling such bars is to melt them all down and to take a dip sample of the molten metal in one or other of the methods already described according to mr claudet this should be done in all cases where the gold exceeds one or two ounces or where the silver exceeds 200 ozs to the ton if during the melting down some dross has formed this must be skimmed off weighed and separately sampled and assayed the clean lead also must be weighed sampled and assayed the mean result must be calculated thus 14 tons 5 cwts of clean lead assaying 32 ozs to the ton will contain 456 ozs of silver 15 cwt dross assaying 20 ozs to the ton will contain 15 ozs of silver the 15 tons of lead and dross will contain 471 ozs of silver or 314 ozs per ton of the methods of sampling which avoid melting the bars that known as sawing is the only one which is thoroughly satisfactory in it the bars are brought to a circular saw having fine teeth and are sawn across either completely or halfway through in this way a quantity of lead sawdust is obtained say 1 lb or so from a bar which represents exactly the average of the bar along the particular cross section taken and approximately that of the whole bar a bar of lead which by dip assay gave 334 ozs to the ton gave on three transverse sections 333 ozs 335 ozs and 331 ozs the variation may be greater than this but with a large number of bars where each bar is cut across in as far as possible a different place these variations tend to neutralise each other and a good sample is obtained two or three cwt of sawdust may be obtained in this way this is thoroughly mixed and reduced by quartering in the usual way or by a mechanical sampler a sample of 2 or 3 lbs is sent to the assayer this being contaminated with the oil used in lubricating the saw is freed from it by washing with carbon bisulphide ether or benzene and dried then after mixing 100 to 200 grams of it are carefully weighed and placed in a hot crucible the heat of which should be sufficient to melt all the lead the molten lead should not be overheated and should show no loss due to the melting the removal of the oil may have decreased the weight by perhaps one half per cent if the lead gives dross on heating it may be melted under 10 or 20 grams of potassium cyanide which prevents the formation of dross samples are sometimes taken with a drill gouge or chisel though no method of this kind is quite satisfactory one plan adopted is to use a punch which when driven into the bar gives a core or rod of metal about half as long as the bar is thick and about oneeighth of an inch across with five bars side by side it is customary to drive in the punch at one end on the first bar and at the opposite end on the last one and on the others in intermediate positions in such a manner that all the holes will be along a diagonal of the rectangle enclosing the bars the bars are then turned over and similar portions punched out through the bottoms of the bars and along the other diagonal or one set of five may be sampled along the top and the next set along the bottom of the bars silver and gold present in bars of copper are subject to the same irregularity of distribution as in lead the sampling of such bars is guided by the same principles36 cyanides the cyanides ought perhaps to be considered along with chlorides bromides and iodides in chapter xv but they are treated here because they owe their importance to their use in the extraction of gold and because their determination has become a part of the ordinary work of an assayer of gold ores formerly the cyanide most easily obtained in commerce was potassium cyanide and it was generally sold in cakes which might contain as little as 40 per cent or as much as 95 per cent of the pure salt it became customary to express the quality of a sample of commercial cyanide by saying it contained so much per cent of potassium cyanide the commercial product now made by improved methods of manufacture is actually sodium cyanide but is called potassium cyanide probably with the words double salt on the label it contains cyanide equivalent to something over 100 per cent of potassium cyanide in addition to a large proportion of sodium carbonate and other impurities what is wanted in most cases is merely a soluble cyanide and it is a matter of indifference whether the base be sodium or potassium but since 49 parts of sodium cyanide nacn 49 are equivalent to 65 parts of potassium cyanide kcn 65 it is evident that a pure sample of sodium cyanide would contain cyanide equivalent to little less than 133 per cent of potassium cyanide therefore a sample of cyanide reported on in this way may be rich in cyanide and yet have much impurity the commonest impurity in commercial cyanide is carbonate of sodium or potassium this may be tested for by dissolving say 2 grams in a little water and adding barium chloride there may be formed a white precipitate of barium carbonate which if filtered off washed and treated with acid will dissolve with effervescence cyanate may be tested for in the solution from which the barium carbonate has been filtered by adding a little soda and boiling if cyanates are present they decompose giving off ammonia which may be tested for in the steam and yielding a further precipitate of barium carbonate37 if the soda alone gave a further precipitate of barium carbonate this may perhaps be due to the presence of bicarbonates alkaline sulphides may be present in small quantity in commercial cyanide their presence is shown at once when the sample is being tested for its strength in cyanide inasmuch as the first few drops of silver nitrate solution produce at once a darkening of the liquor a special test for sulphide may be made by adding a drop or two of solution of acetate of lead to four or five cc of soda solution and adding this to a clear solution of the suspected cyanide this will cause a black precipitate or colour if any sulphide is present the cyanides of the heavier metals combine with the alkaline cyanides to form double cyanides some of these ferrocyanide and ferricyanide of potassium for example have such characteristic properties that the fact that they are cyanides may be overlooked others such as potassium zinc cyanide k2zncy4 have much less distinctiveness they behave more or less as a mixture of two cyanides and are moreover so easily decomposed that it may be doubted if they can exist in dilute alkaline solutions in reporting the cyanide strength of a cyanide liquor as equivalent to so much per cent of potassium cyanide there is a question as to whether the cyanide present in the form of any of these double cyanides should be taken into account it must be remembered that the object of the assay is not to learn how much of the cyanide exists in the solution as actual potassium cyanide reporting the strength in terms of this salt is a mere matter of convenience what is really desired is to know how much of the cyanide present in the liquor is free or available for the purposes of dissolving gold every one is agreed as to the exclusion of such cyanides as the following potassium ferrocyanide k4fecy6 potassium ferricyanide k3fecy6 potassium silver cyanide kagcy2 and potassium aurocyanide kaucy2 and the double cyanides with copper or nickel but with cyanide liquors containing zinc the position is less satisfactory one method of assay gives a lower proportion of cyanide when this metal is present and the loss of available cyanide thus reported depends though in a fitful and uncertain way upon the quantity of zinc present the other method of assay reports as full a strength in cyanide as if no zinc were present unfortunately using both methods and accepting the difference in the results as a measure of the quantity of zinc present or at any rate of the zinc present as cyanide is not satisfactory it appears best to use the method which ignores the zinc and to determine the amount of zinc by a special assay of the liquor for this metal the cyanide present as hydrogen cyanide or prussic acid hcy is practically useless as a gold solvent hence any report on the strength of a cyanide liquor which assigned to this the same value as its equivalent of alkaline cyanide would be misleading on the other hand it is available cyanide inasmuch as a proper addition of sodium hydrate38 would restore its value the question of the presence or absence of free prussic acid is involved in the larger one as to whether the cyanide solution has the right degree of alkalinity the assay for cyanide should include the hydrogen cyanide with the rest a rough test of the power of a cyanide liquor for dissolving gold may be made by floating a gold leaf on its surface and noting the time required for its solution this test might perhaps be improved by taking say 20 cc of the liquor and adding three or four gold leaves so that the gold shall always be in considerable excess the liquor should not be diluted as this will affect the result it should be allowed to stand for a definite time say at least two or three hours or better that corresponding to the time the liquor is left in contact with the ore in actual practice the liquor should then be filtered off and with the washings be evaporated in a lead dish as in the assay of cyanide liquors for gold p 141 the gold obtained on cupelling less any gold and silver originally present in the liquor would be the measure of the gold dissolving power the assay for cyanide by titration with silver nitrate the determination of the quantity of a cyanide is made by finding how much silver nitrate is required to convert the whole of the cyanide into potassium silver cyanide39 or one of the allied compounds it will be seen from the equation that 170 parts by weight of silver nitrate are required for 130 parts by weight of potassium cyanide as already explained it is customary to report the cyanidestrength in terms of potassium cyanide even when only the sodium salt is present one gram of potassium cyanide will require 13076 gram of silver nitrate the standard solution of silver nitrate is made by dissolving 13076 grams of silver nitrate in distilled water and diluting to 1 litre 100 cc of such a solution are equivalent to 1 gram of potassium cyanide40 the titration is performed in the usual way running the standard solution of silver nitrate into a solution containing a known weight or volume of the material containing the cyanide the finishing point is determined in one of two ways both of which are largely used in the first place as long as there remains any free cyanide in the solution the silver nitrate will combine with it forming the double cyanide and yielding a clear solution but as soon as all the free cyanide is used up the silver nitrate will react with the double cyanide41 forming silver cyanide which separates as a white precipitate and renders the solution turbid but in the second place if potassium iodide is present in the solution the excess of silver nitrate will react with it42 rather than with the double cyanide and silver iodide will separate as a yellowish turbidity which is easily recognised in working with pure solutions the two finishing points give the same results and this is true even when there is much difference in the degree of dilution the finishing point with the iodide however has an advantage in precision moreover it is but little affected by variations in alkalinity which render the other finishing point quite useless the great difference between the two is shown when zinc is present in the solution in this case when working without the iodide the first appearance of a turbidity is less distinct the turbidity increases on standing and as a finishing point is unsatisfactory it can be determined with precision only by very systematic working and after some experience the turbidity is due to the separation of an insoluble zinc compound a most important point to which reference has already been made is that less silver nitrate is required to give this turbidity and consequently a lower strength in cyanide is reported on the other hand as much silver nitrate is required to give the yellow turbidity due to silver iodide as would be required if no zinc were present unfortunately the difference in the two titrations does not depend merely on the quantity of zinc present as it is also influenced by the extent of dilution the degree of alkalinity of the solution and the quantity of cyanide present in an experiment with 055 gram of zinc sulphate and 1 gram of potassium cyanide the difference in the two finishing points was only 1 cc whereas with 4 gram of potassium cyanide the other conditions being the same the difference was 15 cc of standard silver nitrate on the assumption that all the zinc was present as potassium zinc cyanide k2zncy4 the difference should have been 5 cc in each case again repeating the experiment with 4 gram of potassium cyanide but with 11 gram of crystallised zinc sulphate the difference was 65 cc that is merely doubling the quantity of zinc increased the difference by more than four times hence it would appear better to use the method with the iodide and make a separate assay for the zinc but since the student may be called on to use the other method he is advised to practice it also the assay without iodidethe standard solution of silver nitrate is placed in a small burette divided into tenths of a cc ten cc of the cyanide solution to be assayed is transferred to a small flask and diluted with water to about 70 cc the silver solution is then run in from the burette with constant shaking of the flask a little at a time but somewhat rapidly until a permanent turbidity appears since 1 cc of the silver nitrate solution corresponds to 01 gram of potassium cyanide it also corresponds to 1 per cent of this salt counted on the 10 cc of cyanide solution taken the titration should be performed in a fairly good uniform light the learner should practice on a fairly pure solution of potassium cyanide at first and this may conveniently have a strength of about 1 per cent for practice with solutions containing zinc make a solution containing 11 gram of crystallised zinc sulphate in 100 cc and slowly add measured quantities of from 1 to 5 cc of this to the 10 cc of cyanide liquor before diluting for the titration if a cyanide solution blackens on the addition of the silver nitrate it contains sulphide in this case shake up a considerable bulk of the liquor with a few grams of lead carbonate allow to settle and make the assay on 10 cc of the clear liquor if the cyanide liquor be suspected to contain free prussic acid take 10 cc for the assay as usual but before titrating add 1 or 2 gram of sodium carbonate on no condition must caustic soda or ammonia be added the difference between the results with and without the addition of carbonate of soda is supposed to measure the quantity of free prussic acid if this has to be reported it is best done as prussic acid equivalent to per cent of potassium cyanide suppose for example the difference in the two titrations equals 1 cc of standard silver nitrate the prussic acid found would be equivalent to 1 per cent of potassium cyanide the assay with iodidethe standard solution of silver nitrate is placed in a burette divided into tenths of a cc take 10 cc of the cyanide liquor which should previously have been treated with white lead for the removal of sulphides if these happened to be present transfer to a small flask add 3 or 4 drops of a solution of potassium iodide and 2 or 3 cc of a solution of sodium hydrate dilute to 60 or 70 cc with water if much zinc is present the soda may be increased to 20 or 30 cc with advantage the standard solution should be run in somewhat rapidly but a little at a time so that the precipitate at first formed shall be small and have only a momentary existence the titration is continued until there is a permanent yellowish turbidity the most satisfactory and exact finish is got by ignoring any faint suspicion of a turbidity and accepting the unmistakable turbidity which the next drop of silver nitrate is sure to produce this finishing point gives results which are exactly proportional to the quantity of cyanide present and it can be recognised with more than ordinary precision even in solutions which are not otherwise perfectly clear each cc of the standard silver nitrate solution corresponds to 01 gram of potassium cyanide and if 10 cc of the liquor are taken for assay this corresponds to 1 per cent or 2 lbs to the short ton or 224 lbs to the long ton as already explained the result should be reported as cyanide equivalent to so much per cent of potassium cyanide the following experimental results were obtained with a solution of potassium cyanide made up to contain about 12 per cent of the salt effect of varying cyanidethe bulk before titration was in each case 60 cc 2 cc of soda and 3 drops of potassium iodide were used in each case cyanide added 40 cc 30 cc 20 cc 10 cc 5 cc 1 cc silver required 470 cc 3525 cc 235 cc 117 cc 58 cc 115 cc accepting the result for 40 cc as correct the others are in very satisfactory agreement effect of varying dilutionthe conditions were those of the 40 cc experiment in the last series but varying amounts of water were used in diluting water added none 100 cc 200 cc 400 cc silver required 470 cc 470 cc 470 cc 4705 cc very considerable dilution therefore has no effect effect of varying sodathe conditions were those of the 40 cc experiment in the first series except that varying amounts of soda solution were used soda added none 10 cc 30 cc silver required 4695 cc 470 cc 470 cc this alkali therefore has no prejudicial effect effect of ammoniasoda causes turbidity in some cyanide liquors with these it should be replaced by 2 or 3 cc of dilute ammonia with a gram or so of ammonium chloride the following experiments with dilute ammonia show that larger quantities of this reagent must be avoided ammonia added none 10 cc 30 cc 60 cc silver required 4695 cc 4715 cc 477 cc 495 cc effect of sodium bicarbonatein this experiment 1 gram of bicarbonate of soda was used instead of the soda or ammonia of the other experiments the silver nitrate required was only 4645 cc instead of the 470 cc which is the normal result this is probably due to the liberation of prussic acid and shows the importance of having the solution alkaline effect of zincin each experiment 40 cc of the cyanide solution and 5 gram of zinc sulphate crystals were used and the bulk was made up to 100 cc before titrating soda added 1 cc 5 cc 10 cc 25 cc silver required 471 cc 470 cc 469 cc 469 cc the work was easier with the more alkaline solutions the titration in the presence of zinc is comparatively easy but in learning it it is well to have a burette with cyanide so that if a titration be overdone it can be brought back by the addition of 1 or 2 cc more cyanide and the finish repeated a quarter of an hours work in this way will ensure confidence in the method effect of other substancesit was found that an alkaline cyanate sulphocyanate ferrocyanide nitrite borate silicate or carbonate has no effect the ferricyanide had a small influence and as might be expected hyposulphite is fatal to the assay the addition of salts of lead and cadmium was without effect on the other hand nickel produces its full effect and the quantity of nickel added can be calculated with accuracy from the extent of its interference with the titration assay of commercial cyanide of potassiumbreak off 20 or 30 grams of the cyanide in clean fresh pieces weigh accurately to the nearest centigram dissolve in water containing a little sodium hydroxide transfer to a 2litre flask dilute to 2 litres add a few grams of white lead shake up and allow to settle run 50 cc of the clear liquor from a burette into an 8 oz flask add 2 or 3 cc of soda solution and 3 drops of potassium iodide titrate with the standard solution of silver nitrate the percentage may be calculated by multiplying the number of cc used by 40 50 cc is one fortieth of the 2 litres and dividing by the weight of commercial cyanide originally taken alkalinity of commercial potassium cyanide and of cyanide solutionshydrocyanic acid like carbonic acid has no action on methylorange43 hence the alkaline cyanides may be titrated with normal acid as easily as the carbonates or hydrates 100 cc of normal acid will neutralise 65 grams of pure potassium cyanide44 a solution of commercial cyanide prepared as for the assay last described but best without the addition of white lead may be used for the test take 50 cc of it tint faintly yellow with methylorange and titrate with normal acid till the liquor acquires a permanent reddish tint in the case of the purer samples of cyanide the quantity of acid used will correspond exactly with that required to neutralise the actual quantity of cyanide present as determined by the assay with nitrate of silver the less pure samples will show an excess of alkalinity because of the presence of sodium carbonate or of potassium carbonate in comparing the alkalinity and cyanide strength of a solution the simplest plan is to take 65 cc of the solution and titrate with normal acid for in this case each cc of normal acid corresponds to 1 per cent of potassium cyanide in systematic assays of this kind the alkalinity would no doubt be generally in excess of that required by the cyanide present there would be no inconvenience in recording such excess in terms of potassium cyanide determination of the acidity of an oremost ores have the power of destroying more or less of the alkalinity of a cyanide solution and in a proportionate degree of damaging its efficiency an assay is needed to determine how much lime or soda must be added for each ton of ore in order to counteract this whether this acidity should be reported in terms of the lime or of the soda required to neutralise it will depend on which of these reagents is to be used in the actual practice again if the ore is washed with water before treating with cyanide on the large scale then the assay should be made of the acidity of the ore after a similar washing the standard solutions of acid and alkali used for this determination may be onefifth normal 200 cc of the normal solution should be diluted to 1 litre in each case 1 cc of the resulting solutions would be equivalent to 8 milligrams of soda naho or 56 milligrams of lime cao it must be remembered this refers to the pure bases in each case suppose it is desired to report as so many lbs of lime to the short ton 2000 lbs of ore since 1 cc of the standard solution is equivalent to 56 milligrams of lime if we take 2000 times this weight of ore ie 11200 milligrams or 112 grams for the assay each cc of standard solution will be equivalent to 1 lb of lime to the short ton45 total acidityweigh out 112 grams of the ore place them in a fourinch evaporating dish and measure on to it from a burette 10 or 20 cc of the standard solution of soda stir the soda solution into the ore and allow to stand for 15 or 20 minutes with occasional stirring stir up with 30 or 40 cc of water float a piece of litmus paper on the liquid and titrate with the standard solution of acid if the ore is strictly neutral the quantity of acid required to redden the litmus will be the same as the quantity of soda originally used if the ore is acid less acid will be used for example if 10 cc of soda were used and only 7 cc of acid were required the ore will have done the work of the remaining 3 cc of acid and the ton of ore will require 3 lbs of lime to neutralise its acidity acidity after washingtake 112 grams of the ore wash thoroughly with water and immediately treat the residue without drying exactly as just described examination of cyanide solutions for metals ctake a measured quantity of the solution say 20 cc46 and evaporate in a small dish with say half a cc of strong sulphuric acid evaporate at first on a waterbath in a well ventilated place but finish off with a naked bunsen flame using a high temperature at the end in order to completely decompose the more refractory double cyanides allow to cool moisten with strong hydrochloric acid warm with a little water and test for the metals in the solution by the ordinary methods since the quantities of the metals likely to be present may be given in milligrams the work must be carefully performed it may be worth while to determine the proportions of lime and magnesia as well as those of the metals proper or the 20 cc of cyanide liquor may be evaporated with 5 cc of strong nitric acid to dryness and gently ignited and the residue taken up with 2 or 3 cc of strong hydrochloric acid copper iron and zinc can be rapidly determined in such a solution as follows dilute with water to 10 or 15 cc add an excess of ammonia and filter the precipitate will contain the iron as ferric hydrate dissolve it in a little hot dilute sulphuric acid reduce with sulphuretted hydrogen boil off the excess of gas cool and titrate with standard potassium permanganate p 236 determine the copper in the filtrate colorimetrically p 203 but avoid further dilution then add dilute hydrochloric acid so as to have an excess of 4 or 5 cc after neutralising the ammonia add some clean strips of lead foil and boil until the solution has for some time become colourless titrate with standard potassium ferrocyanide p 263 without further dilution and bearing in mind that at most only one or two cc will be required examination of an ore for cyanicidesplace 100 grams of the ore with 200 cc of a cyanide solution of known strength say 1 or 2 per cent in a bottle and agitate for a definite time such as one or two days filter off some of the liquor and assay for cyanide using say 20 cc calculate how much cyanide has been destroyed in the operation evaporate 20 cc with sulphuric or nitric acid and examine for metal test another portion for sulphides c the student who has mastered the methods of assaying can greatly improve himself by working out such problems as the above platinum platinum occurs in nature in alluvial deposits associated with gold and some rare metals generally in fine metallic grains and occasionally in nuggets it is a grey metal with a high specific gravity 215 when pure and about 180 in native specimens it is fusible only at the highest temperature and is not acted on by acids it is dissolved by warm aqua regia forming a solution of platinic chloride h2ptcl6 this substance on evaporation remains as a brownish red deliquescent mass on drying at 300 c it is converted into platinous chloride ptcl2 and becomes insoluble and at a higher temperature it is converted into platinum all platinum compounds yield the metal in this way platinic chloride combines with other chlorides to form double salts of which the ammonic and potassic platinochlorides are the most important platinum alone is not soluble in nitric acid but when alloyed with other metals which dissolve in this acid it too is dissolved so that in gold parting for example if platinum was present some or perhaps the whole of it would go into solution with the silver such alloys however when treated with hot sulphuric acid leave the platinum in the residue with the gold platinum is detected when in the metallic state by its physical characters and insolubility in acids in alloys it may be found by dissolving them in nitric acid or in aqua regia evaporating with hydrochloric acid and treating the filtrate with ammonic chloride and alcohol a heavy yellow precipitate marks its presence the assay of bullion or of an alloy containing platinum may be made as follows take 02 gram of the alloy and an equal weight of fine silver cupel with sheet lead and weigh the loss in weight after deducting that of the silver added gives the weight of the base metals copper lead c flatten the button and part by boiling with strong sulphuric acid for several minutes when cold wash anneal and weigh the weight is that of the platinum and gold the silver may be got by difference recupel the metal thus got with 12 or 15 times its weight of silver flatten and part the gold with nitric acid in the usual way see under gold and the platinum will dissolve the gold may contain an alloy of osmium and iridium if so it should be weighed and treated with aqua regia the osmiridium will remain as an insoluble residue which can be separated and weighed its weight deducted from that previously ascertained will give the weight of the gold when the platinum only is required the alloy must be dissolved by prolonged treatment with aqua regia the solution evaporated to dryness and the residue extracted with water the solution thus obtained is treated with ammonic chloride in large excess and with some alcohol a sparingly soluble47 yellow ammonic platinum chloride is thrown down mixed perhaps with the corresponding salts of other metals of the platinum group gold will be in solution the solution is allowed to stand for some time and then the precipitate is filtered off washed with alcohol dried and transferred wrapped in the filter paper to a weighed crucible it is ignited gently at first as there is danger of volatilising some of the platinum chloride and afterwards intensely with large quantities of platinum the ignition should be performed in an atmosphere of hydrogen cool and weigh as metallic platinum iridium occurs in nature alloyed with osmium as osmiridium or iridosmine which is rather abundant in the auriferous beach sands of northern california dana it occurs in bright metallic scales which do not alloy with lead and are insoluble in aqua regia iridium also occurs in most platinum ores and forms as much as two per cent of some commercial platinum in chemical properties it resembles platinum but the ammonic iridochloride has a dark red colour and on ignition leaves metallic iridium which does not dissolve in aqua regia diluted with four or five times its volume of water and heated to a temperature of 40 or 50 c the other metals of the platinum group are palladium rhodium osmium and ruthenium they differ from gold platinum and iridium by the insolubility of their sulphides in a solution of sodium sulphide palladium is distinguished by the insolubility of its iodide and osmium by the volatility of its oxide on boiling with nitric acid mercury mercury occurs native and occasionally alloyed with gold or silver in natural amalgams but its chief ore is the sulphide cinnabar it is comparatively rare being mined for only in a few districts it is chiefly used in the extraction of gold and silver from their ores amalgamation for silvering mirrors c mercury forms two series of salts mercurous and mercuric but for the purposes of the assayer the most important property is the ease with which it can be reduced to the metallic state from either of these mercury itself is soluble in nitric acid forming when the acid is hot and strong mercuric nitrate cinnabar is soluble only in aqua regia mercurous salts are generally insoluble and may be converted into mercuric salts by prolonged boiling with oxidising agents nitric acid or aqua regia the salts of mercury are volatile and if heated with a reducing agent or some body capable of fixing the acid metallic mercury is given off which may be condensed and collected mercury is separated from its solutions by zinc or copper or it may be thrown down by stannous chloride which when in excess gives a grey powder of metallic mercury or if dilute a white crystalline precipitate of mercurous chloride nitric acid solutions of mercury yield the metal on electrolysis and if the pole on which the metal comes down be made of gold or copper or is coated with these the separated mercury will adhere thereto it may then be washed and weighed the best tests for mercury next to obtaining globules of the metal are 1 a black precipitate with sulphuretted hydrogen from acid solutions which is insoluble in nitric acid and 2 a white precipitate with stannous chloride dry method illustration fig 47 weigh up 5 grams if the ore is rich or 10 grams if a poorer mineral take a piece of combustion tube from 18 inches to 2 feet long closed at one end and place in it some powdered magnesite so as to fill it to a depth of 2 or 3 inches and on that a layer of an equal quantity of powdered lime not slaked mix the weighed sample of ore in a mortar with 10 grams of finely powdered lime and transfer to the tube rinse out the mortar with a little more lime and add the rinsings cover with a layer of six or seven inches more lime and a loosely fitting plug of asbestos draw out the tube before the blowpipe to the shape shown in fig 47 avoiding the formation of a ridge or hollow at the bend which might collect the mercury tap gently holding the tube nearly horizontal so as to allow sufficient space above the mixture for the passage of the gases and vapours which are formed place the tube in a tube furnace and when in position place a small beaker of water so that it shall just close the opening of the tube the point of the tube should not more than touch the surface of the water bring the tube gradually to a red heat commencing by heating the lime just behind the asbestos plug and travelling slowly backwards when the portion of the tube containing the ore has been heated to redness for some time the heat is carried back to the end of the tube the magnesite readily gives up carbonic acid which fills the tube and sweeps the mercury vapour before it some of the mercury will have dropped into the beaker and some will remain as drops adhering to the upper part of the neck whilst the tube is still hot cut off the neck of the tube just in front of the asbestos plug a drop of water from the wash bottle will do this and wash the mercury from the neck into the beaker the mercury easily collects into a globule which must be transferred after decanting off the bulk of the water to a weighed berlin crucible the water is removed from the crucible first by the help of filter paper and then by exposing in a desiccator over sulphuric acid where it should be left until its weight remains constant it should not be warmed example5 grams of an ore treated in this way gave 4265 grams of mercury equivalent to 853 per cent pure cinnabar contains 862 per cent wet methods solutionsince solutions of chloride of mercury cannot be boiled without risk of loss48 nitric acid solutions should be used wherever possible no mercurycontaining minerals are insoluble in acids but cinnabar requires aqua regia for solution in dissolving this mineral nitric acid should be used with just as much hydrochloric acid as will suffice to take it up to separate the mercury pass sulphuretted hydrogen in considerable excess through the somewhat dilute solution the precipitate should be black although it comes down at first very light coloured it is filtered washed and transferred back to the beaker and then digested with warm ammonic sulphide the residue filtered washed and boiled with dilute nitric acid will in the absence of much lead be pure mercuric sulphide if much lead is present a portion may be precipitated as sulphate but can be removed by washing with ammonic acetate to get the mercury into solution cover with nitric acid and a few drops of hydrochloric and warm till solution is effected dilute with water to 50 or 100 cc gravimetric determination this may be made by electrolysis the same apparatus as is used for the electrolytic copper assay may be employed but instead of a cylinder of platinum one cut out of sheet copper should be taken or the platinum one may be coated with an evenly deposited layer of copper fix the spiral and weighed copper cylinder in position couple up the battery and when this has been done put the nitric acid solution of the mercury in its place49 the student had better refer to the description of the electrolytic copper assay the mercury comes down readily and the precipitation is complete in a few hours it is better to leave it overnight to make sure of complete reduction disconnect the apparatus and wash the cylinder first with cold water then with alcohol dry by placing in the water oven for two or three minutes cool and weigh the increase in weight gives the amount of metallic mercury it must be remembered that copper will precipitate mercury without the aid of the battery but in this case copper will go into solution with a consequent loss in the weight of the cylinder this must be avoided by connecting the battery before immersing the electrodes in the assay solution the electrolysed solution should be treated with an excess of ammonia when a blue coloration will indicate copper in which case the electrolysis is unsatisfactory with a little care this need not happen gold cylinders may preferably be used instead of copper but on platinum the deposit of mercury is grey and nonadherent so that it cannot be washed and weighed volumetric methods several methods have been devised for the details of these the student is referred to suttons handbook of volumetric analysis questions 1 the specific gravity of mercury is 13596 what volume would 8 grams occupy 2 if 3169 grams of cinnabar gave 2718 grams of mercury what would be the percentage of the metal in the ore 3 pour solution of mercuric chloride on mercury and explain what happens 4 on dissolving 03 gram of mercury in hot nitric acid and passing sulphuretted hydrogen in excess through the diluted solution what weight of precipitate will be got footnotes 9 lead may be granulated by heating it to a little above the melting point pouring it into a closed wooden box and rapidly agitating it as it solidifies 10 a rod of iron placed in the crucible with the assays will decompose any regulus that may be formed 11 with buttons poor in silver the lowering of the temperature at this stage is not a matter of importance 12 100 grams of the lead or of its oxide will contain from 15 to 25 milligrams 13 still the precautions of having cupels well made from bone ash in fine powder and of working the cupellation at as low a temperature as possible are very proper ones provided they are not carried to an absurd excess 14 be careful to remove the crucible before taking the bottle out of the basin of water if this is not done the chloride may be washed out of it 15 1 cc of this dilute acid will precipitate 8 or 9 milligrams of silver 16 chlorides interfere not merely by removing silver as insoluble silver chloride but also by making it difficult to get a good finishing point owing to the silver chloride removing the colour from the reddened solution 17 these results were obtained when using ammonium sulphocyanate and cannot be explained by the presence of such impurities as chlorides c 18 multiply the standard by 1000 and dilute 100 cc of the standard solution to the resulting number of cc thus with a solution of a standard 495 dilute 100 cc to 495 cc using of course distilled water 19 hna2aso4 3agno3 ag3aso4 hno3

nitric acid must be avoided chapter x copperleadthalliumbismuthantimony copper copper occurs native in large quantities especially in the lake superior district in this state it is generally pure more frequently it is found in combination the ores of copper may be classed as oxides and sulphides the most abundant oxidised ores are the carbonates malachite and chessylite the silicates as also the red and black oxides occur less abundantly all these yield their copper in solution on boiling with hydrochloric acid the sulphides are more abundant copper pyrites or yellow ore erubescite or purple ore and chalcocite or grey ore are the most important iron pyrites generally carries copper and is frequently associated with the abovementioned minerals these are all attacked by nitric acid they nearly all contain a small quantity of organic matter and frequently considerable quantities of lead zinc silver gold arsenic bismuth c the copper ores are often concentrated on the mine before being sent into the market either by smelting when the product is a regulus or matte or by a wet method of extraction yielding cement copper or precipitate a regulus is a sulphide of copper and iron carrying from 30 to 40 per cent of copper a precipitate which is generally in the form of powder consists mainly of metallic copper either regulus or precipitate may be readily dissolved in nitric acid copper forms two classes of salts cuprous and cupric the former are pale coloured and of little importance to the assayer they are easily and completely converted into cupric by oxidising agents cupric compounds are generally green or blue and are soluble in ammonia forming deep blue solutions dry assay that for copper next after those for gold and silver holds a more important position than any other dry assay the sale of copper ores has been regulated almost solely in the past by assays made on the cornish method it is not pretended that this method gives the actual content of copper but it gives the purchaser an idea of the quantity and quality of the metal that can be got by smelting the process is itself one of smelting on a small scale as might be expected however the assay produce and the smelting produce are not the same there being a smaller loss of copper in the smelting the method has worked very well but when applied to the purchase of low class ores from which the whole of the copper is extracted by wet methods it is unsatisfactory the following table which embodies the results of several years experience with copper assays shows the loss of copper on ores of varying produce the figures in the fourth column show how rapidly the proportion of copper lost increases as the percentage of copper in the ore falls below 30 per cent for material with more than 30 per cent the proportion lost is in inverse proportion to the copper present loss of copper copper present dry assay margin loss on 100 parts of copper per cent per cent per cent 100 98 20 20 95 9212

column headed margin opposite the corresponding percentage for example if the wet assay gives a produce of 1712 per cent there should be deducted 15 the dry assay would then be 1562 or since the fractions are always expressed in eighths 1558 with impure ores containing from 25 to 50 per cent of copper the differences may be perhaps 14 greater wet methods are gradually replacing the dry assay and it is probable that in the future they will supersede it for stocktaking and the various determinations required in smelting works and on mines they are generally adopted because they give the actual copper contents and since it is obvious that a knowledge of this is more valuable to the miner and smelter moreover the working of the dry method has been monopolised by a small ring of assayers with the double result of exciting outside jealousy and worse still of retarding the development and improvement of the process the principal stages of the dry assay are 1 the concentration of the copper in a regulus 2 the separation of the sulphur by calcining 3 the reduction of the copper by fusion and 4 the refining of the metal obtained the whole of these operations are not necessary with all copper material ores are worked through all the stages with mattes the preliminary fusion for regulus is omitted precipitates are simply fused for coarse copper and refined and blister or bar coppers are refined or if very pure subjected merely to washing the quantity of ore generally taken is 400 grains and is known as a full trial but for rich material containing more than 50 per cent of copper a half trial or 200 grains is used fusion for regulusthe ore either with or without a previous imperfect roasting to get rid of any excess of sulphur is mixed with borax glass lime and fluor spar and in some cases with nitre or iron pyrites according to the quality of the ore the mixture is placed in a large cornish crucible and heated as uniformly as possible in the wind furnace gradually raising the temperature so as to melt down the charge in from 15 to 20 minutes the crucible is removed and its contents poured into an iron mould when the slag is solid it is taken up with tweezers and quenched in water the regulus is easily detached from the slag it should be convex above and easily broken have a reddish brown colour and contain from 40 to 60 per cent of copper a regulus with more than this is too fine and with less too coarse a regulus which is too fine is round compact hard and of a dark bluish grey on the freshly broken surface a coarse regulus is flat and coarse grained and more nearly resembles sulphide of iron in fracture and colour if an assay yields a regulus too coarse a fresh determination is made with more nitre added or the roasting is carried further with low class ores a somewhat coarse regulus is an advantage if on the other hand the regulus is too fine less nitre or less roasting is the remedy with grey copper ores and the oxidised ores iron pyrites is added calcining the regulusit is powdered in an iron mortar and transferred to a small cornish crucible or if the roasting is to be done in the muffle to a roasting dish or scorifier the calcining is carried out at a dull red heat which is gradually increased the charge requires constant stirring at first to prevent clotting but towards the end it becomes sandy and requires less attention if the temperature during calcination has been too low sulphates are formed which are again reduced to sulphides in the subsequent fusion to prevent this the roasted regulus is recalcined at a higher temperature after being rubbed up with a little anthracite the roasted substance must not smell of burning sulphur when hot it is practically a mixture of the oxides of copper and iron fusion for coarse copperthe calcined regulus is mixed with a flux consisting of borax and carbonate of soda with more or less tartar according to its weight some assayers use both tartar and nitre the former of course being in excess the charge is returned to the crucible in which it was calcined and is melted down at a high temperature and as soon as tranquil poured when solid it is quenched and the button of metal separated the slag is black and glassy the small quantity of copper which it retains is recovered by a subsequent cleaning together with the slags from the next operation the button of coarse copper obtained must be free from a coating of regulus it will vary somewhat in appearance according to the nature and quantity of the impurities refining the coarse copperthe same crucible is put back in the furnace deep down and under the crevice between the two bricks when it has attained the temperature of the furnace the coarse copper is dropped into it and the furnace closed the copper will melt almost at once with a dull surface which after a time clears showing an eye some refining flux is then shot in from the scoop fig 48 and when the assay is again fluid it is poured when cold the button of metal is separated illustration fig 48 the button of fine copper is flat or pitted on its upper surface and is coated with a thin orange film it must have the appearance of good copper if it is covered with a red or purple film it is overdone or burnt if on the other hand it has a rough dull appearance it is not sufficiently refined assays that have been burnt are rejected those not sufficiently fine are treated as coarse copper and again put through the refining operation cleaning the slagsthese are roughly powdered and refused with tartar etc as in the fusion for coarse copper the button of metal got is separated if big enough refined and weighed the details of the process are slightly varied by different assayers the following will be good practice for the student determination of copper in copper pyritespowder dry and weigh up 20 grams of the ore mix with 20 grams each of powdered lime and fluor 15 grams each of powdered glass and borax and 5 or 10 grams of nitre transfer to a large cornish crucible and fuse under a loose cover at a high temperature for from 15 to 20 minutes when fluid and tranquil pour into a mould when the slag has solidified but whilst still hot quench by dipping two or three times in cold water avoid leaving it in the water so long that it does not dry after removal when cold separate the button or perhaps buttons of regulus by crumbling the slag between the fingers see that the slag is free from regulus it should be light coloured when cold and very fluid when hot reject the slag powder the regulus in a mortar and transfer to a small crucible calcine with occasional stirring until no odour of sulphurous oxide can be detected shake back into the mortar rub up with about 1 gram of powdered anthracite and recalcine for 10 minutes longer mix the calcined regulus with 10 grams of tartar 20 grams of soda and 3 grams of borax and replace in the crucible used for calcining fuse at a bright red heat for 10 or 15 minutes pour when tranquil as soon as solid quench in water separate the button of copper and save the slag to refine the copper a very hot fire is wanted and the fuel should not be too low down in the furnace place the crucible well down in the fire and in the middle of the furnace the same crucible is used or if a new one is taken it must be glazed with a little borax when the crucible is at a good red heat above the fusing point of copper drop the button of copper into it and close the furnace watch through the crevice and as soon as the button has melted and appears clear showing an eye shoot in 10 grams of refining flux close the furnace and in a few minutes pour then separate the button of copper add the slag to that from the coarse copper fusion and powder mix with 5 grams of tartar 05 gram of powdered charcoal and 2 grams of soda fuse in the same crucible and when tranquil pour quench and pick out the prills of metal if the copper thus got from the slags is coarse looking and large in amount it must be refined but if small in quantity it may be taken as fourfifths copper the combined results multiplied by five give the percentage of copper the refining flux is made by mixing 3 parts by measure of powdered nitre 212 of tartar and 1 of salt put in a large crucible and stir with a redhot iron until action has ceased this operation should be carried out in a wellventilated spot for pure ores in which the copper is present either as metal or oxide and free from sulphur arsenic c the concentration of the copper in a regulus may be omitted and the metal obtained in a pure state by a single fusion50 it is necessary to get a fluid neutral slag with the addition of as small an amount of flux as possible the fusion should be made at a high temperature so as not to occupy more than from 20 to 25 minutes thirty grams of ore is taken for a charge mixed with 20 grams of cream of tartar and 10 grams each of dried borax and soda if the gangue of the ore is basic carrying much oxide of iron or lime silica is added in quantity not exceeding 10 grams if on the other hand the gangue is mainly quartz oxide of iron up to 7 grams must be added exampletwenty grams of copper pyrites known to contain 276 per cent of copper gave by the method first described 522 grams of copper equalling 2618 per cent another sample of 20 grams of the same ore calcined fused with 40 grams of nitre and washed to ensure the removal of arsenic and sulphur and treated according to the second method gave a button weighing 527 grams equalling 2638 per cent the ore contained a considerable quantity of lead lead renders the assay more difficult since after calcination it remains as lead sulphate and in the fusion for coarse copper reappears as a regulus on the button the estimation of moisturethe cornish dry assayer very seldom makes a moisture determination he dries the samples by placing the papers containing them on the iron plate of the furnace it is well known that by buying the copper contents of pyrites by cornish assay burning off the sulphur and converting the copper into precipitate a large excess is obtained notes on the valuation of copper ores closely bound up with the practice of dry copper assaying is that of valuing a parcel of copper ore the methods by which the valuation is made have been described by mr westmoreland51 and are briefly as followsthe produce of the parcel is settled by two assayers one acting for the buyer the other for the seller with the help in case of nonagreement of a third or referee whose decision is final the dry assayers who do this are in most cases helped and sometimes perhaps controlled by wet assays made for one or both of the parties in the transaction in the case of ticketing the parcels are purchased by the smelters by tender and the value of any particular parcel is calculated from the average price paid as followsthe standard or absolute value of each ton of fine copper in the ore is the price the smelters have paid for it plus the returning charges or cost of smelting the quantity of ore in which it is contained the value of any particular parcel of ore is that of the quantity of fine copper it contains calculated on this standard minus the returning charges the ton consists of 21 cwts and it is assumed that the settled produce is the actual yield of the ore if at a ticketing in cornwall 985 tons of ore containing 633 tons of fine copper by dry assay brought 2591 12s the standard would be 83 15s this is calculated as followsthe returning charge is fixed at 55s per ton of ore this on 985 tons will amount to 2708 15s add this to the actual price paid and there is got 5300 as the value of the fine copper present the weight of copper in these 985 tons being 633 tons the standard is 5300633 or 83 15s nearly the value of a parcel of 150 tons of a 6 per cent ore on the same standard would be arrived at as followsthe 150 tons at 6 per cent would contain 9 tons 1506100 of fine copper this at 83 15s per ton would give 753 15s from this must be deducted the returning charges on 150 tons of ore at 55s per ton or 412 10s this leaves 341 5s as the value of the parcel at swansea the returning charge is less than in cornwall and varies with the quality of the ore this appears equitable since in smelting there are some costs which are dependent simply on the number of tons treated and others which increase with the richness the returning charge then is made up of two parts one fixed at so much 12s 2d per ton of ore treated and the other so much 3s 9d per unit of metal in the ore in this way the returning charge on a ton of ore of 834 produce would be 12s 2d8343s 9d or 2 5s if for example chili bars containing 96 per cent of copper bring 50 per ton the standard is 71 9s 4d it is got at in this way the returning charge on a 96 per cent ore is 12s 2d963s 9d or 18 12s 2d this added to 50 gives 68 12s 2d and this multiplied by 100 and divided by 96 100 tons of the bars will contain 96 tons of fine copper will give 71 9s 4d the price of 100 tons of pyrites containing 214 per cent of copper by dry assay would be got on this standard as followsthe parcel of ore would contain 214 tons of copper this multiplied by the standard gives 160 16s 0d from this must be deducted the returning charge which for 1 ton of ore of this produce would be 12s 2d 2143s 9d or 1 0s 7d and on the 100 tons is 102 18s 4d this would leave 57 17s 10d as the price of the parcel or 11s 7d per ton this would be on the standard returning charge of 45s for 834 per cent ore if a smaller returning charge was agreed on say 38s the difference in this case 7s would be added to the price per ton wet methods the solubility of the ores of copper in acid has already been described but certain furnace products such as slags are best opened up by fusion with fusion mixture and a little nitre the method of dissolving varies with the nature of the ore with 5 grams of pyrites a single evaporation with 20 cc of nitric acid will give a residue completely soluble in 30 cc of hydrochloric acid if the ore carries oxide of iron or similar bodies these are first dissolved up by boiling with 20 cc of hydrochloric acid and the residue attacked by an addition of 5 cc of nitric when silicates decomposable by acid are present the solution is evaporated to dryness to render the silica insoluble the residue extracted with 30 cc of hydrochloric acid and diluted with water to 150 cc it is advisable to have the copper in solution as chloride to separate the copper heat the solution nearly to boiling best in a pint flask and pass a rapid current of sulphuretted hydrogen for four or five minutes until the precipitate settles readily and the liquid smells of the gas when iron is present it will be reduced to the ferrous state before the copper sulphide begins to separate the copper appears as a brown coloration or black precipitate according to the quantity present filter through a coarse filter wash with hot water containing sulphuretted hydrogen if necessary wash the precipitate back into the flask boil with 10 cc of nitric acid add soda till alkaline and pass sulphuretted hydrogen again warm and filter wash and redissolve in nitric acid neutralise with ammonia add ammonic carbonate boil and filter the copper freed from impurities will be in the solution acidulate and reprecipitate with sulphuretted hydrogen when the nature of the impurities will allow it this process may be shortened to first filtering off the gangue then precipitating with sulphuretted hydrogen and washing the precipitate on the filter first with water and then with ammonium sulphide having separated the copper as sulphide its weight is determined as follows dry and transfer to a weighed porcelain crucible mix with a little pure sulphur and ignite at a red heat for 5 or 10 minutes in a current of hydrogen allow to cool while the hydrogen is still passing weigh the subsulphide of copper thus obtained contains 7985 per cent of copper it is a greyishblack crystalline mass which loses no weight on ignition if air is excluded copper may be separated from its solutions by means of sodium hyposulphite the solution is freed from hydrochloric and nitric acids by evaporation with sulphuric acid diluted to about a quarter of a litre heated nearly to boiling and treated with a hot solution of sodium hyposulphite added a little at a time until the precipitate settles and leaves the solution free from colour the solution contains suspended sulphur the precipitate is easily washed and under the proper conditions the separation is complete but the separation with sulphuretted hydrogen is more satisfactory since the conditions as to acidity c need not be so exact zinc or iron is sometimes used for separating copper from its solutions but they are not to be recommended electrolytic assay the separation of copper by means of a current of electricity is largely made use of and forms the basis of the most satisfactory method for the determination of this metal if the wire closing an electric circuit be broken and the two ends immersed in a beaker of acidulated water or solution of any salt the electricity will pass through the liquid bringing about some remarkable changes hydrogen and the metals will be liberated around that part of the wire connected with the zinc end of the battery and oxygen chlorine and the acid radicals will be set free around the other different metals are deposited in this way with varying degrees of ease and whether or not any particular metal will be deposited depends1 on the conditions of the solution as regards acid and other substances present and 2 on the intensity of the current of electricity used for analytical purposes the metal should be deposited not only free from the other metals present but also as a firm coherent film which may afterwards be manipulated without fear of loss this is in the case of copper and many other metals effected by a simple control of the conditions it is necessary that the electrodes or wires which bring the electricity into the solution should be made of a material to which the deposited metal will adhere and which will not be attacked by substances originally present or set free in the solution they are generally made of platinum there are various arrangements of apparatus used for this purpose but the following plan and method of working is simple and effective and has been in daily use with very satisfactory results for the last five or six years the battery used is made up of two daniell cells coupled up for intensity as shown in fig 49that is with the copper of one connected with the zinc of the other for eight or ten assays daily the quart size should be used but for four or five two pint cells will be sufficient illustration fig 49 the outer pot of each cell is made of sheet copper and must be clean and free from solder on the inside it is provided near the top with a perforated copper shelf in the shape of a ring into which the inner or porous cell loosely fits it is charged with a saturated solution of copper sulphate and crystals of this salt must be added and always kept in excess when the battery is at work copper is being deposited on the inner surface of this pot the inner or porous pot contains the zinc rod and is charged with a dilute acid made by diluting one volume of sulphuric acid up to ten with water the object of the porous pot is to prevent the mixing of the acid and copper sulphate solutions without interrupting the flow of electricity the copper sulphate solution will last for months but the acid must be emptied out and recharged daily the zinc rods must be well amalgamated by rubbing with mercury under dilute acid until they show a uniformly bright surface they should not produce a brisk effervescence when placed in the acid in the porous pot before coupling up the battery when working is apt to become dirty from the creeping of the copper and zinc sulphate solution it must be kept away from the working bench and is best kept in a box on the floor illustration fig 50 the connection of the battery with and the fixing of the electrodes may be made by any suitable arrangement but the following is a very convenient plan the wire from the zinc is connected by means of a binding screw with a piece of stout copper wire which at a distance sufficiently great to allow of easy coupling with the battery is led along the back of a piece of hard wood this is fixed horizontally about one foot above the working bench the general arrangement is shown in fig 50 in which however for the sake of economy of space the battery is placed on the working bench instead of on the floor the piece of wood is one inch square and three or four feet long it is perforated from front to back at distances of six inches by a number of small holes in which are inserted screws like that shown in fig 51 these are known as terminals and may be obtained of any electrician the head of each screw is soldered to the wire mentioned above as running along the back and as being connected with the zinc end of the battery these terminals serve to fix the electrodes on which the copper is to be deposited the wire from the copper end of the battery is similarly connected by a connecting screw fig 52 with another wire h in fig 53 which runs along the top of the rod and has soldered to it at distances of six inches cylindrical spirals of copper wire these should project from the rod at points about halfway between the terminals already described they may be made by wrapping copper wire around a blacklead pencil for a length of about three inches illustration fig 51 illustration fig 52 illustration fig 53 the rod is perforated from top to bottom with a series of small holes one in advance of each terminal but as near it as possible into these short pieces of glass tube are inserted to ensure insulation these receive the other electrodes which are connected with the wire leading to the copper end of the battery through the spirals with the help of a binding screw the figure will make this clear fig 53 illustration fig 54 the electrodes consist of a platinum spiral and cylinder the spiral should have the shape shown in a fig 54 when in work it is passed through one of the holes fitted with glass tubes and connected with the copper end of the battery the thickness of the wire of which it is made is unimportant provided it is stout enough to keep its form and does not easily bend the spiral will weigh about 8 grams the cylinder c fig 54 will weigh about 12 grams it should have the shape shown in the figure in working it is clamped to one of the terminals and on it the copper is deposited a cylinder will serve for the deposition of from 1 to 15 gram of copper it is made by rivetting a square piece of foil on to a stiff piece of wire and then bending into shape over a glass tube or piece of rounded wood each cylinder carries a distinctive number and is marked by impressing roman numerals on the foil with the blade of a knife the weight of each is carefully taken and recorded they lose slightly in weight when in use but the loss is uniform and averages half a milligram per month when in daily use the cylinders are cleaned from deposited copper by dissolving off with nitric acid and washing with water and from grease by igniting the beakers to contain the solution of copper to be electrolysed are ordinary tall beakers of about 200 cc capacity and are marked off at 100 cc and 150 cc they are supported on movable stands consisting of wooden blocks about six inches high and three inches across the bar of wood which carries the connecting wires and electrodes is permanently fixed over the working bench at such a height that with the beakers resting on these blocks the electrodes shall be in position for working to fix the electrodes to the rod remove the stand and beaker and pass the long limb of the spiral up through one of the glass tubes connect it with the free end of the copper spiral by means of a connecting screw fig 52 and then draw out and bend the copper spiral so that the platinum one may hang freely screw the wire of the cylinder to the terminal and if necessary bend it so that the cylinder itself may be brought to encircle the rod of the spiral in the manner shown in fig 53 the general method of working is as followsthe quantity of ore to be taken for an assay varies with the richness of the ore as is shown in the following table percentage of copper quantity of ore in the ore to be taken 1 to 5 5 grams 5 to 10 3 10 to 30 2 30 to 50 15 50 to 100 1 the weighed quantity of ore is dissolved by evaporating with nitric acid and taking up with hydrochloric as already described any coloured residue which may be left is generally organic matter it is filtered off calcined and any copper it contains is estimated colorimetrically nearly always however the residue is white and sandy the copper is separated from the solution as sulphide by means of a rapid current of sulphuretted hydrogen the liquid is decanted off through a filter the precipitate washed once with hot water and then rinsed back into the flask the filter paper being opened out with a jet of water from a wash bottle fifteen cc of nitric acid are added to the contents of the flask which are then briskly boiled until the bulk is reduced to less than 10 cc the boiling down is carried out in a cupboard free from cold draughts so as to prevent the condensation of acid and steam in the neck of the flask twenty cc of water are next added and the solution is warmed and filtered into one of the beakers for electrolysis the filtrate and washings are diluted with water to the 100 cc mark and the solution is then ready for the battery it must not contain more than 10 per cent by volume of nitric acid the number and weight of the platinum cylinder having been recorded both electrodes are fixed in position and the wooden block removed from under them the beaker containing the copper solution is then brought up into its place with one hand and the block replaced with the other so as to support it all the assays having been got into position the connecting wires are joined to the battery if everything is right bubbles of oxygen at once stream off from the spiral and the cylinder becomes tarnished by a deposit of copper if the oxygen comes off but no copper is deposited it is because the assay solution contains too much nitric acid if no action whatever takes place it is because the current is not passing in this case examine the connections to see that they are clean and secure and the connecting wires to see that they are not touching each other the action is allowed to go on for sixteen or seventeen hours so that it is best to let the current act overnight in the morning the solutions will appear colourless and a slow stream of oxygen will still be coming off from the spiral a washbottle with cold distilled water and two beakers one with distilled water and the other with alcohol are got ready the block is then removed the spiral loosened and lowered with the beaker the cylinder is next detached and washed with a stream of water from the washbottle the washings being added to the original solution the current from the battery is not stopped until all the cylinders are washed after being dipped in the beaker of water and once or twice in that with the alcohol it is dried in the wateroven for about three minutes and then weighed the increase in weight is due to deposited copper this should be salmonred in colour satinlike or crystalline in appearance and in an even coherent deposit not removed by rubbing it is permanent in air when dry but sulphuretted hydrogen quickly tarnishes it producing coloured films with ores containing even very small proportions of bismuth the deposited copper has a dark grey colour and when much of this metal is present the copper is coated with a grey shaggy deposit it still remains to determine any copper left undeposited in the solution this does not generally exceed four or five milligrams and is estimated colorimetrically thirty cc of dilute ammonia one of strong ammonia mixed with one of water are added to the electrolysed solution which is then diluted up to the 150 cc mark with water it is mixed using the spiral as stirrer and after standing a few minutes to allow the precipitate to settle 100 cc of it are filtered off through a dry filter for the colorimetric determination since only twothirds of the solution are taken for this the quantity of copper found must be increased by onehalf to get the quantity actually present illustration fig 55 the colorimetric determination may be made in the manner described under that head but where a number of assays are being carried out it is more convenient to have a series of standard phials containing known amounts of copper in ammoniacal solution by comparing the measured volume of the assay solution with these the amount of copper present is determined at a glance these standard bottles however can only be economically used where a large number of assays are being made daily a convenient plan is to get a quantity of white glass fourounce phials like that in fig 55 and to label them so that they shall contain 100 cc when filled up to the bottom of the labels the labels should be rendered permanent by coating with wax and be marked with numbers indicating the milligrams of copper present the bottles are stopped with new clean corks and contain in addition to the specified quantity of copper 6 cc of nitric acid and 10 cc of strong ammonia with sufficient water to make up the bulk to 100 cc the copper is best added by running in the requisite amount of a standard solution of copper each cc of which contains 0001 gram of the metal the standard bottles should be refilled once every three or four months since their colorimetric value becomes slowly less on keeping the following determinations of a set which had been in use for three months will illustrate this the figures indicate milligrams of copper in 100 cc the first row gives the nominal and the second row the actual colorimetric value of the standards the difference between the two shows the deterioration 1 2 3 4 6 8 10 12 14 1 2 3 37 55 75 9 11 13 the amount of copper in the assay is got by increasing that found colorimetrically by onehalf and adding to that found on the platinum cylinder the percentage is calculated in the usual way the following examples will illustrate this as well as the method of recording the work in the laboratory book cylinder i cu 95410

electrolytic assay of metals alloys precipitates and other bodies rich in copper the preliminary separation of the copper by sulphuretted hydrogen is unnecessary it is sufficient to dissolve the weighed sample in 10 cc of nitric acid boil off nitrous fumes dilute to 100 cc with water and then electrolyse general considerationsin the preliminary work with the copper sulphide there is a small loss owing to its imperfect removal in washing the filter paper and another small loss in dissolving in nitric acid owing to the retention of particles in the fused globules of sulphur to determine its amount the filterpapers and sulphur were collected from forty assays and the copper in them determined the average amount of copper in each assay was 0175 gram that left on the filter paper was 000067 gram and that retained by the sulphur 000003 gram thus showing an average loss from both sources of 000070 gram the determinations from another lot of fortytwo similar assays gave on an average copper left on filter paper 000070 gram copper retained by sulphur 000004 the loss from these sources is trifling and need only be considered when great accuracy is required the deposition of the copper under the conditions given is satisfactory but as already stated if the solution contain more than 10 per cent of nitric acid it is not thrown down at all or if a stronger current is used say that from three bunsen cells it will be precipitated in an arborescent brittle form ill adapted for weighing it may be noted here that increasing the size of the cells does not necessarily increase the intensity of the current in two determinations on pure electrotype copper the following results were obtained copper taken copper found 08988 gram 08985 gram 08305 08303 the presence of salts of ammonia c somewhat retards the deposition but has no other ill effect the organic matter generally present in copper ores interferes more especially in the colorimetric determination of the residual copper it can be detected on dissolving the ore as a light black residue insoluble in nitric acid it is filtered off at once or if only present in small amount it is carried on in the ordinary process of the assay and separated in the last filtration before electrolysis the following experiments were made to test the effect of the presence of salts of foreign metals in the solution during the precipitation of copper by electrolysis copper taken other metal added copper found 01000 gram 01000 gram of silver 01800 01050 01000 02000 01030 01000 mercury 02010 01037 01000 02015 01020 01000 lead

be seen from these that mercury silver and bismuth are the only metals which are precipitable52 along with the copper under the conditions of the assay mercury which if present would interfere is separated because of the insolubility of its sulphide in nitric acid bismuth is precipitated only after the main portion of the copper is thrown down it renders the copper obviously unsuitable for weighing it darkens or forms a greyish coating on the copper and this darkening is a delicate test for bismuth in assaying ores containing about three and a half per cent of copper and known to contain bismuth in quantities scarcely detectable in ordinary analysis the metal deposited was distinctly greyish in colour and would not be mistaken for pure copper ten grams of this impure copper were collected and analysed with the following results copper 9946 per cent bismuth 0030 iron 0014 arsenic 0010 10000 the quantity of copper got in each assay was 0175 gram and consequently the bismuth averaged 000053 gram to separate the bismuth in such a case the deposit is dissolved off by warming it in the original solution the bismuth is precipitated by the addition of ammonic carbonate and the solution after filtering and acidifying with nitric acid is reelectrolysed determination of copper in commercial coppertake from 1 to 15 gram weigh carefully and transfer to a beaker add 20 cc of water and 10 cc of nitric acid cover with a clock glass and allow to dissolve with moderate action boil off nitrous fumes dilute to 100 cc and electrolyse the cylinder must be carefully weighed and the electrolysis allowed to proceed for 24 hours the weight found will be that of the copper and silver the silver in it must be determined53 and deducted determination of copper in brass german silver or bronzetreat in the same manner as commercial copper if nickel is present the few milligrams of copper remaining in the electrolysed solution should be separated with sulphuretted hydrogen the precipitated sulphide dissolved in nitric acid and determined colorimetrically volumetric processes there are two of these in use one based on the decolorising effect of potassic cyanide upon an ammoniacal copper solution and the other upon the measurement of the quantity of iodine liberated from potassic iodide by the copper salt the cyanide process is the more generally used and when carefully worked on certain understood and orthodox conditions yields good results but probably there is no method of assaying where a slight deviation from these conditions so surely leads to error an operator has no difficulty in getting concordant results with duplicate assays yet different assayers working without bias on the same material get results uniformly higher or lower a difference evidently due to variations in the mode of working where a large number of results are wanted quickly it is a very convenient method the iodide process is very satisfactory when worked under the proper conditions cyanide method the process is based upon the facts1 that when ammonia is added in excess to a solution containing cupric salts ammoniacal copper compounds are formed which give to the solution a deep blue colour and 2 that when potassic cyanide is added in sufficient quantity to such a solution the colour is removed double cyanides of copper and potassium or ammonium being formed54 in the explanation generally given the formation of cuprous cyanide is supposed55 but in practice it is found that one part of copper requires rather more than four parts of cyanide which agrees with the former rather than the latter explanation reliance on the accuracy of the process cannot rest upon the supposition that the cyanide required for decoloration is proportional to the copper present for varying quantities of ammonia salts ammonia and water and differences of temperature have an important effect the results are concordant and exact only when the cyanide is standardised under the same conditions as it is used it is best to have the assay solution and that used for standardising as nearly as possible alike and to titrate the two solutions side by side this demands an approximate knowledge of the quantity of copper contained in the ore and a separation of the bulk of the impurities for the titration there is required a standard solution of potassium cyanide made by dissolving 42 grams of the salt known to dealers as potassium cyanide gold in water and diluting to one litre 100 cc of this will be about equivalent to one gram of copper for poor ores the solution may conveniently be made half this strength the solution of the ore and the separation of the copper as sulphide are effected in the same ways as have been already described for electrolysis similarly too the sulphide is attacked with 15 cc of nitric acid and the assay boiled down to 10 cc add 20 cc of water and warm filter into a pint flask wash well with water and dilute to about 150 cc add 30 cc of dilute ammonia and cool prepare a standard by dissolving a quantity of electrotype copper judged to be about the same as that contained in the assay in 20 cc of water and 10 cc of nitric acid boil off the nitrous fumes and dilute to 150 cc add 30 cc of dilute ammonia and cool fill a burette with the standard cyanide solution the burette with syphon arrangement figured on page 52 is used a number of titrations can be carried on at the same time provided the quantity of copper present in each is about the same this is regulated in weighing up the ore the flasks must of course be marked and should be arranged in series on a bench in front of a good light and at such a height that the liquid can be looked through without stooping supposing about 50 cc of cyanide will be required 30 cc should be run into each and each addition be recorded as soon as made then run 15 cc into each the solutions will now probably show marked differences of tint add 1 cc of cyanide to the lighter ones and more to the darker so as to bring the colours to about the same depth of tint they should all be of nearly equal tint just before finishing at the end add half a cc at a time until the colours are completely discharged a piece of damp filter paper held between the light and the flask assists in judging the colour when nearly finished overdone assays show a straw yellow colour which deepens on standing the following will illustrate the notes recorded of five such assays and one standard 1 30 cc 15 cc 5 cc 2 cc 1 cc 12 cc cc 5312 cc 2 30 15 1 1 1 12 4812 3 30 15 3 1 1

a cc means about 015 per cent on the ore with a little practice it is easy to estimate whether the whole or half of the last addition should be counted to get satisfactory results the manner of finishing once adopted must be adhered to the following experiments show the effect of variation in the conditions of the assayuse a solution of copper nitrate made by dissolving 10 grams of copper in 50 cc of water and 35 cc of nitric acid and diluting to a litre 100 cc 1 gram of copper effect of varying temperaturein these experiments 20 cc of copper nitrate were used with 10 cc of nitric acid 30 cc of dilute ammonia and water to 200 cc the results were temperature 15 30 70 100 cyanide required 215 cc 208 cc 197 cc 188 cc the temperature is that of the solution before titrating these show the importance of always cooling before titrating and of titrating the assay and standard at the same temperature effect of varying bulkthe quantities of copper acid and ammonia were the same as in the lastmentioned experiments the results were bulk 1000 cc 2000 cc 3000 cc 4000 cc cyanide required 233 217 214 214 these show that large variations in bulk must be avoided effect of varying ammoniathe quantities of copper and acid were the same as in the series of experiments last noticed the bulk was 200 cc the results were dilute ammonia 200 cc 300 cc 500 cc 1000 cc cyanide required 209 217 223 246 effect of varying acidthe quantities of copper and water were the same as in the lastnoticed set of experiments 30 cc of dilute ammonia were used nitric acid 50 cc 100 cc 150 cc cyanide required 216 217 215 on adding nitric acid to the solution it combines with a portion of the ammonia to form ammonic nitrate it will be seen from the last series of experiments that the lessening of the amount of free ammonia will decrease the quantity of cyanide required but on the other hand the ammonic nitrate which is at the same time formed will increase the amount required under the conditions of the assay these two effects neutralise each other and such differences in the quantity of acid as are likely to occur are unimportant effect of varying ammonic saltsthe quantities of copper water and ammonia were the same as in the last mentioned set of experiments but no nitric acid was used ammonic nitrate added 1 gram 5 grams 10 grams 20 grams cyanide required 212 cc 221 cc 231 cc 241 cc these show that combined ammonia seriously affects the titration and that the principle sometimes recommended of neutralising the acid with ammonia and then adding a constant quantity of ammonia is not a good one because there is then an interference both by the ammonia and by the variable quantity of ammonic salts the same quantity of combined ammonia has the same effect whether it is present as sulphate nitrate chloride or acetate as the following experiments show four lots of 20 cc of copper nitrate were taken and 20 cc of dilute ammonia added to each these were carefully neutralised with the respective acids rendered alkaline with 30 cc more of ammonia cooled diluted to bulk and titrated the results were with sulphuric acid 225 cc of cyanide nitric acid 226 hydrochloric acid 226 acetic acid 225 effect of foreign saltssulphates nitrates and chlorides of sodium or potassium have no action whilst the hydrates carbonates bicarbonates sulphites and nitrites have an important effect the interference of ammonic salts has already been shown salts of silver zinc and nickel react with cyanide just as copper does and consequently interfere ferrous salts are sure to be absent and ferric salts yield ferric hydrate with the ammonia which is not acted on by the cyanide but owing to its bulkiness it settles slowly this lengthens the time required for titration and so modifies the manner of working an assay should not be worked with ferric hydrate present unless the standard contains about the same amount of it on mines it is often inconvenient to separate the copper by means of sulphuretted hydrogen hence it is customary to titrate without previous separation in this case instead of standardising the cyanide with electrotype copper a standard ore should be used this should be an ore of the same kind as those being assayed in which the copper has been carefully determined effect of varying copperin these experiments 10 cc of nitric acid 30 cc of ammonia and water to 200 cc were used copper nitrate present 10 cc 100 cc 200 cc 500 cc 1000 cc cyanide required 07 112 217 545 1081 these results show that under the conditions laid down the various causes of disturbance nearly neutralise one another and the results within a fair range are practically proportional determination of copper in copper pyritesweigh up 2 grams of the dried and powdered ore and place in an evaporating dish about four inches in diameter cover with 20 cc of nitric acid and put on a hot plate evaporate to dryness without further handling allow to cool and take up with 30 cc of hydrochloric acid boil dilute and transfer to a pint flask filtering if necessary make up the bulk with the washings to about 150 cc precipitate with sulphuretted hydrogen filter and wash back the precipitate into the flask add 15 cc of nitric acid and boil down rapidly to 10 cc dilute add 30 cc of dilute ammonia make up to 150 cc and cool for the standard weigh up 05 gram of copper more or less according to the quantity judged to be present in the assay dissolve in 20 cc of dilute nitric acid boil off nitrous fumes add 30 cc of dilute ammonia make up to the same bulk as that of the assay and cool titrate the two solutions side by side and as nearly as possible in the same manner since the assay solution is often turbid from the presence of small quantities of lead and of iron from incomplete washing and since this slight precipitate is very slow in settling the standard can hardly be compared strictly with the assay this can be counteracted by precipitating in both solutions a mixture of ferric and aluminic hydrates which settles readily and leaves the supernatant liquor clear to effect this boil the nitric acid solutions with 30 cc of a solution containing 15 grams each of alum and ferrous sulphate to the litre in an actual determination 2 grams of the ore were taken and compared with 05 gram of copper the assay required 577 cc of cyanide and the standard 525 cc 525 05 577 05495 this on 2 grams of ore 2747 per cent the same sample by electrolysis gave 2760 per cent of copper determination without previous separationdissolve up 2 grams as before but instead of passing sulphuretted hydrogen add 30 cc of dilute ammonia shake well and cool prepare a standard by dissolving 05 gram of copper in 1 cc of nitric acid add 06 gram of iron in the form of ferric chloride and 20 cc of hydrochloric acid dilute to about 150 cc add 30 cc of dilute ammonia and cool titrate the two solutions side by side in a determination on the sample last used 58 cc were required for the assay and 53 cc for the standard which indicates 273 per cent of copper this method of working is somewhat rough iodide method this is based upon the fact that when potassic iodide in excess is added to a strong solution of a cupric salt in a faintly acid solution cuprous iodide is formed and an equivalent of iodine liberated56 the iodine is measured by titrating with a solution of sodium hyposulphite57 using starch paste as indicator the iodine is soluble in the excess of potassium iodide forming a deep brown solution the hyposulphite is added until this brown colour is almost removed starch paste is then added and strikes with the remaining iodine a dirty blue colour the addition of the hypo is continued until the blue colour is discharged the end reaction is sharp a drop is sufficient to complete it as regards the titration the process leaves little to be desired the quantity of hypo required is strictly proportional to the copper present and ordinary variations in the conditions of working are without effect the presence of salts of bismuth masks the end reaction because of the strong colour imparted to the solution by the iodide of bismuth under certain conditions there is a return of the blue colour in the assay solution after the finishing point has apparently been reached which is a heavy tax on the patience and confidence of the operator this is specially apt to occur when sodium acetate is present although it may also be due to excessive dilution the standard hypo solution is made by dissolving 3918 grams of the crystallised salt na2s2o35h2o in water and diluting to one litre one hundred cc will equal one gram of copper the starch solution is made by mixing 1 gram of starch into a thin paste with cold water pouring it into 200 cc of boiling water and continuing the boiling for a minute or so the solution must be cold before use and about 2 cc is used for each assay it should not be added until the bulk of the iodine has been reduced to standardise the hypo weigh up 03 or 04 gram of pure copper dissolve in 5 cc of dilute nitric acid boil off nitrous fumes and dilute with an equal bulk of cold water add soda solution until a permanent precipitate is obtained and then 1 cc of acetic acid this should yield a clear solution fill an ordinary burette with the hypo add 3 grams of potassium iodide crystals to the copper solution and when these are dissolved dilute to 100 cc with water run in the hypo solution rather quickly until the brown colour is nearly dischargedie to within 3 or 4 cc of the finish add 2 cc of the starch solution and continue the addition of the hypo a few drops at a time until the tint suddenly changes to a cream colour the blue colour must not return on standing three or four minutes calculate the standard in the usual way in assaying ores the copper is dissolved and separated with sulphuretted hydrogen as in the other processes but the sulphide should be washed more completely to ensure the absence of iron salts the following experiments show the effect of variation in the conditions of the assay use a solution of copper sulphate containing 3938 grams of copper sulphate crystals cuso45h2o in the litre 100 cc equal 100 gram of copper effect of varying temperaturethe assay after the addition of the potassic iodide must be kept cold else iodine may be volatilised effect of varying potassium iodidein various descriptions of the process the amount of iodide required is variously stated at from a few crystals to as much as 10 grams the proportion required by theory for 1 gram of copper is a little over 5 grams an excess however is required to keep the liberated iodine in solution on economic grounds this excess should not be extravagant if the student uses 10 parts of the iodide for each part of copper in the assay he will have sufficient in the experiments there were used 20 cc of the copper sulphate with varying amounts of potassic iodide and the following results were got potassic iodide added 15 gram 3 grams 5 grams hypo required 200 cc 200 cc 200 cc in these the iodide was added direct to the solution containing the copper which was afterwards diluted to 100 cc and titrated in another series the iodide was added after the dilution to 100 cc and the results were potassic iodide added 15 gram 3 grams 5 grams 10 grams hypo required 200 cc 201

hypo required 200 200 200 199 in the last of these experiments the colour was discharged at 18 cc but gradually returned until 199 cc had been run in it will be seen that considerable variation in bulk does not interfere effect of acetic acidthese experiments were like the last series mentioned but the bulk was 100 cc and varying amounts of acetic acid were added acetic acid added 0 cc 10 cc 50

without acetic acid and with varying amounts of sodium acetate sodium acetate added 0 gram 1 gram 2 grams 5 grams 10 grams hypo required 200 cc 200 cc 202 cc 193 cc 182 cc in the 5 grams experiment when the finishing point had been apparently reached the colour slowly returned but as the results generally on titrating were not satisfactory a repetition of the experiment was made with the addition of 5 cc of acetic acid which gave an equally bad result effect of foreign saltsthe conditions of these experiments were the same as before the salts were added and dissolved before the addition of the potassium iodide using 5 grams or in the case of the acids 5 cc the results were as follows dilute acetic salt added h2so4 acid naac nacl hypo required 200 cc 200 cc 201 cc 193 cc 201 cc salt added kno3 na2so4 amcl am2so4 hypo required 202 cc 187 cc 200 cc 199 cc the low result with the sulphate of soda was evidently due to the formation of a sparingly soluble double salt which removed copper from the solution on adding a little acetic acid the full amount of hypo was required the effect of the presence of certain metals is important the method of determining it was to add the substance to the solution containing the copper and partly precipitate with soda solution then treating with 1 cc of acetic acid adding the iodide and proceeding as before substance added hypo required 20 cc 0050 gram arsenic as as2o5 200 0050 antimony as sbcl5 198 0050 lead as pbno32 201 a similar experiment with 0050 gram of bismuth nitrate could not be determined the endreaction being masked bismuth iodide is soluble in potassic iodide forming a brown solution the colour of which is very similar to that produced by iodine and although it does not strike a blue colour with starch hypo has an action on it a similar experiment with 0050 gram of iron as ferric chloride required 223 cc of hypo and the colour returned on standing this shows that ferric acetate liberates iodine under the conditions of the assay trying to counteract this by adding to a similar solution 05 gram of phosphate of soda dissolved in a little water 197 cc of hypo were required instead of 200 but the assay showed signs of returning colour in standardising the same result was obtained whether the copper was present as nitrate or sulphate before neutralising effect of varying copperwith the same conditions as before but with varying amounts of copper and a proportionally increasing quantity of iodide the results were copper present 10 cc 100 cc 200 cc 500 cc 1000 cc hypo required 10 100 200

the following is an example 05 gram of copper required 505 cc hypo the assay required 556 which is equal to 275 per cent of copper colorimetric process this is based on the blue coloration of ammoniacal copper solutions the quantity of copper in 100 cc of the assay solution should not be more than 15 milligrams or less than half a milligram it is not so delicate as most other colorimetric methods but nevertheless is a very useful one the manner of working is the same as that described under iron standard copper solutionweigh up 05 gram of electrotype copper dissolve in 10 cc of nitric acid boil off nitrous fumes and dilute to 1 litre 1 cc 05 milligram in nearly all cases it will be necessary to separate the copper with sulphuretted hydrogen from a solution of about 5 grams of the material to be assayed the filter paper containing the sulphide and probably much sulphur is dried and burnt the ashes are dissolved in 5 cc of dilute nitric acid 10 cc of dilute ammonia added and the solution filtered through a coarse filter into a nessler tube washing the paper with a little dilute ammonia the estimation of the colour and calculation of the result are made in the way described on page 44 the effect of varying conditions on the assay may be seen from the following experiments effect of varying temperaturethe effect of increased temperature is to slightly decrease the colour but this can only be observed when a fair quantity of copper is present 10 cc at 15 showed the colour of 10 cc at 70 25 27 50 50 100 90 effect of varying ammoniathe solution must of course contain free ammonia about 5 cc of dilute ammonia in 50 cc bulk is the quantity to be used in the experiments a larger quantity affects the results giving lower readings and altering the tint with small quantities

test a sample of 3 grams of an ore treated in this way required 52 cc of standard copper to produce equality of tint this gives 035 per cent determination of copper in tinweigh up 1 gram of the sample transfer to an evaporating dish and cover with 30 cc of aqua regia warm until the metal has dissolved then evaporate almost to dryness take up with a few cc of hydrochloric acid and again evaporate dissolve the residue in 10 cc of dilute hydrochloric acid and transfer to a 100 cc flask add 10 cc of dilute ammonia and make up with water to the containing mark filter off 50 cc of the solution into a nessler glass and determine the copper in it colorimetrically examination of commercial copper very pure copper can be obtained in commerce owing to the demand for metal of high conductivity for electrical purposes which practically means for metal free from impurities much of the metal sold contains as much as one per cent of foreign substances of which arsenic is the most important the other elements to be looked for are bismuth lead antimony silver gold iron nickel cobalt sulphur and oxygen in blister copper which is the unrefined metal aluminium silicon and phosphorus may be met with oxygenall commercial copper carries oxygen most of it is present as cuprous oxide which is dissolved by molten copper the estimation of oxygen is often made by difference the copper and the other impurities being determined the rest is assumed to be oxygen probably this is nearly correct but the whole of the oxygen should not be ascribed to cuprous oxide for any arsenic the metal contained would be present as cuprous arsenite since arsenide of copper and cuprous oxide could not exist together at the temperature of fusion without interacting in the report of the analysis it is best to state the proportion of oxygen thus oxygen per cent by difference there is a method of determination by fusing 5 or 10 grams in a brasqued crucible and counting the loss as oxygen and another method for the determination of cuprous oxide based on the reaction of this substance with nitrate of silver59 about 2 grams of silver nitrate dissolved in 100 cc of water is allowed to act upon 1 gram of the copper in the cold the precipitate is filtered off washed thoroughly with water and the basic salt dissolved and determined colorimetrically one part of copper found represents 168 part of cuprous oxide or 019 part of oxygen copper generally carries from 01 to 02 per cent of oxygen silver is found in most samples but occurs in variable proportions when it amounts to 30 ounces per ton it has a commercial value to determine its amount dissolve 10 grams of the copper in 35 cc of nitric acid and 50 cc of water boil off nitrous fumes and dilute to about 100 cc one or two cc of dilute hydrochloric acid one to 100 of water are added stirred in and the precipitate allowed to settle for twentyfour hours filter through a double swedish paper dry burn and cupel the ashes with one gram of sheet lead ten grams of a sample of copper gave in this way 47 milligrams of silver ten grams of the same copper to which 24 milligrams of silver had been added gave 282 milligrams goldto determine it dissolve 10 20 or 50 grams of the sample in 35 70 or 175 cc of nitric acid and an equal volume of water boil till free from nitrous fumes and dilute to double its volume allow to stand for some time decant on to a filter dry burn and cupel the ashes with 1 gram of sheet lead if silver is present owing to traces of chlorides in the reagents used parting will be necessary see gold working in this way on 20 grams of copper to which 18 milligram of gold had been added a button weighing 20 milligrams was obtained antimony is not a frequent impurity of copper it can be detected in quantities over 01 per cent by a white residue of sb2o4 insoluble in nitric acid with material containing only small quantities of antimony the white oxide does not show itself for some time but on longcontinued boiling it separates as a fine powder it is best when looking for it to evaporate the nitric acid solution to the crystallising point to add a little fresh nitric acid and water and then to filter off the precipitate after weighing it should be examined for arsenic and bismuth leadrefined coppers are often free from lead anything more than traces being seldom found in coarse coppers it is sometimes present in considerable quantities its presence may be detected in the estimation of the copper electrolytically the platinum spiral becoming coated with a brown or black deposit of lead dioxide the depth of colour varies with the lead present and obviously could be made the basis of an approximate estimation the colour shows itself within an hour or so but is best observed when all the copper has been deposited electrolysing a solution of one gram of pure copper to which 05 milligram of lead had been added the deposit was dark brown in a similar solution with 1 milligram of lead it was much darker and with 2 milligrams it was black under the conditions of the assay the dioxide cannot be weighed as it partly dissolves on breaking the current when lead has been found its quantity may be estimated by evaporating to dryness the nitric acid solution to which an excess of sulphuric acid has been added taking up with water and filtering off and weighing the lead sulphate the separation of traces of lead as chromate is a fairly good one dissolve 5 grams of the copper in 17 cc of nitric acid and an equal volume of water boil off nitrous fumes neutralise with soda and afterwards acidulate with acetic acid and dilute to a litre add 20 grams of sodium acetate warm and precipitate the lead with a dilute solution of potassium chromate copper chromate yellow may be at the same time thrown down but it is readily soluble on diluting filter off the precipitate wash it into a beaker and pass sulphuretted hydrogen oxidise the sulphide and weigh as lead sulphate treated in this way 5 grams of copper yielded sulphate of lead equal to 20 milligrams of lead five grams of the same sample to which 10 milligrams of lead were added gave 114 milligrams nickel and cobaltnickel is always present in larger or smaller quantities in commercial copper and perhaps has an influence on the properties of the metal it is determined as followsdissolve 10 grams of the copper in 35 cc of nitric acid and an equal bulk of water boil off nitrous fumes and neutralise with soda add 2 grams of carbonate of soda dissolved in water boil and filter acidify the filtrate with 2 or 3 cc of dilute nitric acid and dilute to 1 or 112 litres pass sulphuretted hydrogen through the cold solution till the copper is all down and the liquid smells of the gas filter and evaporate the filtrate to a small bulk and determine the nickel by electrolysing the solution rendered ammoniacal or by precipitating as sulphide and weighing as sulphate see under nickel the precipitate after weighing should be tested for cobalt if present it is separated with potassium nitrite as described under cobalt ten grams of copper gave 60 milligrams of nickel and another lot of 10 grams of the same copper to which 100 milligrams of nickel had been added gave 172 milligrams sulphurthe amount of sulphur in refined copper is very small seldom exceeding 0005 per cent in coarse copper as might be expected it is found in larger quantities in determining it it is first converted into sulphuric acid and then precipitated and weighed as barium sulphate the precipitation cannot be effected from a nitric acid solution ten grams of copper are dissolved in nitric acid as for the other determinations and then boiled with excess of hydrochloric acid till the nitric acid is completely removed there is then added a few drops of a dilute solution of baric chloride and the solution is allowed to stand for some hours the baric sulphate is filtered off and weighed the necessity for precipitating from a hydrochloric acid solution is seen from the following determinations in each experiment 10 grams of copper was used and a known weight of sulphur in the form of copper sulphate added sulphur added sulphur found in sulphur found in hydrochloric acid solutionnitric acid solution 5 milligrams 8 milligrams 003 milligrams 10 11 003 15 17 1200 bismuthnearly all samples of copper contain bismuth but only in small quantities it is best determined colorimetrically as described under bismuth the method of concentrating and preparing the solution for colorimetric assay is as follows dissolve 10 grams of copper in nitric acid as in the other determinations neutralise with soda add 1 or 15 grams of bicarbonate of soda and boil for ten minutes filter dissolve the precipitate in hot dilute sulphuric acid add sulphurous acid and potassium iodide in excess and boil till free from iodine filter and dilute to 500 cc take 50 cc of the yellow solution for the determination a few cc of a dilute solution of sulphurous acid 1 in 100 will prevent the liberation of iodine the following experiments test the method of separation ten grams of copper were treated as above and precipitated with 15 gram of soda the precipitate contained 06 milligram of bismuth 0006 per cent the filtrate treated with another 15 gram of soda gave a precipitate which was free from bismuth to the filtrate from this was added 10 milligram of bismuth and another fraction was precipitated with 15 gram of soda in this precipitate was found 10 milligram of bismuth to the filtrate another milligram of bismuth was added and the separation with soda repeated the bismuth was separated from this precipitate with ammonic carbonate before determination and 09 milligram was found arsenicthe proportion of arsenic in copper varies from 001 to 075 per cent whilst in coarse copper it may amount to 2 or even 3 per cent to determine it dissolve 5 10 or 20 grams of the copper according to the amount of arsenic present in 18 cc 35 cc or 70 cc of nitric acid and an equal volume of water boil off the nitrous fumes dilute to 100 cc and neutralise with soda add 15 or 2 grams of carbonate of soda dissolved in a little water and boil filter washing is unnecessary and dissolve back into the flask with a little dilute hydrochloric acid add 30 cc of dilute ammonia and 25 cc of magnesia mixture and allow to stand overnight the whole of the arsenic is precipitated as ammonicmagnesic arsenate in one hour but it is advisable to leave it longer the precipitate may be dried and weighed or better titrated with uranium acetate see arsenic to test this method of separation 10 grams of pure copper were taken and 0200 gram of arsenic dissolved with it the arsenic was determined by titration with uranium acetate and 0200 gram was found two other similar experiments with 0080 and 0010 gram of arsenic added gave 0079 and 0012 gram respectively antimony or bismuth may be present without interfering with the titration with 0100 gram of antimony and 0100 gram of arsenic 0100 gram of arsenic was found and in another case with 0100 gram of bismuth and 0060 gram of arsenic 0060 gram was found in these experiments the antimony and bismuth were present in the assay solution when titrated for a gravimetric determination they would require to be removed before precipitating with magnesia mixture phosphorus if present counts as arsenic in the proportion of 1 to 24 but except in the case of coarse coppers it is always absent iron if present interferes by forming a white flocculent precipitate of ferric arsenate after the addition of the sodium acetate and preliminary to the titration each milligram of iron abstracts in this way 13 milligrams of arsenic ironrefined coppers carry traces of iron varying from 0001 to 001 per cent it is best determined during the arsenic estimation the precipitate of the ammonicmagnesic arsenate will contain the whole of the iron as ferric hydrate on dissolving in hydrochloric acid neutralising with ammonia adding 5 cc of sodic acetate diluting and boiling it reappears as a white precipitate of ferric arsenate it is filtered off the arsenic being estimated in the filtrate dissolved in warm hydrochloric acid and determined colorimetrically as described under iron a series of experiments testing the separation is there given phosphorusrefined coppers do not carry phosphorus although it may be present in coarse copper up to 1 per cent or more in such samples the following method is adopted for the estimation of both phosphorus and arsenic dissolve 10 grams of copper and 01 02 or 03 gram of iron wire according to the amount of arsenic and phosphorus present in 35 cc of nitric acid and an equal volume of water add soda till the free acid is nearly neutralised next add a strong solution of sodium acetate until the solution ceases to darken on further addition then dilute with water to half a litre the solution is best contained in a large beaker it is next heated to the boiling point and at once removed and allowed to settle if the precipitate is light coloured it is evidence that sufficient iron has not been added or if it is green from basic copper salts it shows that the solution was not sufficiently acid in either case start afresh filter off the precipitate and wash with hot water containing a little sodium acetate dissolve it off the filter with hot dilute hydrochloric acid add ammonia in excess and pass sulphuretted hydrogen for five minutes warm at about 70 c for a quarter of an hour filter the clear yellow filtrate contains the arsenic and phosphorus add dilute sulphuric acid in excess filter off the yellow precipitate of sulphide of arsenic dissolve it in nitric acid and titrate with uranium acetate as described under arsenic the filtrate from the sulphide of arsenic is rendered alkaline with ammonia and magnesia mixture added the solution is stirred and allowed to stand overnight the precipitate of ammonicmagnesic phosphate is filtered off dissolved and titrated with uranium acetate using the same standard solution as is used in the arsenic assay 05 gram of arsenic equals 0207 gram of phosphorus copperthe method of determining this has been described under electrolytic assay in the method of concentration by fractional precipitation with sodic carbonate which is adopted in most of these determinations the precipitate will contain all the bismuth iron and alumina the arsenic and phosphorus as cupric arsenate and phosphate and the greater part of the lead antimony and silver the nickel and cobalt and the sulphur as sulphuric acid will remain in solution with the greater part of the copper practical exercises 1 according to a wet assay 2 grams of a certain ore contained 03650 gram of copper what would you expect the dry assay produce to be 2 a standard solution is made by dissolving 25 grams of potassic cyanide and diluting to a litre assuming the salt to be 98 per cent real cyanide what would 100 cc of the solution be equivalent to in grams of copper 3 how would you make a solution of hypo of such strength that 100 cc shall equal 0633 gram of copper 4 what weight of ore containing 170 per cent of copper would you take in order to get about 05 gram of copper in solution for electrolysis 5 the solution of copper in nitric acid is effected by the following reaction 3cu 8hno3 3cuno32 4h2o 2no what volume of nitric acid will be required to dissolve 1 gram of copper lead the chief ore of lead is galena a sulphide of lead common in most mining districts and frequently associated with blende and copperpyrites it always carries more or less silver so that in the assay of the ore a silver determination is always necessary carbonate cerussite sulphate anglesite and phosphate pyromorphite of lead also occur as ores but in much smaller quantities lead ores are easily concentrated owing to their high specific gravity c by mechanical operations so that the mineral matter sent to the smelter is comparatively pure lead is readily soluble in dilute nitric acid the addition of sulphuric acid to this solution throws down heavy white and insoluble lead sulphate galena is soluble in hot hydrochloric acid sulphuretted hydrogen being evolved but the action is retarded by the separation of the sparingly soluble lead chloride if a rod of zinc is placed in this solution metallic lead is precipitated on it as a spongy mass the lead chloride being decomposed as fast as it is formed the opening up of the ore is thus easily effected the sulphur going off as sulphuretted hydrogen and the lead remaining in a form easily soluble in dilute nitric acid galena itself is readily attacked by nitric acid part of the lead going into solution and the rest remaining as insoluble lead sulphate the sulphate is due to the oxidation of the sulphur by nitric acid its amount will vary with the quantity and concentration of the acid used sulphate of lead is soluble in solutions of ammonium or sodium acetate or it may be converted into carbonate by boiling with carbonate of soda the carbonate after washing off the sulphate of soda dissolves easily in nitric acid the precipitation of lead from acid solutions with sulphuric acid and the solubility of the precipitate in ammonium acetate distinguishes it from all other metals the addition of potassium chromate to the acetate solution reprecipitates the lead as a yellow chromate dry assay the dry assay of lead is largely used but it is only applicable to rich or concentrated ores and even with these only gives approximate results both lead and lead sulphide are sensibly volatile at a moderatelyhigh temperature hence it is necessary to obtain a slag which is easily fusible as a reducing agent iron is almost always used and this is added either in the form of an iron rod or the crucible itself is made of this metal the flux used is carbonate of soda when a clay crucible is used the method of working is as followsweigh up 25 grams of the dry and powdered ore mix with an equal weight of soda and 2 grams of tartar place in a crucible e battersea round and then insert a piece of iron rod about half an inch in diameter and of such a length that it will just allow the crucible to be covered the rod should be pushed down so as to touch the bottom of the crucible and the mixture should be covered with a sprinkling of borax place in a furnace heated to but not above redness and cover the crucible in about twenty minutes the charge will be fused the fusion is complete when bubbles of gas are no longer being evolved and then but not till then the iron is withdrawn any adhering buttons of lead being washed off by dipping the rod a few times in the slag cover the crucible leave it for a minute or two and then pour detach the slag when cold by hammering the weight of the button multiplied by 4 gives the percentage the commoner errors of students in working the process are too high a temperature and too quick a withdrawal a sample of ore treated in this manner gave on duplicate assay 175 and 176 grams of lead equalling 700 and 704 per cent respectively by wet assay the sample gave 733 per cent using an iron crucible the results will be 1 per cent or so higher the crucible must be made of wrought iron and if it has been previously used should be cleaned by heating to dull redness and scraping the scale off with a stirrer take 30 grams of the ore mix with 30 grams of soda and 3 grams of tartar put the mixture in the crucible and cover with a sprinkling of borax heat for about twenty minutes at not too high a temperature and then scrape down the slag adhering to the side with a stirrer leave in the furnace till action has ceased before pouring tap the pot gently and then tilt it so as to make the slag wash over the part of the crucible along which the charge is to be poured pour and when cold clean and weigh the button of metal a crucible may be used from ten to twenty times these assays are for ores containing the lead chiefly as sulphide for oxidised ores charcoal or tartar is employed as the reducing agent the student may practise on red lead as followstake 30 grams of red lead mix with 10 grams each of borax and soda and about 15 gram of powdered charcoal place in a small clay crucible with a cover c battersea round fuse at a gentle heat and pour when action ceases this assay will only take a few minutes where lead is present as phosphate as in the case of pyromorphite or mixed with phosphates as sometimes happens carbonate of soda is a suitable flux but the phosphate of soda which is formed makes a thick tenacious slag which is very apt to be carried out of the pot by the escaping gas a widemouthed clay pot is taken and a little fluor spar added for the assay of pyromorphite the following charge may be usedore 20 grams soda 25 grams tartar 7 grams and fluor spar 5 grams and 2 grams of borax as a cover this will melt down in about ten minutes and should be poured as soon as tranquil wet assay in the case of galena the best method of getting the lead into solution is to treat with hydrochloric acid and zinc put 1 gram of the ore in an evaporating dish 4 inches across and cover with 10 cc of dilute hydrochloric acid heat till the evolution of sulphuretted hydrogen becomes sluggish and then drop in a piece of zinc rod if the solution effervesces too strongly dilute it continue the heating until the sulphide is seen to be all dissolved when the lead is all precipitated pour off the liquid and wash twice with cold water peel off the precipitated lead with the help of a glass rod and then clean the zinc cover the lead with 20 cc of water and 5 cc of dilute nitric acid and heat gently till dissolved all the lead will be in solution and when filtered off from the gangue will be ready for a gravimetric determination for volumetric work this filtering is unnecessary the chief objection to this method is that commercial zinc carries considerable quantities of lead although this can be determined and allowed for the correction required is in most cases too large to be satisfactory the following method is applicable in all cases but is more troublesometreat 1 gram of the ore with 10 cc of dilute nitric acid in an evaporating dish covered with a clockglass and evaporate till nearly dry take up with 50 cc of water and add 10 cc of dilute sulphuric acid filter the residue contains the lead as sulphate together with the insoluble matter of the ore and globules of sulphur warm with a solution of ammonium acetate and filter the lead will be in the filtrate and is recovered in a state fit for direct gravimetric estimation by the addition of dilute sulphuric acid if the volumetric method is to be used the lead sulphate should be dissolved out with a solution of sodium acetate instead of with the ammonium salt solution gravimetric determination the lead is separated and precipitated as sulphate as already described the solution must be allowed to stand and the clear liquid be decanted through a filter transfer the precipitate and wash with very dilute sulphuric acid 1 or 2 cc in 100 cc of water the acid must be completely removed with one or two washes with cold water and then with alcohol the volume of liquid required for washing is small as the precipitate is dense and easily cleaned but the washing must be carefully done since if any acid remains it will on drying char the paper and render the subsequent work troublesome dry transfer to a watchglass and burn the filter paper collecting its ash in a weighed porcelain crucible the filter paper must be freed as much as possible from the lead sulphate before burning and the ash treated with a drop or two of nitric and sulphuric acids transfer the lead sulphate to the crucible ignite gently keeping the temperature below redness cool and weigh the precipitate will contain 736 per cent of lead oxide or 683 per cent of lead determination of lead in commercial zinctake 10 grams of zinc and treat without heating with 60 cc of dilute hydrochloric acid when the zinc is nearly all dissolved decant off the clear liquid and dissolve the residue in 2 cc of dilute nitric acid evaporate till most of the acid is removed dilute to 20 or 30 cc with water and add 10 cc of dilute sulphuric acid filter off and weigh the lead sulphate ten grams treated in this way gave01610 gram of lead sulphate equivalent to 110 per cent of lead volumetric method this is based upon the reaction between chromate of potash and soluble lead salts in neutral solutions whereby an insoluble yellow chromate of lead is produced60 an excess of the chromate is required to complete the reaction so that the point at which an indicator shows the presence of undecomposed chromate cannot be satisfactorily taken as the finish therefore an excess of the standard chromate must be run in and such excess determined chromate of lead is not precipitated from strong nitric acid solutions and only incompletely from dilute ones acids generally are detrimental to the precipitation and must be neutralised before titrating if the lead is present as sulphate in sodic acetate solution it is well to render it distinctly alkaline with ammonia lead chromate precipitated in the cold is a lemonyellow light precipitate very difficult to filter on heating to 40 c the colour becomes orange at 60 c it assumes a deeper hue and becomes flocculent and at a boiling temperature it still further darkens and settles readily these changes in colour are not due to any chemical change as will be seen by testing the filtrate for chromium or lead this is an advantage to the assay since it is only at the higher temperature that the precipitate can be easily filtered the lead is not completely precipitated but the amount remaining in solution is only 2 or 3 milligrams which is just sufficient to give a dark coloration with sulphuretted hydrogen the standard chromate of potash solution is made by dissolving 713 grams of bichromate of potash and 20 grams of caustic soda in water and diluting to 1 litre or 940 grams of the neutral chromate k2cro4 may be dissolved and diluted to 1 litre 100 cc will be equivalent to 1000 gram of lead standard lead solution16 grams of nitrate of lead pbno32 are dissolved in water and diluted to 1 litre 100 cc will contain 1000 gram of lead acetate of soda solution250 grams of the crystallised salt naac3h2o are dissolved and diluted to 1 litre use 40 cc for each assay in the titration the assay solution should measure 150 to 200 cc and should be boiling or nearly so it is best contained in a pint flask and the standard chromate solution used with an ordinary burette run in the chromate solution in a steady stream until the whole of the lead has been precipitated the amount required for this may be calculated for example 1 gram of an 80 per cent ore would require 80 cc a little of the assay may be filtered off and if it does not show a yellow colour in the filtrate run in 2 cc more of the standard solution and continue this addition till a colour is shown after this run in another cc to ensure an excess dilute to 250 cc and heat to boiling allow to settle for three or four minutes filter off 50 cc into a nessler glass and determine the excess of chromate colorimetrically the excess found in the 50 cc must of course be multiplied by five and then be deducted from the quantity of chromate originally run into the assay solution the quantity to be deducted should not exceed 3 cc where a number of determinations are made the colorimetric estimation is facilitated by using a series of standard phials similar to those described under the electrolytic copper assay the determination is rendered sharper and less liable to error by the addition of a few drops of acetic acid to convert the chromate into bichromate the same chromate solution must be used in this determination as was used in the precipitation in standardising the chromate solution the standard lead nitrate solution is used a quantity containing about as much lead as the assay is supposed to contain is measured off rendered alkaline with dilute ammonia and then neutralised with acetic acid using a small piece of litmus paper dropped into the solution as indicator then dilute boil and titrate when the lead in the assay has been separated as sulphate and dissolved in sodic acetate less chromate is apparently required and in this case it will be necessary to precipitate the lead in the standard with an equivalent of sodic sulphate and redissolve in sodic acetate just as in the assay in these solutions although there is considerable chromate in excess a further addition of 5 or 6 cc of the chromate solution will cause a further precipitate the following experiments show the effect of variation in the conditions of the assay effect of varying temperaturetwenty cc of lead nitrate solution and 10 grams of sodium acetate were used diluted to 200 cc heated to the desired temperature and titrated the results were temperature 15 30 50

required 196 193 194 194 effect of varying acetic acidsince the experiments are carried out in the presence of sodic acetate acetic acid is the only acid whose effect need be considered working as before but with 200 cc bulk and varying amounts of the acid the results were acid present 100 cc 200 cc 400 cc chromate required 197 cc 191 185 173 these experiments show that only slight quantities of acid are admissible effect of varying sodium acetatewith the same conditions as before but with varying weights of sodium acetate the results were sodium acetate present 5 grams 10 grams 25 grams 50 grams chromate required 197 cc 196 cc 196 cc 188 cc 178 cc these experiments show that excessive quantities of sodium acetate must be avoided ammonium acetate interferes to a greater extent and if both acetic acid and this salt are present each exerts its disturbing influence with 10 grams of ammonium acetate 194 cc of the chromate solution were required instead of 197 cc in the absence of this salt with 10 grams of the acetate and 10 cc of acetic acid only 186 cc were required effect of foreign saltsas already stated sulphates interfere twenty cc of the lead nitrate solution were taken precipitated with sulphate of soda and the precipitate dissolved in 10 grams of sodium acetate and titrated as before duplicate experiments required 186 cc and 187 cc of the chromate solution a similar experiment with 40 cc of lead nitrate required 374 cc of chromate if the sulphate had not been present the results would have been 197 cc and 394 cc respectively effect of varying leadin these experiments the conditions were as before but with varying amounts of lead lead nitrate solution present 100 cc 200 cc 500 cc 1000 cc chromate solution required 94 197 488 982 determination of lead in galenaweigh up 1 gram of the powdered and dried ore and boil in an evaporating dish with 10 cc of dilute hydrochloric acid when the action becomes sluggish dilute with an equal bulk of water and add a weighed piece of zinc rod about 1 inch long and quarterinch across keep up a moderate action by warming till the ore is seen to be completely attacked and the lead precipitated decant off the solution wash once strip off the lead wash and weigh the remaining zinc dissolve the lead in 5 cc of dilute nitric acid and 5 cc of water with the aid of heat dilute and transfer to a pint flask add a slight excess of dilute ammonia and render faintly acid with acetic acid dilute to 150 cc heat to boiling and run in the standard chromate in slight excess noting the amount required and make up to 250 cc with water boil the solution allow to settle for a minute or so filter off 50 cc and determine the excess of chromate colorimetrically as an example 1 gram of an impure galena was precipitated with 75 cc of standard chromate 100 cc 1020 gram lead the excess found in 50 cc was 03 cc which multiplied by 5 gives 15 cc as the excess in the whole solution the remaining 735 cc of chromate required by the assay are equivalent to 07497 gram of lead the zinc used up weighed 15 grams and contained 00165 gram of lead thus we get lead in the assay 07497 gram lead from the zinc 00165 lead in the galena 07332 equivalent to 733 per cent another sample in which the galena was accompanied with a large quantity of pyrites gave the following resultsthree grams were treated with 30 cc of dilute hydrochloric acid and a rod of zinc the zinc and lead were carefully transferred to another vessel the zinc cleaned and the lead dissolved in 5 cc of dilute nitric acid and 20 cc of water treated as before 145 cc of the chromate were required 01479 gram lead lead in 2 grams of zinc 00220 lead in 3 grams of the ore 01259 equivalent to 420 per cent the same ore gave by separation of the lead with sulphuretted hydrogen and conversion into sulphate 416 per cent with fairly pure ores free from sulphate the assay may be made more quickly as follows dissolve 1 gram of the finely powdered ore by boiling gently with 40 cc of dilute hydrochloric acid for 15 minutes cool add a few drops of permanganate neutralise with ammonia add acetic acid and a little sodium acetate titrate with standard chromate colorimetric process this is based upon the brown coloration produced in very dilute solutions of lead by the action of a solution of sulphuretted hydrogen the quantity of lead in the 50 cc of the assay solution must not much exceed 05 milligram nor be less than 001 the sulphuretted hydrogen is used in the form of a solution and is not bubbled through the assay the principle of working is the same as previously described standard lead solutioneach cc of this should contain 01 milligram of lead it is made by diluting 10 cc of the solution of lead nitrate described under the volumetric process to 1 litre sulphuretted hydrogen water is made by passing a current of the washed gas into water till the latter is saturated five cc of the sulphuretted hydrogen water are put into a nessler tube the measured portion of the assay solution added and the whole diluted with water to the 50 cc mark into the standard nessler tube the same amount of the sulphuretted hydrogen water is put and diluted to nearly 50 cc the standard lead solution is then run in till the tints are equal the assay solution must not contain much free acid and if the conditions will allow it may with advantage be rendered alkaline with ammonia the chief cause of disturbance is the precipitation of lead sulphide forming a black turbid solution instead of a brown clear one this may be caused by using hot solutions or an excess of acid other metals precipitable by sulphuretted hydrogen must be absent as well as strong oxidising agents effect of varying temperaturethe effect of increased temperature is to change the colour from brown to black and to render the estimation difficult 1 cc at 15 c showed the colour of 05 cc at 60 c 2 15 at 60 c 3 50 at 50 c effect of varying timethe colour becomes lighter on standing 2 cc on standing 10 20 and 40 minutes became equal in colour to 17 cc effect of acids and ammoniatwo cc of the solution with 2 cc of dilute hydrochloric acid became cloudy and equivalent to about 25 cc and a similar result was got with 2 cc of dilute sulphuric acid with 2 cc of dilute ammonia the solution became somewhat darker or equal to 23 cc but gave a very clear solution easy to compare determination of lead in commercial zincdissolve 01 gram of the metal in 1 cc of dilute nitric acid evaporates till a solid separates out dilute to 100 cc with water and take 20 cc for assay a sample treated in this way required 24 cc this multiplied by 5 gives 120 cc equivalent to 12 milligram of lead or 12 per cent by gravimetric assay the sample gave 110 per cent practical exercises 1 thirty grams of galena gave on dry assay 21 grams of lead and this on cupellation gave 15 milligrams of silver calculate the results in per cents of lead and in ounces of silver to the ton of ore 2 how many ounces of silver to the ton would be contained in the lead got from this ore if the loss in smelting is equal to that of the assay 3 having given you a sample of white lead freed from oil by washing with ether how would you proceed to determine the percentage of lead in it thallium thallium is a rare metal found in small quantities in some varieties of iron and copper pyrites and in some lithia micas it resembles lead in appearance its compounds resemble the salts of the alkalies in some respects and in others those of the heavy metals it is detected by the green colour which its salts impart to the flame this when examined with the spectroscope shows only one bright green line it is separated and estimated by dissolving in aqua regia converting into sulphate by evaporation with sulphuric acid separating the second group of metals with sulphuretted hydrogen in the acid solution boiling off the excess of the gas nearly neutralising with carbonate of soda and precipitating the thallium with an excess of potassic iodide on allowing the liquid to stand for some time a bright yellow precipitate of thallous iodide separates out this is collected on a weighed filter washed with cold water finishing off with alcohol dried at 100 c and weighed the precipitate is thallous iodide tli and contains 616 per cent of thallium bismuth bismuth is nearly always found in nature in the metallic state but occasionally it is met with as sulphide in bismuthine and as carbonate in bismutite it is also found in some comparatively rare minerals such as tetradymite combined with tellurium and associated with gold in minute quantities it is widely distributed it is a common constituent of most copper ores hence it finds its way into refined copper which is seldom free from it it is occasionally met with in silver in sufficient quantity to interfere with the working qualities of that metal bismuth compounds are used in medicine and in the manufacture of alloys bismuth possesses many useful properties it has considerable commercial value and sells at a high price the metal is brittle breaks with a highly crystalline fracture and has a characteristic reddishyellow colour it is almost insoluble in hydrochloric but readily dissolves in nitric acid and gives if the acid is in excess a clear solution bismuth salts have a strong tendency to separate out as insoluble basic compounds this is more especially true of the chloride which on diluting with a large volume of water becomes milky the whole of the bismuth separating out the nitrate carbonate and hydrate yield the oxide bi2o3 on ignition this oxide closely resembles litharge it combines with silica forming fluid slags and at a red heat is liquid enough to be absorbed by a cupel in fact bismuth may take the place of lead in cupellation the metal itself is easily fusible and may be separated from its ores by liquation the assay of bismuth by wet methods presents little difficulty and is fairly accurate the price of the metal is such that only methods which yield good results should be adopted and since bismuth is volatile at the temperature of the furnace and is found mixed with ores not easy to flux as also with metals which are not easily separated by the dry method the dry assay can only be considered as having a qualitative value dry assay by liquationthis is adapted to ores containing the bismuth as metal take 20 grams of the powdered ore and place in a crucible with a perforated bottom put this crucible into another of about the same size and lute the joint lute on a cover place in the furnace and heat to redness the bismuth melts readily and drains into the lower crucible from which when cold it is taken and weighed by fusionfor fairly pure ores the process is as followstake 20 grams of the ore and mix with 20 grams of fusion mixture 10 grams of salt and 5 or 10 grams of potassium cyanide place in a crucible cover and fuse at a moderate temperature for about fifteen minutes pour when cold detach the metal and weigh for coppery ores in which the metals are present as sulphides use the fluxes just given with 2 grams of charcoal instead of the cyanide and a little sulphur for coppery ores in which the metals are present as oxides mix 20 grams of the ore with 10 grams of fusion mixture 4 grams of salt 4 grams of sulphur and 2 grams of charcoal and fuse a considerable percentage of bismuth is lost in these assays it is stated as being nearly 8 per cent of the metal present wet methods detectionbismuth is detected by dissolving the substance in nitric or hydrochloric acid and precipitating the diluted solution with sulphuretted hydrogen the precipitated sulphides after digesting with soda and washing are dissolved in nitric acid and the solution boiled with ammonium carbonate the precipitate is washed and then warmed with dilute sulphuric acid the solution will contain the bismuth add a solution of potassium iodide in excess and boil a yellow or dark brown solution proves that bismuth is present another good test for small quantities of bismuth is to add tartaric acid to the solution to be tested and then to make it alkaline with potash add a few cc of schneiders liquid61 and heat a brownishblack colour is produced by as little as one part of bismuth in 200000 of solution the test is not applicable in the presence of mercury copper or manganese compounds of bismuth fused with cyanide of potassium in a berlin crucible readily give a globule of bismuth which is recognised by its appearance and fracture solution and separationthe solution of bismuth compounds presents no difficulty they are soluble in nitric acid or aqua regia and provided the solution is sufficiently acid they remain dissolved in separating it from other metals the solution is made up to about 100 cc and treated with a current of sulphuretted hydrogen the bismuth comes down in a tolerably strong acid solution the sulphide is decanted on to a filter and washed it is next digested with ammonic sulphide or better especially when other metals are present dissolved in nitric acid and treated with an excess of ammonia and a current of sulphuretted hydrogen the precipitate is filtered off and evaporated to dryness with nitric acid it is taken up with a few drops of sulphuric acid and a little water and warmed and filtered if necessary the filtrate is nearly neutralised with ammonia ammonium carbonate added in slight excess and the liquid heated to boiling and filtered the bismuth will be contained in the precipitate with perhaps traces of lead antimony tin or sometimes iron from incomplete separation or washing when only traces of a precipitate are got it must be tested the bismuth precipitate is readily soluble in dilute nitric acid gravimetric determination the bismuth having been separated and dissolved in nitric acid62 is precipitated after dilution by the addition of carbonate of ammonium in slight excess and boiling the precipitate is filtered off washed with hot water dried ignited and weighed the ignition should be performed carefully at not above a low red heat the oxide which is formed has at this temperature a dark yellow or brown colour and becomes yellow on cooling it is bismuthic oxide bi2o3 and contains 8965 per cent of bismuth fusion with potassium cyanide at a temperature just sufficient to melt the salt reduces it to the metal which falls to the bottom and runs into a globule the button of metal may be weighed but it often sticks tenaciously to the bottom of the crucible the precipitation with ammonic carbonate must not be made in a sulphate or chloride solution since basic compounds would then be thrown down and the result on weighing would either be too low because of the volatilisation of the chloride or too high because of the retention of sulphuric acid bismuth compounds in a nitric acid solution are readily decomposed by the electric current but the deposited bismuth is not coherent it comes down in shaggy tufts which are difficult to wash and easy to oxidise volumetric assay there are two methods which have been proposed one based on the precipitation as chromate and the estimation of the chromic acid and the other on the precipitation as oxalate and subsequent titration with permanganate of potash these offer little advantage over the easy gravimetric determination colorimetric method bismuth iodide dissolves in excess of potassium iodide forming a yellowcoloured solution indistinguishable in colour from that given by iodine the colour however is not removed by boiling or by sulphurous acid since none of the commoner metals give such a colour and free iodine is easily separated by boiling this method is specially suited for small determinations of bismuth it requires a solution of bismuth made by dissolving 01 gram of bismuth in a drop or so of nitric acid evaporating with a little sulphuric acid and diluting with water to 1 litre 1 cc will contain 01 milligram of bismuth and a solution of sulphurous acid made by diluting 10 cc of the commercial acid to 1 litre with water the determination is made in the usual way 50 cc of the prepared solution which should not carry more than 075 milligram nor less than 001 milligram of bismuth are placed in a nessler tube and the colour compared with that observed in a similar tube containing water and potassium iodide on adding the standard solution of bismuth the assay solution is prepared by separating the bismuth with sulphuretted hydrogen boiling the precipitate with nitric acid and evaporating with sulphuric acid take up with water add 10 or 20 cc of solution of potassium iodide boil off any iodine liberated dilute filter and make up to 100 cc according to the depth of colour take 10 20 or 50 cc and transfer to the nessler tube add a few cc of the solution of sulphurous acid into the other nessler tube put as much potassium iodide solution as is contained in the assay tube with sulphurous acid and water to within a few cc of the bulk then add the standard bismuth solution till the tints are equal the student must be careful not to confuse the colour of the bismuth iodide with that of free iodine if the yellow colour is removed by boiling and returns on standing it is due altogether to iodine if it is lessened by the addition of a few drops of the dilute sulphurous acid it is in part due to it hence the necessity of having a little free sulphurous acid in each tube a strong solution must not be used since it liberates iodine from potassium iodide the following experiments illustrate the effect of variation in the conditions of the assay effect of varying temperatureat a higher temperature the colour is somewhat lessened 10 cc at 15 c showed the colour of 08 cc at 70 c 25 20 50 50 effect of free acid 25 cc with 5 cc of nitric acid equalled 25 cc 50 sulphuric acid 50

bismuth 5 of lead and 3 of tin what weight of oxide of bismuth bi2o3 would you get on the analysis of 1 gram of it 2 what weight of bismuth can be got from 2 grams of the subnitrate biono3h2o 3 how would you detect and separate arsenic lead and copper in a sample of bismuth antimony antimony occurs in the native state but is rare its common ore is antimonite the sulphide sb2s3 jamesonite and other sulphides of lead and antimony are frequently met with sulphide of antimony is also a constituent of fahlerz and of many silver ores antimonite occurs generally in fibrous masses has a leadlike metallic lustre is easily cut with a knife and melts in the flame of a candle antimony itself has a very crystalline fracture is brittle and has a bluishwhite colour it is used in the preparation of alloys with lead and tin for the manufacture of typemetal it is readily fusible and imparts hardness and the property of taking a sharp cast to its alloys it is practically insoluble in hydrochloric acid on boiling with strong nitric acid it is converted into antimonic oxide sb2o5 which is a powder almost insoluble in this acid or in water but which may be got into solution with difficulty by the prolonged action of hydrochloric and tartaric acids antimonic oxide is converted on ignition into the tetroxide sb2o4 with loss of oxygen antimony forms two series of salts antimonious and antimonic and advantage is taken of this in its determination volumetrically either sulphide of antimony yields antimonious chloride on boiling with hydrochloric acid sulphuretted hydrogen being given off and in the case of antimonic sulphide sulphur is deposited antimonious is converted into antimonic chloride by treatment with permanganate of potash in an acid solution antimonic chloride and potassium iodide react forming antimonious chloride and free iodine this latter may be got rid of by boiling sulphide of antimony is separated from the ore by liquation this regulus is met with in commerce as crude antimony dry assay an approximate determination of the amount of sulphide of antimony in an ore may be made by fusing and liquating in a luted double crucible in the manner described under bismuth this is unsatisfactory the determination of metallic antimony in an ore is made either by fusion with potassium cyanide or by fusion with iron as in the galena assay both methods yield poor results and where iron is used it must be added in quantity only sufficient for desulphurising this amounts to about 40 per cent in pure ores if the iron is in excess it alloys with the reduced antimony if on the other hand it is insufficient the metal will contain sulphur or sulphide of antimony will be lost in the slag the following note for which we are indebted to mr bedford mcneill arsm gives a description of the method adopted in the commercial valuation of a parcel of antimony ore the antimony smelter when he wishes to determine the value of any parcel of oreusually the sulphidethat may be offered for sale practically has recourse to the smelting operation that is a quantity of 2 or 3 cwts taken by his sampler having been obtained he treats it under the immediate supervision of the foreman smelter as if it formed part of the ore in process of daily reduction at his works he thus determines by actual trial the output which it may fairly be anticipated will be yielded by the bulk and upon the result of this trial or assay and the knowledge gained of the actual behaviour of the ore under treatment he bases his tender knowing that should he secure the parcel he may confidently expect a similar return briefly the process consists of the three ordinary operations of a singling or removing most of the antimony from the ore b doubling c refining or starring but in the assay sufficient information is generally given by the first two of these a new pot having been taken and made hot in the furnace 40 or 45 lbs of the ore is weighed in the mineral from the necessities of sampling not exceeding walnut size 1 to 3 lbs of salt cake is now added to render the separation of the resulting sulphide of iron more easy as also to assist in the fusion of the gangue 20 to 25 lbs of tinplate scrap beaten more or less into ball shape is weighed placed on the top of the ore and salt cake and the whole brought to a state of fusion the foreman from time to time takes notice of the behaviour of the ore under the working conditions ores that manifest a tendency to boil or froth require the admixture of other more sluggish mineral in order to render their reduction economically practicable after 114 to 112 hours the time depending mainly on the temperature the contents of the crucible are usually in a state of tranquil fusion the pot is now lifted from the fire and its contents transferred to a conical iron mould the empty pot being immediately put back into the fire and the latter mended with sufficient coke for another run the conical mould when dealing with a strange ore and the possibility of insufficient iron being present to satisfy the sulphur contents is wiped inside with clay previous to pouring in the molten charge otherwise the mould itself will be attacked and the contents after solidifying will require to be chiselled out piecemeal a further 40 lbs of the ore is now charged into the crucible with iron as above but before this second charge is ready to be drawn an inspection of the first may suggest the addition of either 3 or 5 lbs more iron or 5 or 10 lbs more ore it is a good fault rather to aim at an excess of iron as tending to clean the ore from antimony any of the latter that from an insufficiency of iron may be left in the slag from the first process being irretrievably lost whereas if the iron be in excess that which is combined with the crude antimony resulting from the first process is easily got rid of by adding 3 to 5 lbs or so of ore in the second process this latter as practised for the determination of the value of a parcel of ore consists in selecting two of the best quality singles resulting from perhaps four or five trials as above and running them down with a few pounds of salt cake or a mixture of salt cake with american potash and as is generally necessary a small addition of ore upon the final result confirmed perhaps on another pair of singles and judging from the total weight or output of the metal as calculated from the ore used in singling plus any added in the doubling the crystalline fracture and face of the metal its colour etc the price to be offered for the parcel of ore is fixed wet methods detectionthe antimony if any being got into solution by treating the ore with hydrochloric acid or aqua regia may be detected by evaporating with hydrochloric acid diluting and filtering into the cover of a platinum crucible or better a platinum dish a small lump of zinc is then added and if antimony is present the dish will in a minute or so be stained black with a deposit of metallic antimony this stain is removed by nitric but not by hydrochloric acid the reaction is delicate and characteristic arsenic under like conditions is evolved as arseniuretted hydrogen and tin is deposited as metal on the zinc solutionores c containing antimony are best opened up by boiling with hydrochloric acid or aqua regia treatment with nitric acid should be avoided wherever possible since it forms antimonic acid which is subsequently dissolved only with difficulty salts of antimony in solution have a tendency to form insoluble basic salts so that care must be exercised in diluting compounds such as antimonite which are soluble in hydrochloric should be dissolved at once in that acid separationto the solution add potash in excess and a little free sulphur and pass a current of sulphuretted hydrogen for some minutes allow to digest for an hour or so on a hot plate filter and wash the residue acidulate the filtrate with hydrochloric acid the precipitate will contain the antimony as sb2s5 and possibly arsenic or tin the precipitate is transferred to a beaker and boiled with hydrochloric acid the solution is filtered off and diluted add a few crystals of tartaric acid and pass a current of sulphuretted hydrogen for some time the first flocculent precipitate will become denser and render the filtering more easy transfer the precipitate after washing free from chlorides to a berlin dish and treat cautiously with fuming nitric acid the action of this acid on the sulphide is very violent evaporate and ignite transfer to a silver dish and fuse with four or five times its weight of caustic soda cool and extract with a little water then add an equal volume of alcohol and allow to stand overnight filter wash with dilute alcohol the filtrate will contain the tin the residue contains the antimony as antimonate of soda and is dissolved off the filter with hot dilute hydrochloric with the help of a little tartaric acid the filtrate is now ready for the gravimetric determination gravimetric assay pass a current of sulphuretted hydrogen through the solution containing the antimony to which a little tartaric acid has been previously added pass the gas till the precipitate becomes dense and the antimony is all down the solution must not be too strongly acid filter off the precipitate wash with hot water dry in the water oven transfer to a weighed porcelain dish and cautiously treat with fuming nitric acid continue the action on the water bath till the sulphur and antimony are completely oxidised evaporate ignite gently at first then strongly over the blast cool and weigh the residue is a white infusible powder and consists of antimony tetroxide sb2o4 containing 7894 per cent of the metal determination of antimony as bigallatewhat appears to be a very good method has been worked out by ma guyard and is described in crookes select methods p 398 the antimony must be in solution as antimonious chloride and must not be accompanied by an excess of hydrochloric acid to ensure these conditions the solution is treated with potassium iodide until no more iodine is evolved and is then evaporated to remove the excess of hydrochloric acid to the concentrated and nearly neutral solution a freshlyprepared solution of gallic acid is added in slight excess a bulky white precipitate is formed that settles rapidly the solution is diluted with hot water and washed by decantation then the precipitate is collected on a weighed double filter washed once or twice with hot water and dried at 100 c the dried substance is antimony bigallate and contains 4085 per cent of antimony it should be completely soluble in ammonium sulphide the solution in which the antimony is precipitated need not be quite free from other metals volumetric method this is based on the reduction of antimonic chloride sbcl5 to antimonious sbcl3 by the action of potassium iodide in strong hydrochloric acid solution63 iodine is at the same time liberated and the amount of antimony reduced is got at by titrating with sodium hyposulphite which measures the iodine set free the standard solution of sodium hyposulphite is made by dissolving 4132 grams of the salt na2s2o35h2o in water and diluting to 1 litre one hundred cc will be equivalent to about 1 gram of antimony it is standardised with the help of a solution of antimony made as followsweigh up 5 grams of powdered antimony transfer to a flask and cover with 50 cc of hydrochloric acid boil and add nitric acid 5 or 10 drops at a time until the metal is dissolved allow the action of the nitric acid to cease before adding more boil down to a small bulk add 250 cc of hydrochloric acid and dilute to nearly 1 litre warm until any precipitate which has formed is redissolved allow to cool slowly and run in from a pipette a weak solution of permanganate until a faint brown colour is produced dilute to exactly 1 litre 100 cc contain 05 gram of antimony as antimonic chloride in standardising take 50 cc of the antimony solution and transfer to a flask add 2 grams of potassium iodide crystals and when dissolved after standing a few minutes run in the solution of hypo from an ordinary burette until the greater part of the iodine has been reduced add a few drops of starch solution and continue the addition of the hypo until the muddygreen colour changes to a clear brownishyellow the solution must be shaken after each addition of the hypo in determining antimony in ore weigh up 05 to 1 gram and dissolve in hydrochloric acid with if necessary the help of chlorate of potash the antimony is separated as sulphide redissolved in hydrochloric acid and oxidised with a crystal of chlorate of potash chlorine is boiled off and the solution diluted with an equal bulk of water to the clear cold solution potassium iodide is added and after a few minutes the liberated iodine is titrated with hypo as already described the method only yields satisfactory results when the

oxide known as ferrous salts are generally pale and greenish ferric salts are derived from the higher oxide and are generally red brown or yellow the existence of these two wellmarked families of salts renders the assay of iron comparatively easy for the quantity of iron present in a solution can be readily measured by the amount of oxidising or reducing agent required to convert it from the one state into the otherthat is from ferrous to ferric or from ferric to ferrous as the case may be in the red and brown iron ores and ochres ferric iron is present in chalybite the iron is in the ferrous state and in magnetite it is present in both forms traces of iron in the ferrous state may be found even in the presence of much ferric iron by either of the following tests 1 ferricyanide of potassium gives a blue precipitate or green coloration with ferric salts a brown colour only is produced 2 a solution of permanganate of potassium is decolorised by a ferrous salt but not by a ferric one traces of ferric iron can be detected even in the presence of much ferrous iron by the following tests 1 by the brown or yellow colour of the solution especially when hot 2 by giving a pink or red coloration with sulphocyanide of potassium substances containing oxide of iron yield the whole of the iron as metal when fused at a high temperature with charcoal and suitable fluxes the metal however will contain varying proportions of carbon and other impurities and its weight can only afford a rough knowledge of the proportion of the metal in the ore there are two or three methods of dry assay for iron but they are not only inexact but more troublesome than the wet methods and need not be further considered chalybite and the hydrated oxides dissolve very readily in hydrochloric acid hmatite and magnetite dissolve with rather more difficulty iron itself when soft is easily soluble in dilute hydrochloric or sulphuric acid pyrites mispickel c are insoluble in hydrochloric acid but they are readily attacked by nitric acid certain minerals such as chrome iron ore titaniferous iron ore and some silicates containing iron remain in the residue insoluble in acids some of these yield their iron when attacked with strong sulphuric acid or when fused with the acid sulphate of potash generally however it is better in such stubborn cases to fuse with carbonate of soda and then attack the melt with hydrochloric acid when nitric acid or the fusion method has been used the metal will be in solution in the ferric state no matter in what condition it existed in the ore but with dilute hydrochloric or sulphuric acid it will retain its former degree of oxidation hydrochloric acid for example with chalybite ferrous carbonate will give a solution of ferrous chloride with hmatite ferric oxide it will yield ferric chloride and with magnetite ferrous and ferric oxides a mixture of ferrous and ferric chlorides metallic iron yields solutions of ferrous salts it is convenient to speak of the iron in a ferrous salt as ferrous iron and when in the ferric state as ferric iron frequently it is required to determine how much of the iron exists in an ore in each condition in such cases it is necessary to keep off the air whilst dissolving the operation should therefore be performed in an atmosphere of carbonic acid separationthe separation of the iron from the other substances is as followssilica is removed by evaporating the acid solution and taking up with acid as described under silica the whole of the iron will be in solution the metals of groups i and ii are removed by passing sulphuretted hydrogen and at the same time the iron will be reduced to the ferrous state the solution should be filtered into a 16 oz flask boiled to get rid of the gas and treated whilst boiling with a few drops of nitric acid in order to convert the whole of the iron into the ferric state when this condition is arrived at an additional drop of nitric acid causes no dark coloration the boiling must be continued to remove nitrous fumes next add caustic soda solution until the colour of the solution changes from yellow to red the solution must be free from a precipitate if the soda be incautiously added a permanent precipitate will be formed in which case it must be redissolved with hydrochloric acid and soda again but more cautiously added after cooling a solution of sodium acetate is added until the colour of the solution is no longer darkened the solution diluted to twothirds of the flaskful with water is heated to boiling longcontinued boiling must be avoided the precipitate is filtered quickly through a large filter and washed with hot water containing a little acetate of soda the precipitate will contain all the iron and may also contain alumina chromium titanium as well as phosphoric and perhaps arsenic acids64 dissolve the precipitate off the filter with dilute sulphuric acid avoiding excess add tartaric acid and then ammonia in excess pass sulphuretted hydrogen warm and allow the precipitate to settle filter and wash with water containing a little ammonic sulphide gravimetric method dissolve the precipitate in dilute hydrochloric acid peroxidise with a few drops of nitric acid and boil dilute to about 200 cc add ammonia with constant stirring till the liquid smells of it and heat to boiling wash as much as possible by decantation with hot water transfer to the filter and wash till the filtrate gives no indication of soluble salts coming through the filtrate must be colourless and clear the wet precipitate is very bulky of a darkbrown colour and readily soluble in dilute acids but insoluble in ammonia and dilute alkalies when thrown down from a solution containing other metals it is very apt to carry portions of these with it even when they are by themselves very soluble in ammoniacal solutions it must be dried and ignited the filter paper being burnt separately and its ash added when further ignition ceases to cause a loss of weight the residue is ferric oxide fe2o3 which contains 70 per cent of iron the weight of iron therefore can be calculated by multiplying the weight of oxide obtained by 07 the presence of ammonic chloride causes loss of iron during the ignition and organic matter causes an apparent loss by reducing the iron to a lower state of oxidation when the iron in the solution much exceeds 02 gram the volumetric determination is generally adopted as the bulkiness of the precipitate of ferric hydrate makes the gravimetric method very inconvenient volumetric methods as already explained these are based on the measurement of the volume of a reagent required to bring the whole of the iron from the ferrous to the ferric state oxidation or from the ferric to the ferrous reduction ferrous compounds are converted into ferric by the action of an oxidising agent in the presence of an acid either permanganate or bichromate of potash is generally used for this purpose65 ferric compounds are reduced to ferrous by the action of 1 stannous chloride 2 sulphuretted hydrogen 3 sodium sulphite or 4 zinc66 the processes then may be divided into two kinds one based on oxidation and the other on reduction in each case the titration must be preceded by an exact preparation of the solution to be assayed in order that the iron may be in the right state of oxidation permanganate and bichromate methods these consist of three operations 1 solution of the ore 2 reduction of the iron to the ferrous state and 3 titration solutionthe only point to be noticed concerning the first operation in addition to those already mentioned is that nitric acid must be absent if nitric acid has been used evaporate to dryness of course without previous dilution add hydrochloric or sulphuric acid and boil for five or ten minutes dilute with water to about 100 cc and warm until solution is complete the reduction is performed by either of the following methods 1 with stannous chloridefill a burette with a solution of stannous chloride67 and cautiously run the liquid into the hot assay solution in which the iron is present as chloride until the colour is discharged a large excess of the stannous chloride must be avoided then add 5 cc of a 212 per cent solution of mercuric chloride this will cause a white precipitate or a grey one if too large an excess of the stannous chloride has been added boil till the solution clears cool dilute and titrate 2 with sulphuretted hydrogencool the solution and pass through it a current of washed sulphuretted hydrogen till the liquid smells strongly of the gas after withdrawal and shaking a white precipitate of sulphur will be formed this will not interfere with the subsequent titration provided it is precipitated in the cold if however the precipitate is coloured showing the presence of the second group metals or if the precipitation has been carried out in a hot solution it should be filtered off boil the solution until the sulphuretted hydrogen is driven off this may be tested by holding a strip of filter paper dipped in lead acetate solution in the steam issuing from the flask the presence of sulphuretted hydrogen should be looked for rather than its absence it is well to continue the boiling for a few minutes after the gas has been driven off cool and titrate 3 with sodium sulphiteadd ammonia a few drops at a time until the precipitate first formed redissolves with difficulty if a permanent precipitate is formed redissolve with a few drops of acid to the warm solution add from 2 to 3 grams of sodium sulphite crystals the solution will become strongly coloured but the colour will fade away on standing for a few minutes in a warm place when the colour is quite removed add 20 cc of dilute sulphuric acid and boil until the steam is quite free from the odour of sulphurous acid cool and titrate 4 with zincadd about 10 grams of granulated zinc if the hydrogen comes off violently add water if on the other hand the action is very slow add sufficient dilute sulphuric acid to keep up a brisk effervescence the reduction is hastened by warming and is complete when the solution is quite colourless and a drop of the liquid tested with sulphocyanate of potassium gives no reaction for ferric iron filter through glass wool or quick filtering paper the zinc should be still giving off gas rapidly indicating a freely acid solution if not acid must be added wash with water rendered acid cool and titrate with regard to the relative advantages of the different methods they may be roughly summed up as followsthe stannous chloride method has the advantage of immediately reducing the ferric iron whether in hot or cold solution and under varied conditions in regard to acidity but has the disadvantage of similarly reducing salts of copper and antimony which in a subsequent titration count as iron moreover there is no convenient method of eliminating any large excess of the reagent that may have been used and consequently it either leaves too much to the judgment of the operator or entails as much care as a titration students generally get good results by this method the sulphuretted hydrogen method also has the advantage of quick reduction under varying conditions and the further one of adding nothing objectionable to the solution in fact it removes certain impurities the disadvantages are the necessity for boiling off the excess of the gas and of filtering off the precipitated sulphur although this last is not necessary if precipitated cold the tendency with students is to get high results the sodium sulphite method has the advantages of being clean and neat and of requiring no nitration on the other hand it requires practice in obtaining the best conditions for complete reduction and as with sulphuretted hydrogen there is the necessity for boiling off the gas while there is no simple and delicate test for the residual sulphurous acid in addition if an excess of sodium sulphite has been used and enough acid not subsequently added the excess will count as iron students generally get low results by this method the advantages of the zinc method are that it is easily worked and that the excess of zinc is readily removed by simply filtering the disadvantages are the slowness68 with which the last portions of ferric iron are reduced the danger of loss by effervescence the precipitation of basic salts and perhaps of iron and the loading of the solution with salts of zinc which in the titration with bichromate have a prejudicial effect the tendency in the hands of students is to get variable results sometimes low and sometimes high generally speaking the sulphuretted hydrogen and sodium sulphite methods are to be preferred carefully worked each method will yield good results the titration may be done with a standard solution of 1 permanganate of potash or 2 bichromate of potash 1 with permanganate of potashprepare a standard solution by dissolving 282 grams of the salt and diluting to one litre the strength of this should be 100 cc 05 gram of iron but it varies slightly and should be determined and afterwards checked every two or three weeks by weighing up 02 gram of iron wire dissolving in 10 cc of dilute sulphuric acid diluting to about 100 cc and titrating the standard solution must be put in a burette with a glass stopcock as it attacks indiarubber the assay should be contained in a pint flask and be cooled before titrating the standard solution must be run in until a pinkish tinge permeates the whole solution this must be taken as the finishing point when certain interfering bodies are present this colour quickly fades but the fading must be ignored with pure solutions the colour is fairly permanent and a single drop of the potassium permanganate solution is sufficient to determine the finishing point 2 with bichromate of potashprepare a standard solution by dissolving 439 grams of the powdered and dried salt in water and diluting to 1 litre this solution is permanent its strength is determined by dissolving 02 gram of iron wire in 10 cc of dilute sulphuric acid diluting to about a quarter of a litre and titrating also prepare a test solution by dissolving 01 gram of ferricyanide of potassium in 100 cc of water this solution does not keep well and must be freshly prepared an ordinary burette is used the assay is best contained in a glazed earthenware dish and may be titrated hot or cold to determine the finishing point place a series of drops of the ferricyanide solution on a dry white glazed plate the drops should be of about the same size and be placed in lines at fairly equal distances the bichromate is run in in a steady stream the assay solution being continuously stirred until the reaction is sensibly slackened then bring a drop of the assay with the stirrer in contact with one of the test drops on the plate the standard can be safely run in 1 cc at a time so long as the test drop shows signs of a precipitate when only a coloration is produced run in cautiously a few drops at a time so long as two drops of the assay gives with the test a colour which is even faintly greener than two drops of the assay solution placed alongside the finishing point is decided and practically permanent although it demands a little practice to recognise it the titration with permanganate of potassium has the advantage of a more distinct finishing point and easier mode of working its application however is somewhat limited by the disturbing effects of hydrochloric acid the bichromate method has the advantage of a standard solution which does not alter in strength and the further one of being but little affected by altering conditions of assay hydrochloric acid has practically no effect on it both methods give accurate results and are good examples of volumetric methods the following results illustrate the extent to which the methods may be relied on and the influence which the various conditions of experiment have on the assay solutions of ferrous sulphate and of ferrous chloride were made containing 05 gram of iron in each 100 cc thus corresponding to the standard solutions of permanganate and bichromate of potassium these last were prepared in the way already described the solution of ferrous sulphate was made by dissolving 501 grams of iron wire in 100 cc of dilute sulphuric acid and diluting to 1 litre a similar solution may be made by dissolving 2482 grams of pure ferrous sulphate crystals in water adding 100 cc of dilute sulphuric acid and diluting to 1 litre rate of oxidation by exposure to airthis is an important consideration and if the rate were at all rapid would have a serious influence on the manner of working since exclusion of air in the various operations would be troublesome 20 cc of the solution of ferrous sulphate were taken in each experiment acidified with 10 cc of dilute sulphuric acid and diluted to 100 cc the solution was exposed cold in an open beaker for varying lengths of time and titrated with permanganate of potassium time exposed 1 hour 1 day 2 days 3 days cc required 192 191 190 190 these results show that the atmospheric oxidation in cold solutions is unimportant with boiling solutions the results are somewhat different a solution which at the outset required 20 cc of permanganate of potassium after boiling for an hour in an open beaker without any precautions to prevent oxidation water being added from time to time to replace that lost by evaporation required 192 cc if the solution be evaporated to dryness the oxidising power of concentrated sulphuric acid comes into play so that very little ferrous iron will be left a solution evaporated in this way required only 22 cc of permanganate of potassium effect of varying temperaturein these experiments the bulk was in each case 100 cc and 10 cc of dilute sulphuric acid were present the permanganate required by 1 cc of ferrous sulphate was at 15 10 cc and at 70 11 cc 10 97 98 100 977 968 the lower result with the 100 cc may be due to oxidation from exposure effect of varying bulkthe following experiments show that considerable variations in bulk have no practical effect in each case 20 cc of ferrous sulphate solution and 10 cc of dilute acid were used bulk of assay 30 cc 100 cc 500 cc 1000 cc permanganate required 200 200 202 205 effect of free sulphuric acidfree acid is necessary for these assays if there is an insufficiency the assay solution instead of immediately decolorising the permanganate assumes a brown colour the addition of 10 cc of dilute sulphuric acid suffices to meet requirements and keep the assay clear throughout the following experiments show that a considerable excess of acid may be used without in the least affecting the results in each case 20 cc of ferrous sulphate were used dilute sulphuric acid 10 cc 50 cc 100 cc 200 cc 500 cc 1000 cc permanganate required 193 193 193 193 193 193 effect of foreign saltswhen the assay has been reduced with zinc varying quantities of salts of this metal pass into solution the amount depending on the quantity of acid and iron present salts of sodium or ammonium may similarly be introduced it is essential to know by experiment that these salts do not exert any effect on the titration the following series of experiments show that as much as 50 grams of zinc sulphate may be present without interfering zinc sulphate present 0 gram 1 gram 10 grams 50 grams permanganate required 193 cc 193 cc 193 cc 193 cc magnesium sodium and ammonium salts are equally without effect ammonic sulphate present 0 gram 1 gram 10 grams permanganate required 193 cc 192 cc 193 cc sodic sulphate present 0 gram 1 gram 10 grams permanganate required 193 cc 193 cc 193 cc magnesic sulphate present 0 gram 1 gram 10 grams permanganate required 193 cc 193 cc 193 cc effect of varying amounts of ironit is important to know within what limits the quantity of iron in an assay may safely vary from that used in standardising in the following experiments the conditions as to bulk acidity and mode of working were the same as before ferrous sulphate solution taken 1 cc 10 cc 20 cc 50 cc 100 cc permanganate required 10 97 196 489 977 the ferrous sulphate solution is here a little weaker than that of the permanganate of potassium but the results show that the permanganate required is proportional to the iron present titrations in hydrochloric solutionsthese are less satisfactory than those in sulphuric solutions since an excess of hydrochloric acid decomposes permanganate of potassium evolving chlorine and since the finishing point is indicated not by the persistence of the pink colour of the permanganate but by a brown coloration probably due to perchloride of manganese nevertheless if the solution contains only from 5 to 10 per cent of free hydrochloric acid sp g 116 the results are the same as those obtained in a sulphuric acid solution equal weights 01 gram of the same iron wire required exactly the same quantity of the permanganate of potassium solution 20 cc whether the iron was dissolved in dilute sulphuric or dilute hydrochloric acid the following series of experiments are on the same plan as those given above with sulphuric acid solutions a solution of ferrous chloride was made by dissolving 501 grams of iron wire in 50 cc of dilute hydrochloric acid and diluting to 1 litre the dilute hydrochloric acid was made by mixing equal volumes of the acid sp g 116 and water rate of atmospheric oxidation20 cc of the ferrous chloride solution were acidified with 10 cc of the dilute hydrochloric acid and diluted to 100 cc this solution was exposed cold in open beakers time exposed 1 hour 1 day

1000 cc permanganate required 204 203 208 215 the variation due to difference in bulk here although only equal to an excess of 07 milligram of iron for each 100 cc of dilution are about three times as great as those observed in a sulphuric acid solution effect of free hydrochloric acidin these experiments 20 cc of the ferrous chloride solution were used with varying quantities of acid the bulk of the assay in each case being 100 cc dilute acid present 5 cc 10 cc 50 cc 100 cc permanganate required 202 202 205 210 the last had a very indistinct finishing point the brown coloration being very evanescent the effect of the acid is modified by the presence of alkaline and other sulphates but not by sulphuric acid repeating the last experiment we got without further addition 210 cc with 100 cc of dilute sulphuric acid 220 10 grams ammonic sulphate 205 10 sodic sulphate 200 10 magnesium sulphate 204 10 manganese sulphate 202 the results with these salts in counteracting the interference of the acid however were not a complete success since the endreactions were all indistinct with the exception perhaps of that with the manganese sulphate effect of varying amounts of ironin these experiments the bulk of the assay was 100 cc and 10 cc of acid were present ferrous chloride used 1 cc 10 cc 20 cc 50 cc 100 cc permanganate required 11 103 203 504 1001 in making himself familiar with the permanganate of potassium titration the student should practise by working out a series of experiments similar to the above varying his conditions one at a time so as to be certain of the cause of any variation in his results he may then proceed to experiment on the various methods of reduction a solution of ferric chloride is made by dissolving 501 grams of iron wire in 50 cc of hydrochloric acid sp g 116 and running from a burette nitric acid diluted with an equal volume of water into the boiling iron solution until the liquid changes from a black to a reddishyellow about 45 cc of the nitric acid will be required and the finishing point is marked by a brisk effervescence the solution of iron should be contained in an evaporating dish and boiled briskly with constant stirring there should be no excess of nitric acid boil down to about half its bulk then cool and dilute to one litre with water twenty cc of this solution diluted to 100 cc with water and acidified with 10 cc of dilute hydrochloric acid should not decolorise any of the permanganate of potassium solution this shows the absence of ferrous salts and 20 cc of the same solution boiled with 20 cc of the ferrous sulphate solution should not decrease the quantity of permanganate required for the titration of the ferrous sulphate added in a series of experiments on the various methods of reduction the following results were got the modes of working were those already described 1 with stannous chloridetwenty cc of the ferric chloride solution required after reduction with stannous chloride 20 cc of permanganate fifty cc of a solution of ferrous chloride which required on titration 498 cc of permanganate required for retitration after subsequent reduction with stannous chloride 50 cc of the permanganate solution 2 with sulphuretted hydrogentwo experiments with this gas using in each 20 cc of the ferric chloride solution and 10 cc of hydrochloric acid required after reduction 202 cc and 201 cc of permanganate repeating the experiments by passing the gas through a nearly boiling solution but in other respects working in the same way 213 cc and 216 cc of the permanganate solution were required the sulphur was not filtered off in any of these in another experiment in which 50 cc of the ferrous sulphate solution were titrated with permanganate 48 cc of the latter were required the titrated solution was next reduced with sulphuretted hydrogen brought to the same bulk as before and again titrated 479 cc of the permanganate of potassium solution were required 3 with sodium sulphitetwenty cc of the ferric chloride solution reduced with sodium sulphite required 199 cc of permanganate in one experiment 50 cc of the ferrous sulphate solution were titrated with permanganate 493 cc of the lastmentioned solution were required the titrated solution was reduced with sodium sulphite and again titrated it required 492 cc of the permanganate of potassium solution 4 with zinctwenty cc of the ferric chloride solution reduced with zinc and titrated required 208 cc of permanganate fifty cc of a solution of ferrous sulphate which required 497 cc of permanganate required for retitration after reduction with zinc 497 cc the student should next practise the titration with bichromate which is more especially valuable in the estimation of hydrochloric acid solutions the following experiments are on the same plan as those already given in each experiment except when otherwise stated there were present 20 cc of the ferrous chloride solution and 10 cc of dilute hydrochloric acid and the bulk was 300 cc effect of varying temperaturethe quantities of the bichromate of potassium solution required were as follows temperature 15 30 70 100 bichromate required 202

acid were used acid present 10 cc 50 cc 100 cc bichromate required 203 203 202 effect of foreign saltsthe effect of the addition of 10 grams of crystallized zinc sulphate was to decrease the quantity of bichromate required from 203 cc to 201 cc but the colour produced with the testdrop was very slight at 185 cc and with incautious work the finishing point might have been taken anywhere between these extremes zinc should not be used as a reducing agent preliminary to a bichromate titration ten grams of ammonic sulphate had the effect of rendering the finishing point faint for about 05 cc before the titration was finished but there was no doubt about the finishing point when allowed to stand for a minute the student should note that a titration is not completed if a colour is developed on standing for five or ten minutes ten grams of sodic sulphate had no effect 203 cc were required effect of varying ironthe results are proportional as will be seen from the following details ferrous chloride present 10 cc 100 cc 200 cc 500 cc 1000 cc bichromate required 10 102 203 510 1023 the student may now apply these titrations to actual assays of minerals the following examples will illustrate the mode of working and of calculating the results determination of iron in chalybiteweigh up 1 gram of the dry powdered ore and dissolve in 10 cc of dilute sulphuric acid and an equal volume of water with the aid of heat avoid evaporating to dryness dilute and titrate the result will give the percentage of iron existing in the ore in the ferrous state some ferric iron may be present if it is wished to determine this also add in dissolving another portion 10 cc of dilute hydrochloric acid to the sulphuric acid already ordered and reduce the resulting solution before titrating by dissolving and titrating without previous reduction one has a measure of the ferrous iron present by dissolving reducing and then titrating one can measure the total iron and as the iron exists in only two conditions the total iron less the ferrous iron is the measure of the ferric iron determination of iron in brown or red ores or magnetiteweigh up 05 gram of the ore powdered and dried at 100 c and dissolve in from 10 to 20 cc of strong hydrochloric acid boiling until all is dissolved or until no coloured particles are left dilute reduce and titrate determination of iron in pyritesweigh up 1 gram of the dry powdered ore and place in a beaker cover with 10 cc of strong sulphuric acid mix well by shaking and place on the hot plate without further handling for an hour or so until the action has ceased allow to cool and dilute to 100 cc warm until solution is complete reduce and titrate determination of iron in substances insoluble in acidsweigh up 1 gram of the ore mix with 5 or 6 grams of carbonate of soda and 05 gram of nitre by rubbing in a small mortar and transfer to a platinum crucible clean out the mortar by rubbing up another gram or so of soda and add this to the contents of the crucible as a cover fuse till tranquil cool extract with water if the ore carries much silica evaporate to dryness with hydrochloric acid to separate it redissolve in hydrochloric acid and separate the iron by precipitating with ammonia and filtering if only a small quantity of silica is present the aqueous extract of the melt must be filtered and the insoluble residue washed and dissolved in dilute hydrochloric acid reduce and titrate a convenient method of at once separating iron from a solution and reducing it is to add ammonia pass sulphuretted hydrogen through it filter and dissolve the precipitate in dilute sulphuric acid the solution when boiled free from sulphuretted hydrogen is ready for titrating stannous chloride process the colour imparted to hot hydrochloric acid solutions by a trace of a ferric compound is so strong and the reducing action of stannous chloride is so rapid that a method of titration is based upon the quantity of a standard solution of stannous chloride required to completely decolorise a solution containing ferric iron this method is more especially adapted for the assay of liquors containing much ferric iron and of those oxidised ores which are completely soluble in hydrochloric acid it must be remembered however that it only measures the ferric iron present and when as is generally the case the total iron is wanted it is well to calcine the weighed portion of ore previous to solution in order to get the whole of the iron into the higher state of oxidation since many ores which are generally supposed to contain only ferric iron carry a considerable percentage of ferrous the stannous chloride solution is made by dissolving 20 grams of the commercial salt sncl22h2o in 100 cc of water with the help of 20 cc of dilute hydrochloric acid and diluting to a litre the solution may be slightly opalescent but should show no signs of a precipitate the strength of this is about equivalent to 1 gram of iron for each 100 cc of the solution but it is apt to lessen on standing taking up oxygen from the air forming stannic chloride a larger proportion of hydrochloric acid than is ordered above would remove the opalescence but at the same time increase this tendency to atmospheric oxidation as the following experiments show the stannous chloride solution 20 cc was mixed with varying amounts of strong hydrochloric acid sp g 116 diluted to 100 cc and exposed in open beakers for varying lengths of time and the residual stannous chloride measured by titration with permanganate the quantities required were as follows time exposed 50 per cent acid 10 per cent acid 1 per cent acid 1 hour 332 cc 344 cc 345 cc 1 day 50 240 276 2 days 30 145 213 these indicate very clearly the increased susceptibility to oxidation in strongly acid solutions a standard solution of ferric chloride is prepared in the same manner as that described under the experiments on the methods of reduction but it should be of twice the strength so that 100 cc may contain 1 gram of iron this solution is used for standardising the stannous chloride when required and must be carefully prepared and tested for the presence of nitric acid the titration is more limited in its application than either of the oxidising processes because of the restrictions as to bulk quality and quantity of free acid present and other conditions of the solution to be assayed the following experiments show the conditions necessary for a successful titration effect of varying temperaturetwenty cc of ferric chloride solution with 20 cc of strong hydrochloric acid diluted to 50 cc gave the following results when titrated temperature 15 30 70 100 stannous chloride required 228 cc 220 cc 221 cc 220 cc the finishing point however is more distinct the hotter the solution so that it is best in all cases to run the standard into the boiling solution effect of varying bulksolutions containing the same quantity of iron and acid as the last but diluted to various bulks and titrated while boiling gave the following results bulk 30 cc 100 cc 500 cc stannous chloride required 215 217 243 effect of varying quantities of

somewhat modifying the mode of working another experiment like the last of this series required 216 cc effect of foreign saltsexperiments in which 10 grams of various salts were added showed them to be without effect the results were as follows salt present amcl am2so4 mgcl2 stannous chloride required 216 cc 216 cc 216 cc 216 cc salt present cacl2 fecl2 al2cl6 stannous chloride required 218 cc

proceed to the assay of an iron ore determination of iron in brown iron oreweigh up 1 gram of the dried and powdered ore calcine in the cover of a platinum crucible and dissolve up in an evaporating dish69 with 20 cc of strong hydrochloric acid when solution is complete dilute to 50 cc after replacing any acid that may have been evaporated boil and run in the stannous chloride solution until the colour is faintly yellow boil again and continue the addition of the stannous chloride solution stirring continuously until the solution appears colourless note the quantity of the stannous chloride solution required suppose this to be 59 cc take 60 cc of the standard ferric chloride solution add 20 cc of hydrochloric acid boil and titrate in the same way as before suppose this to require 61 cc then as 61 is equivalent to 60 of the iron solution 59 is equivalent to 581370 this gives the percentage it is not necessary to standardise the stannous chloride solution in this way with each sample assayed the ratio 61 60 would serve for a whole batch of samples but the standardising should be repeated at least once each day colorimetric method this method is valuable for the determination of small quantities of iron present as impurities in other metals or ores it is based on the red coloration developed by the action of potassic sulphocyanate on acid solutions of ferric salts standard ferric chloride solutiontake 1 cc of the ferric chloride solution used for standardising the stannous chloride solution add 2 cc of dilute hydrochloric acid and dilute to 1 litre with water 1 cc 001 milligram solution of potassic sulphocyanatedissolve 60 grams of the salt in water and dilute to a litre it should be colourless use 10 cc for each test the quantity of the substance to be weighed for the assay should not contain more than a milligram of iron consequently if the ore contain more than 01 per cent of that metal less than a gram of it must be taken the method is as followsweigh up 1 gram of the substance and dissolve in a suitable acid dilute and add permanganate of potash solution until tinted boil for some time and dilute to 100 cc take a couple of nessler tubes holding over 100 cc but marked at 50 cc label them 1 and 2 and into each put 10 cc of the potassic sulphocyanate solution and 2 cc of dilute hydrochloric acid the solutions should be colourless to 1 add 10 cc of the assay solution and dilute to the 50 cc mark to the other add water but only to within 5 or 10 cc of this mark now run in the standard ferric chloride solution from a small burette 1 cc at a time stirring after each addition till the colour is nearly equal to that of the assay no 1 at this stage bring the solution to the same level by diluting and make a further addition of the standard ferric chloride solution till the colours correspond the amount of iron will be the same in each tube that in the standard may be known by reading off the volume from the burette and multiplying by 001 milligram if the 10 cc of the assay solution gave a colour requiring more than 5 or 6 cc of the standard ferric chloride solution repeat the determination taking a smaller proportion the effect of varying conditions on the assay will be seen from the following experiments effect of varying temperaturethe effect of increase of temperature is to lessen the colour in fact by boiling the colour can be entirely removed all assays are best carried out in the cold 1 cc at 15 would only show the colour of 075 cc at 45 2 175 5 40 effect of timethe effect of increase of time is to increase the colour as will be seen from the following experiments 2 cc on standing 10 minutes became equal to 225 cc 2 20 275 2 40 300 effect of free acidif no acid at all be present the sulphocyanate of potassium solution removes the colour it first produces so that a certain amount of acid is necessary to develop the colour the use of a large excess has a tendency to increase the colour produced 5 cc nitric acid sp g 14 read 37 cc instead of 2 cc with the dilute acid 5 cc sulphuric acid sp g 132 read 22 cc instead of 2 cc with the dilute acid 5 cc hydrochloric acid sp g 116 read 25 cc instead of 2 cc with the dilute acid effect of foreign metalslead mercury cadmium bismuth arsenic tin antimony nickel cobalt manganese aluminium zinc strontium barium calcium magnesium sodium or potassium when separately present in quantities of from 100 to 200 times the weight of iron present do not interfere if they have previously been brought to their highest oxidised condition by boiling with nitric acid or by treating with permanganate arsenic and phosphoric acids interfere unless an excess of free hydrochloric or other acid is present oxalic acid but not tartaric acid in minute quantities destroys the colour nitrous acid strikes a red colour with the sulphocyanate of potassium consequently when nitric acid has been used in excess high results may be obtained copper and some other metals interfere so that in most cases it is advisable to concentrate the iron before estimating it a blank experiment should always be made with the reagents used in order to determine the iron if any introduced during the solution c of the substance assayed determination of iron in metallic copperthis may be most conveniently done during the estimation of the arsenic the small quantity of white flocculent precipitate which may be observed in the acetic acid solution before titrating contains the whole of the iron as ferric arsenate it should be filtered off dissolved in 10 cc of dilute hydrochloric acid and diluted to 100 cc 10 cc of this may be taken for the estimation for example 10 grams of copper were taken and the iron estimated 30 cc of standard ferric chloride solution were used equivalent to 003 milligram of iron this multiplied by 10 because only 110th of the sample was taken gives 03 milligram as the iron in 10 grams of copper this equals 0003 per cent in a series of experiments with this method working on 10gram lots of copper to which known quantities of iron had been added the following were the results iron present 0015 0070 0100 0495 iron found 0015 0061 0087 0522 when no arsenic is present in the copper the iron can be separated by fractionally precipitating with sodic carbonate dissolving in ammonia and filtering off the ferric hydrate coppers generally carry more iron the less arsenic they contain determination of iron in metallic zincdissolve 1 gram of zinc in 10 cc of dilute hydrochloric acid adding a drop or two of nitric acid towards the end to effect complete solution boil dilute and tint with the permanganate of potassium solution boil till colourless and dilute to 100 cc take 10 cc for the determination make a blank experiment by boiling 10 cc of dilute hydrochloric acid with a drop or two of nitric acid add a similar quantity of the permanganate of potassium solution boiling c as before the quantity of iron in zinc varies from less than 0005 to more than 20 per cent when 1 gram is taken and worked as above each cc of ferric chloride solution required indicates 001 per cent of iron determination of iron in metallic tincover 1 gram of tin with 5 cc of hydrochloric acid add 1 cc of nitric acid and evaporate to dryness take up with 2 cc of dilute hydrochloric acid add 10 cc of the potassic sulphocyanate solution and make up to 50 cc probably the colour developed will be brown instead of red owing to the presence of copper in this case add to the standard as much copper as the assay is known to contain which must have previously been determined see copper the titration is then carried out in the usual way or the iron may be separated from the copper in the tin by the following processdissolve 5 grams of metal in 30 cc of hydrochloric acid and 5 cc of nitric acid and evaporate to dryness take up with 5 cc of dilute hydrochloric acid add 10 grams of potash dissolved in 30 cc of water and warm till the tin is dissolved pass sulphuretted hydrogen boil cool and filter the iron and copper will be in the precipitate they are separated in the ordinary manner practical exercises 1 calculate from the following determinations the percentages of ferrous ferric and total iron in the sample of ore used 1 gram of ore dissolved and titrated required 267 cc of bichromate of potassium solution 1 gram of ore dissolved reduced and titrated required 435 cc of bichromate of potassium solution standard 1014 2 one gram of an ore contained 0307 gram of ferrous iron and 0655 gram of total iron the iron existing as oxide what are the percentages of ferrous oxide feo and ferric oxide fe2o3 in the ore 3 one gram of brown iron ore dissolved in hydrochloric acid required 592 cc of stannous chloride standard 0930 another gram dissolved in acid and titrated with permanganate required 82 cc standard 04951 calculate the percentages of ferrous ferric and total iron 4 another gram of the same ore roasted dissolved and titrated with stannous chloride required 635 cc to what extent does this result confirm the others 5 two grams of a metal were dissolved and diluted to 100 cc five cc were taken for a colorimetric determination and required 45 cc of the standard ferric chloride solution what is the percentage of iron in the metal nickel nickel and cobalt are closely related in their chemical properties and may best be considered together nickel is the commoner of the two and is met with in commerce alloyed with copper and zinc as german silver as also in the coinage of the united states and on the continent it is used for plating polished iron and steel goods forming a coating little liable to rust and taking a good polish the ores of nickel are not very common kupfernickel and chloanthite are arsenides of nickel with generally more or less iron and cobalt noumeite and garnierite are hydrated silicates of nickel and magnesia the chief sources of nickel are these silicates which are found in large quantity in new caledonia and a pyrites found in norway containing three or four per cent of the metal in smaller quantities it is more widely distributed being frequently met with in copper ores consequently commercial copper is rarely free from it nickel is readily soluble in moderately concentrated nitric acid its salts are mostly green and soluble in excess of ammonia forming blue solutions in these respects it resembles copper the acid solutions however are not precipitated by sulphuretted hydrogen although in alkaline solutions a black sulphide is formed which is insoluble in dilute hydrochloric acid if the sulphide is formed in a solution containing much free ammonia the precipitation is incomplete some sulphide remaining in the solution and colouring it dark brown these reactions serve to distinguish and separate nickel from other metals except cobalt if the separated sulphide be heated in a borax bead the colour obtained will be a sherry brown in the outer flame and grey or colourless in the inner flame if nickel only is present in the presence of cobalt these colours are masked by the intense and characteristic blue yielded in both flames by that metal dry assay the dry assay of nickel cobalt being at the same time determined is based on the formation of a speise which will carry the cobalt nickel copper and some of the iron of the ore in combination with arsenic a speise of this kind fused and exposed at a red heat to air first loses arsenide of iron by oxidation it is only when the iron has been oxidised that the arsenide of cobalt begins to be attacked and when the removal of the cobalt is complete the nickel commences to pass into the slag the copper being left till last the changes are rendered evident by fusion in contact with borax the process is as followsweigh up 5 grams of the ore and calcine thoroughly on a roasting dish in the muffle rub up with some anthracite and reroast mix intimately with from 3 to 5 grams of metallic arsenic and heat in a small covered clay crucible at dull redness in a muffle until no more fumes of arsenic come off about 15 minutes take out the crucible and inject a mixture of 20 grams of carbonate of soda 5 grams of flour and 2 grams of fused borax place in the wind furnace and raise the temperature gradually until the charge is in a state of tranquil fusion pour when cold detach the button of speise and weigh weigh out carefully a portion of about 1 gram of it place a shallow clay dish in the muffle and heat it to bright redness then add about 15 gram of borax glass wrapped in a piece of tissue paper when this has fused drop the piece of speise into it close the muffle until the speise has melted which should be almost at once the arsenide of iron will oxidise first and when this has ceased the surface of the button brightens remove it from the muffle and quench in water as soon as the button has solidified the borax should be coloured slightly blue weigh the loss is the arsenide of iron repeat the operation with the weighed button on another dish using rather less borax continue the scorification until a film green when cold floating on the surface of the button shows that the nickel is beginning to oxidise cool separate and weigh the button as before the loss is the arsenide of cobalt if copper is absent the speise is now arsenide of nickel the weight of nickel corresponding to the arsenide got is calculated by multiplying by 0607 and similarly the weight of the cobalt is ascertained by multiplying the loss in the last scorification by 061571 it must be remembered that the nickel and cobalt so obtained are derived from a fraction only of the speise yielded by the ore taken so that the results must be multiplied by the weight of the whole of the speise and divided by the weight of the fragment used in the determination as an example suppose 5 grams of ore gave 33 grams of speise and 11 gram of this gave 08 gram of nickel arsenide then 080607 04856 gram of nickel 048563311 1456 gram of nickel and this being obtained from 5 grams of ore is equivalent to 2912 per cent when copper is also present weigh up accurately about 05 gram of gold and place it on the scorifier with the button of nickel and copper arsenide using borax as before scorify until the button shows the bluishgreen colour of a fused goldcopper alloy then cool and weigh the button of copper and gold the increase in weight of the gold button gives the copper as metal the weight of the copper multiplied by 1395 is the weight of the copper arsenide cu3as present the difference will be the nickel arsenide the student should enter the weighings in his book as follows ore taken grams speise got speise taken grams arsenides of cobalt nickel and copper nickel and copper gold added gold and copper got showing cobalt per cent nickel copper wet methods solution and separationtwo or three grams of a rich ore or 5 to 10 grams if poor are taken for the assay if much arsenic is present as is usually the case the ore must be calcined before attacking with acids transfer to a flask and boil first with hydrochloric acid until the oxides are dissolved and then with the help of nitric acid until nothing metalliferous is left dilute nearly neutralise with soda and separate the iron as basic acetate72 as described in page 233 through the filtrate pass sulphuretted hydrogen till saturated allow to settle best overnight filter and wash transfer the precipitate to a beaker and dissolve in nitric acid dilute with water pass sulphuretted hydrogen and filter off the precipitate if any boil off the gas add ammonia until a precipitate is formed and then acidify somewhat strongly with acetic acid pass sulphuretted hydrogen in a slow stream until any white precipitate of zinc sulphide there may be begins to darken filter to the filtrate add ammonia and pass sulphuretted hydrogen the precipitate will contain the nickel and cobalt as sulphides where small quantities of nickel and cobalt are present and an approximate determination is sufficient they can be concentrated as followsremove the copper c by passing sulphuretted hydrogen through the acid solution and filtering add ammonia to the filtrate and again pass sulphuretted hydrogen then heat nearly to boiling and filter dissolve the precipitate off the filter with dilute hydrochloric acid the residue will contain nearly all the nickel and cobalt as sulphides separation of nickel and cobaltdissolve the sulphides separated as above in nitric acid render alkaline with a solution of potash then acidify with acetic acid add a concentrated solution of nitrite of potash the liquid after this addition must have an acid reaction allow to stand for 24 hours in a warm place filter off the yellow precipitate of nitrite of potash and cobalt and wash with a 10 per cent solution of acetate of potash the cobalt is determined in the precipitate in the way described under cobalt the nickel is separated from the solution by boiling with sodic hydrate filtering and dissolving the precipitate in nitric acid the solution will contain the nickel gravimetric determination the solution which contains the nickel free from other metals is heated and a solution of sodic hydrate added in slight excess the precipitate is filtered off washed with boiling water dried ignited at a red heat and weighed when cold the ignited substance is nickel oxide nio and contains 7867 per cent of nickel the oxide is a green powder readily and completely soluble in hydrochloric acid and without action on litmus paper it is very easily reduced by ignition in hydrogen to metallic nickel illustration fig 56 nickel is also determined by electrolysis as followsthe nitric acid solution is rendered strongly ammoniacal and placed under the electrolytic apparatus used for the copper assay three cells fig 56 however must be used coupled up for intensity that is with the zinc of one connected with the copper of the next the electrolysis is allowed to go on overnight and in the morning the nickel will be deposited as a bright and coherent film a portion of the solution is drawn off with a pipette if it smells of ammonia has no blue colour and gives no precipitate with ammonic sulphide the separation is complete wash the cylinder containing the deposited metal first with water and then with alcohol as in the copper assay dry in the water oven and weigh the increase in weight is metallic nickel as an examplethere was taken 1 gram of a nickel alloy used for coinage it was dissolved in 10 cc of nitric acid and diluted to 100 cc with water the copper was then precipitated by electrolysis it weighed 0734 gram the solution after electrolysis was treated with sulphuretted hydrogen and the remaining copper was thrown down as sulphide and estimated colorimetrically this amounted to 312 milligrams the filtrate was evaporated treated with ammonia warmed and filtered the ferric hydrate was dissolved in dilute acid and reprecipitated dried ignited and weighed its weight was 00310 gram the two filtrates were mixed and reduced in bulk to about 50 cc a considerable excess of ammonia was added and the nickel precipitated by electrolysis it weighed 02434 gram these quantities are equivalent to copper 7375 per cent nickel 2434 iron 217 10026 volumetric determination an alkaline solution of potassium cyanide to which a little potassium iodide has been added can be assayed for its strength in cyanide by titrating with a standard solution of silver nitrate nickel interferes with this assay doing the work of its equivalent of silver and the quantity of nickel present can be calculated from the amount of its interference in the titration a volumetric assay for nickel is based on this it has the disadvantage of all indirect titrations in that it requires two standard solutions on the other hand it gives good results even under unfavourable conditions and is applicable in the presence of much zinc small quantities of cobalt will count as so much nickel but larger quantities make the assay unworkable some of the other metalslead for examplehave no appreciable effect but practically the solution demands a preliminary treatment which would result in their removal nevertheless it is a very satisfactory method and makes the determination of nickel quick and comparatively easy in most cases the standard solution of silver nitrate is made by dissolving 1448 grams of recrystallised silver nitrate in distilled water and diluting to 1 litre 100 cc of this solution are equivalent to 025 gram of nickel73 the standard solution of potassium cyanide should be made so as to be exactly equal to the silver nitrate solution this can be done as follows weigh up 12 grams of good potassium cyanide 95 per cent dissolve in water add 50 cc of a 10 per cent solution of sodium hydrate and dilute to 1 litre fill one burette with this and another with the solution of silver nitrate run 50 cc of the cyanide into a flask add a few drops of potassium iodide solution and titrate with the standard silver nitrate until there is a distinct permanent yellowish turbidity the titration is more fully described under cyanide p 165 the cyanide solution will be found rather stronger than the silver nitrate dilute it so as to get the two solutions of equal value for example 513 cc of silver nitrate may have been required then add 13 cc of water to each 50 cc of the cyanide solution remaining if the full 950 cc are available then add to them 247 cc of water after mixing take another 50 cc and titrate with the silver nitrate the two solutions should now be exactly equal the cyanide solution being strongly alkaline with soda keeps very well but its strength should be checked from time to time by titrating with silver nitrate should there be any slight inequality in the strengths of the two solutions it is easily allowed for in the calculations the titrationthe solution containing not much more than 01 gram of nickel and free from the interfering metals must be cooled it is next neutralised and then made strongly alkaline with a solution of soda naho an excess of 20 or 30 cc suffices this will produce a precipitate the cyanide solution is now run in from a burette until the solution clears after which an excess of about 20 cc is added it is well to use some round number of cc to simplify the calculation add a few drops of potassium iodide solution and run in the standard solution of silver nitrate from a burette this should be done a little at a time though somewhat rapidly and with constant shaking till a permanent yellow precipitate appears if the addition of the cyanide did not result in a perfectly clear solution this is because something besides nickel is present the residue may be filtered off though with a little practice the finishingpoint may be detected with certainty in the presence of a small precipitate if the student has the slightest doubt about a finish he should run in another 5 cc of the cyanide and again finish with silver nitrate the second result will be the same as the first for example if 40 cc of cyanide and 30 cc of silver nitrate were required at the first titration then the 45 cc of cyanide in the second titration will require 35 cc of silver nitrate the difference between the quantities of the two solutions used in each case will be 10 cc it is this difference in the readings of the two burettes which measures the quantity of nickel present each cc of the difference is equal to 0025 gram of nickel but if the cyanide solution is not exactly equal in strength to the silver nitrate the quantity of cyanide used should be calculated to its equivalent in silver nitrate before making the subtraction the following experimental results illustrate the accuracy of the assay and the effect upon it of varying conditions a solution containing 1 gram of nickel sulphate niso46h2o in 100 cc was used by a separate assay the sulphate was found to contain 2225 per cent of nickel for the sake of simplicity the results of the experiments are stated in weights of nickel in grams effect of varying excess of cyanide solutionin each experiment there was 20 cc of the nickel solution equal to 0445 gram of nickel there were also 10 cc of soda solution 3 or 4 drops of potassium iodide and sufficient water to bring the bulk to 100 cc before titrating cyanide in excess 6 cc 4 cc 8 cc 12 cc 25 cc nickel found 0434 0436 0440 0442 0444 although the difference between the highest and lowest of these results is only 1 milligram their meaning is quite obvious the excess of cyanide should not be less than 20 cc effect of varying the quantity of sodathere were two series of experiments one with 2 cc of nickel solution 0044 gram of nickel the other with 20 cc the conditions were as before except that the quantity of soda was varied soda added 5 cc 15 cc 30 cc nickel found 1st series 0037 0042 0045 2nd series 0444 0444 0442 these show that the presence of much soda though it has only a small effect is beneficial rather than otherwise ammonia has a bad effect if present in anything like the same quantities effect of varying the nickelin experiments with 10 20 and 40 cc of the nickel solution the results were nickel present 0222 0445 0890 nickel found 0220 0442 0884 effect of zincin these experiments 20 cc of nickel solution 0445 gram of nickel 10 cc of soda 6 drops of potassium iodide and water to 100 cc were used the excess of cyanide was purposely kept at from 10 to 15 cc which is hardly sufficient zinc added 0 25 gram 5 gram nickel found 0442 0440 0407 on increasing the excess of cyanide to over 20 cc and doubling the quantity of soda the experiment with 05 gram of zinc gave 0441 gram of nickel hence the titration is satisfactory in the presence of zinc provided that not fewer than 20 or 30 cc of soda are used and that the excess of cyanide is such that not fewer than 20 or 30 cc of silver nitrate are required in the titration moreover these precautions should be taken whether zinc is present or not effect of other metalsif metals of the first and second groups are present they should be removed by passing sulphuretted hydrogen and filtering if iron is present it must be removed since ferrous salts use up much cyanide forming ferrocyanides and ferric salts yield ferric hydrate which obscures the end reaction hence the sulphuretted hydrogen must be boiled off and the iron removed as basic ferric acetate by the method described on p 233 if the precipitate is bulky it should be dissolved in a little dilute acid neutralised and again precipitated as basic acetate the nickel will be in the two filtrates in the absence of manganese and cobalt the titration may be made without further separation manganese does not directly interfere but the precipitated hydrate which rapidly darkens through atmospheric oxidation obscures the end reaction it may be removed by passing sulphuretted hydrogen through the filtrate from the acetate separation sulphides of nickel cobalt and zinc will be precipitated whilst manganese remains in solution the addition of more sodium acetate may assist the precipitation the precipitate must be filtered off and dissolved in nitric acid the solution should be evaporated to dryness the filtrate may retain a little nickel if so add ammonia till alkaline then acidify with acetic acid and again filter any small precipitate obtained here should be added to that first obtained it is only when cobalt is present that any further separation is required cobalt hydrate takes up oxygen from the air and on adding potassium cyanide some may refuse to dissolve and the solution itself acquires a brown colour which becomes deeper on standing at this stage the cobalt is easily separated the solution containing the nickel and cobalt with no great excess of acid is made alkaline by adding 20 cc of soda exactly as in preparing for a titration so too the solution of cyanide is added so as to have an excess of 20 or 30 cc the solution may have a brown colour but if it is not quite clear it must be filtered then warm boiling is not needed and add from 50 to 100 cc of bromine water this throws down all the nickel as black peroxide in a condition easy to filter filter it off and wash with water the precipitate can be dissolved off the filter with the greatest ease by a little warm sulphurous acid the filtrate and washings boiled till free from sulphurous acid yield the nickel as sulphate in a clean condition determination of nickel in nickel sulphate crystalstake 05 gram of the salt dissolve in 50 cc of water and add 25 cc of solution of soda run in from a burette say 60 cc cyanide add a few drops of potassium iodide and titrate back with silver nitrate suppose 155 cc of the latter is required then 155 cc subtracted from 60 cc leaves 445 cc and since 100 cc 025 gram of nickel 445 cc will equal 011125 gram of nickel this in 05 gram of the salt equals 2225 per cent determination of nickel in german silverweigh up 05 gram of the alloy and dissolve in a dish with 5 or 10 cc of dilute nitric acid add 5 cc of dilute sulphuric acid and evaporate till all the nitric acid is removed cool take up with 50 cc of water and when dissolved pass sulphuretted hydrogen through the solution filter off the precipitate and wash with water containing sulphuretted hydrogen and dilute sulphuric acid boil down the filtrate and washings to get rid of the excess of the gas add some nitric acid and continue the boiling cool neutralise the excess of acid with soda add 1 gram of sodium acetate and boil filter off the precipitate which contains the iron the filtrate cooled and rendered alkaline with soda is ready for the titration cobalt occurs less abundantly than nickel its chief ores are smaltite and cobaltite which are arsenides of cobalt with more or less iron nickel and copper it also occurs as arseniate in erythrine and as oxide in asbolan or earthy cobalt which is essentially a wad carrying cobalt it is mainly used in the manufacture of smalts for imparting a blue colour to glass and enamels the oxide of cobalt forms coloured compounds with many other metallic oxides with oxide of zinc it forms rinmans green with aluminia a blue with magnesia a pink this property is taken advantage of in the detection of substances before the blowpipe the compounds of cobalt in most of their properties closely resemble those of nickel and the remarks as to solution and separation given for the latter metal apply here solutions of cobalt are pink whilst those of nickel are green the detection of cobalt even in very small quantity is rendered easy by the strong blue colour which it gives to the borax bead both in the oxidising and in the reducing flame it is concentrated from the ore in the same way as nickel and should be separated from that metal by means of potassic nitrite in the way described the dry assay of cobalt has been given under nickel gravimetric method the yellow precipitate from the potassium nitrite after being washed with the acetate of potash is washed with alcohol dried transferred to a weighed porcelain crucible and cautiously ignited with an excess of strong sulphuric acid the heat must not be sufficient to decompose the sulphate of cobalt which decomposition is indicated by a blackening of the substance at the edges the salt bears a low red heat without breaking up if blackening has occurred moisten with sulphuric acid and ignite again cool and weigh the substance is a mixture of the sulphates of cobalt and potash 2coso4 3k2so4 and contains 1417 per cent of cobalt cobalt is also gravimetrically determined like nickel by electrolysis or by precipitation with sodic hydrate in the latter case the ignited oxide will be somewhat uncertain in composition owing to its containing an excess of oxygen consequently it is better to reduce it by igniting at a red heat in a current of hydrogen and to weigh it as metallic cobalt practical exercises 1 in the dry assay of an ore containing cobalt nickel and copper the following results were obtained calculate the percentages ore taken 5 grams speise formed 099 gram speise taken 099 gram arsenides of cobalt nickel and copper got 075 gram arsenide of nickel and copper got 054 gram gold

mixed sulphates of potash and cobalt will be obtained in a gravimetric determination on 1 gram of the ore 4 03157 gram of metal was deposited by the electrolysis of a nickel and cobalt solution on dissolving in nitric acid and determining the cobalt 02563 gram of potassium and cobalt sulphates were got find the weights of cobalt and nickel present in the deposit 5 what should be the percentage composition of pure cobaltite its formula being coass zinc zinc occurs in nature most commonly as sulphide blende it also occurs as carbonate calamine and silicate smithsonite each of these is sufficiently abundant to be a source of the metal the metal is known in commerce as spelter when in ingots and as sheet zinc when rolled it is chiefly used in the form of alloys with copper which are known as brasses it is also used in the form of a thin film to protect iron goods from rustinggalvanised iron ores of zinc more especially blende are met with in most lead copper gold and silver mines in larger or small quantities scattered through the lodes those ores which generally come under the notice of the assayer are fairly rich in zinc but alloys and metallurgical products contain it in very varying proportions zinc itself is readily soluble in dilute acids any residue which is left after boiling with dilute hydrochloric or sulphuric acid consists simply of the impurities of the metal this is generally lead all zinc compounds are either soluble in or are decomposed by boiling with acids the zinc going into solution zinc forms only one series of salts and these are colourless their chief characteristic is solubility in an alkaline solution from which sulphuretted hydrogen produces a white precipitate of zinc sulphide zinc is detected by dissolving the substance in hydrochloric or nitric acid boiling and adding sodic hydrate in excess filtering and adding ammonic sulphide to the filtrate the precipitate contains the zinc which can be dissolved out by boiling with dilute sulphuric acid and detected by the formation of a white precipitate on the addition of potassic ferrocyanide the dry assay of zinc can only be made indirectly and is unsatisfactory zinc is volatile and at the temperature of its reduction is a gas it is impracticable to condense the vapour so as to weigh the metal consequently its amount is determined by loss the following method gives approximate results take 10 grams of the dried and powdered ore and roast first at a low temperature and afterwards at a higher one with the help of carbonate of ammonia to decompose the sulphates formed cool and weigh the metals will be present as oxides mix with 2 grams of powdered charcoal and charge into a blacklead crucible heated to whiteness cover loosely and leave in the furnace for about a quarter of an hour uncover and calcine the residue cool and weigh the loss in weight multiplied by 803 gives the percentage of zinc in the ore wet methods solution and separation may be effected as follows treat 1 or 3 grams of the substance with 10 or 30 cc of hydrochloric acid or aqua regia evaporate to dryness take up with 10 cc of hydrochloric acid and dilute to 100 cc heat nearly to boiling saturate with sulphuretted hydrogen filter and wash with water acidulated with hydrochloric acid boil off the sulphuretted hydrogen and peroxidise with a few drops of nitric acid cool add caustic soda till nearly but not quite neutralised and separate the iron as basic acetate by the method described under iron to the filtrate add ammonia till alkaline and pass sulphuretted hydrogen allow to settle and decant on to a filter dissolve off the precipitate from the filter with hot dilute hydrochloric acid the solution will contain the zinc together with any manganese the ore contained and perhaps traces of nickel and cobalt if the zinc is to be determined volumetrically and manganese is present this latter is separated with carbonate of ammonia as described further on but if a gravimetric method is used and only small quantities of manganese are present it is better to proceed as if it were absent and to subsequently determine its amount which should be deducted gravimetric determination the solution containing the zinc is contained in an evaporating dish and freed from sulphuretted hydrogen by boiling and if necessary from an excess of acid by evaporation the evaporating dish must be a large one cautiously add sodium carbonate to the hot moderately dilute solution until the liquid is distinctly alkaline and boil allow the precipitate to settle decant on to a filter and wash with hot water dry transfer to a porcelain crucible cleaning the paper as much as possible add the ash ignite and weigh the substance weighed is oxide of zinc which contains 8026 per cent of the metal it is a white powder becoming yellow when heated it must not show an alkaline reaction when moistened if it contains manganese this metal will be present as sesquioxide mn2o3 its amount can be determined by dissolving in dilute acid and boiling with an excess of sodic hydrate the oxide of manganese will be precipitated and can be ignited and weighed its weight multiplied by 1035 must be deducted from the weight of oxide of zinc previously obtained the results yielded by the gravimetric determination are likely to be high since the basic carbonate of zinc frequently carries down with it more or less soda which is difficult to wash off volumetric determination this method is based on the facts that zinc salts in an acid solution decompose potassium ferrocyanide forming a white insoluble zinc compound and that an excess of the ferrocyanide can be detected by the brown coloration it strikes with uranium acetate the method resembles in its working the bichromate iron assay the standard solution of potassium ferrocyanide is run into a hot hydrochloric acid solution of the zinc until a drop of the latter brought in contact with a drop of the indicator uranium acetate on a white plate strikes a brown colour the quantity of zinc in the solution must be approximately known run in a little less of the ferrocyanide than is expected will be necessary test a drop or two of the assay and then run in one or two cc at a time until the brown colour is obtained add 5 cc of a standard zinc solution equivalent in strength to the standard ferrocyanide retitrate and finish off cautiously of course 5 cc must be deducted from the reading on the burette the precipitate of zinc ferrocyanide formed in the assay solution is white but if traces of iron are present it becomes bluish if the quantity of ferrocyanide required is known within a few cc the finishing point is exactly determined in the first titration without any addition of the standard zinc solution unfortunately this titration serves simply to replace the gravimetric determination and does not as many volumetric processes do lessen the necessity for a complete separation of any other metals which are present most metals give precipitates with ferrocyanide of potassium in acid solutions if the conditions are held to the titration is a fairly good one and differences in the results of an assay will be due to error in the separation ferric hydrate precipitated in a fairly strong solution of zinc will carry with it perceptible quantities of that metal similarly large quantities of copper precipitated as sulphide by means of sulphuretted hydrogen will carry zinc with it except under certain nicely drawn conditions when much copper is present it is best separated in a nitric acid solution by electrolysis the titration of the zinc takes less time and with ordinary working is more trustworthy than the gravimetric method the standard ferrocyanide solution is made by dissolving 432 grams of potassium ferrocyanide k4fecy63h2o in water and diluting to a litre one hundred cc are equal to 1 gram of zinc the standard zinc solution is made by dissolving 10 grams of pure zinc in 50 cc of hydrochloric acid and 100 or 200 cc of water and diluting to 1 litre or by dissolving 4415 grams of zinc sulphate znso47h2o in water with 30 cc of hydrochloric acid and diluting to 1 litre one hundred cc will contain 1 gram of zinc the uranium acetate solution is made by dissolving 02 gram of the salt in 100 cc of water to standardise the ferrocyanide measure off 50 cc of the standard zinc solution into a 10 oz beaker dilute to 100 cc and heat to about 50 c not to boiling run in 47 or 48 cc of the ferrocyanide solution from an ordinary burette and finish off cautiously fifty divided by the quantity of ferrocyanide solution required gives the standard in assaying ores c take such quantity as shall contain from 01 to 1 gram of zinc

paste add 5 cc of dilute hydrochloric acid dilute to 100 cc or 150 cc heat to about 50 c and titrate manganese if present counts as so much zinc and must be specially separated since it is not removed

method metallic zinc is readily soluble in dilute hydrochloric or sulphuric acid hydrogen being at the same time evolved74 the volume of the hydrogen evolved is obviously a measure of the amount of zinc present in the metallic state the speed with which the reaction goes on even in the cold and the insolubility of hydrogen renders this method of assay a convenient one it is especially applicable to the determination of the proportion of zinc in zinc dust the apparatus described in the chapter on gasometric method is used the method of working is as follows fill the two burettes with cold water to a little above the zero mark place in the bottle about 025 gram of the substance to be determined and in the inner phial or test tube 5 cc of dilute sulphuric acid cork the apparatus tightly and allow to stand for a few minutes then bring the water to the same level in the two burettes by running out through the clip at the bottom read off the level of the liquid in the graduated burette turn the bottle over sufficiently to spill the acid over the zinc and then run water out of the apparatus so as to keep the liquid in the two burettes at the same level taking care not to run it out more quickly than the hydrogen is being generated when the volume of gas ceases to increase read off the level of the liquid deduct the reading which was started with the difference gives the volume of hydrogen evolved at the same time read off the volume of air in the volume corrector which must be fixed alongside the gas burettes make the correction for example a piece of zinc weighing 02835 gram was found to give 999 cc of gas at a time when the corrector read 104 cc75 then the corrected volume is 104 100 999 x x 960 cc 100 cc of hydrogen at 0 c and 760 mm is equivalent to 02912 gram of zinc therefore the quantity of zinc found is 100 96 02912 x x 02795 gram of zinc this being contained in 02835 gram of metal is equivalent to 985 per cent as an example of a determination in which reducing the volume of liberated hydrogen to 0 c and 760 mm is avoided the following may be taken 02315 gram of pure zinc gave 821 cc of gas and the volume of air in the corrector was 1036 cc 02835 gram of the assay gave 999 cc of gas and the volume of air in the corrector was 1040 cc 104 1036 999 x x 995 cc this is the volume of gas got in the assay if measured under the same conditions as the standard 821 995 02315 x x 02806 then 02835 02806 100 x x 989 per cent as these assays can be made quickly it is well for the sake of greater accuracy to make them in duplicate and to take the mean of the readings one set of standardisings will do for any number of assays the student must carefully avoid unnecessary handling of the bottle in which the zinc is dissolved colorimetric methodzinc salts

whole of the tin of commerce is derived tin also occurs as sulphide combined with sulphides of copper and iron in the mineral stannine or bellmetal ore it is a constituent of certain rare minerals such as tantalite the methods of assaying tin in actual use are remarkable when compared with those of other metals the more strictly chemical methods are rendered troublesome by the oxide being insoluble in acids resembling in this respect the gangue with which it is associated moreover it is not readily decomposed by fusion with alkalies the oxide has first to be reduced to metal before the tin can be dissolved the reduction may be performed by fusing with potassic cyanide by heating to moderate redness in a current of hydrogen or coal gas or by heating to a higher temperature with carbon the reduced metal is only slowly dissolved by hydrochloric acid and although it is readily soluble in aqua regia the solution cannot be evaporated or freed from the excess of acids by boiling without loss of tin because of the volatility of stannic chloride there has long been a difficulty in getting a quick wet method the process of assaying tin ores adopted in the mines of cornwall is a mechanical one known as vanning the object of which is to find the percentage of black tin which it is well to remember is not pure cassiterite much less pure oxide of tin tin ore as taken from the lode contains from 2 to 5 per cent of cassiterite and is mainly made up of quartz felspar chlorite schorl and other stony minerals together with more or less mispickel iron and copper pyrites oxide of iron and wolfram the cassiterite has a specific gravity 64 to 71 considerably higher than that of the veinstuff 25 to 30 and is concentrated by a series of washings till it is free from the lighter material those minerals which have a specific gravity approaching that of the cassiterite are not completely removed the mispickel and copper and iron pyrites are converted into oxides by roasting and are in great part removed by a subsequent washing the concentrated product is known as black tin and in this condition is sold to the smelter the chief foreign matters in the black tin are silica oxides of iron and copper and wolfram with traces of manganese and niobic acid and in certain stream ores there may be as much as 6 or 7 per cent of titaniferous iron the black tin from the mines contains from 5 to 12 per cent of water and is sold and assayed wet a series of typical samples of black tin ranged as follows source of material percentage of metal specific gravity in dry ore good mine ore 720 639 inferior do 715 664 titaniferous stream ore 670 639 mine ore with wolfram 645 667 ore from stream works 585 599 it will be seen from these figures that black tin is a very variable substance and that the specific gravity is largely influenced by the impurities hence it is only an indication of the percentage of metal when the same kind of ore is dealt with as already pointed out the object of vanning is to determine the proportion of black tin in the lode stuff the relation between the actual content in oxide of tin and the produce got by vanning has been tested on several occasions with results which show a fair degree of approximation the following are some published results of assays of the same batch of ore the vanning results were obtained by a cornish vanner of recognised ability and the wet assays by two london firms of the highest standing vanning results average 91 lbs of black tin wet assay results a 837 lbs of stannic oxide b 797 lbs the vanner reported his black tin as containing 70 per cent of tin this will bring his result if calculated as stannic oxide to 809 lbs to the ton which agrees with the others according to our experience the van assay agrees fairly well with the wet one if the black tin is assumed to contain 925 per cent of stannic oxide sno2 vanners are as a rule skilful men and show remarkable dexterity in separating the black tin with the help of their apparatus which consists simply of a shovel and a kieve of water an account of the process is given below but different vanners all good men will get different results working on material new to them the black tin weighed by the vanner is supposed to correspond in quality with the black tin returned from the floors of the mine for which he is assaying but this differs materially in different mines with the nature of the gangue the process leaves too much to the judgment of the vanner it is more than probable that in practice the returns from the dressingfloors check the assayer instead of as should properly be the case the assayer checking the returns it is only when this last is done that any control is had over the system of dressing a correct assay of this ore is a matter of some importance because of the high price of the metal the method of assaying the black tin is a dry one and consists of mixing it with culm and submitting it in a blacklead crucible to the highest temperature of a wind furnace the sample is taken wet as it arrives at the smelting house and is assayed direct the product of the assay is examined and a deduction of a considerable percentage is very properly made for impurities since the assay really determines the percentage not merely of tin but of the bodies present which are reducible at a white heat the judgment as to how much is to be deducted is assisted partly by an examination of the metal got from the assay and partly by the experience acquired in smelting similar ores the produce which is that of the impure tin is stated in parts in twenty thus a produce of 14 is equivalent to 70 per cent or to 14 cwt per ton illustration fig 57 mechanical separationvanning this process which has already been referred to is carried out as followsafter sampling the ore in the ordinary way a quantity varying with its richness is weighed out special weights are generally used the standard weight marked 200 weighs about an ounce with poor ores this quantity is taken for an assay but with richer ores 100 or even 50 is sufficient the unit of weight has no special name but the parts in 200 are spoken of as the produce thus if 200 of ore were taken and 95 of black tin were separated the produce would be 912 obviously half the produce will give the percentage the weighed portion of the ore is placed on the vanning shovel the vanner stands in front of a tub of water kieve and allows 30 or 40 cc of water to flow on to the ore he then raises the shovel a little above the surface of the water and holding it nearly horizontal briskly rotates the water by imparting to the shovel a slight circular motion passing into an elliptical one front to back this causes the finer mud to be suspended in the liquid which is then run off leaving the body of the ore in the centre of the shovel this is repeated until the water after standing a moment is fairly clear about half as much water as before is brought on then with a motion which is similar to the previous one but with a jerk added in one direction the heavier minerals are thrown up and the stony matter brought back the jerk is produced just as the wave of water is returning the descending wave of water draws with it the bulkier and lighter particles of the ore whilst the heavier matter lying on the bottom is scarcely affected by it the jerky motion however carries it to the front of the shovel the lighter stuff is washed off and the residue dried by holding the shovel over the furnace it now corresponds more or less to the stuff which on the mine is sent to the calciner it is swept from the shovel into a scoop and transferred to a hot crucible in which it is calcined until free from sulphur some vanners calcine their samples before commencing to van the calcined ore is shaken out of the crucible on to the shovel rubbed up with a hammer and washed as at first to get rid of the finer and lighter waste the separating motions are again gone through and the head of the best of the black tin is thrown well up on one side of the shovel in the form of a crescent so as to leave room on the shovel to work with the tailings the quantity of water used is kept low to prevent this crop tin from being washed back again the tailings are then crushed to free the tin from adherent oxide of iron and again washed to throw up the remaining tin ore as this tin is finely divided it is more difficult to bring it up so that a vigorous and rapid motion is required the tailings are now washed off and the whole of the black tin is brought into the centre of the shovel it requires two or three washings more to free it from the waste it contains very small quantities of water are used the purity of the black tin can be seen by its appearance on the shovel the cleaned ore is dried as before freed from particles of iron with the aid of a magnet and weighed the weighings are carried to 18th of the unit used the following example illustrates the method of calculation adopted on the mine a parcel of 1 ton 2 cwt 3 qrs of tin ore with a produce of 45 equal to 2212 per cent contains 5 cwt 0 qrs 12 lbs of black tin this result is obtained as follows ton cwt qrs 1 2 3 9 10 4 3 equivalent to multiplying by 45 5 51 3 3 strike off the first figure to the right 4 multiply by 4 to reduce to quarters 4 12 3 4 15 28 multiply

information as well as for much of that already given about vanning we are indebted to captain reynolds of cooks kitchen mine to have a complete set of tools for all vanning purposes it will be necessary to get the followinga vanning shovel 14 inches long and 13 inches wide weighing not over 234 pounds it is made of hammered sheet iron of the shape shown in fig 57 it must have a light wooden handle preferably of deal 3 feet long a bruising hammer weighing 212 pounds with a handle 1 foot long a pair of tongs furnace 212 feet long made of 12inch round iron and a set of ordinary clay crucibles for calcining there ought to be two sets of scales and weights the first should be confined to weighing the powdered tin stuff and the second ought to be a much higher class one for weighing the black tin obtained the furnace for roasting the sample should be 10 inches square and 12 inches deep with the firebars at the bottom threequarters of an inch apart the waterbox for vanning in should be at least 4 feet long 2 feet 6 inches wide and 8 inches deep dry methods for the following description of the process adopted in cornwall we are indebted to mr ak barnett fgs of chyandour cornish methodtin ore assaythe ore to be smelted or assayed should be concentrated to say not less than 50 per cent of metallic tin though to obtain satisfactory results it should be brought nearer 70 per cent as with ore containing less than 40 to 50 per cent of metal there will be a considerable loss both in the assaying and in the smelting if the ore to be operated on does not contain this quantity of metal then the sample if coarse must be reduced to a fine state the gangue being removed by vanning and the ore saved for the fire assay the method adopted for the determination of tin in the ore is as followsabout 212 ounces troy 1200 grains or about 80 grams of the ore to be assayed is weighed out and mixed on a flat copper pan shaped with a long lip with onefifth of its weight 240 grains or 155 grams of powdered culm anthracite the mixture of ore and culm is either transferred to a blacklead crucible before the latter is put into the furnace or as some prefer it is carefully swept into a crucible which has been imbedded in the fire some assayers cover their pots with a flat cover placed loosely on while others leave the mixture in the open pot the furnace which has been previously fired to a strong heat is then covered and the sample is subjected to a sharp fire for a period of from twelve to twenty minutes no definite time can be stated as besides the strength of the fire the quality and condition of the ore and the impurities associated with it greatly affects the time required for the complete reduction of the ore as soon as the mixture in the crucible has settled down to a uniform white heat and any very slight ebullition which may have taken place has subsided the crucible is gently shaken removed from the fire the culmash or slag which covers the metal being carefully drawn aside with an iron scraper and the metal is poured quickly into an iron ingotmould which is usually placed on a copper pan to save the culmslag and the adherent metal which comes out with it the crucible is then carefully scraped and the scrapings together with the contents of the mould and pan are transferred to a mortar there the ingot of tin is freed from slag and then taken to the scales the rest after being finely powdered is passed through a sieve the flattened particles of tin which remain on the sieve are weighed with the ingot the lump as it is called whilst the siftings are vanned on a shovel and the slag being washed off the fine tin is collected dried and weighed with the rest the whole gives the produce or percentage of metal in the ore the results of the assays are expressed in cwts of metal in the ton of ore the percentage is rarely given and never used in cornwall thus1312 produce would mean that the assay yielded results at the rate of 1312 cwts of metal for one ton of the ore some assayers use a little powdered fluorspar to assist the fusion of refractory slags a small quantity of borax will also occasionally be of service for ores containing silica in excess of any iron that may be present the borax renders the slag more fusible and assists the formation of a larger lump with less fine tin in the slag than would be obtained by the use of culm alone the quality and the percentage of pure tin in the metal will vary considerably according to the impurities that are associated with the ore to be assayed the crude lump is then remelted in a small iron ladle at as low a temperature as possible and the fused metal is poured into a shallow trench about 4 inches long by 34 of an inch wide cut in a block of white marble the metal will be silverywhite if the temperature employed be correct if too hot the surface will show a yellow red or blue colour according to the heat employed in such case the metal should be remelted at a lower temperature if the metal on cooling remains perfectly clear and bright then it may be assumed that the tin is of good quality and commercially pure a crystallised or frosted appearance of the metal indicates the presence of some alloy say of iron copper zinc lead antimony c the assayer who has had much practice can readily distinguish the metal or metals that are associated with the ore by noting the appearance of the tin on cooling and can fairly judge the quantity of impurity present by the amount of the crystallisation or stain whilst the foregoing method of assaying cannot lay claim to scientific accuracy it is by no means so imperfect as some writers would have us believe who state that a loss of 5 to 10 per cent arises in the operation it is certainly the most ready and expeditious mode of determining the commercial value of a parcel of tin ore which after all is the main object of all assaying operations the difficulty which beginners find in obtaining satisfactory results and any loss of metal which those not accustomed to the process may incur will invariably occur in the vanning of the powdered slag for the fine tin the rest of the operations being easy of execution and requiring only the ordinary care necessary for all metallurgical work there is no doubt that if low percentage ores containing silica are assayed in this manner low results are obtained as it is impossible to reduce the whole of the tin in the presence of free silica with this class of ores care should be taken to remove some of the silica by preliminary vanning or some flux should be added which will combine with the silica and so prevent its entering into combination with the tin low quality tin ores containing iron copper lead zinc antimony etc combined with arsenic sulphur or oxygen will give very much higher results than the actual percentage of tin in the sample the other metals being readily reduced in the presence of tin alloy with it and give a hard lump difficult to fuse in the iron ladle where the quantity of foreign metals is large the metal can only be melted to a stiff pasty mass so that in determining the value of a ton of tin ore or even reporting on the percentage of tin it contains not only must the weight of the assay be the basis for calculation but the quality and character of the metal obtained must also be considered thus two ores of tin might be assayed both yielding a similar produce say 1312 6712 per cent and yet one might contain 5 per cent less tin than the other if it be required to obtain the pure metal from tin ores containing the ores of other metals associated with them the latter must be removed by digesting in strong hydrochloric acid and washing the assay may then be conducted in the usual way and a fairly pure lump will be obtained if wolfram be present in any appreciable quantity in the ore it considerably reduces the proportion of lump and at the same time it increases the fine tin or prillion as it is termed in the assay this may be got rid of by boiling in aqua regia and dissolving out the tungstic acid which has been liberated by means of ammonia it will be seen that this method of assaying tin has its advantages and its drawbacks it is quickly performed with ores of good quality it gives results not to be excelled by any other process and it gives the smelter the actual alloy and quality of metal he may expect to get in the smelting of the ore which no other mode of assaying will do against which may be set the skill required to obtain accurate results with the vanning shovel the loss of metal in poor ores containing an excess of silica and the high results from ores containing a large quantity of metallic impurities cyanide methodweigh up 20 grams of the ore and dry it on a scoop over the bunsen flame when dry weigh and calculate the percentage of water from the loss in weight transfer the dried ore to an evaporating dish and cover with 30 cc of hydrochloric acid boil for 10 or 12 minutes and then add 5 cc of nitric acid and boil again dilute with water and filter transfer the filter and its contents to an e battersea crucible and calcine it for a few minutes cool and weigh the residue the loss equals the oxides soluble in acid transfer the residue to the crucible and mix it with its own weight of cyanide of potassium add a similar amount of cyanide as a cover place in the furnace and when the charge has attained the temperature of the furnace in from 3 to 6 minutes remove it at once tap the pot vigorously several times and then pour its contents quietly into a mould dissolve the slag in water clean dry and weigh the button of tin wet methods detectiontin ore is detected by its insolubility in acids high specific gravity and characteristic appearance in water the powder is separated from the lighter gangue by washing it is fused in a berlin crucible with five times its weight of potassic cyanide at a moderately high temperature in a muffle or over the blowpipe the slag is washed off with water and the metallic buttons or residue treated with hydrochloric acid not aqua regia for some time one portion of the solution strikes a purple colour with chloride of gold another portion gives a white or grey precipitate or cloudiness with mercuric chloride these reactions are characteristic of tin as stannous chloride metallic tin treated with nitric acid becomes converted into a white insoluble powder metastannic acid aqua regia dissolves tin readily forming stannic chloride and in this solution the metal is detected by precipitation with sulphuretted hydrogen which gives a yellow precipitate tin in solution as stannic or stannous chloride is precipitated as metal by means of zinc the fact that tin forms two welldefined series of compounds is taken advantage of in assaying just as in the case of iron by determining how much of an oxidising agent is required to convert it from the stannous into the stannic state for example on the addition of a solution of permanganate of potash to a solution of stannous chloride the oxidation goes on rapidly and the finishing point is sharp and distinct but acid solutions of stannous chloride quickly take up oxygen from that dissolved in the water used and from the air unfortunately there is no obvious sign that such oxidation has taken place except that fatal to the assay a smaller volume of the permanganate is required great care is required with such solutions both before and during titration the addition of an excess of ferric chloride to the stannous solution as soon as the whole of the tin has been dissolved will lessen this liability to oxidation separationif the tin is present in an alloy the substance is boiled in an evaporating dish with dilute nitric acid until the whole of the material is attacked evaporate nearly to dryness dilute boil for a few minutes and filter off the white insoluble residue under certain circumstances this residue will be nearly free from other metals in which case it is ignited and weighed if not known to be pure it must be ignited reduced in a current of hydrogen and treated as subsequently described when the tin is present as insoluble oxide in an ore the substance is finely powdered and from 1 to 5 grams of it according to its richness boiled with 30 cc of hydrochloric acid in an evaporating dish till the oxide of iron is seen to be dissolved then add 1 cc of nitric acid or more if much pyrites c is present and continue the boiling till these are decomposed dilute and filter off washing first with dilute acid and afterwards with a little dilute ammonia dry ignite and place in a combustion tube together with the filterash and heat to redness for about thirty minutes in a current of dried hydrogen illustration fig 58 the oxide of tin is placed in a porcelain boat fig 58 which is then introduced into a piece of combustion tube the latter wrapped in a piece of wire gauze is supported on a couple of iron rings and heated by one or two bunsen burners in a furnace fitted up with loose firebrick tiles as shown in fig 59 illustration fig 59 when the reduction is complete the tube is allowed to cool the boat is removed and the tin dissolved add a rod of zinc to the freelyacid hot solution and in a few minutes decant through a filter and wash with water after having removed the zinc wash the precipitated metal back into the beaker and dissolve in 10 cc of dilute nitric acid evaporate off the excess of acid dilute boil and filter wash dry ignite strongly in a porcelain crucible and weigh in the absence of antimony the above separation works very well but if this metal is present in quantity the metals precipitated on the zinc must be covered with hydrochloric acid and treated with a few drops of nitric it is then warmed with iron wire until no more of the latter dissolves the antimony is precipitated as metal and the tin remains in solution as stannous chloride the antimony is filtered off and may be washed with alcohol and weighed whilst the tin in the filtrate is precipitated with zinc and treated as already described gravimetric method if the tin is not already in the metallic state it is reduced to this condition by the method given precipitation by zinc treat the finelydivided metal washed free from chlorides in a fourinch evaporating dish with 10 cc of dilute nitric acid cover with a clockglass and apply a gentle heat until the precipitate appears of a white colour and the metal is completely attacked evaporate nearly to dryness on a waterbath then add 50 cc of water heat to boiling and filter wash with hot water dry transfer to a weighed porcelain crucible add the filterash ignite strongly and weigh the precipitate after ignition is stannic oxide sno2 it is a yellowishwhite powder darker whilst hot insoluble in acids and contains 7867 per cent of tin cold dilute nitric acid dissolves tin to a clear solution which becomes a white enamellike jelly on heating this filtered off washed and dried forms an opallike substance which is converted on ignition into stannic oxide with evolution of nitrous fumes stannic oxide when ignited with chlorides is more or less completely converted into stannic chloride which volatilises the presence of chlorides during the evaporation with nitric acid causes a similar loss determination of tin in an alloybronzetake 2 grams and attack with 20 cc of dilute nitric acid in a covered beaker with the aid of heat boil till the bulk is reduced by onehalf dilute

hydrogen through the tube and heat to redness for 30 minutes cool whilst the gas is still passing dissolve in 20 cc of dilute hydrochloric acid and keep the solution tinted with permanganate of potassium when the colour of the permanganate becomes permanent dilute to a bulk of 50 cc with water filter and wash heat add a rod of zinc weighing about 3 grams allow to stand for a few minutes decant through a filter and wash removing the remaining zinc and returning the tin to the beaker treat with 5 cc of dilute nitric acid boil for some time take up with water filter wash dry ignite and weigh as stannic oxide volumetric method titration with solution of permanganate of potassiumthis titration may be made either directly on the solution of stannous chloride prepared by dissolving the precipitated metal in hydrochloric acid or indirectly on a solution of ferrous chloride produced by the reducing action of the precipitated metal on ferric chloride the standard solution of permanganate of potassium is made by dissolving 5356 grams of the salt in water and diluting to one litre 100 cc are equivalent to 100 gram of tin the precipitated tin is transferred to a flask and dissolved in 10 cc hydrochloric acid with the aid of heat and in an atmosphere of carbonic acid the acid and metal are placed in the flask which is then filled with the gas and stopped with a cork provided with a rubber valve when solution is complete the flask is again filled with carbonic acid fifty cc of water freed from air and saturated with carbonic acid are then added this water is made by adding a gram of bicarbonate of soda and 2 cc of hydrochloric acid to 100 cc of water the effervescence sweeps out the dissolved oxygen the permanganate of potassium solution is then run in from a stopcock burette in the usual way until a faint pink tinge is obtained the following experiments show the effect of variations in the conditions of the assay a solution of stannous chloride equivalent in strength to the permanganate was made by dissolving 1906 grams of the crystallised salt sncl22h2o in 50 cc of water and 10 cc of hydrochloric acid and diluting to 1 litre with water freed from dissolved oxygen 100 cc contain 1 gram of tin in the first experiments tap water was used and no precautions were taken for excluding air except when otherwise stated 20 cc of the stannous chloride were used in each experiment with 10 cc of hydrochloric acid and were diluted to 100 cc with water before titration effect of varying hydrochloric acid acid added 10 cc 100 cc 200 cc 500 cc permanganate required 188 189 188 188 the only effect of the increase in quantity of acid was to give the brown of perchloride of manganese instead of the pink of permanganic acid to mark the finishing point effect of varying temperature temperature 15 c 50 c 70 c 100 c permanganate required 188 cc 187 cc 186 cc 184 cc rate of atmospheric oxidationsolutions ready for titration were exposed

may be seen from the following similar experiments which were however performed with water freed from oxygen and in which the titrations were effected in an atmosphere of carbonic acid effect of varying tina new solution of stannous chloride was used stannous chloride added 10 cc 100 cc 200 cc 500 cc 1000 cc permanganate required 10 100 198 496 993 effect of varying bulk bulk 300 cc 500 cc

phosphidephosphor tinthis substance is used in the manufacture of phosphor bronze and similar alloys it is a crystalline imperfectlymalleable metallic substance it is soluble in hydrochloric acid with effervescence phosphoretted hydrogen which inflames on the addition of a drop or two of nitric acid being evolved it is attacked by nitric acid yielding a white powder of stannic phosphate this is not easily decomposed by ammonium sulphide or readily soluble in hydrochloric acid phosphortin is made up only of tin and phosphorus for the estimation weigh up 1 gram place in a weighed berlin dish and cover with 10 cc of nitric acid and 3 or 4 cc of water let the reaction proceed under a clockglass on the waterbath till complete remove the glass evaporate to dryness and ignite at first gently over a bunsen burner and afterwards in the muffle at a red heat cool in the desiccator and weigh as quickly as possible when cold the substance contains the tin as stannic oxide sno2 and the phosphorus as phosphoric oxide p2o5 the increase in weight on the gram of substance taken gives the weight of the oxygen taken up by the phosphorus and tin and since 1 gram of tin takes up only 0271 gram of oxygen and 1 gram of phosphorus takes up 129 gram the proportion of tin to phosphorus can be calculated from the increase in weight for example 1 gram of a sample gave 13410 gram of mixed oxides which is 0070 gram in excess of that which would be got with pure tin if the substance was all phosphorus the excess would be 10190 gram consequently the proportion of phosphorus in the substance is 0070 1019 or 687 per cent the tin is calculated by difference 9313 per cent another method of separating and determining the phosphorus is as followstake 1 gram of the substance and add to it 15 cc of hot aqua regia boil till dissolved dilute and precipitate the tin with sulphuretted hydrogen to the filtrate add ammonia and magnesia mixture filter wash the precipitate with dilute ammonia dry ignite and weigh as magnesic pyrophosphate calculate the phosphorus and take the tin by difference a sample of phosphor tin gave tin 931 per cent by difference phosphorus 69 1000 tin arsenidethis is met with in tinsmelting it closely resembles the phosphide but the crystals have a duller grey appearance it contains simply tin and arsenic the determination is made by treating 1 gram of the substance with nitric acid and weighing the mixed oxides of tin and arsenic in the same manner as in the case of the phosphide one gram of arsenic will give 1533 gram of arsenic oxide as2o5 consequently the excess of weight of the mixed oxides over 1271 gram must be divided by 0262 the result multiplied by 100 gives the percentage of arsenic in consequence of the higher atomic weight of arsenic the results by this method are not so close as with the phosphide each milligram of excess weight over 1271 represents 038 per cent of arsenic as both in this and in the corresponding phosphide determination care must be taken to avoid absorption of moisture by allowing the oxides to cool in a desiccator and weighing quickly the percentage of arsenic is better determined as followsweigh up 1 gram of the substance dissolve in aqua regia dilute and pass sulphuretted hydrogen render alkaline with ammonia and add ammonium sulphide till the precipitate is dissolved add magnesia mixture filter off the precipitate wash with dilute ammonia ignite with a few drops of nitric acid and weigh as magnesic pyrarsenate calculate the arsenic and take the tin by difference a sample treated in this way gave tin 968 per cent by difference arsenic 32 1000 examination of black tindry the ore and reduce it to a fine powder weigh up 2 grams and boil with 20 cc of hydrochloric acid and 2 cc of nitric for ten or fifteen minutes filter and reserve the filtrate tungstic aciddigest the residue with about 50 cc of water and a few cc of dilute ammonia for a few minutes and filter collect the filtrate in a weighed

red heat for half an hour allow to cool whilst the hydrogen is still passing transfer the boat to a beaker and dissolve up the tin in 10 cc of hydrochloric acid and a cc or so of nitric wash out the combustion tube with some acid and add the washing to the contents of the beaker warm gently dilute with water and filter collect dry ignite and weigh the insoluble residue through the filtrate pass a rapid current of sulphuretted hydrogen allow to settle and filter wash the precipitate with hot water dry calcine gently ignite with ammonium carbonate and weigh as stannic oxide sno2 the insoluble

and weigh as stannic oxide and add it to that previously obtained copperpass sulphuretted hydrogen through the acid filtrate obtained in the first cleaning of the ore collect the precipitate and wash first with soda solution and then with hot water dry ignite and weigh as cupric oxide cuo mix the filtrate with that from the main portion of the sulphide of tin ferric oxideboil off the sulphuretted hydrogen from the mixed filtrates and peroxidise with nitric acid add ammonia in slight excess boil filter dry ignite and weigh the precipitate as ferric oxide this will be practically pure but the iron in it must be determined by dissolving and titrating the filtrate from the iron may contain zinc lime and magnesia but rarely in quantities sufficient to be determined silica cthe silica may be calculated from the weight of the residue insoluble in acid after the reduction of the tin in hydrogen by deducting from it the weight of the oxide of tin subsequently found or it may be determined as followsthe insoluble portion is fused with fusion mixture and taken up with hydrochloric acid as already described on filtering the filter will retain a portion of the silica the rest is recovered after the removal of the stannous sulphide by evaporating to dryness taking up with hydrochloric acid and filtering through the same filter it is washed dried ignited and weighed as silica the filtrate from the silica is boiled with a little nitric acid and precipitated with ammonia the precipitate is collected washed ignited and weighed as ferric oxide and alumina but it frequently contains oxide of titanium when the last is present it is determined by fusing with bisulphate of potash and extracting with cold water the solution is nearly neutralised with ammonia charged with sulphurous acid and boiled the precipitate is collected washed dried ignited and weighed as oxide of titanium tio2 the difference between this weight and that of the combined oxides gives the ferric oxide and alumina the filtrate from the mixed oxides is examined for lime and magnesia sulphurrub up 5 grams of the ore with 5 grams of nitre transfer to a porcelain dish and fuse over a bunsen burner

evaporate with nitric acid dilute add ammonia pass sulphuretted hydrogen and filter to the filtrate add magnesia mixture collect the precipitate ignite with nitric acid and weigh as magnesic pyrarsenate the following may be taken as an example of the composition of an impure black tin tungstic acid 18 stannic oxide 790 silica 26 titanic oxide 08 copper oxide 09 ferric oxide 134 sulphur 04 arsenic 03 992 examination of hardheadin the smelting of tin ores a quantity of speise known as hardhead is produced it is essentially an arsenide of iron carrying a considerable quantity of tin much of this last is present in the form of small buttons of metal distributed through the mass the buttons can be seen on careful inspection and become evident on powdering in assaying the substance a variation in the usual method of sampling is required because of the quantity of metal present which cannot be powdered after powdering as finely as possible the coarse particles are sifted off and weighed the weight of the powder is also taken the method of working is best illustrated by an example a sample of hardhead weighed 1551 grams and gave 210 grams of coarse particles equivalent to 135 per cent of the whole the fine portion weighed 134 grams which is equivalent to 865 per cent thirteen and a half grams of the coarse material were dissolved in aqua regia and diluted with water to 1 litre ten cc of this contain 0135 gram of the metallic portion which is the amount contained in 1 gram of the original hardhead if in a determination 1 gram of the substance is wanted weigh up 0865 gram of the powdered portion and add to it 10 cc of the solution it will be seen that these together make up 1 gram of the original sample the solution of the metallic portion must be saved until the analysis is finished tin and copperweigh up the portion of the powdered stuff equivalent to 1 gram of the sample transfer to a flask and cover with 10 cc of the solution of the metallic portion and 10 cc of aqua regia boil gently till oxidation is complete and the nitric acid for the greater part driven off dilute to 100 cc with water and pass sulphuretted hydrogen for some time filter wash with hot water and rinse through the funnel back into the flask digest with yellow sodium sulphide until only a light flocculent black precipitate is left filter this off wash with hot water dry calcine treat with a little nitric acid ignite and weigh as copper oxide cuo the weight multiplied by 07983 gives the weight of copper the filtrate containing the tin is rendered acid with hydrochloric acid and filtered the precipitate is rinsed into a halfpint beaker covered with 20 cc of hydrochloric acid and boiled down to about 20 cc the solution is filtered off from the sulphur and sulphide of arsenic which after washing with hot water is transferred to a flask labelled arsenic a strip of sheet zinc 2 in by 1 in is placed in the solution the evolution of hydrogen should be brisk in five or ten minutes decant off a few cc of the liquid and test with sulphuretted hydrogen for tin if no yellowish precipitate is formed decant off the rest of the liquid and wash the precipitated metal with hot water two or three times by decantation the metal should be in a lump if there are any floating particles they must be made to sink by compression with a glass rod transfer the washed metal to an evaporating dish 3 or 4 in across and cover with a few cc of hot water add nitric acid drop by drop till the tin is completely attacked evaporate nearly to dryness and add a drop or two more of nitric acid and 20 cc of water boil and filter wash with hot water dry ignite and weigh as stannic oxide sno2 calculate to metallic tin by multiplying by 0786776 the filtrate from the first treatment with sulphuretted hydrogen will probably no longer smell of the gas warm and pass the gas for a few minutes longer filter off any precipitate of sulphide of arsenic and transfer it to the flask for arsenic boil the filtrate ignoring any signs of a further precipitation of arsenic with a few cc of nitric acid and separate the iron as basic acetate wash reserve the filtrate for cobalt ironrinse back the basic acetate precipitate into the flask add ammonia dilute with water to about 100 cc and pass sulphuretted hydrogen for a few minutes filter and wash with hot water collect the filtrate in the flask labelled arsenic boil the precipitate with dilute sulphuric acid filter and titrate the filtrate with the permanganate of potassium solution after boiling off the sulphuretted hydrogen report the result as iron the sulphuric acid will not effect complete solution a light black residue will remain chiefly sulphur this must be rinsed into the filtrate from the acetate separation it contains cobalt cobaltthe filtrate from the acetate separation will have a pink colour render it ammoniacal and pass sulphuretted hydrogen collect the precipitate on a filter dry and ignite dissolve in hydrochloric acid and evaporate nearly to dryness with an excess of nitric acid dilute with 10 or 20 cc of water and add potash solution in slight excess add acetic acid until the solution is acid and the precipitate is quite dissolved add 20 or 30 cc of a strong solution of potassium nitrite and determine the cobalt as described on pp 254 256 boil the filtrate from the cobalt precipitate with hydrochloric acid render ammoniacal and test for zinc nickel and manganese the remainder of the tin will be contained in the flask labelled arsenic acidify with hydrochloric acid and filter rinse into a beaker and evaporate to a small bulk with 10 cc of nitric acid dilute and filter dry the precipitate consisting of stannic arsenate 2sno2as2o5 ignite and weigh calculate the tin it contains by multiplying by 04453 and add to that already found arsenicthis is determined in a separate portion weigh up a portion of the powder equivalent to 1 gram of the hardhead place in a pint flask and boil with 10 cc of nitric acid when action has ceased add 10 cc of the solution of the metallic portion and then hydrochloric acid a few drops at a time till solution is complete warm gently in dissolving

fuse in a porcelain dish for ten minutes extract with water add 20 or 30 cc as the case may be of the solution of the metallics add 10 grams of sodic acetate and ferric chloride until the precipitate turns brown dilute with water to half a litre boil and titrate with standard baric chloride as described under sulphur report as sulphur a sample of hardhead examined in this way gave sulphur 300 arsenic 2710 tin 222 copper 164 iron 432 cobalt 26 9974 examination of tin slagsin tin smelting works the term slag is applied to the unfused portion of the charge it is made up of unburnt anthracite and small lumps of slag proper together with some buttons of metallic tin this is rarely if ever assayed the slag proper or as it is generally called glass is a silicate of iron alumina and lime containing from 3 to 7 per cent of tin it is thus examinedthe sample after bruising on an iron plate is reduced to a very fine powder by grinding in an agate mortar in this state it is in most cases readily decomposed by hydrochloric acid determination of tinwhere the percentage of tin only is required take 2 grams of the powdered slag and well mix with it 20 cc of hydrochloric acid and heat to boiling add 1 cc of nitric acid allow to stand for fifteen minutes dilute with water and filter pass a rapid current of sulphuretted hydrogen for some time allow to settle and filter the precipitate after washing with hot water is dried and gently calcined until the greater part of the sulphur is burnt off it is then strongly ignited in the muffle or over the blowpipe with the addition of a small lump of ammonic carbonate the residue is weighed as stannic oxide sno2 and is calculated to metallic tin by multiplying by 0787 the percentage on the slag is calculated in the usual way the tin is always best determined in the examination of slags by a separate assay carried out in this way the determination of the other constituents is thus made silicatake 2 grams of the powdered slag and cover them in a small evaporating dish with 20 cc of hydrochloric acid mix well by stirring with a glass rod and evaporate to dryness if as is generally the case tungsten is present the solution will be blue take up with 20 cc of hydrochloric acid add 1 cc of nitric acid and reduce by boiling to about half the bulk add about 20 cc of water boil and filter wash the residue with hot dilute hydrochloric acid it consists of silica with the tungstic acid wash it back into the dish and digest with 5 or 10 cc of a cold solution of ammonic carbonate filter and collect the filtrate and washings in a weighed porcelain dish dry the residue ignite strongly and weigh as silica sio2 in certain exceptional cases this may contain some unaltered cassiterite which is easily recognised by its appearance tungstenthe ammonic carbonate filtrate from the silica is evaporated to dryness ignited strongly over the blowpipe and weighed the residue is tungstic acid wo3 the tungsten may be conveniently reported in this form although it is probably present as a lower oxide tinthe acid filtrate from the silica and tungstic acid is treated with sulphuretted hydrogen the sulphide of tin is filtered off since the percentage of tin has been already determined this precipitate may be neglected or may be treated in the same way as the previous one so as to check the result since some stannic chloride will have been lost in the evaporation a low result may be expected the tin should be reported as stannous oxide and is calculated by multiplying the percentage of tin by 1136 the filtrate from the tin is boiled rapidly down to remove sulphuretted hydrogen and then peroxidised with 1 or 2 cc of nitric acid it is cooled transferred to a graduated flask and diluted with water to 200 cc ferrous oxide and aluminahalf the filtrate from the tin that is 100 cc is taken nearly neutralised with soda and treated with sodium acetate the basic acetate precipitate obtained on boiling is filtered off and washed reserve the filtrate the precipitate is dissolved off the filter with hot dilute hydrochloric acid and the solution thus formed is treated with a slight excess of ammonia and boiled the precipitate is filtered off washed with hot water dried ignited and weighed as mixed ferric oxide and alumina the ignited precipitate is then dissolved with sulphuric and hydrochloric acids and the iron determined in the solution by titration with the solution of stannous chloride the iron found is calculated to and reported as ferrous oxide feo factor 1286 to find the alumina which is best estimated by difference multiply the iron by 1428 to get the weight of ferric oxide and deduct this from the weight of alumina and ferric oxide found this of course gives the alumina a direct determination may be made by removing the tin from the titrated solution with sulphuretted hydrogen filtering nearly neutralising with ammonia and boiling with a few grams of hyposulphite of soda the precipitate filtered washed and ignited is the alumina which is weighed the direct determination gives a slightly low result oxides of zinc and manganesethese are determined in the filtrate from the basic acetate precipitate by rendering alkaline with ammonia and passing a current of sulphuretted hydrogen generally a small but decided precipitate of alumina comes down together with sulphides of any zinc or manganese which is present the precipitate is allowed to settle dried ignited and weighed the metals are separately determined in it and the residue is counted as alumina and added to that already found the mixed precipitate amounts to from 1 to 2 per cent of the sample limethe filtrate from the last is treated with ammonic oxalate boiled for a few minutes allowed to settle and filtered the precipitate is washed with hot water dried ignited and weighed as carbonate after gentle ignition or as lime after strong ignition in the muffle magnesiathe filtrate from the lime is treated with sodic phosphate and ammonia it is well mixed by stirring and allowed to stand overnight the precipitate is washed with dilute ammonia dried ignited and weighed as pyrophosphate soda and potashthese are determined in the remaining half of the filtrate from the tin the solution is rendered ammoniacal with ammonia and treated first with sulphuretted hydrogen and then with ammonium oxalate the precipitate is filtered off and rejected the filtrate is evaporated in a small porcelain dish over a bunsen burner or on the sand bath and towards the close or earlier if the evaporation is not proceeding well nitric acid is added the evaporation is carried to dryness and the residue heated nearly to redness the residue which consists of magnesia with carbonates and chlorides of the alkalies is extracted with water and filtered the filtrate is evaporated with hydrochloric acid in a weighed platinum dish ignited gently and weighed this gives the weight of the mixed chlorides of sodium and potassium which are then separated and determined as described under potash it must be remembered when calculating the percentage that with the exception of the silica tungstic acid and tin the determinations have been made on 1 gram of the sample the following analysis will illustrate the composition of such a slag tungstic acid 13 silica 394 stannous oxide 81 ferrous oxide 262 alumina 148 oxide of manganese traces lime 79 magnesia 05 alkalies calculated as soda 17 999 titanium titanium only occurs as a mineral in its oxidised state or as titanic oxide tio2 it is a substance which has little commercial value and is generally recognised as one of the rare bodies although in small quantities it is widely disseminated it occurs in granite basalt and other igneous rocks in quantities up to as much as 1 per cent it is also met with in clays and iron ores and in river sands in which it is often associated with stream tin the proper minerals of titanium are rutile tio2 titaniferous iron titanate of iron and sphene titanate and silicate of lime the oxide of titanium like cassiterite and quartz is undecomposed by hydrochloric or nitric acid so that it is generally found in the residue insoluble in acids the titanates however are attacked and a portion of the titanium dissolves so that it must be looked for in both the filtrate and residue oxide of titanium in its native form or after ignition may be made soluble by fusing the finelydivided substance with fusion mixture in a platinum dish the resulting titanate is dissolved out of the melt by cold hydrochloric acid the method most commonly used is fusion with bisulphate of potash this renders the oxide of titanium soluble in cold water the process is as followsthe substance is extracted with hydrochloric and nitric acids and the solution reserved for further treatment the residue is dried moistened with sulphuric acid and evaporated once or twice to dryness with hydrofluoric acid it is then fused with bisulphate of potash and the melt extracted with cold water until all soluble matter is removed the solution is filtered the residue may consist of unremoved silica and oxides of tantalum niobium and perhaps chromium on the prolonged boiling of the filtrate the oxide of titanium and oxide of zirconium if any is precipitated any titanium dissolved by the first extraction with acids is recovered in the following waysulphuretted hydrogen is passed into the acid solution and any precipitate that may be formed is filtered off the filtrate is oxidised and the iron aluminium and titanium are separated as basic acetates see under iron the precipitate is dried and fused with bisulphate of potash the melt is extracted with cold water filtered if necessary and the solution rendered first faintly alkaline with ammonia then very slightly acid with sulphuric acid 30 or 40 cc of a saturated solution of sulphurous acid is added and the oxide of titanium precipitated by prolonged boiling it is filtered off added to the precipitate previously got ignited with ammonic carbonate towards the end and then weighed detectiontitanium is detected in an insoluble residue by fusing the residue for some time in a bead of microcosmic salt in the reducing flame it gives a violet colour which becomes reddishbrown if much iron is present in the oxidising flame it gives a colourless or whitish bead it is best detected in acid solutions by the deep brown or iodine colour developed on adding hydroxyl a solution of this can be prepared by pouring peroxide of barium bao2 diffused in water into dilute hydrochloric acid a little at a time and keeping the acid in excess separationin the usual course of an analytical separation the hydrate of titanium will be thrown down with ferric hydrate c on the addition of ammonic chloride and ammonia it is best separated from this precipitate by fusion with bisulphate of potash as already described but it must be remembered that the presence of much mineral acid prevents complete precipitation when the solution is boiled further if phosphates are present the precipitate will contain phosphoric oxide it may be freed from this by fusion with sodium carbonate a very good method of separating titanium from iron is to add tartaric acid and ammonia to the solution and then precipitate the iron as sulphide with sulphuretted hydrogen the filtrate contains the titanium which is recovered by evaporating and igniting it may be separated from zirconia by the action of sodium carbonate which precipitates both but when concentrated redissolves the zirconia the separation from large quantities of silica is best effected by evaporating with hydrofluoric acid which volatilises the silicon but sulphuric acid must be present otherwise some titanium also will be lost as may be seen from the following experiments77 in which oxide of titanium pure ignited was evaporated to dryness with a quantity of hydrofluoric acid known by experiment to be sufficient to volatilise 1 gram of silica without sulphuric acid 00466 gram of titanic oxide left 00340 gram showing a loss of about 25 per cent with sulphuric acid the following results were obtained

solution from the bisulphate is collected washed dried ignited strongly with the addition of a little ammonic carbonate and weighed the substance is titanic oxide tio2 and is generally reported as such it contains 6098 per cent of titanium it should be white if pure holland white yellow or brown fresenius or black tidy volumetric method a method has been proposed based on the reduction of titanic oxide by zinc in hydrochloric acid solutions to the sesquioxide the reduction is marked by the development of a violet or green colour the former with chlorides and the latter when fluorides are present the quantity of titanium reduced is measured by titrating with permanganate of potassium solution the water used must be free from dissolved oxygen tungsten and tungstates tungsten occurs in nature only in the oxidised state or as tungstic acid wo3 either free as in wolframine or combined with oxides of manganese and iron as in wolfram or with lime as in scheelite wolfram occurs associated with tin ores the value of which is consequently lowered both wolfram and scheelite are of considerable importance as a source of tungstic acid for the manufacture of sodium tungstate which is used as a mordant and for some other purposes and as a source of metallic tungsten which is used in steelmaking the tungsten minerals have a high specific gravity 6 to 75 on treatment with hydrochloric acid or aqua regia they are decomposed the yellow tungstic acid separates and remains insoluble tungsten itself is insoluble in nitric acid or aqua regia but is converted into tungstic acid wo3 by prolonged and strong ignition in air alloys containing tungsten leave tungstic acid after treatment with nitric acid or aqua regia tungstic acid may be got into solution after fusion with alkalies or alkaline carbonates this solution gives with hydrochloric acid a white precipitate of tungstic acid which becomes yellow on boiling but the separation is not complete fusion with bisulphate of potash gives a residue which does not dissolve in water but is soluble in ammonic carbonate for the assay of minerals containing tungsten these reactions are only occasionally taken advantage of for testing or purifying the separated tungstic acid detectionthe minerals are easily recognised by their physical characters and the yellow tungstic acid separated by boiling with acids is the best test for its presence this after decanting and washing immediately dissolves in a few drops of dilute ammonia a solution of tungstate acidulated with hydrochloric acid becomes intensely blue on the addition of stannous chloride and warming fused in a bead of microcosmic salt it gives a clear blue colour reddishbrown if iron is also present in the reducing flame but is colourless in the oxidising flame solution and separationthe decomposition and solution of natural tungstates is difficult to effect owing to the separation of tungstic acid the method of treatment is as followsboil the finelypowdered substance with hydrochloric acid or aqua regia till it apparently ceases to be attacked dilute filter and wash with dilute hydrochloric acid cover with dilute ammonia and filter the solution which contains ammonic tungstate into an evaporating dish treat the residue again with acid and again dissolve out the separated tungstic acid with ammonia and repeat this operation until decomposition is complete by this means there will be obtained1 a solution containing tungstate of ammonia 2 an insoluble residue with silicates and oxides of tin niobium tantalum c and 3 an acid solution containing the soluble bases the tungstate of ammonia requires simple evaporation on the waterbath and gentle ignition in order to cause the tungstic acid to be left in an almost pure state possibly it may carry a little silica gravimetric determination the tungstic acid is dissolved and separated as ammonic tungstate and after evaporation is gently ignited the heat being increased towards the end the residual tungstic acid is fixed so that when the ammonia has been driven off it may be strongly heated without loss it is a dark yellow or brown powder whilst hot which becomes a light yellow on cooling if any reduction has taken place it will be more or less greenish it is weighed when cold and is the trioxide or tungstic acid wo3 which contains 7931 per cent of tungsten after its weight has been taken its purity is checked by fusing with hydric potassic sulphate extracting with water and treating the residue with ammonic carbonate any silica present will be left undissolved it should be separated and weighed and its weight deducted from that of the tungstic acid found determination of tungstic acid in wolframtake 2 grams of the finelypowdered sample and boil with 50 cc of hydrochloric acid for half an hour adding 5 cc of nitric acid towards the end allow to stand overnight and boil again for 15 or 20 minutes dilute with an equal volume of water and filter wash with dilute hydrochloric acid dissolve in a few cc of warm dilute ammonia and dilute to 200 cc with distilled water allow to settle and filter evaporate in a weighed dish ignite and weigh the following analysis will illustrate the composition of a sample of cornish wolfram as brought into the market tungstic acid 501 cassiterite 109 ferrous oxide 246 manganous oxide 54 niobic

niobic they are probably present in the form of columbite a niobate of iron and manganese and tantalite a tantalate of the same metals on boiling with hydrochloric acid they are both liberated and remain for the greater part all the niobic in the insoluble residue with the tungstic acid on removing the latter with dilute ammonia they remain as a white insoluble precipitate very prone to run through the filter on washing they may be dissolved in hydrofluoric acid either at once or after fusion with bisulphate of potash and extraction with cold water to the solution in hydrofluoric acid gradually add a boiling solution of acid potassium fluoride hf kf potassic fluotantalate soluble in 200 parts of water separates out first and afterwards potassic fluoniobate soluble in 12 parts of water the separated salts after heating with sulphuric acid and washing out the potassium sulphate formed are ignited with ammonic carbonate and weighed as tantalic oxide ta2o5 and niobic oxide nb2o5 respectively they are both white powders the oxide of niobium dissolved in a bead of microcosmic salt gives a bluish colour in the reducing flame the oxide of tantalum dissolves in the bead but gives no colour footnotes 76 this will give almost the whole of the tin a further portion will be got in subsequent work and must be added to this result 77 published by p holland in the chemical news vol lix p 27 chapter xiii manganese chromium c manganese manganese occurs mainly as black oxide mno2 in the mineral pyrolusite and in a less pure form in psilomelane and wad the value of the ore depends rather on the percentage of available oxygen than on the proportion of metal present the results of assays are generally reported as so much per cent of the dioxide mno2 in smaller quantities it is very widely distributed manganese itself has a value for steelmaking or rather for the making of spiegeleisen and ferromanganese which are used in the bessemer and siemens processes for this purpose the percentage of the metal mn is required consequently the minerals of manganese may be considered in two aspects1 as a source of oxygen and 2 as a source of manganese these will require separate consideration the black oxide is mainly used in the preparation of chlorine liberation of which it brings about when treated with hot hydrochloric acid or with a mixture of common salt and sulphuric acid the quantity of chlorine which is obtained depends upon the proportion of dioxide present78 and in assaying may either be measured by its equivalent of iodine liberated or by the oxidising effect on an acid solution of ferrous sulphate when the ore also carries substances which have a reducing effect such as ferrous compounds such assays will give not the total dioxide mno2 but less by the amount required to oxidise these impurities and this is exactly what is required in valuing such an ore for commercial purposes manganese compounds are characterised by the readiness with which they may be converted into highlyoxidised bodies solution of manganese in hydrochloric acid rendered alkaline with ammonia yields a clear solution79 which rapidly takes up oxygen from the air forming a brown precipitate of the oxide mn2o3 the addition of bromine or chlorine to such a solution determines the precipitation of a still higher oxide approximately mno2 on treating a compound containing manganese with nitric acid and dioxide of lead pbo2 the oxidation is carried still further a purplecoloured solution of permanganic acid hmno4 or h2omn2o7 being formed on fusing minerals containing even traces of manganese with sodium carbonate in an open crucible a green melt is obtained which owes its colour to sodium manganate na2mno4 or na2omno3 this salt is soluble in water forming a green solution which when rendered acid rapidly changes into the permanganate with the characteristic purple colour permanganate of potash is a salt much used in assaying with some properties of which the student will have already become familiar compounds of manganese on boiling with strong hydrochloric acid yield manganous chloride80 mncl2 the properties given above serve for the detection of manganese the higher oxides are distinguished by causing the evolution of chlorine with its peculiarly suffocating smell when acted on with hydrochloric acid while the green melt with sodium carbonate can be relied on for the recognition of manganese itself there is no dry assay of manganese ores wet methods strong hydrochloric acid is the best solvent for ores of manganese but where the proportion of dioxide mno2 is required the solution is effected during the assay the ore should be in a very fine state of division before treatment with acids the separation of manganese from other metals is thus effected ignite in order to destroy any organic matter which may be present dissolve in hydrochloric acid and evaporate to dryness to separate silica take up with hydrochloric acid dilute pass sulphuretted hydrogen and filter boil off the excess of gas peroxidise the iron with a drop or two of nitric acid and separate the iron as basic acetate as described under iron81 if the iron precipitate is bulky it is dissolved in a little hydrochloric acid reprecipitated and the filtrate added to the original one neutralise with soda and add bromine in excess heat gradually to boiling allow to settle and filter the precipitate is impure dioxide of manganese containing alkalies and possibly cobalt or nickel gravimetric determination dissolve the precipitate in hydrochloric acid and boil add a slight excess of carbonate of soda warm and filter wash with hot water dry carefully ignite in an open berlin crucible and weigh the substance is the brown oxide mn3o4 and contains 7205 per cent of manganese if the percentage of dioxide is required it may be calculated by multiplying the percentage of manganese by 1582 it must be borne in mind that the manganese should never be calculated to dioxide except when it is known to exist in the ore only in that form volumetric methods the two methods are based on the oxidising effect of manganese dioxide and if the metal does not already exist in this form it will require a preliminary treatment to convert it the following method due to mr j pattinson82 effects this a quantity of the ore containing not more than 25 grams of the metal mn is dissolved in hydrochloric acid in a pint beaker and if necessary 3 or 4 cc of nitric acid are added to peroxidise the iron and ferric chloride is added if required so that there may be at least as much iron as manganese calcium carbonate is added till the solution is slightly red and next the redness is removed by the cautious addition of acid 30 cc of zinc chloride solution containing 15 grams of zinc per litre are added the liquid is brought to boil and diluted to about 300 cc with boiling water 60 cc of a solution of bleaching powder 33 grams to the litre and filtered rendered slightly greenish by acid are then run in and are followed by 3 grams of calcium carbonate suspended in 15 cc of boiling water during effervescence the beaker is covered the precipitate is stirred and 2 cc of methylated spirit are mixed in the precipitate is collected on a large filter washed with cold water and then with hot till free from chlorine which is tested for with starch and potassium iodide the acid ferrous sulphate solution presently described is then measured into the beaker and the precipitate still in the paper added more acid is added if necessary and the solution is diluted and titrated in place of bleaching powder solution 90 cc of bromine water containing 22 grams per litre may be used ferrous sulphate assay this method which is the one commonly used is based on the determination of the amount of ferrous iron oxidised by a known weight of the ore it is known that 87 parts of the dioxide will oxidise 112 parts of ferrous iron83 therefore 1 gram will oxidise 1287 gram of ferrous iron or 1 gram of ferrous iron oxidised will be equivalent to 07768 gram of the dioxide the finelydivided substance containing the dioxide is digested in a solution of a known quantity of iron in sulphuric acid the iron of course must be in excess which excess is determined when the ore is dissolved by titrating with standard permanganate or bichromate of potash solution the assay resolves itself into one for the determination of ferrous iron for which the standard solutions and method of working described under iron are used the assay is as followsfor rich ores 2 grams of clean soft iron wire are treated in a pint flask with 100 cc of dilute sulphuric acid and warmed till dissolved carefully sample the ore and in one portion determine the moisture at 100 c grind the rest in a wedgwood mortar with a little pure alcohol until free from grit this reduces the substance to a finelydivided state and assists solution evaporate off the alcohol and dry at 100 c mix well and keep in a weighingbottle weigh up 2 grams and add them to the solution of iron in the flask carefully wash it all down into the acid liquid on rotating the flask the ore will rapidly dissolve but gentle heat may be used towards the end to complete the solution when the residue is clean and sandylooking and free from black particles the flask is cooled and the residual ferrous iron is determined by titration with permanganate the iron thus found deducted from the 2 grams taken will give the amount of iron peroxidised by the dioxide contained in the 2 grams of ore this divided by 2 and multiplied by 7768 will give the percentage of dioxide in the sample or multiplied by 4941 will give that of metallic manganese when the quantity of manganese or of the dioxide to be determined is small it is not necessary to use 2 grams of iron 1 gram or even less may be taken the iron may be used in the form of a standard solution of ferrous sulphate and portions measured off thus saving the labour of weighing determination of dioxide in a manganese oreweigh up 1 or 2 grams of the finelypowdered ore84 and an equal weight of pure iron wire dissolve the wire in 50 or 100 cc of dilute sulphuric acid and when solution is complete add the ore and warm till it too is dissolved cool and titrate the remaining ferrous iron with the permanganate or bichromate of potassium solution for example 07560 gram of pyrolusite and 1000 gram of iron were taken and treated as above 139 cc of permanganate standard 100 cc 04920 gram iron were required this indicates that 00684 gram of iron was left unoxidised by the ore the iron oxidised then was 09316 gram 1000 00684 multiplying this by 07768 we find that 07237 gram is the quantity of manganese dioxide which was present this is equivalent to 9577 per cent 07560 07237 100 9577 iodine method it has been already stated that when dioxide of manganese is boiled with strong hydrochloric acid chlorine is given off and that the amount of chlorine so liberated is a measure of the dioxide present if the chlorine is passed into a solution of potassium iodide an equivalent of iodine will be set free85 this is apparently a very indirect way of determining how much of the dioxide is present but the reactions are very sharp and the final determination of the iodine is an easy one illustration fig 60 the finelypowdered sample of dioxide is placed in a small flask provided with an exit tube leading into a solution of potassic iodide fig 60 on adding hydrochloric acid and boiling the chlorine evolved is driven into the iodide solution and there absorbed the boiling is continued till the steam and hydrochloric acid fumes have driven the last portions of the chlorine out of the flask and into the solution in this experiment there is a strong tendency for the iodide solution to rush back into the flask this tendency is overcome by avoiding draughts and regulating the heat or by placing a lump of magnesite in the flask which acts by evolving carbonic acid and so producing a steady outward pressure when the distillation is finished the tube containing the iodine is detached and washed out into a beaker if the solution is strongly acid it should be almost neutralised by the cautious addition of dilute ammonia if crystals of iodine have separated potassium iodide must be added in quantity sufficient to dissolve them the condenser must be kept cool whilst the chlorine is passing into it the solution transferred to a beaker is titrated with a standard solution of sodic hyposulphite 100 cc 127 gram iodine or 0435 gram of dioxide of manganese in titrating the solution should be cold or not warmer than 30 c the bulk may vary from 100 to 200 cc but it is best always to work with the same volume the hypo is run in with constant agitation until the brown colour has been reduced to a light yellow 5 cc of starch solution are then added and the titration cautiously continued until the end is reached the finish is indicated by a change from blue to colourless the assay solution may be acidified with acetic sulphuric or hydrochloric acid before titrating with hypo but it must be only faintly so an excess of acid may be nearly neutralised with ammonia without interference but excess of alkali is fatal bicarbonate of soda must not be used in excess it is best to avoid it altogether the assay solution should be titrated at once as it weakens on standing and the hypo solution should be standardised every two or three days as its strength is not constant the standard solution of hyposulphite of soda is made by dissolving 25 grams of the salt na2s2o35h2o in water and diluting to 1 litre 100 cc are equivalent to 127 gram of iodine this solution is standardised by weighing in a small beaker about half a gram of iodine to which is added a crystal or two of potassium iodide and a few drops of water when dissolved the solution is diluted to 100 cc and titrated in the manner described the starch solution is made in the manner described under the iodide copper assay 5 cc are used for each titration in determining the effects of variations in the condition of the assay a solution of iodine was used which was equivalent in strength to the hypo solution it was made by dissolving 127 grams of iodine with 25 grams of potassium iodide in a little water and diluting to 1 litre 100 cc of this solution were found at the time of the experiments to be equivalent to 1020 cc of the hypo effect of varying temperaturethe bulk of the solution was 100 cc 20 cc of iodine were taken and 5 cc of starch solution were added towards the end as indicator these conditions are also those of the other experiments except where otherwise stated iodine being volatile it is to be expected that with hot solutions low results will be obtained temperature 15 20 40 60 80 hypo required 204 cc 204 cc 201 cc 192 cc 155 cc these show that the temperature should not much exceed 20 effect of exposure of the iodine solutiontwenty cc of the iodine were diluted to 100 cc and exposed for varying lengths of time in open beakers at the ordinary temperature and then titrated time exposed 1 day 2 days 3 days hypo required 204 cc 161 cc 136 cc 94 cc effect of varying bulkthese experiments were carried out in the usual way bulk only varying bulk 1000 cc 2000 cc 3000 cc 5000 cc hypo required 204 204 204 204

assay of manganese ores hydrochloric and hydriodic acids are the only ones likely to be present effect of alkalieson theoretical grounds the presence of these is known to be inadmissible a solution rendered faintly alkaline with ammonia required only 112 cc of hypo and another with 05 gram of caustic soda required 40 cc instead of 204 cc as in neutral solutions effect of nearly neutralising hydrochloric acid solutions with ammoniaprovided care is taken not to add excess of ammonia this has a good effect counteracting the interference of excess of acid thus 20 cc of iodine as before required 204 cc of hypo with 15 cc of hydrochloric acid 207 cc were required but with 15 cc of acid nearly neutralised with dilute ammonia 204 cc were used effect of the addition of starchthe addition of varying quantities of starch has no effect provided it is added when the titration is nearly finished as the following experiments show starch added 10 cc 50 cc 100 cc 500 cc hypo required 204 204 204 205 but if the starch is added before the titration the results are liable to error starch added 10 cc 500 cc hypo required 204 240 the starch should be used fresh and is best made on the day it is used after four days the finishing point is not so good effect of varying potassium iodidean excess of iodide is always required to keep the iodine in solution a larger excess has little effect iodide added 1 gram 20 grams hypo required 204 cc 205 cc 206 cc the 20 cc of iodine used itself contained 05 gram of potassium iodide effect of foreign salts bicarbonate of soda added 05 gram 15 gram 50 grams hypo required 204 cc 182 cc 171 cc 160 cc the solution obviously must be free from bicarbonate of soda this should be remembered since when titrating arsenic assays with iodine it must be present and students must avoid confounding the two titrations in some other experiments in which 10 grams each of the salts were taken the following results were obtained salt added amcl amno3 am2so4

204 510 1020 determination of dioxide in a manganese oreweigh up 025 to 03 gram of the powdered ore place in a flask cover with 10 cc of hydrochloric acid and close the flask with a paraffined cork and bulbs as shown in fig 60 having previously charged the bulb with 5 grams of potassium iodide in strong solution heat the flask and boil cautiously for about fifteen minutes wash the contents of the bulbs into a large beaker nearly but not quite neutralise with dilute ammonia and titrate with the standard hypo as an example 02675 gram of pyrolusite was taken and required 603 cc of standard hypo 100 cc equal 1185 gram iodine or 04042 gram mno2 which equals 02437 gram of the dioxide or 911 per cent colorimetric method when compounds of manganese free from chlorides are boiled with nitric acid and dioxide of lead87 the manganese is converted into permanganic acid which is soluble and tints the solution violet the depth of colour depends on the amount of manganese present and this should not much exceed 10 milligrams a quantity of substance containing not more than this amount of manganese should be boiled for a few minutes with 25 cc of a solution containing 5 cc of nitric acid and 10 or 20 cc of dilute sulphuric acid with 2 or 3 grams of lead dioxide filter through asbestos wash by decantation with dilute sulphuric acid make up with distilled water88 to a definite bulk and take a measured portion for the colorimetric determination the standard solution of manganese is made by dissolving 01435 gram of permanganate of potash kmno4 in a little water acidulated with nitric acid and diluting to 1 litre one cc will contain 005 milligram of manganese practical exercises 1 what percentage of manganese mn is contained in permanganate of potash kmno4 2 ten cc of a solution of permanganate of potash is found to oxidise 10 cc of an acid solution of ferrous sulphate the manganese is determined in the titrated solution by precipitation as dioxide and titrating how much of the ferrous solution will be oxidised in the second titration 3 what weight of potassium iodide would be just sufficient to absorb the chlorine evolved by 05 gram of pure dioxide of manganese 4 what weight of iron must be dissolved up so as to have an excess of 025 gram after oxidation by 1 gram of pure dioxide 5 what weight of the brown oxide mn2o4 will be left on igniting 1 gram of the pure dioxide chromium chromium occurs in nature chiefly as chromite or chrome iron ore feo2cr2o3 with more or less mgo and al2o3 which is the chief ore it is a constituent of some silicates and is frequently met with in very small quantities in iron ores it occurs as chromate in crocoisite pbcro4 and some other rare minerals the metal is used in steelmaking steel containing about 05 per cent of it is rendered very hard but its chief value is in its salts the chromates these are highlycoloured compounds generally red or yellow some of the insoluble chromates are used as pigments chromate of lead or chromeyellow is the most important the soluble chromates those of soda and potash are valuable chemicals and are largely used in the preparation of pigments dyeing and tanning and as oxidising agents chromium forms two important classes of compoundschromic salts corresponding to the oxide cr2o3 and chromates which contain the trioxide cro3 solutions of chromic salts are green whilst those of the chromates are yellow chromates are reduced to chromic salts by the action of most reducing agents in the presence of an acid and this property is used in assaying for the volumetric determination of ferrous iron c the chromates in solution are more stable than other similar oxidising agents and consequently are generally used in the laboratory as one of the standard oxidising agents for volumetric analysis they have the disadvantage of requiring an outside indicator bichromate of potash k2cr2o7 is the salt generally used for this purpose chromic salts are oxidised to chromate by fusion with fusion mixture and nitre or by treating with chlorine in an alkaline solution chromic salts closely resemble those of ferric iron and in the ordinary course of analysis chromic hydrate green is precipitated together with ferric hydrate alumina c on the addition of ammonic chloride and ammonia the ignited oxide cr2o3 however is not reduced on heating to redness in a current of hydrogen detectionchromium is detected by fusing the powdered substance with fusion mixture and nitre the melt is extracted with water and filtered the filtrate is acidified with acetic acid and treated with a few drops of a solution of lead acetate a yellow precipitate indicates chromium substances containing chromium impart a green colour to the borax bead in both flames small quantities of chromate in neutral solution can be found by the dark or violetred colouration imparted thereto on boiling with a dilute decoction of logwood solution and separationchromates and chromic salts are generally soluble in water or dilute acids chrome iron ore however and ignited chromic oxide are insoluble and the former presents considerable difficulty on attempting to open up by the usual methods a large number of mixtures have been tried in order to get all the chromium in a soluble form among these are the following one part of the very finelypowdered ore is fused with any of these mixtures 1 10 parts of bisulphate of potash 2 5 parts of bisulphate of potash and 5 parts of potassium fluoride 3 5 parts of hydric potassic fluoride 4 12 parts of bisulphate of potash and afterwards with 6 parts of carbonate of soda and 6 parts of nitre 5 8 parts of borax afterwards with carbonate of soda till it ceases to effervesce then with 3 parts of carbonate of soda and 3 of nitre 6 4 parts of borax and 6 parts of fusion mixture 7 12 parts of caustic potash 8 10 parts of caustic soda and 30 of magnesia 9 5 parts of caustic soda and 3 of magnesia 10 2 parts of carbonate of soda and 1 of lime 11 6 parts of sodalime and 2 of chlorate of potash 12 sodium peroxide of these numbers 1 2 and 3 yield the chromium in a form soluble in dilute acids as chromic salt the rest in a form soluble in water as potassium or sodium chromate on boiling an insoluble chromium compound with chlorate of potash and nitric acid the chromium passes into solution as chromate this method however does not answer for chrome iron ore in the fusion methods the ore must be very finely powdered well mixed with the fluxes and subjected to a prolonged fusion in a platinum vessel at a high temperature undecomposed particles require refusion the aqueous extract containing the chromate is ready for volumetric work except in those cases where nitre has been used for gravimetric work the solution is acidified with hydrochloric acid then mixed with ammonia in slight excess boiled and filtered the filtrate is acidified with hydrochloric acid and treated with sulphuretted hydrogen warmed rendered slightly alkaline with ammonia and the gas again passed the chromium is precipitated as chromic hydrate mixed with sulphur from the reduction with sulphuretted hydrogen it is filtered off washed with hot water and ignited it is weighed as chromic oxide gravimetric determination the solution containing the chromium freed from other metals and earths and in the form of green chromic salt is heated to boiling if any chromate is present reduce it with sodium sulphite or sulphuretted hydrogen add ammonia in slight excess boil till the liquid is free from a red tint and allow to settle for a few minutes filter wash with hot water dry and ignite strongly in a looselycovered crucible cool and weigh the substance is chromic oxide cr2o3 and contains 6862 per cent of chromium it is a darkgreen powder insoluble in acids when as is generally the case the chromium exists altogether as chromate phosphates and arsenates being absent it is best to proceed as followsrender the solution acid with acetic acid then add sodium acetate to the solution and heat nearly to boiling next treat with a slight excess of acetate of lead and boil allow to settle and filter wash the precipitate with hot water dry in the wateroven or at a low temperature transfer the precipitate to a weighed berlin crucible burn the filter separately ignite below redness cool in the desiccator and weigh the substance is lead chromate pbcro4 and contains 161 per cent of chromium or 2353 per cent of chromic oxide cr2o3 volumetric method this is based on the oxidation of ferrous iron by the solution containing the chromium as chromate a known weight of iron 05 1 or 15 gram according to the quantity of chromate is dissolved in 50 cc of dilute sulphuric acid the solution containing the chromate is added and the remaining ferrous iron titrated with the permanganate or bichromate of potassium solution as described under iron the iron thus found is deducted from that taken and the difference gives the iron oxidised by the chromate this multiplied by 03101 gives the chromium cr and when multiplied by 04529 gives the chromic oxide cr2o3 colorimetric method small quantities of chromium may be determined after conversion into chromate colorimetrically the solution which should not contain more than a few milligrams in 100 cc is acidified with acetic acid and compared against an equal volume of water rendered acid with acetic acid and tinted with a standard bichromate of potassium solution this standard bichromate is made by dissolving 2827 grams of the salt in water and diluting to 1 litre one cc will contain 1 milligram of chromium cr the manner of working this assay is the same as that adopted in the other colorimetric processes determination of chromium in steel89weigh up 24 grams dissolve in hydrochloric acid and evaporate to dryness fuse with sodium carbonate and nitre extract with water and make up to 301 cc take 250 cc of the clear liquor boil with hydrochloric acid add sodium phosphate and then ammonia in slight excess heat till clear filter off the precipitate dissolve it in hydrochloric acid and evaporate to dryness take up with a little acid filter and precipitate with a slight excess of ammonia wash ignite and weigh as chromium phosphate 3cr2o32p2o5 which contains 422 per cent of chromium vanadium vanadium occurs in certain rare minerals such as vanadinite 3pb3vo42pbcl2 a vanadate of lead mottramite a vanadate of copper and lead and dechenite a vanadate of lead and zinc it is occasionally found in iron and copper ores and in the slags from them in spanish copperprecipitates it is found along with chromium and is probably derived from the iron used for precipitating the vanadates like the chromates are coloured compounds generally yellow or red on reduction blue solutions are got in their general reactions vanadates resemble phosphates vanadium is detected by the red colouration produced by passing sulphuretted hydrogen into ammoniacal solutions for some time on adding an acid to the filtered solution a brown precipitate of the sulphide is produced this gives with borax a colourless bead in the oxidising and a green one in the reducing flame it is separated by fusing the ore with potassic nitrate extracting with water and precipitating with baric chloride the precipitate is boiled with dilute sulphuric acid filtered neutralised with ammonia and saturated with ammonic chloride ammonium vanadate separates out it is filtered off ignited and weighed as vanadic oxide v2o5 containing 5618 per cent of vanadium molybdenum molybdenum occurs in nature chiefly as molybdenite mos2 it also occurs in wulfenite a molybdate of lead pbmoo4 and in molybdic ochre moo3 molybdate of ammonia is an important reagent in the determination of phosphates the manufacture of which compound is the chief purpose to which molybdenum is applied iron and copper ores frequently contain molybdenum sometimes in quantity consequently it is met with in slags and pigiron molybdenum forms several series of salts in those corresponding to the lower oxides it is basic but the trioxide moo3 is the acid oxide which forms a series of salts called the molybdates all molybdenum compounds are converted into the trioxide by boiling with nitric acid the trioxide is a white powder readily dissolved by ammonia it fuses at a red heat and volatilises freely in contact with air it is slightly soluble in water molybdates are easily reduced with the production of coloured solutions by most reducing agents sulphuretted hydrogen first produces a blue tint and then precipitates a brown sulphide the precipitation as sulphide is only complete on prolonged treatment a green colour indicates that some molybdenum still remains in solution the precipitated sulphide is soluble in ammonium sulphide detectionmolybdenum is detected by its behaviour with sulphuretted hydrogen molybdenite can only be mistaken for graphite from which it is easily distinguished by yielding sulphur dioxide on roasting and by giving on charcoal a yellowish white incrustation which becomes blue on touching it for a moment with the reducing flame the boraxbead is colourless in the oxidising and darkbrown in the reducing flame gravimetric determination the solution containing the molybdate is neutralised and treated with an excess of mercurous nitrate the precipitate is allowed to settle for some time filtered and washed with a dilute solution of mercurous nitrate then it is dried transferred to a weighed berlin crucible containing ignited oxide of lead mixed ignited and weighed the increase in weight gives the amount of trioxide moo3 this contains 667 per cent of molybdenum uranium uranium occurs chiefly as pitchblende which is an impure oxide u3o8 it is also found as sulphate in uranochre johannite c and as phosphate in the uranites torbernite hydrated phosphate of uranium and copper and autunite hydrated phosphate of uranium and lime it also occurs in some rarer minerals the oxide is used for colouring glass and the nitrate and acetate are used as reagents uranium yellow used for enamel painting is sodium uranate the uranates in which the oxide of uranium acts as an acid are mostly insoluble and of secondary importance uranium forms two families of salts uranous and uranic corresponding to the oxides uo2 and uo3 respectively the former are generally green and the latter yellow uranous salts are converted into uranic by boiling with nitric acid or other oxidising agents uranic salts on the other hand are easily reduced by sulphuretted hydrogen stannous chloride or zinc this property is made use of in determining the quantity of uranium in pure solutions by titrating with permanganate of potassium solution as in the case with iron detectionthe most characteristic reaction of the uranium compounds is their behaviour in the presence of alkaline carbonates in which they are freely soluble even ammonium sulphide will not precipitate uranium from these solutions on neutralising the carbonate with an acid a uranate of the alkali is precipitated ammonia or sodic hydrate free from carbonates

hydrochloric acid dilute pass sulphuretted hydrogen and filter peroxidise the filtrate with a little nitric acid add an excess of ammonic carbonate and some ammonium sulphide and filter render the solution acid boil and precipitate the uranium by means of ammonia filter off and wash it with dilute ammonic chloride ignite and weigh as protosesquioxide u3o8 gravimetric determination the solution containing the uranium free from other metals is if required first peroxidised by boiling with nitric acid ammonia in slight excess is added to the nearlyboiling solution a yellow precipitate is formed which is filtered off hot and washed with a dilute solution of ammonium chloride the precipitate is dried and ignited and weighed as u3o8 which contains 848 per cent of uranium volumetric method this is based on the precipitation of uranium as phosphate from acetic acid solutions and the recognition of complete precipitation by testing with potassic ferrocyanide it is the converse of the process for the volumetric determination of phosphate the standard solution of phosphate is prepared by dissolving 29835 grams of hydric sodic phosphate na2hpo412h2o in water and diluting to 1 litre 100 cc will be equivalent to 2 grams of uranium take 1 gram of the sample or if poor in uranium 2 grams and separate the uranium as described dissolve the precipitate in nitric acid and evaporate to a small bulk add 2 grams of sodium acetate dilute with water to 100 cc and boil titrate the boiling solution with the sodium phosphate till it ceases to give a brown colouration with

in nature fairly pure in the mineral corundum transparent and coloured varieties of which form the gems sapphire and ruby a coarser compact variety contaminated with oxide of iron constitutes emery compounded with silica alumina forms the base of clays and many rockforming minerals china clay or kaolin is used as a source of alumina bauxite hydrated alumina is also used for the same purposethat is for the preparation of sulphate of alumina the mineral cryolite is a fluoride of aluminium and sodium corundum is characterised by a high specific gravity 40 and extreme hardness by these it is distinguished from felspar and similar minerals which it somewhat resembles in general appearance aluminium is used for a variety of small purposes it is white light and very tenacious but owing to the difficulty of its reduction it is expensive aluminium forms one series of salts which closely resemble those of ferric iron it forms an interesting series of double sulphates known as the alums common potash alum is al2so43k2so424h2o detectionalumina is not precipitated from its acid solution by sulphuretted hydrogen but it is thrown down by ammonia with the other earths as a white hydrate soluble in soda and insoluble in ammonic carbonate filtered off and ignited it assumes after treatment with nitrate of cobalt before the blowpipe a blue colour which is characteristic with natural compounds containing metallic oxides this colour is masked it is more satisfactory to make a separation in the wet way and to test the ignited oxide separation and solutionif the substance is insoluble in hydrochloric acid it is finely powdered and fused with fusion mixture with the help in the case of corundum which is very refractory of a little caustic soda or potash the method of working is the same as that described for opening up silicates see under silica corundum cannot be powdered in wedgwood or even agate mortars since it rapidly wears these away and becomes contaminated with their powder it is best to use a hard steel mortar and to extract the metallic particles from the bruised sample with a magnet or dilute acid when the substance has been completely attacked and dissolved it is evaporated to dryness with an excess of hydrochloric acid on the waterbath to render any silica present insoluble the residue is extracted with hydrochloric acid and freed from the second group of metals by means of sulphuretted hydrogen the filtrate from this after removing the sulphuretted hydrogen by boiling is nearly neutralised and treated with 8 or 10 grams of hyposulphite of soda90 in solution it is then boiled till the sulphurous oxide is driven off the precipitate is filtered off ignited and weighed as alumina it is sometimes more convenient to proceed as followsafter boiling off the sulphuretted hydrogen peroxidise the iron with a little nitric acid add a solution of ammonic chloride and then ammonia in very slight excess boil filter wash ignite and weigh the oxides these generally consist of ferric oxide and alumina it is a common practice to determine the iron calculate it to ferric oxide and so to estimate the alumina indirectly this may be done either by igniting in a current of hydrogen and estimating the iron by the weight of oxygen lost or by dissolving with sulphuric and hydrochloric acids and determining the iron volumetrically it should be borne in mind that these oxides will also contain any phosphoric oxide that happened to be in the mineral in general analyses of samples containing alumina it may be contained in both the soluble and insoluble portions in these cases it is better to fuse the sample with fusion mixture before treatment with acids the alumina in the fused mass will exist in a state soluble in acids gravimetric determination solutions containing alumina free from the other metals are diluted to a convenient bulk and heated nearly to boiling add chloride of ammonium and then ammonia in slight excess boil allow to settle filter and wash with hot water dry the precipitate and ignite in a platinum or porcelain crucible at the strongest heat cool and weigh the substance is alumina al2o3 which contains 5294 per cent of aluminium it is only in special cases such as the analysis of metals and alloys that it is reported as aluminium the percentage of alumina is generally given ignited alumina is difficultly soluble in acids it is not reduced by hydrogen at a red heat ignited with ammonium chloride portions are volatilised direct determination of alumina in the presence of ironthe iron and alumina are precipitated as hydrates by ammonia the precipitate is dissolved in hydrochloric acid and the iron reduced to the ferrous state it is then added to a hot solution of potash or soda the solution is boiled till the precipitate settles readily filtered and washed with hot water the alumina is contained in the filtrate which is acidified with hydrochloric acid and the alumina precipitated therefrom as hydrate with ammonia as just described determination of alumina in the presence of phosphates and ironfor details see a paper by rt thomson in the journal of the society of chemical industry v p 152 the principles of the method are as followsif the substance does not already contain sufficient phosphoric oxide to saturate the alumina some phosphate is added the iron is reduced to the ferrous state and phosphate of alumina precipitated in an acetic acid solution it is purified by reprecipitation ignited and weighed as phosphate al2o3p2o5 which contains 418 per cent of alumina al2o3 examination of clays moisturetake 5 grams of the carefullyprepared sample and dry in the wateroven till the weight is constant loss on ignitionweigh up 2 grams of the sample used for the moisture determination and ignite in a platinumcrucible to redness cool and weigh silica and insoluble silicatesweigh up another 2 grams of the dried sample and place them in a platinum dish moisten with water and cover with 20 cc of sulphuric acid evaporate and heat gently to drive off the greater portion of the free acid allow to cool and repeat the operation extract by boiling with dilute hydrochloric acid filter wash dry ignite and weigh the quantity of insoluble silicates is determined by dissolving out the separated silica with a strong boiling solution of sodium carbonate the residue washed dried and ignited is weighed and reported as sand alumina and ferrous oxideto the filtrate from the silica add soda solution till nearly neutral and then sodium acetate boil and filter off the precipitate reserve the filtrate dissolve the precipitate in hydrochloric acid and dilute to exactly 200 cc divide into two parts of 100 cc each in one determine the iron by reducing and titrating in the way described under volumetric iron calculate the percentage as ferrous oxide unless there are reasons to the contrary also calculate its weight as ferric oxide to the other portion add ammonia in slight excess and boil filter wash with hot water dry ignite and weigh as mixed alumina and ferric oxide the weight of the ferric oxide has already been determined in the first portion deduct it and the difference is the weight of alumina limeto the reserved filtrate concentrated by evaporation add ammonium oxalate and ammonia boil filter ignite strongly and weigh as lime magnesia is separated from the filtrate by adding sodium phosphate it is weighed as magnesium pyrophosphate potash and sodathese are determined in a fresh portion of the sample by lawrence smiths method as described on page 333 thoria this is an oxide of thorium tho2 it is only found in a few rare minerals it is a heavy oxide having when strongly ignited a specific gravity of 92 in the ordinary course of analysis it will be separated and weighed as alumina it is separated from this and other earths by the following method the solution in hydrochloric acid is nearly neutralised and then boiled with sodium hyposulphite the thoria will be in the precipitate it is dissolved and the solution heated with ammonium oxalate in excess the precipitate is thorium oxalate which is washed with hot water dried and ignited it is then weighed as thoria tho2 thoria which has been ignited is not readily soluble in acids zirconia the oxide of zirconium zro2 is found in the mineral zircon a silicate of zirconia zrsio4 when heated intensely it becomes very luminous and is used on this account for incandescent lights in the ordinary course it is thrown down by ammonia with the other earths from which it is thus separatedthe hydrates precipitated in the cold and washed with cold water are dissolved in hydrochloric acid nearly neutralised with soda and precipitated by boiling with hyposulphite of soda dissolve and from the hydrochloric acid solution precipitate the thoria if any with ammonium oxalate to the filtrate add carbonate of ammonia which will precipitate any titanium present the zirconia will be in solution and is recovered by precipitating with potassium sulphate or by evaporating the solution and igniting it is separated from alumina by taking advantage of its insolubility in potassic hydrate it is estimated in zircons in the following waythe powdered substance is fused with bisulphate of potash and extracted with dilute sulphuric acid the residue is fused with caustic soda and extracted with water the portion not dissolved consisting of zirconate of soda is dissolved in hydrochloric acid the solution is diluted filtered if necessary and treated with ammonia in excess the precipitate is filtered off washed with hot water dried ignited and weighed as zirconia zro2 this is a white powder which is insoluble in acids even in hydrofluoric acid it is only slightly attacked cerium cerium occurs as silicate together with the oxides of lanthanum didymium iron and calcium in the mineral cerite which is its chief source it also occurs as phosphate in monazite and as fluoride in fluocerite the oxalate is used in medicine cerium forms two classes of salts corresponding to the oxides cerous oxide ce2o3 and ceric oxide ceo2 compounds of cerium with volatile acids yield dioxide on ignition and this on solution in hydrochloric acid yields cerous chloride and chlorine in the ordinary course cerium is thrown down along with alumina and the other earths by ammonia it is separated by dissolving the hydrates in hydrochloric acid and oxidizing with chlorine water on treating with oxalic acid cerium lanthanum and didymium are precipitated as oxalates which on ignition are converted into oxides these are soluble in acids their solution in hydrochloric acid is nearly neutralised acetate of soda is then added and an excess of sodium hypochlorite on boiling the cerium is precipitated as dioxide which is filtered off ignited and weighed cerium is detected by giving with borax a bead which is yellow in the oxidising and colourless in the reducing flame traces of cerium compounds boiled with dioxide of lead and nitric acid will give a yellow solution lanthanum and didymium occur together with cerium in cerite and are separated with that metal as oxalates as described under cerium didymium salts have a rose or violet colour and impart when in sufficient quantity the same colour to the borax bead solutions have a characteristic absorptionspectrum the separation of lanthanum and didymium in the solution from which the cerium has been precipitated is effected by precipitating them together as oxalates igniting and dissolving in dilute nitric acid this solution is then evaporated to dryness and ignited for a few minutes just below redness a subnitrate of didymium is formed and remains as an insoluble residue on extracting with hot water the separated salts are treated with ammonia and ignited and weighed as oxides la2o3 and di2o3 yttria yttria is found in gadolinite and some other rare minerals it is precipitated along with the other earths by ammonia it is distinguished by the insolubility of its hydrate in potash by the insolubility of its oxalate in oxalic acid and by not being precipitated by hyposulphite of soda or potassium sulphate further it is precipitated by potash in the presence of tartaric acid as an insoluble tartrate this reaction distinguishes the members of the yttria group from most of the other earths the other members of the group closely resemble it and amongst them are erbia terbia ytterbia scandia c beryllia the oxide of beryllium beo also known as glucina occurs in nature mainly as silicate beryl the green transparent variety of which is the emerald is the best known of these it is a silicate of alumina and beryllia91 some other minerals in which it occurs are phenakite euclase and chrysoberyl in the ordinary course of analysis beryllia will be precipitated with alumina c by ammonic hydrate it is distinguished by the solubility of its hydrate in ammonic carbonate by not being precipitated by boiling with sodium hyposulphite and by not being precipitated by ammonic sulphide from an ammonic carbonate solution the analysis of silicates containing beryllia is thus effected the finely powdered substance is fused with twice its weight of potassium carbonate and the melt is extracted with water and evaporated with a slight excess of sulphuric acid to render the silica insoluble treat with water filter and evaporate the filtrate until a crust is formed potash alum crystallises out the liquor is poured off into a warm strong solution of ammonium carbonate ferric hydrate and alumina will be precipitated they are filtered off redissolved and again precipitated in ammonic carbonate solution the combined filtrates are boiled for some time and acidified slightly with hydrochloric acid the carbon dioxide is boiled off and the beryllia is then precipitated as hydrate with ammonia the hydrate is washed with hot water dried ignited and weighed as beryllia beo beryllia has a specific gravity of 308 it is white infusible and insoluble in water after ignition it is insoluble in acids except sulphuric but is rendered soluble by fusion with alkalies beryllia in a solution of carbonate of ammonia is precipitated as carbonate on boiling in proportion as the carbonate of ammonia is volatilised the hydrate is dissolved by a boiling solution of ammonic chloride ammonia being evolved the alkaline earths lime lime is an oxide of calcium cao it occurs abundantly in nature but only in a state of combination the carbonate caco3 found as limestone chalk and other rocks and as the minerals calcite and arragonite is the most commonly occurring compound the hydrated sulphate gypsum caso42h2o is common and is used in making plaster of paris anhydrite caso4 also occurs in rock masses and is often associated with rock salt phosphate of lime in the forms of apatite phosphorite coprolite c is largely mined lime is a component of most natural silicates calcium also occurs combined with fluorine in the mineral fluor caf2 in most of these the acid is the important part of the mineral it is only the carbonate which is used as a source of lime lime in addition to its use in mortars and cements is valuable as a flux in metallurgical operations and as a base in chemical work on a large scale a mixture of lime and magnesia is used in the manufacture of basic firebricks carbonate of lime on ignition especially when in contact with reducing substances loses carbonic acid and becomes lime this is known as quicklime on treatment with water it becomes hot expands and falls to a powder of slaked lime or calcium hydrate cah2o2 the hydrate is slightly soluble in water 01368 gram in 100 cc forming an alkaline solution known as limewater calcium hydrate is more generally used suspended in water as milk of lime as a flux it is used either as limestone or as quicklime silica forms with lime a compound calcium silicate which is not very fusible but when alumina and other oxides are present as in clays and in most rocky substances the addition of lime gives a very fusible slag detectioncalcium is detected by the reddish colour which its salts impart to the flame it is best to moisten with hydrochloric acid or in the case of some silicates to treat with ammonium fluoride before bringing the substance into the flame when seen through a spectroscope it shows a large number of lines of which a green and an orange are most intense and characteristic calcium is detected in solution after removal of the metals by treatment with sulphuretted hydrogen and ammonium sulphide by boiling with ammonium oxalate and ammonia the lime is completely thrown down as a white precipitate lime is distinguished from the other alkaline earths by forming a sulphate insoluble in dilute alcohol but completely soluble in a boiling solution of ammonium sulphate lime compounds are for the most part soluble in water or in dilute hydrochloric acid calcium fluoride must be first converted into sulphate by evaporation in a platinum dish with sulphuric acid insoluble silicates are opened up by fusion with fusion mixture as described under silica separationthe separation of lime is effected by evaporating with hydrochloric acid to separate silica and by treating with sulphuretted hydrogen to remove the second group of metals if the substance contains much iron the solution is next oxidised by boiling with a little nitric acid and the iron alumina c are removed as basic acetates the filtrate is treated with ammonia and sulphuretted hydrogen and allowed to settle the filtrate from this is heated to boiling treated with a solution of ammonium oxalate in excess boiled for five or ten minutes allowed to settle for half an hour and filtered the precipitate contains all the lime as calcium oxalate gravimetric determination the precipitate of calcium oxalate is washed with hot water dried transferred to a weighed platinum crucible and ignited at a temperature not above incipient redness this ignition converts the oxalate into carbonate with evolution of carbonic oxide which burns at the mouth of the crucible with a blue flame92 generally a small quantity of the carbonate is at the same time converted into lime to reconvert it into carbonate moisten with a few drops of ammonic carbonate solution and dry in a wateroven heat gently over a bunsen burner cool and weigh the substance is calcium carbonate caco3 and contains 56 per cent of lime cao it is a white powder and should show no alkaline reaction with moistened litmuspaper where the precipitate is small it is better to ignite strongly over the blowpipe and weigh directly as lime with larger quantities and when many determinations have to be made it is easier to make the determination volumetrically volumetric methods these are carried out either by dissolving the oxalate at once in dilute sulphuric acid and titrating with permanganate of potassium solution or by calcining it to a mixture of lime and carbonate and determining its neutralising power with the standard solutions of acid and alkali titration with permanganate of potassium solutionthis solution is made by dissolving 5643 grams of the salt in water and by diluting to 1 litre 100 cc are equivalent to 05 gram of lime the solution is standardised by titrating a quantity of oxalic acid about equivalent to the lime present in the assay 05 gram of lime is equivalent to 1125 gram of crystallised oxalic acid the standardising may be done with iron the standard found for iron multiplied by 05 gives that for lime the process is as followsthe calcium oxalate having been precipitated and washed as in the gravimetric process is washed through the funnel into a flask with hot dilute sulphuric acid boiled till dissolved diluted to 200 cc with water and heated to about 80 c the standard solution of permanganate is then run in not too quickly and with constant shaking until a permanent pink tinge is produced the cc used multiplied by the standard and divided by the weight of the substance taken will give the percentage of lime estimation of lime by alkalimetrythe methods of determining the amount of an alkali or base by means of a standard acid solution or conversely of determining an acid by means of a standard alkaline solution are so closely related that they are best considered under one head the same standard solution is applicable for many purposes and consequently it is convenient to make it of such strength that one litre of it shall equal an equivalent in grams of any of the substances to be determined such solutions are termed normal for example a solution of hydrochloric acid hcl 365 containing 365 grams of real acid per litre would be normal and of equivalent strength to a solution containing either 17 grams of ammonia nh3 17 or 40 grams of sodic hydrate naho 40 per litre it will be seen in these cases that the normal solution contains the molecular weight in grams per litre and if solutions of these strengths be made it will be found that they possess equal neutralising value if now a solution containing 98 grams of sulphuric acid h2so4 98 per litre be made it will be found to have twice the strength of the above solution that is 100 cc of the soda would only require 50 cc of the acid to neutralise it the reason for this will be seen on inspecting the equations naho hcl nacl h2o 2naho h2so4 na2so4 2h2o acids like sulphuric acid are termed bibasic and their equivalent is only half the molecular weight thus a normal solution of sulphuric acid would contain 49 grams 982 of real acid per litre similarly lime and most of the bases are bibasic as may be seen from the following equations hence their equivalent will be half the molecular weight 2hcl cao cacl2 h2o 2hcl mgo mgcl2 h2o the standard normal solution of hydrochloric acid is made by diluting 100 cc of the strong acid to one litre with water this will be approximately normal in order to determine its exact strength weigh up 3 grams of recently ignited pure sodium carbonate or of the ignited bicarbonate transfer to a flask and dissolve in 200 cc of water when dissolved cool tint faintly yellow with a few drops of a solution of methyl orange and run in the standard acid from a burette till the yellow changes to a pink read off the number of cc used and calculate to how much sodium carbonate 100 cc of the acid are equivalent if the acid is strictly normal this will be 53 grams it will probably be equivalent to more than this now calculate how much strictly normal acid would be equivalent to the standard found for example suppose the standard found is 55 gram of sodium carbonate then 53 55 100 x where x is the quantity of normal acid required x 1038 cc to get the acid of normal strength we should then add 38 cc of water to each 100 cc of the standard solution remaining suppose there were left 930 cc of the approximate acid 353 cc of water must be added and mixed it should then be checked by another titration with pure sodium carbonate the standard solution of seminormal alkali the best alkali for general purposes is ammonia but since it is volatile especially in strong solutions it is best to make it of half the usual strength or seminormal one litre of this will contain 85 grams of ammonia nh3 and 100 cc of it will just neutralise 50 cc of the normal acid take 100 cc of dilute ammonia and dilute with water to one litre run into a flask 50 cc of the standard acid tint with methyl orange and run in from a burette the solution of ammonia till neutralised less than 100 cc will probably be used suppose 95 cc were required there should have been 100 hence there is a deficiency of five then for each 95 cc of standard ammonia left add 5 cc of water and mix well 100 cc will now be equivalent to 50 cc of the acid as an example of the application of this method we may take the determination of lime in limestone marble and similar substances determination of lime in limestoneweigh up 1 gram of the dried sample and dissolve in 25 cc of normal acid cool dilute to 100 cc and titrate with the seminormal solution of alkali using methylorange as an indicator divide the cc of alkali used by 2 subtract from 25 and multiply by 0028 to find the weight of lime this method is not applicable in the presence of other carbonates or oxides unless the weight of these substances be afterwards determined and due correction be made strontia strontia the oxide of strontium sro occurs in nature as sulphate in the mineral celestine srso4 and as carbonate in strontianite srco3 it is found in small quantities in limestones chalk c strontia is used in sugarrefining and for the preparation of coloured lights detectionit is detected by the crimson colour which its compounds when moistened with hydrochloric acid impart to the flame the spectrum shows a large number of lines of which a red an orange and a blue are most characteristic it resembles lime in many of its compounds but is distinguished by the insolubility of its sulphate in a boiling solution of ammonium sulphate and by the insolubility of its nitrate in alcohol from baryta which it also resembles it is distinguished by not yielding an insoluble chromate in an acetic acid solution by the solubility of its chloride in alcohol and by the fact that its sulphate is converted into carbonate on boiling with a solution formed of 3 parts of potassium carbonate and 1 of potassium sulphate it is got into solution in the same manner as lime the sulphate should be fused with fusion mixture extracted with water and thoroughly washed the residue will contain the strontia as carbonate which is readily soluble in dilute hydrochloric or nitric acid separationit is separated after removal of the silica and metals as described under lime by adding ammonia and ammonia carbonate and allowing to stand for some hours in a warm place in the absence of baryta or lime it is filtered off and weighed as strontium carbonate which contains 7017 per cent of strontia it is separated from baryta by dissolving in a little hydrochloric acid adding ammonia in excess and then acidifying with acetic acid and precipitating the baryta with potassium bichromate as described under baryta the strontia is precipitated from the filtrate by boiling for some time with a strong solution of ammonic sulphate and a little ammonia fifty parts of ammonic sulphate are required for each part of strontia or lime present the precipitate is filtered off and washed first with a solution of ammonic sulphate and then with alcohol it is dried ignited and weighed as strontium sulphate gravimetric determination the determination of strontia in pure solutions is best made by adding sulphuric acid in excess and alcohol in volume equal to that of the solution allow to stand overnight filter wash with dilute alcohol dry ignite at a red heat and weigh as sulphate srso4 this contains 564 per cent of strontia sro or 477 per cent of strontium baryta baryta oxide of barium bao commonly occurs in combination with sulphuric oxide in the mineral barytes or heavy spar baso4 and in combination with carbon dioxide in witherite baco3 these minerals are not unfrequently found in large quantity associated with galena and other metallic sulphides in lodes small isolated crystals of these are frequently found in mining districts barium is a constituent of certain mineral waters the minerals are recognised by their high specific gravity and their crystalline form compounds of barium are often used by the assayer more especially the chloride and hydrate the salts are with the exception of the sulphate generally soluble in water or hydrochloric acid in such solutions sulphuric acid produces a white precipitate of baric sulphate which is practically insoluble in all acids the dioxide bao2 is used for the preparation of oxygen on strong ignition it gives up oxygen and is converted into baryta bao which at a lower temperature takes up oxygen from the air reforming the dioxide detectionbarium is detected by the green colour its salts especially the chloride give to the flame this viewed through the spectroscope shows a complicated spectrum of which two lines in the green are most easily recognised and characteristic the salts of barium give no precipitate with sulphuretted hydrogen in either acid or alkaline solution but with sulphuric acid they at once give a precipitate which is insoluble in acetate of soda in solutions rendered faintly acid with acetic acid they give a yellow precipitate with bichromate of potash these reactions are characteristic of barium baryta is got into solution in the manner described under lime but in the case of the sulphate the substance is fused with three or four times its weight of fusion mixture the melt is extracted with water washed and the residue dissolved in dilute hydrochloric acid separationthe separation is thus effectedthe solution in hydrochloric acid is evaporated to dryness redissolved in hot dilute hydrochloric acid and sulphuric acid is added to the solution till no further precipitate is formed the precipitate is filtered off and digested with a solution of ammonium acetate or of sodium hyposulphite at 50 or 60 c to dissolve out any lead sulphate the residue is filtered off washed dried and ignited the ignited substance is mixed with four or five times its weight of fusion mixture and fused in a platinumdish over the blowpipe for a few minutes when cold it is extracted with cold water filtered and washed the residue is dissolved in dilute hydrochloric acid and if necessary filtered the solution contains the barium as baric chloride mixed perhaps with salts of strontium or lime to separate these ammonia is added till the solution is alkaline and then acetic acid in slight excess chromate of baryta is then thrown down by the addition of bichromate of potash as a yellow precipitate it is allowed to settle filtered and washed with a solution of acetate or of nitrate of ammonia it is dried ignited gently and weighed it is bacro4 and contains 6047 per cent of baryta gravimetric determination the gravimetric determination of baryta when lime and strontia are absent is as followsthe solution if it contains much free acid is nearly neutralised with ammonia and then diluted to 100 or 200 cc it is heated to boiling and dilute sulphuric acid is added till no further precipitation takes place the precipitate is allowed to settle for a few minutes decanted through a filter and washed with hot water and afterwards dried transferred to a porcelain crucible and strongly ignited in the muffle or over the blowpipe for a few minutes it is then cooled and weighed as sulphate of baryta baso4 it contains 6567 per cent of baryta bao in determining the baryta in minerals which are soluble in acid it is precipitated direct from the hydrochloric acid solution nearly neutralised with ammonia by means of sulphuric acid the precipitated baric sulphate is digested with a solution of ammonic acetate and filtered washed ignited and weighed volumetric determination the principle and mode of working of this is the same as that given under the sulphur assay but using a standard solution of sulphuric acid instead of one of barium chloride the standard solution of sulphuric acid is made to contain 3202 grams of sulphuric acid h2so4 or an equivalent of a soluble alkaline sulphate per litre 100 cc will be equal to 5 grams of baryta five grams of the substance are taken and the baryta they contain converted into carbonate if necessary the carbonate is dissolved in dilute hydrochloric acid ten grams of sodium acetate are added and the solution diluted to 500 cc is boiled and titrated in the manner described lead salts must be absent in the titration and so must strontia and lime ferrous salts should be peroxidised by means of permanganate or chlorate of potash other salts do not interfere magnesia magnesia the oxide of magnesium mgo occurs in nature in the rare mineral periclase mgo and hydrated as brucite mgh2o2 as carbonate it occurs in large quantity as magnesite mgco3 which is the chief source of magnesia mixed with carbonate of lime it forms magnesian limestone and dolomite it is present in larger or smaller quantity in most silicates and the minerals serpentine talc steatite and meerschaum are essentially hydrated silicates of magnesia soluble magnesian salts occur in many natural waters more especially the sulphate and the chloride kieserite mgso4h2o occurs in quantity at stassfurt and is used in the manufacture of epsom salts detectionmagnesia is best detected in the wet way its compounds give no colour to the flame and the only characteristic dry reaction is its yielding a pink mass when ignited before the blowpipe after treatment with a solution of cobalt nitrate in solution it is recognised by giving no precipitate with ammonia or ammonic carbonate in the presence of ammonic chloride and by giving a white crystalline precipitate on adding sodium phosphate or arsenate to the ammoniacal solution magnesia differs from the other alkaline earths by the solubility of its sulphate in water magnesia is dissolved by boiling with moderately strong acids the insoluble compounds are fused with fusion mixture and treated as described under silicates separationit is separated by evaporating the acid solution to dryness to render silica insoluble and by taking up with dilute hydrochloric acid the solution is freed from the second group of metals by means of sulphuretted hydrogen and the iron alumina c are removed with ammonic chloride ammonia and ammonic sulphide the somewhat diluted filtrate is treated first with ammonia and then with carbonate of ammonia in slight excess it is allowed to stand for an hour in a warm place and then filtered the magnesia is precipitated from the filtrate by the addition of an excess of sodium phosphate and ammonia it is allowed to stand overnight filtered and washed with dilute ammonia the precipitate contains the magnesia as ammonicmagnesic phosphate in cases where it is not desirable to introduce sodium salts or phosphoric acid into the assay solution the following method is adopted the solution freed from the other alkaline earths by ammonium carbonate is evaporated in a small porcelain dish with nitric acid the residue after removing the ammonic salts by ignition is taken up with a little water and a few crystals of oxalic acid transferred to a platinum dish evaporated to dryness and ignited the residue is extracted with small quantities of boiling water and filtered off while the insoluble magnesia is washed the filtrate contains the alkalies the residue is ignited and weighed as magnesia it is mgo gravimetric determination the solution containing the magnesia is mixed with chloride of ammonium and ammonia in excess if a precipitate should form more ammonic chloride is required add sodium phosphate solution in excess stir and allow to stand overnight filter and wash the precipitate with dilute ammonia dry transfer to a platinum or porcelain crucible and ignite finally at intense redness cool and weigh the substance is magnesic pyrophosphate mg2p2o7 and contains 3604 per cent of magnesia volumetric method the magnesia having been precipitated as ammonicmagnesic phosphate which is the usual separation its weight can be determined volumetrically by the method of titration described under phosphates the same standard solution of uranium acetate is used its standard for magnesia is got by multiplying the standard for phosphoric oxide by 05493 for example if one hundred cc are equivalent to 05 gram of phosphoric oxide they will be equivalent to 05 5493 02746 gram of magnesia the method of working and the conditions of the titration are the same as for the phosphate titration the quantity of substance taken for assay must not contain more than 01 or 02 gram of magnesia after precipitating as ammonicmagnesic phosphate with sodium phosphate and well washing with ammonia it is dissolved in dilute hydrochloric acid neutralised with ammonia and sodic acetate and acetic acid are added in the usual quantity the solution is boiled and titrated examination of a limestone silica and insoluble silicatestake one gram of the dried sample and dissolve it in 10 cc of dilute hydrochloric acid filter wash dry and ignite the residue organic matterif the residue insoluble in hydrochloric acid shows the presence of organic matter it must be collected on a weighed filter and dried at 100 on weighing it gives the combined weights of organic and insoluble matter the latter is determined by igniting and weighing again the organic matter is calculated by difference limewhere but little magnesia is present this is determined by titration with standard acid take one gram and dissolve it in 25 cc of normal hydrochloric acid tint with methylorange and titrate with seminormal ammonia divide the quantity of ammonia used by 2 deduct this from 25 and multiply the remainder by 28 this gives the percentage of lime where magnesia is present the same method is adopted and the magnesia which is separately determined is afterwards deducted the percentage of magnesia found is multiplied by 14 and the result is deducted from the apparent percentage of lime got by titrating magnesiadissolve 2 grams of the limestone in hydrochloric acid and separate the lime with ammonia and ammonium oxalate the filtrate is treated with sodium phosphate and the magnesia is weighed as pyrophosphate or titrated with uranium acetate irondissolve 2 grams in hydrochloric acid reduce and titrate with standard permanganate of potassium solution this gives the total iron the ferrous iron is determined by dissolving another 2 grams in hydrochloric acid and at once titrating with the permanganate of potassium solution manganesedissolve 20 grams in hydrochloric acid nearly neutralise with soda add sodium acetate boil and filter to the filtrate add bromine boil and determine the manganese in the precipitate see page 300 phosphoric oxidethis is determined by dissolving the ferric acetate precipitate from the manganese separation in hydrochloric acid adding ammonia in excess and passing sulphuretted hydrogen filter and add to the filtrate magnesia mixture the precipitate is collected washed with ammonia ignited and weighed as pyrophosphate the alkalies the oxides of sodium potassium lithium csium and rubidium and ammonia are grouped under this head of these csia and rubidia are rare and lithia comparatively so they are easily distinguished by their spectra they are characterised by the solubility of almost all their salts in water and consequently are found in the solutions from which the earths and oxides of the metals have been separated by the usual group reagents the solution from which the other substances have been separated is evaporated to dryness and the product ignited to remove the ammonic salts added for the purpose of separation the residue contains the alkali metals generally as chlorides or sulphates before determining the quantities of the particular alkali metals present it is best to convert them altogether either into chloride or sulphate and to take the weight of the mixed salts it is generally more convenient to weigh them as chlorides they are converted into this form if none of the stronger acids are present by simply evaporating with an excess of hydrochloric acid nitrates are converted into chlorides by this treatment when sulphates or phosphates are present the substance is dissolved in a little water and the sulphuric or phosphoric acid precipitated with a slight excess of acetate of lead in the presence of alcohol the solution is filtered and the excess of lead precipitated with sulphuretted hydrogen the filtrate from this is evaporated to dryness with an excess of hydrochloric acid and the residue consisting of the mixed chlorides is gently ignited and weighed in many cases such as the analysis of slags and of some natural silicates where the percentage of alkalies is small the percentage of soda and potash which most commonly occur need not be separately determined it is sufficient to report the proportion of mixed alkalies which is thus ascertaineddissolve the ignited and weighed chlorides in 100 cc of distilled water and titrate with the standard solution of silver nitrate using potassic chromate as indicator in the manner described under chlorine the cc of silver nitrate used gives the weight in milligrams of the chlorine present multiply this by 0775 and deduct the product from the weight of the mixed chlorides this will give the combined weight of the alkalies na2o and k2o present for example 00266 gram of mixed chlorides required on titrating 142 cc of silver nitrate which is equivalent to 00142 gram of chlorine this multiplied by 0775 gives 00110 to be deducted from the weight of the mixed chlorides mixed chlorides 00266 gram deduction 00110 mixed alkalies 00156 assuming this to have been got from 1 gram of a rock it would amount to 156 per cent of potash and soda the relative proportions of the potash and soda can be ascertained from the same determination sodium and potassium chlorides have the following composition sodium 3938 potassium 5246 chlorine 6062 chlorine 4754 10000 10000 the percentage of chlorine in the mixed chlorides is calculated it necessarily falls somewhere between 475 and 606 per cent and approaches the one or the other of these numbers as the proportion of the sodium or potassium preponderates each per cent of chlorine in excess of 475 represents 763 per cent of sodium chloride in the mixed chlorides the percentage of potash and soda in the substance can be calculated in the usual way sodium chloride multiplied by 05302 gives its equivalent of soda na2o and potassium chloride multiplied by 06317 gives its equivalent of potash k2o the weight of sodium chloride in the mixed chlorides is also calculated thustake the same example for illustration multiply the chlorine found by 2103 this gives 001422103 002987 from the product deduct the weight of the mixed chlorides found product 002987 mixed chlorides 002660 difference 000327 the difference multiplied by 36288 gives the weight of sodium chloride in the mixture in this case it equals 00118 gram the potassium chloride is indicated by the difference between this and the weight of the mixed chlorides it equals 00148 gram we have now got sodium chloride 00118 gram potassium chloride 00148 from 1 gram of the rock taken multiplying these by their factors we have soda 0011805302 potash 0014806317 soda 0625 per cent potash 0935 concentration of the alkalieswith the exception of magnesia all the other bases are separated from the alkalies in the ordinary course of work without the addition of any reagent which cannot be removed by simple evaporation and ignition consequently with substances soluble in acids successive treatment of the solution with sulphuretted hydrogen ammonia ammonic sulphide and ammonic carbonate filtering where necessary will yield a filtrate containing the whole of the alkalies with ammonic salts and perhaps magnesia the filtrate is evaporated in a small porcelain dish with the addition of nitric acid towards the finish it is carried to dryness and ignited the residue is taken up with a little water treated with a few crystals of oxalic acid and again evaporated and ignited the alkaline salts are extracted with water and filtered from the magnesia into a weighed platinum dish the solution is then evaporated with an excess of hydrochloric acid ignited at a low red heat and weighed the residue consists of the mixed alkaline chlorides for substances such as most silicates and similar bodies not completely decomposed by acids lawrence smiths method is generally used this is as followstake from 05 to 1 gram of the finely powdered mineral and mix by rubbing in the mortar with an equal weight of ammonium chloride then mix with eight times as much pure calcium carbonate using a part of it to rinse out the mortar transfer to a platinum crucible and heat gently over a bunsen burner until the ammonic chloride is decomposed five or ten minutes raise the heat to redness and continue at this temperature for about three quarters of an hour the crucible must be kept covered cool and turn out the mass into a 4inch evaporating dish wash the crucible and cover with distilled water and add the washings to the dish dilute to 60 or 80 cc and heat to boiling filter and wash add to the filtrate about 15 gram of ammonium carbonate evaporate to about 40 cc and add a little more ammonic carbonate and some ammonia filter into a weighed platinum dish and evaporate to dryness heat gently to drive off the ammonic chloride and ignite to a little below redness cool and weigh the residue consists of the mixed alkaline chlorides separation of the alkalimetals from each othersodium and lithium are separated from the other alkalimetals by taking advantage of the solubility of their chlorides in the presence of platinic chloride and from one another by the formation of an almost insoluble lithic phosphate on boiling with a solution of sodium phosphate in a slightly alkaline solution csium rubidium and potassium yield precipitates with platinic chloride which are somewhat soluble and must be precipitated from concentrated solutions csium and rubidium are separated from potassium by fractional precipitation with platinum chloride their platinochlorides being less soluble than that of potassium are precipitated first one hundred parts of boiling water dissolve 518 of the potassium platinochloride 0634 of the rubidium salt and 0377 of the corresponding csium compound the separation of lithium csium and rubidium is seldom called for owing to their rarity the details of the separation of potassium from sodium are described under potassium ammonia compounds are sharply marked off from the rest by their volatility and it is always assumed that they have been removed by ignition if left in the solution they would count as potassium compounds they will be considered under ammonia sodium sodium is the commonest of the alkali metals it is found in nature chiefly combined with chlorine as common salt nacl this mineral is the source from which the various compounds of sodium in use are prepared sodium occurs abundantly as nitrate nano3 in chili saltpetre and as silicate in various minerals such as albite or sodafelspar it occurs as fluoride in cryolite na3alf6 and as carbonate in natron c sulphates are also found sodium is very widely diffused few substances being free from it the detection of sodium is easy and certain owing to the strong yellow colour its salts impart to the flame this when viewed by the spectroscope shows a single yellow line93 the extreme delicacy of this test limits its value because of the wide diffusion of sodium salts it is more satisfactory to separate the chloride which may be recognised by its taste flame coloration fusibility and negative action with reagents the chloride dissolved in a few drops of water gives with potassium metantimoniate a white precipitate of the corresponding sodium salt sodium salts are dissolved out from most compounds on treatment with water or dilute acids insoluble silicates are decomposed and the alkali rendered soluble by lawrence smiths method which has just been described the separation of the sodium from the mixed chlorides is effected in the following waythe chlorides are dissolved in a little water and the potassium separated as platinochloride the soluble sodium platinochloride with the excess of platinum is boiled mixed with sulphuric acid evaporated to dryness and ignited on extracting with water filtering evaporating and igniting sodium sulphate is left and is weighed as such it is more usual and quite as satisfactory to calculate the weight of the sodium chloride by difference from that of the mixed chlorides by subtracting that of the potassium chloride which is separately determined for example 1 gram of a rock gavemixed chlorides 00266 gram and 00486 gram of potassic platinochloride this last is equivalent to 00149 gram of potassium chloride mixed chlorides found 00266 deduct potassium chloride 00149 leaves sodium chloride 00117 the weight of sodium chloride found multiplied by 05302 gives the weight of the soda na2o gravimetric determination the solution which must contain no other metal than sodium is evaporated in a weighed platinum crucible or dish towards the finish an excess not too great of sulphuric acid is added and the evaporation is continued under a loosely fitting cover the residue is ignited over the blowpipe a fragment of ammonic carbonate being added towards the end when fumes of sulphuric acid cease to be evolved this ensures the removal of the excess of acid the crucible is cooled in the desiccator and weighed the substance is sulphate of soda na2so4 and contains 4366 per cent of soda na2o or 3238 per cent of sodium na volumetric methods there are various methods used for the different compounds of sodium there is no one method of general application thus with common salt the chlorine is determined volumetrically and the sodium after deducting for the other impurities is estimated by difference with sodic carbonate and caustic soda a given weight of the sample is titrated with standard acid and the equivalent of soda estimated from the alkalinity of the solution with sodium sulphate a modification of the same method is used to a solution of 355 grams of the salt contained in a halflitre flask 250 cc of a solution of baryta water is added the volume is made up to 500 cc with water the solution is mixed and filtered half of the filtrate is measured off treated with a current of carbonic acid and then boiled it is transferred to a halflitre flask diluted to the mark shaken up and filtered 250 cc of the filtrate representing a quarter of the sample taken is then titrated with standard acid the standard acid is made by diluting 250 cc of the normal acid to 1 litre the cc of acid used multiplied by 2 gives the percentage a correction must be made to counteract the effect of impurities in the baryta as well as errors inherent in the process this is small and its amount is determined by an experiment with 355 grams of pure sodium sulphate examination of common salt moisturepowder and weigh up 10 grams of the sample into a platinum dish dry in a water oven for an hour and afterwards heat to bare redness over a bunsen burner cool and weigh the loss gives the water chlorineweigh up two separate lots of 1 gram each

potassium potassium occurs in nature as chloride in the mineral sylvine kcl and more abundantly combined with magnesium chloride in earnallite kclmgcl26h2o it occurs as nitrate in nitre kno3 and as silicate in many minerals such as orthoclase or potashfelspar and muscovite or potashmica potassium compounds are detected by the characteristic violet colour they impart to the flame the presence of sodium salts masks this tint but the interference can be neutralised by viewing the flame through a piece of blue glass viewed through the spectroscope it shows a characteristic line in the red and another in the violet these however are not so easy to recognise or obtain as the sodium one concentrated solutions of potassium salts give a yellow crystalline precipitate with platinum chloride and a white crystalline one with the acid tartrate of soda for these tests the solution is best neutral these tests are only applicable in the absence of compounds other than those of potassium and sodium gravimetric determination this process serves for its separation from sodium take 1 gram of the sample and dissolve it in an evaporating dish with 50 cc of water acidify with hydrochloric acid in quantity sufficient if the metals are present as chlorides to make it acid or if other acids are present in at least such quantity as will provide the equivalent of chlorine add 3 grams of platinum in solution as platinum chloride and evaporate on a waterbath to a stiff paste but not to dryness moisten with a few drops of platinic chloride solution without breaking up the paste by stirring cover with 20 cc of strong alcohol and wash the crystals as much as possible by rotating the dish allow to settle for a few moments and decant through a filter wash in the same way two or three times until the colour of the filtrate shows that the excess of the platinum chloride used is removed wash the precipitate on to the filter with a jet of alcohol from the washbottle clean the filterpaper using as little alcohol as possible dry in the wateroven for an hour brush the precipitate into a weighed dish and weigh it it is potassium platinochloride k2ptcl6 and contains 1603 per cent of potassium or 3056 per cent of potassium chloride kcl which is equivalent to 193 per cent of potash k2o if the filterpaper is not free from precipitate burn it and weigh separately the excess of weight over that of the ash will be due to platinum and potassic chloride pt and 2kcl this multiplied by 1413 will give the weight of the potassic platinochloride from which it was formed it must be added to the weight of the main precipitate the mixed alkaline chlorides obtained in the usual course of analysis are treated in this manner the quantity of platinum added must be about three times as much as the mixed chlorides weigh volumetric methods these are the same as with soda examination of commercial carbonate of potashthe impurities to be determined are moisture silica and insoluble matter chlorine sulphuric oxide and oxide of iron these determinations are made in the ways described under the examination of common salt the potassium is determined by converting it into chloride and precipitating with platinum chloride c as just described available alkaliweigh up 235 grams of the sample dissolve in water and make up to 500 cc take 50 cc tint with methyl orange and titrate with the normal solution of acid the cc of acid used multiplied by 2 gives the percentage of available alkali calculated as potash k2o sodathis is calculated indirectly in the following waydeduct from the potassium found the quantity required for combination with the chlorine and sulphuric oxide present and calculate the remainder to potash k2o the apparent surplus excess of available alkali is the measure of the soda present carbon dioxidethe cc of acid used in the available alkali determination multiplied by 22 and divided by 235 gives the percentage of carbon dioxide lithium lithia the oxide of lithium li2o occurs in quantities of 3 or 4 per cent in various silicates such as lepidolite or lithiamica spodumene and petalite it also occurs as phosphate in triphyline it is a constituent of the water of certain mineral springs a spring at wheal clifford contained as much as 0372 gram of lithium chloride per litre in small quantities lithia is very widely diffused the detection of lithia is rendered easy by the spectroscope its spectrum shows a red line lying about midway between the yellow sodium line and the red one of potassium it also shows a faint yellow line the colour of the flame a crimson is characteristic the reactions of the lithium compounds lie between those of the alkalies and of the alkaline earths solutions are not precipitated by tartaric acid nor by platinic chloride the oxide is slowly soluble in water the carbonate is not freely soluble lithia is completely precipitated by sodic phosphate especially in hot alkaline solutions in its determination the mixed alkaline chlorides obtained in the separation of the alkalies are dissolved in water a solution of soda is added in slight excess and the lithia precipitated with sodic phosphate before filtering it is evaporated to dryness and extracted with hot water rendered slightly ammoniacal the residue is transferred to a filter dried ignited and weighed the precipitate is lithium phosphate 3li2o p2o5 and contains 388 per cent of lithia the separation of lithia from magnesia is not given by the usual authorities wohler recommends evaporating the solution to dryness with carbonate of soda on extracting the residue with water the lithia dissolves out and is determined in the filtrate one hundred parts of water dissolve at the ordinary temperature 0769 parts of lithium carbonate li2co3 the basic magnesia compound is almost insoluble in the absence of carbon dioxide and ammonium salts caesium the oxide of caesium caesia cs2o is found associated with lithia in lepidolite c and together with rubidium in many mineral waters the mineral pollux is essentially a silicate of alumina and caesia it contains 340 per cent of the latter oxide caesium is best detected by the spectroscope its spectrum being characterised by two lines in the blue and one in the red the latter is about midway between the lithium and sodium lines if not detected by the spectroscope or specially looked for caesia would in the ordinary course of work be separated with the potash and weighed as potassium platinochloride caesia is separated from all the other alkalies by adding to the acid solution of the mixed chlorides a strongly acid cold solution of antimonious chloride the acid used must be hydrochloric the caesium is precipitated as a white crystalline precipitate csclsbcl3 which is filtered off and washed when cold with strong hydrochloric acid since it is decomposed by water or on warming the precipitate is washed into a beaker and treated with sulphuretted hydrogen after filtering off the sulphide of antimony the solution leaves on evaporation the caesium as chloride rubidium rubidium occurs widely diffused in nature but in very small quantities it is generally associated with caesium it is detected by the spectroscope which shows two violet lines and two dark red ones like caesium it is precipitated with platinic chloride and in the ordinary course of work would be weighed as potassium it is separated from potassium by fractional precipitation with platinic chloride rubidium platinochloride is much less soluble than the potassium salt ammonium it is usual to look upon the salts of ammonia as containing a compound radical nh4 am which resembles in many respects the metals of the alkalies ammonium occurs in nature as chloride in sal ammoniac amcl as sulphate in mascagnine am2so4 as phosphate in struvite ammgpo412h2o minerals containing ammonium are rare and are chiefly found either in volcanic districts or associated with guano ammonia and ammonium sulphide occur in the waters of certain tuscan lagoons which are largely worked for the boracic acid they contain the crude boracic acid from this source contains from 5 to 10 per cent of ammonium salts it is from these that the purer forms of ammonium compounds of commerce known as from volcanic ammonia are derived but the bulk of the ammonia of commerce is prepared from the ammoniacal liquors obtained as byeproducts in the working of certain forms of blast furnaces and coke ovens and more especially in gasmaking ammonia hardly comes within the objects of assaying but it is largely used in the laboratory and the assayer is not unfrequently called on to determine it ammonium salts are mostly soluble in water in strong solutions they give a yellow precipitate of ammonium platinochloride on the addition of chloride of platinum and with the acid tartrate of soda yield a white precipitate of hydric ammonic tartrate these reactions are similar to those produced with potassium compounds heated with a base such as lime or sodic hydrate ammonium salts are decomposed yielding ammonia gas nh3 which is readily soluble in water the solution of this substance is known as ammonic hydrate or ammonia they are volatilised on ignition either with or without decomposition according to the acid present this fact is of importance in analytical work since it allows of the use of alkaline solutions and reagents which leave nothing behind on heating it must be remembered however that although ammonic chloride is volatile it cannot be volatilised in the presence of substances which form volatile chlorides without loss of the latter for example ferric oxide and alumina are thus lost volatilising as chlorides and there are some other compounds notably ammonic magnesic arsenate which on heating to redness suffer reduction the presence of ammonic chloride in such cases must be avoided detectioncompounds of ammonium are detected by their evolving ammonia when mixed or heated with any of the stronger bases the ammonia is recognised by its odour by its alkaline reaction with litmus paper and by yielding white fumes when brought in contact with fuming acid in consequence of the use of ammonium salts and ammonia as reagents it is necessary to make a special test for and determination of ammonium94 in the ordinary course of work it will be lost on ignition the determination presents little difficulty and is based on the method used for its detection illustration fig 61 solution and separationalthough ammonium salts are soluble in water there is no necessity for dissolving them the compound containing the ammonia is boiled with an alkaline solution and the liberated ammonia condensed and collected the substance is weighed out into a flask of about 200 cc capacity the flask is closed with a rubber cork perforated to carry a 20 cc pipette and a bulb exit tube the latter is connected with a receiver which is a small flask containing dilute hydrochloric acid fig 61 the flask containing the substance is corked and the greater part of the soda solution is run in from the pipette the solution is then boiled the ammonia volatilises and is carried over into the hydrochloric acid with which it combines to form ammonic chloride the distillation is carried on gently until the bulk of the liquid is driven over the ammonia in the receiver will be mixed only with the excess of hydrochloric acid this separation is used in all determinations gravimetric determination the contents of the flask are transferred to a weighed platinum dish and evaporated on the waterbath it is dried until the weight is constant the chloride of ammonium remains as a white mass which after cooling in a desiccator is weighed it contains 3372 per cent of ammonium nh4 or 3185 per cent of ammonia nh3 on heating over the bunsen burner it is completely volatilised leaving no residue volumetric determination weigh up 17 gram of the substance and place it in the flask measure off 50 cc of the normal solution of acid place them in the receiver and dilute with an equal volume of water run in through the pipette by opening the clip 20 cc of a strong solution of soda boil until the ammonia has passed over and then aspirate a current of air through the apparatus disconnect the receiver and tint its contents with methyl orange titrate the residual acid with a seminormal solution of alkali divide the cc of the alkali solution used by 2 and deduct from the 50 cc the difference will give the number of cc of the normal acid solution neutralised by the ammonia distilled over each cc of acid so neutralised represents 1 per cent of ammonia in the sample if the results are to be reported as ammonium 18 gram of the sample is taken instead of 17 gram colorimetric determination this is effected by means of nesslers reagent which strikes a brown colour with traces of ammonia even with a few hundredths of a milligram in 100 cc of liquid with larger quantities of ammonia the reagent gives a precipitate this reagent is a strongly alkaline solution of potassic mercuric iodide and is thus made nesslers solution dissolve 17 grams of mercuric chloride in 300 cc of water and add the solution to one of 35 grams of potassium iodide in 100 cc of water until a permanent precipitate is produced both solutions must be cold then make up to a litre by adding a 20 per cent solution of potash add more of the mercuric chloride a little at a time until a permanent precipitate is again formed allow to settle decant and use the clear liquor four or five cc are used for each 100 cc of liquid to be tested a standard solution of ammonia is made by dissolving 0315 gram of ammonic chloride in water and diluting to 100 cc ten cc of this are taken and diluted to 1 litre one cc contains 001 milligram of ammonia nh3 in working the solution containing the ammonia is diluted to a definite volume and to such an extent that 50 cc of it shall not contain more than 002 or 003 milligram of ammonia fifty cc of it are transferred to a nessler glass and mixed with 2 cc of nesslers reagent the colour is noted and an estimate made as to the amount of ammonia it indicates a measured quantity of the standard ammonia judged to contain about as much ammonia as that in the assay is then put into another nessler glass it is diluted to 50 cc with water and mixed with 2 cc of nessler after standing a minute or two the colours in the two glasses are compared if the tints are equal the assay is finished but if the standard is weaker or stronger than the assay another standard containing more or less ammonia as the case may be must be prepared and compared with the assay two such experiments will generally be sufficient but if not a third must be made the addition of more standard ammonia to the solution to which the nessler has already been added does not give a satisfactory result when the ammonia in 50 cc has been determined that in the whole solution is ascertained by a suitable multiplication by 10 for example if the bulk was 500 cc or by 20 if it was a litre distilled water is used throughout it must be free from ammonia and is best prepared by distilling an ammoniafree spring water footnotes 90 al2cl6 3na2s2o3 3h2o al2ho6 6nacl 3s 3so2 91 3beoal2o36sio2 92 cac2o4 caco3co 93 resolved into two with a powerful spectroscope 94 ammonium compounds are frequently produced when dissolving metals in nitric acid or when nitrates are heated in the presence of the metals part iiinonmetals chapter xv oxygen and oxidesthe halogens oxygen oxygen occurs in nature in the free state forming 23 per cent by weight or 21 per cent by volume of the atmosphere but since it is a gas its presence is easily overlooked and its importance underestimated except in the examination of furnacegases c the assayer is not often called upon to determine its quantity but it forms one of his most useful reagents and there are many cases where he cannot afford to disregard its presence it occurs not only in the air but also dissolved in water ordinary waters containing on an average 000085 per cent by weight or 085 parts per 100000 chemically it is characterised by its power of combining especially at high temperatures with the other elements forming an important class of compounds called oxides this combination when rapid is accompanied by the evolution of light and heat hence oxygen is generally called the supporter of combustion this property is taken advantage of in the operation of calcining scorifying cupelling c the importance of a free access of air in all such work is seen when it is remembered that 1 litre of air contains 02975 gram of oxygen and this quantity will only oxidise 01115 gram of carbon 02975 gram of sulphur or 3849 grams of lead oxidation takes place at the ordinary temperature with many substances examples of such action are seen in the weathering of pyrites rusting of iron and in the assay office the weakening of solutions of many reducing agents for methods of determining the percentage of oxygen in gases for technical purposes the student is referred to winkler lunges technical gas analysis oxides oxides are abundant in nature almost all the commonly occurring bodies being oxidised water h2o contains 888 per cent of oxygen silica lime alumina magnesia and the other earths are oxides and the oxides of the heavier metals are in many cases important ores as for example cassiterite sno2 hmatite fe2o3 magnetite fe3o4 and pyrolusite mno2 in fact the lastnamed mineral owes its value to the excess of oxygen it contains and may be regarded as an ore of oxygen rather than of manganese most of the metals when heated to redness in contact with air lose their metallic lustre and become coated with or if the heating be prolonged altogether converted into oxide this oxide was formerly termed a calx and has long been known to weigh more than the metal from which it was obtained for example one part by weight of tin becomes on calcining 1271 parts of oxide putty powder the student will do well to try the following experimentstake 20 grams of tin and heat them in a muffle on a scorifier scraping back the dross as it forms and continuing the operation until the whole of the metal is burnt to a white powder and ceases to increase in weight95 take care to avoid loss and when cold weigh the oxide formed the oxide should weigh 2542 grams which increase in weight is due to the oxygen absorbed from the air and combined with the metal it can be calculated from this experiment if there has been no loss that oxide of tin contains 2133 per cent of oxygen and 7867 per cent of tin oxidation is performed with greater convenience by wet methods using reagents such as nitric acid which contain a large proportion of oxygen loosely held such reagents are termed oxidising agents besides nitric acid permanganate of potash bichromate of potash and peroxide of hydrogen are largely used for this purpose one cc of nitric acid contains as much oxygen as 256 litres of air and the greater part of this is available for oxidising purposes try the following experimenttake 2 grams of tin and cover in a weighed berlin dish with 20 cc of dilute nitric acid heat till decomposed evaporate to dryness ignite and weigh the 2 grams of tin should yield 2542 grams of oxide the increase in weight will be proportionally the same as in the previous experiment by calcination and is due to oxygen which in this case has been derived from the nitric acid the percentage of oxygen in this oxide of tin or in any of the oxides of the heavier metals may be directly determined by heating such oxides in a current of hydrogen and collecting and weighing the water formed it is found by experiment that 8886 parts by weight of oxygen combining with 1114 parts of hydrogen form 100 parts of water so that from the weight of water formed it is easy to calculate the amount of oxygen the oxide contained illustration fig 62 take 1 gram of the dried and powdered oxide and place it in a warm dry combustion tube place the tube in a furnace and connect at one end with a hydrogen apparatus provided with a sulphuric acid bulb for drying the gas and at the other with a weighed sulphuric acid tube for collecting the water formed the apparatus required is shown in fig 62 pass hydrogen through the apparatus and when the air has been cleared out light the furnace continue the heat and current of hydrogen for half an hour or longer if necessary allow to cool draw a current of dry air through the weighed tube weigh the increase in weight gives the amount of water formed and this multiplied by 08886 gives the weight of the oxygen the percentage of oxygen thus determined should be compared with that got by the oxidation of the metal it will be practically the same the following results can be taken as examples twenty grams of tin calcined as described gave 2537 grams of oxide two grams of tin oxidised with nitric acid and ignited gave 2551 grams of oxide one gram of the oxide of tin on reduction in a current of hydrogen gave 02360 gram of water equivalent to 02098 gram of oxygen and left 07900 gram of metal ten grams of ferrous sulphate gave on strong ignition 2898 grams of ferric oxide fe2o396 instead of 2877 the student should similarly determine the percentage of oxygen in oxides of copper and iron the former oxide may be prepared by dissolving 5 grams of copper in 50 cc of dilute nitric acid evaporating to dryness and strongly igniting the residue the oxide of iron may be made by weighing up 10 grams of powdered ferrous sulphate to 2014 grams of iron and heating at first gently to drive off the water and then at a red heat until completely decomposed the weight of oxide in each case should be determined and the percentage of oxygen calculated compare the figures arrived at with those calculated from the formula of the oxides cuo and fe2o3 it would be found in a more extended series of experiments that the same metal will under certain conditions form two or more oxides differing among themselves in the amount of oxygen they contain these oxides are distinguished from one another by such names as higher and lower oxides peroxides protoxides dioxides c the oxides may be conveniently classified under three heads 1 those that are reduced to metal by heat alone such as the oxides of mercury silver platinum gold c 2 those which are reduced by hydrogen at a red heat which includes the oxides of the heavy metals 3 those which are not reduced by these means good examples of which are silica alumina the alkalies and the alkaline earths another important classification is into acid basic and neutral oxides the oxides of the nonmetallic elements such as sulphur carbon phosphorus c are as a rule acid and the more oxygen they contain the more distinctly acid they are the oxides of the metals are nearly all basic and as a rule the less oxygen they contain the more distinctly basic they are the basic oxides which are soluble in acids give rise to the formation of salts when dissolved therein during the solution water is formed but no gas is evolved the oxide dissolved in each case neutralizes an equivalent of the acid used for solution97 the basic properties of many of these can be taken advantage of for their determination this is done in the case of soda potash lime c by finding the quantity of acid required to neutralize a given weight of the substance there are some oxides which under certain conditions are acid to one substance a stronger base and basic to another a stronger acid for example the oxides of lead and of tin as also alumina dissolve in caustic soda acting as acids whilst on the other hand they combine with sulphuric or hydrochloric acid playing the part of bases the oxides known as earths when ignited are many of them insoluble in acids although easily dissolved before ignition it is common in complete analyses of minerals to meet with cases in which the sum total of the elements found falls short of the amount of ore taken and here oxygen must be looked for for example this occurs in the case of a mixture of pyrites with oxide of iron or in a mixture of sulphides and sulphates the state in which the elements are present and the percentage say of sulphides and sulphates can in many cases be determined but this is not always required when the difference between the sum total and the elements found is small it is reported as oxygen and loss when however it is considerable the oxygen may be reported as such and its amount be either determined directly in the way already described or calculated from the best determination that can be made of the relative amounts of oxides sulphides sulphates c present such cases require a careful qualitative analysis to find out that the substance is present and then the separation of each constituent is made as strictly as possible these remarks apply especially to ores of the heavy metals the separation of the constituents is effected with suitable solvents applied in proper order the soluble sulphates for example are extracted with water the oxides by the dilute acids or alkalies in which they are known to be soluble the oxygen in the sulphates and oxides thus obtained is estimated by determining the sulphur and metals in the solutions and calculating the amount of oxygen with which they combine the metals of the earths and alkalies are almost invariably present as oxides and are reported as such except it is known that they are present in some other form such as fluoride or chloride thus silica alumina lime water c appear in an analysis even in those cases where oxygen and loss is also mentioned as an example of such a report take the following analysis of spanish pyrites sulphur 4900 iron 4355 copper 320 arsenic 047 lead 093 zinc 035 lime 010 silica c 063 water 070 oxygen and loss 107 10000 the following example will illustrate the mode of calculating and reporting a mineral occurring as blue crystals soluble in water and found on testing to be a mixed sulphate of iron and copper gave on analysis the following results water 4451 per cent sulphuric oxide 2882 copper 844 ferrous iron 1181 ferric iron 038 zinc 028 9424 there is here a deficiency of 576 per cent due to oxygen nothing else could be found and it is known that in the sulphates the metals exist as oxides by multiplying the weight of the copper by 1252 the weight of copper oxide cuo will be ascertained in this case it equals 1057 per cent the ferrous iron multiplied by 1286 will give the ferrous oxide feo in this case 1519 per cent the ferric iron multiplied by 1428 will give the ferric oxide fe2o3 in this case 054 per cent the zinc multiplied by 1246 will give the zinc oxide zno in this case it equals 035 per cent the analysis will be reported as water 4451 sulphuric oxide 2882 copper oxide 1057 equal to copper 844 ferrous oxide 1519 ferric oxide 054 zinc oxide 035 9998 the following a is an analysis of a sample of south american copper ore which will serve as a further illustration the analysis showed the presence of 689 per cent of ferrous oxide and some oxide of copper the analysis b is that of an ore from the same mine after an imperfect roasting it will be seen that the carbonates have been converted into sulphates if the total sulphur simply had been determined and the sulphate overlooked the oxygen and loss would have been 565 per cent an amount which would obviously require an explanation a b water 025 059 organic matter 054 sulphur 2950 2133 copper 1092 980 copper 957 copper oxide 028 iron 3209 3973 iron 3432 ferric oxide 773 lead 035 012 zinc 086 069 cobalt 006 011 lime

and combined the term moisture ought strictly to be limited to the first although as has already been explained it is more convenient in assaying to apply the term to all water which is driven off on drying at 100 c the combined water is really a part of the mineral itself although it may be driven off at a high temperature which varies with the base in some cases a prolonged red heat is required whilst with crystallised salts it is sometimes given off at the ordinary temperatures this latter phenomenon known as efflorescence is mostly confined to artificial salts the determination of the combined water may often be made by simply igniting the substance from which the moisture has been removed the quantity of water may be determined either indirectly by the loss or directly by collecting it in a calcium chloride tube and weighing in some cases in which the loss on ignition does not give simply the proportion of combined water it can be seen from the analysis to what else the loss is due and after a proper deduction the amount of water can be estimated for example 1 gram of crystallised iron sulphate was found to contain on analysis 02877 gram of sulphuric oxide and on igniting another gram 02877 gram of ferric oxide was left as the salt is known to be made up of ferrous oxide sulphuric oxide and combined water the combined water can be thus calculated 02877 gram of ferric oxide is equal to 02589 gram of ferrous oxide98 and consequently the loss on ignition has been diminished by 00288 gram which is the weight of oxygen absorbed by the ferrous oxide during calcining the loss on ignition was 07123 gram to which must be added 00288 gram hence 07411 gram is the weight of the combined sulphuric oxide and water present deducting the weight of sulphuric oxide found 02877 gram there is left for combined water 04534 gram the composition of 1 gram of the dry salt is then water 04534 sulphuric oxide 02877 ferrous oxide 02589 10000 the following is another examplea sample of malachite lost on ignition 2847 per cent leaving a residue which was found on analysis to be made up of oxide of copper equal to 7016 per cent on the mineral and silica and oxide of iron equal to 137 per cent carbon dioxide and water but nothing else was found to be present and the carbon dioxide amounted to 1964 per cent deducting this from the loss on ignition we have 882 as the percentage of water present the analysis was then reported as follows cupric oxide 7016 equal to 560 copper silica and ferric oxide 137 carbon dioxide 1964 water 882 9999 illustration fig 63 direct determination of combined watertransfer about 3 grams of the substance to a piece of combustion tube 8 or 10 inches long attached as in fig 63 at one end to a utube containing sulphuric acid and at the other end to a calcium chloride tube the last is weighed previous to the determination the tube should be warmed to ensure complete dryness and must be free from a misty appearance aspirate a current of air through the apparatus heat the mineral by means of a bunsen burner cautiously at first and afterwards to redness if necessary the water is driven off and condenses in the calcium chloride tube which is afterwards cooled and weighed the increase in weight is due to the water if the substance gives off acid products on heating it is previously mixed with some dry oxide of lead or pure calcined magnesia examination of waters the assayer is occasionally called on to test water for the purpose of ascertaining the nature and quantity of the salts contained in it and whether it is or is not fit for technical and drinking purposes in mineral districts the water is generally of exceptional character being more or less charged not only with earthy salts but also frequently with those of the metals distilled water is only used by assayers in certain exceptional cases so that by many it would be classed among the rarer oxides water of ordinary purity will do for most purposes but the nature and quantity of the impurities must be known the following determinations are of chief importance total solids at 100 cwhere simply the amount is required take 100 cc and evaporate on the waterbath in a weighed dish then dry in the wateroven and weigh total solids ignitedthe above residue is very gently ignited keeping the heat well below redness and again weighed a larger loss than 4 or 5 parts per 100000 on the water requires an explanation chlorinetake 100 cc of the water in a porcelain dish add 2 cc of a 5 per cent solution of neutral potassic chromate and titrate with a neutral standard solution of nitrate of silver made by dissolving 4789 grams of crystallised silver nitrate in distilled water and diluting to 1 litre the addition of the nitrate of silver is continued until the yellow of the solution assumes a reddish tint the reaction is very sharp each cc of nitrate of silver used is equal to 1 part by weight of chlorine in 100000 of water at inland places this rarely amounts to more than 1 in 100000 but near the sea it may amount to 3 or 5 more than this requires explanation and generally indicates sewage pollution nitric pentoxide n2o5it is more generally reported under the heading nitrogen as nitrates take 250 cc of the water and evaporate to 2 or 3 cc acidulate with a few drops of dilute sulphuric acid and transfer to a nitrometer using strong sulphuric acid to wash in the last traces the sulphuric acid must be added to at least twice the bulk of the liquid shake up with mercury the mercury rapidly flours and nitric oxide is given off if any nitrate is present the volume of the nitric oxide corrected to normal temperature and pressure multiplied by 025 gives the parts of nitrogen per 100000 or multiplied by 0965 will give the nitric pentoxide in parts per 100000 in well and spring waters the nitrogen may amount to 03 or 04 parts per 100000 or in richly cultivated districts 07 or 08 parts per 100000 an excess of nitrates is a suspicious feature and is generally due to previous contamination ammoniatake 500 cc of the water and place them in a retort connected with a liebigs condenser add a drop or two of a solution of carbonate of soda and distil over 100 cc collect another 50 cc separately determine the ammonia in the distillate colorimetrically with nesslers solution as described under ammonia and compare with a standard solution of ammonic chloride containing 00315 gram of ammonic chloride in 1 litre of water one cc contains 001 milligram of ammonia the second distillate will show little if any ammonia in ordinary cases the amounts found in both distillates are added together and expressed in parts per 100000 waters other than rain and tank waters which contain more than 0003 per 100000 are suspicious organic matterthe organic matter cannot be determined directly but for ordinary purposes it may be measured by the amount of permanganate of potassium which it reduces or by the amount of ammonia which it evolves on boiling with an alkaline permanganate of potassium solution a albuminoid ammoniato the residue left after distilling the ammonia add 50 cc of a solution made by dissolving 200 grams of potash and 8 grams of potassium permanganate in 1100 cc of water and rapidly boiling till the volume is reduced to 1 litre this should be kept in a well stoppered bottle and be occasionally tested to see that it is free from ammonia continue the distillation collecting 50 cc at a time until the distillate is free from ammonia three or four fractions are generally sufficient determine the ammonia colorimetrically as before if the total albuminoid ammonia does not exceed 0005 in 100000 the water may be regarded as clean as regards organic matter if it amounts to more than 0015 it is dirty b oxygen consumeda standard solution of permanganate of potash is made by dissolving 0395 gram of the salt in water and diluting to 1 litre each cc equals 01 milligram of available oxygen the following are also required1 a solution of sodium hyposulphite containing 1 gram of the salt na2s2o35h2o in 1 litre of water 2 dilute sulphuric acid made by adding one part of the acid to three of water and titrating with the permanganate solution till a faint pink persists after warming for several hours 3 starch paste 4 potassium iodide solution take 250 cc of the water in a stoppered bottle add 10 cc of sulphuric acid and 10 cc of the permanganate and allow to stand in a warm place for four hours then add a few drops of the solution of potassium iodide and titrate the liberated iodine with hypo using starch paste towards the end as an indicator to standardise the hyposulphite take 250 cc of water and 10 cc of sulphuric acid and a few drops of potassium iodide then run in 10 cc of the permanganate solution and again titrate about 30 cc of the hypo will be used the difference in the two titrations divided by the last and multiplied by 10 will give the cc of permanganate solution used in oxidising the organic matter in the 250 cc of water each cc represents 004 parts of oxygen in 100000 metalsthese may for the most part be estimated colorimetrically leadtake 100 cc of the water in a nessler tube and add 10 cc of sulphuretted hydrogen water and compare the tint if any against a standard lead solution as described under colorimetric lead report in parts per 100000 copperproceed as with the lastmentioned metal but if lead is also present boil down 500 cc to about 50 cc then add ammonia filter and estimate the copper in the blue solution as described under colorimetric copper irontake 50 cc or a smaller quantity if necessary dilute up to the mark with distilled water and determine with potassium sulphocyanate as described under colorimetric iron zinczinc is the only other metal likely to be present and since it cannot be determined colorimetrically it must be separately estimated during the examination of the total solids examination of total solidsevaporate 500 cc to dryness with a drop or two of hydrochloric acid take up with hydrochloric acid filter ignite and weigh the residue as silica to the filtrate add a little ammonic chloride and ammonia boil and filter ignite and weigh the precipitate as oxide of iron and alumina collect the filtrate in a small flask add a few drops of ammonium sulphide or pass sulphuretted hydrogen cork the flask and allow to stand overnight filter wash and determine the zinc gravimetrically as oxide of zinc if copper or lead were present they should have been previously removed with sulphuretted hydrogen in the acid solution to the filtrate add ammonic oxalate and ammonia boil for some time allow to stand filter wash ignite and weigh as lime evaporate the filtrate with nitric acid and ignite take up with a few drops of dilute hydrochloric acid add baric hydrate in excess evaporate and extract with water the residue contains the magnesia boil with dilute sulphuric acid filter precipitate it with phosphate of soda and ammonia and weigh as pyrophosphate the aqueous extract contains the alkalies with the excess of barium add sulphuric acid in slight excess filter evaporate and ignite strongly the residue consists of the sulphates of the alkalies which are separately determined as described under potash sulphuric oxide so3take 200 cc and boil to a small bulk with a little hydrochloric acid filter if necessary add baric chloride solution in slight excess to the hot solution filter ignite and weigh as baric sulphate carbon dioxide freecarbon dioxide exists in waters in two forms free and combined the latter generally occurs as bicarbonate although on analysis it is more convenient to consider it as carbonate and to count the excess of carbon dioxide with the free the method is as followsto determine the free carbon dioxide take 100 cc of the water place them in a flask with 3 cc of a strong solution of calcium chloride and 2 cc of a solution of ammonic chloride next add 50 cc of limewater the strength of the limewater must be known make up to 200 cc with distilled water stop the flask and allow the precipitate to settle take out 100 cc of the clear solution with a pipette and titrate with the standard solution of acid99 the number of cc required multiplied by two and deducted from that required for the 50 cc of limewater and then multiplied by 00045 will give the carbon dioxide present other than as normal carbonates carbon dioxide combined as normal carbonate100 cc of the water are tinted with phenacetolin or lacmoid then heated to near boiling and titrated with standard acid the number of cc used multiplied by 00045 will give the weight in grams of the combined carbon dioxide free acidin some waters especially those from mining districts there will be no carbonates on the contrary there may be free mineral acid or acid salts in these cases it is necessary to determine the amount of acid other than carbon dioxide present in excess of that required to form normal salts this is done in the following waymake an ammoniacal copper solution by taking 13 grams of copper sulphate cuso45h2o dissolving in water adding solution of ammonia until the precipitate first formed has nearly dissolved and diluting to 1 litre allow to settle and decant off the clear liquid the strength of this solution is determined by titrating against 10 or 20 cc of the standard solution of sulphuric acid 100 cc 1 gram h2so4 the finishing point is reached as soon as the solution becomes turbid from precipitated cupric hydrate at first as each drop falls into the acid solution the ammonia and cupric hydrate combine with the free acid to form ammonic and cupric sulphates but as soon as the free acid is used up the ammonia in the next drop not only precipitates an equivalent of cupric hydrate from the solution but also throws down that carried by itself this method is applicable in the presence of metallic sulphates other than ferric the standardising and titration should be made under the same conditions since sulphuric acid and sulphates are predominant in waters of this kind it is most convenient to report the acidity of the water as equivalent to so much sulphuric acid dissolved oxygenfor the gasometric method of analysing for dissolved oxygen and for the schtzenbergers volumetric method the student is referred to suttons volumetric analysis the following is an easy method of estimating the free oxygen in a watertake 20 cc of a stannous chloride solution about 20 grams of the salt with 10 cc of hydrochloric acid to the litre add 10 cc of hydrochloric acid and titrate in an atmosphere of carbon dioxide with standard permanganate of potassium solution made by dissolving 1975 gram of the salt in 1 litre of water 1 cc equals 05 milligram of oxygen a similar titration is made with the addition of 100 cc of the water to be tested less permanganate will be required in the second titration according to the amount of oxygen in the water and the difference multiplied by 05 will give the weight of the oxygen in milligrams small quantities of nitrates do not interfere in reporting the results of the analysis it is customary to combine the acids and bases found on some such principle as the followingthe sulphuric oxide is calculated as combined with the potash and reported as potassic sulphate k2so4 the balance of the sulphuric oxide is then apportioned to the soda and reported as sulphate of soda na2so4 if any is still left it is reported as calcium sulphate caso4 and after that as magnesic sulphate mgso4 when the sulphuric oxide has been satisfied the chlorine is distributed taking the bases in the same order then the nitric pentoxide and lastly the carbon dioxide but any method for thus combining the bases and acids must be arbitrary and inaccurate it is extremely improbable that any simple statement can represent the manner in which the bases and acids are distributed whilst in solution and since different chemists are not agreed as to any one system it is better to give up the attempt and simply state the results of the analysis this has only one inconvenience the bases are represented as oxides and since some of them are present as chlorides the sum total of the analysis will be in excess of the actual amount present by the weight of the oxygen equivalent to the chlorine present as chloride the following is an example of such a statement parts per 100000 total solids dried at 100 c 2873 chlorine 170 nitrogen as nitrate 003 ammonia

apparatus shown in fig 64 is convenient for laboratory use it consists of a copper retort heated by a ring gasburner and connected with a wormcondenser illustration fig 64 practical exercise a mineral on analysis gave the following resultswater 4494 per cent sulphuric oxide 2872 per cent ferrous iron 1392 per cent ferric iron 035 per cent copper 61 per cent the mineral was soluble in water and showed nothing else on testing how would you report the analysis calculate the formula for the salt the halogens there is a group of closely allied elements to which the name halogen saltproducer has been given it comprises chlorine bromine iodine and fluorine these elements combine directly with metals forming as many series of salts chlorides bromides iodides and fluorides corresponding to the respective oxides but differing in their formul by having two atoms of the halogen in the place of one atom of oxygen for example ferrous oxide is feo and ferrous chloride is fecl2 and again ferric oxide is fe2o3 whilst ferric chloride is fe2cl6 these salts differ from the carbonates nitrates c in containing no oxygen consequently it is incorrect to speak of such compounds as chloride of potash fluoride of lime c since potash and lime are oxides it is important to bear this in mind in reporting analyses in which determinations have been made say of chlorine magnesia and potash or of fluorine silica and alumina it is necessary in all such cases to deduct from the total an amount of oxygen equivalent to the halogen found except of course where the base has been determined and recorded as metal compounds containing oxides and fluorides c do not lend themselves to the method of determining the halogen by difference for example topaz which according to dana has the formula al2sio4f2 would yield in the ordinary course of analysis alumina 554 silica 326 fluorine 206 1086 the oxygen equivalent to 206 per cent fluorine may be found by multiplying the percentage of fluorine by 0421 it is 87 per cent and must be deducted the analysis would then be reported thus alumina 554 silica 326 fluorine 206 1086 less oxygen equivalent to fluorine 87 999 take as an illustration the following actual analysis by fw clarke and js diller alumina 5738 silica 3192 fluorine 1699 potash 015 soda 133 water 020 10797 deduct oxygen equivalent 716 10081 in calculating the factor for the oxygen equivalent divide the weight of one atom of oxygen 16 by the weight of two atoms of the halogen for example with chlorine it would be 1671 or 02253 with bromine 16160 or 01000 with iodine 16254 or 0063 and with fluorine 1638 or 0421 chlorine and chlorides chlorine occurs in nature chiefly combined with sodium as halite or rock salt nacl with potassium it forms sylvine kcl and together with magnesium carnallite kclmgcl26h2o of the metalliferous minerals containing chlorine kerargyrite or horn silver agcl and atacamite an oxychloride of copper cucl23cuho2 are the most important apatite phosphate of lime and pyromorphite phosphate of lead contain a considerable amount of it chlorine is a gas of a greenish colour possessing a characteristic odour and moderately soluble in water it does not occur native and is generally prepared by the action of an oxidising agent on hydrochloric acid it combines directly with metals at the ordinary temperature even with platinum and gold forming chlorides which except in the case of silver are soluble it is important in metallurgy because of the extensive use of it in extracting gold by chloridising processes it is also used in refining gold detectioncompounds containing the oxides of chlorine are not found in nature because of the readiness with which they lose oxygen by reduction they yield a chloride the form in which chlorine is met with in minerals in testing the compound supposed to contain a chloride is boiled with water or in some cases dilute nitric acid to the clear solution containing nitric acid a few drops of nitrate of silver solution are added if on shaking a white curdy precipitate soluble in ammonia separates out it is sufficiently satisfactory evidence of the presence of chlorides solution and separationthe chlorides are generally soluble in water and are got into solution by extracting with warm dilute nitric acid or if insoluble the substance is fused with carbonate of soda extracted with water and the filtrate acidified with nitric acid for the determination it is not necessary to obtain the solution of the chloride free from other acids or metals if tin antimony mercury or platinum is present it is best to separate by means of sulphuretted hydrogen the chloride is determined in the solution after removal of the excess of the gas where traces of chlorides are being looked for a blank experiment is made to determine the quantity introduced with the reagents one hundred cc of ordinary water contains from 1 to 3 milligrams of chlorine on the addition of nitrate of silver to the nitric acid solution chloride of silver separates out this is free from other substances except perhaps bromide and iodide gravimetric determination freely mix the solution containing the chloride with dilute nitric acid filter if necessary and treat with nitrate of silver heat nearly to boiling and when the precipitate has settled filter and wash with hot distilled water dry and transfer to a weighed berlin crucible burn the filterpaper separately and convert any reduced silver into chloride by alternate treatment with drops of nitric and of hydrochloric acid add the main portion to this and heat cautiously till the edges of the mass show signs of fusing about 260 cool in the desiccator and weigh the substance is chloride of silver agcl and contains 2473 per cent of chlorine the precipitated chloride is filtered and washed as soon as possible after settling since on exposure to light it becomes purple and loses a small amount of chlorine volumetric method there are several volumetric methods but that based on the precipitation of silver chloride in neutral solution by means of a standard solution of silver nitrate using potassium chromate as indicator is preferred silver chromate is a redcoloured salt and when silver nitrate is added to a solution containing both chloride and chromate the development of the red colour marks off sharply the point at which the chloride is used up silver chromate is decomposed and consequently decolorised by solution of any chloride the solution for this method must be neutral since free acid prevents the formation of the red silver chromate if not already neutral it is neutralised by titrating cautiously with a solution of soda in a neutral solution other substances such as phosphates and arsenates also yield a precipitate with a solution of nitrate of silver and will count as chloride if they are not removed the standard solution of nitrate of silver is made by dissolving 2394 grams of the salt agno3 in distilled water and diluting to 1 litre 100 cc are equal to 05 gram of chlorine the indicator is made by adding silver nitrate to a strong neutral solution of yellow chromate of potash k2cro4 till a permanent red precipitate is formed the solution is allowed to settle and the clear liquid decanted into a stoppered bottle labelled chromate indicator for chlorine standardise the silver nitrate by weighing up 05 gram of pure sodium chloride or potassium chloride transfer to a flask and dissolve in distilled water dilute to 100 cc fill an ordinary burette with the standard silver solution and after adjusting run into the flask a quantity sufficient to throw down the greater part of the chlorine add a few drops of the chromate indicator and continue the addition of the silver nitrate until the yellow colour of the solution becomes permanently tinted red after shaking this shows that the chlorine is all precipitated and that the chromate is beginning to come down the further addition of a couple of drops of the silver solution will cause a marked difference in the tint read off the quantity run in and calculate the standard one gram of sodium chloride contains 06062 gram of chlorine and 1 gram of potassium chloride contains 04754 gram for the determination of small quantities of chloride a few milligrams the same method is used but the standard solution is diluted so that each cc is equal to 1 milligram of chlorine and the chromate indicator is added before titrating the standard solution is made by measuring off 200 cc of the solution described above and diluting with distilled water to 1 litre bromine and bromides bromine closely resembles chlorine in the nature of its compounds it does not occur free in nature but is occasionally found in combination with silver as bromargyrite agbr and together with chloride in embolite it mainly occurs as alkaline bromides in certain natural waters nearly all the bromine of commerce is derived from the mother liquors of saltworksie the liquors from which the common salt has been crystallised out bromine combines directly with the metals forming a series of saltsthe bromides in ordinary work they are separated with and except when specially tested for counted as chlorides they are detected by adding chlorine water to the suspected solution and shaking up with carbon bisulphide bromine colours the latter brown iodine and iodides iodine does not occur in nature in the free state and iodides are rare iodargyrite or iodide of silver agi being the only one which ranks as a mineral species iodates are found associated with chili saltpetre which is an important source of the element iodine and iodides are largely used in the laboratory and have already been frequently referred to it is used as an oxidising agent in a similar manner as permanganate and bichromate of potash especially in the determinations of copper arsenic antimony and manganese iodine is not readily soluble in water but dissolves easily in a concentrated solution of potassium iodide its solutions are strongly coloured a drop of a dilute solution colours a large volume of water decidedly yellow on the addition of starch paste this becomes blue the delicacy of this reaction is taken advantage of in titrations to determine when free iodine is present the blue colour may be alternately developed and removed by the addition of iodine or an oxidising agent and hyposulphite of soda or some other reducing agent in decolorising the solution changes from blue or black to colourless or pale yellow according to circumstances sometimes the solution instead of remaining colourless gradually develops a blue which recurs in spite of the further addition of the reducing agent in these cases the conditions of the assay have been departed from or and this is more often the case there is some substance present capable of liberating iodine iodine forms a series of saltsthe iodidesresembling in many respects the chlorides these can be obtained by direct combination of the metals with iodine detectionfree iodine is best recognised by the violet vapours evolved from the solution on heating and by the blue or black colour which it strikes on the addition of starch paste iodides are detected by boiling with strong solutions of ferric sulphate or chloride iodine is liberated distilled over and collected chlorine also liberates iodine from iodides and this reaction is frequently made use of in assaying a process based on this is described under manganese all substances which liberate chlorine on boiling with hydrochloric acid dioxides bichromates permanganates c are determined in a similar way solution and separationmost iodides are soluble in water or dilute acids the separation is effected by distilling the substance with solution of ferric sulphate and collecting the vapour in a dilute solution of sulphurous acid or arsenite of soda on the completion of the distillation the iodine will be in the distillate as iodide and the gravimetric determination is made on this gravimetric determination to the solution containing the iodine as iodide and which is free from chlorides and bromides add a little dilute nitric acid and nitrate of silver till no further precipitate is produced filter off wash with hot water and dry clean the filterpaper as much as possible and burn it collect the ash in a weighed porcelain crucible add the main portion and heat to incipient fusion cool and weigh the substance is silver iodide and contains 5403 per cent of iodine volumetric method this is for the titration of free iodine and is practically that which is described under manganese the substance to be determined is distilled with ferric sulphate and the iodine is collected in a solution of potassium iodide in which it readily dissolves if flaky crystals separate out in the receiver more potassium iodide crystals are added when the distillation is finished the receiver is disconnected and its contents washed out into a beaker and titrated with hypo the standard solution of hypo is made by dissolving 1958 grams of hyposulphite of soda na2s2o35h2o in water and diluting to 1 litre 100 cc are equal to 1 gram of iodine to standardise the solution weigh up 025 gram of pure iodine in a small beaker add 2 or 3 crystals of potassium iodide cover with water and when dissolved dilute to 50 or 100 cc titrate and calculate the standard fluorine and fluorides fluorine is frequently met with as calcium fluoride or fluorspar caf2 it occurs less abundantly as cryolite na3alf6 a fluoride of aluminium and sodium which is used in glassmaking certain other rarer fluorides are occasionally met with fluorine is also found in apatite and in some silicates such as topaz tourmaline micas c hydrofluoric acid is used for etching glass and opening up silicates it attacks silica forming fluoride of silicon sif4 which is volatile silica is by this means eliminated from other oxides which in the presence of sulphuric acid are fixed the commercial acid is seldom pure and generally weak and the acid itself is dangerously obnoxious the use of ammonium fluoride or sodium fluoride and a mineral acid is more convenient determinations of this kind are made in platinum dishes enclosed in lead or copper vessels in a wellventilated place fluorspar is useful as a flux in dry assaying it renders slags which would otherwise be pasty quite fluid fluorides generally are fusible and impart fusibility to substances with which they form weak compounds their fluxing action does not depend on the removal of silicon as fluoride detectionfluorides in small quantity are easily overlooked unless specially sought for in larger amounts they are recognised by the property hydrofluoric acid has of etching glass a watchglass is warmed and a layer of wax is melted over the convex side when cold some lines are engraved on the waxed surface with any sharppointed instrument the substance to be tested is powdered and moistened in a platinum dish with sulphuric acid the watchglass is filled with cold water and supported over the dish the dish is then carefully warmed but not sufficiently to melt the wax after a minute or two the glass is taken off and the wax removed if the substance contained fluorine the characters will be found permanently etched on the glass an equally good but more rapid test is to mix the powdered substance with some silica and to heat the mixture in a test tube with sulphuric acid silicon fluoride is evolved and if a moistened glass rod is held in the tube it becomes coated with a white deposit of silica formed by the decomposition of the silicon fluoride by the water this is also used as a test for silica but in this case the substance is mixed with a fluoride and the experiment must obviously be carried out in a platinum vessel separation and determinationthe determination of fluorine is difficult in the case of fluorides free from silicates such as fluorspar it is determined indirectly by decomposing a weighed portion with sulphuric acid evaporating igniting and weighing the residual sulphate the increase in weight multiplied by 0655 gives the weight of fluorine in the presence of silica this method does not answer because of the volatilisation of silicon fluoride in these cases whler adopted the following plan which resembles that for the indirect determination of carbon dioxide mix the weighed substance in a small flask with powdered silica and sulphuric acid the mouth of the flask is closed with a cork carrying a tube which is filled the first half with calcium chloride and the second half with pumice coated with dried copper sulphate the apparatus is weighed quickly and then warmed till decomposition is complete a current of dry air is aspirated for a minute or two and the apparatus again weighed the loss in weight gives that of the silicon fluoride sif4 which multiplied by 07307 gives the weight of fluorine fresenius uses the same reaction but collects and weighs the silicon fluoride the finely powdered and dried substance is mixed with ten or fifteen times its weight of ignited and powdered silica the mixture is introduced into a small dry flask connected on one side with a series of dryingtubes and on the other with an empty tube to condense any sulphuric acid to this last is joined a dryingtube containing chloride of calcium and anhydrous copper sulphate this is directly connected with a series of three weighed tubes in which the fluoride of silicon is collected the last of these is joined to another dryingtube the first weighed tube contains pumice and cotton wool moistened with water the second tube contains sodalime as well as in the upper half of the second limb fused calcium chloride between plugs of wool the third tube is filled half with sodalime and half with fused calcium chloride the distillingflask containing the substance mixed with silica is charged with 40 or 50 cc of sulphuric acid and placed on the hot plate alongside it is placed a similar dry flask containing a thermometer and the temperature in this is kept at 150 or 160 c a current of air is sent through the tubes during the operation which takes from one to three hours for from 01 to 1 gram of the substance a correction is made by deducting 0001 gram for every hour the dried air has been passed through the increase in weight of the three tubes gives the weight of the silicon fluoride penfield uses a similar arrangement but passes his silicon fluoride into an alcoholic solution of potassium chloride silica and potassium silicofluoride are precipitated and hydrochloric acid is set free100 the acid thus liberated is titrated with a standard solution of alkali in the alcoholic solution and from the amount of free acid found the fluorine is calculated the weight of hydrochloric acid hcl found multiplied by 1562 gives the weight of the fluorine with this method of working fewer utubes are required the exit tube from the flask is bent so as to form a small v which is kept cool in water this is directly connected with the utube containing the alcoholic solution of potassium chloride the flask with the assay is heated for about two hours and a current of dry air is aspirated throughout the determination fluoride of silicon is a gas not easily condensed to a liquid but is immediately decomposed by water or moist air footnotes 95 this will require two or three hours to thoroughly complete it is best to powder the oxide first produced and recalcine 96 no magnetic oxide was formed 97

sulphides it is common in all mineral districts iron pyrites fes2 is the most abundant source of this element sulphates such as gypsum are fairly common but have no value so far as the sulphur in them is concerned in coal it exists as an impurity occurring partly as a constituent of organic compounds sulphur whether free or combined with metals forms on burning sulphurous oxide so2 which by the action of oxidising agents and water is converted into sulphuric acid it forms two oxides sulphurous so2 and sulphuric so3 which combine with bases to form sulphites and sulphates sulphites are of little importance to the assayer and are converted into sulphates by the action of nitric acid and other oxidising agents the native sulphides when acted on with hydrochloric acid give off sulphuretted hydrogen with nitric acid or aqua regia sulphates are formed and more or less sulphur separated sulphur is detected in sulphides by the irritating odour of sulphurous oxide given off on roasting by the evolution of sulphuretted hydrogen when treated with hydrochloric acid or by a white precipitate of barium sulphate formed when barium chloride is added to the aqua regia solution dry assaythere is no method of general application free or native sulphur may be volatilised condensed and weighed but pyrites only gives up a portion of its sulphur when heated in a closed vessel while most sulphides and all sulphates give up none at all in the determination of sulphur in brimstone 10 grams of the substance are taken placed in a small porcelain dish heated over a bunsen burner in a wellventilated place and ignited when the sulphur has been completely burnt off the residue which consists chiefly of sand is collected and weighed in a separate portion the moisture and arsenic are determined the amounts of these are deducted from the loss in the first experiment the difference multiplied by 10 gives the percentage of sulphur wet methods solutionall sulphates excepting those of lead barium strontium and lime are soluble in water or dilute acid all sulphides except cinnabar are converted into sulphates by the action of nitric acid at a gentle heat or better by the action of a mixture of three volumes of nitric acid and one volume of hydrochloric acid this last attacks cinnabar as well with most substances it is difficult to convert the whole of the sulphur into sulphuric acid the sulphur separates out at first as a dark spongy mass which on continued treatment changes to lightcoloured flakes when the solution becomes concentrated and the temperature rises sufficiently the sulphur fuses into one or more honeycoloured globules which owing to the small surface they oppose to the acid are very slowly oxidised it is not desirable to assist the formation of these globules therefore the temperature is kept as low as possible and strong nitric acid is used when such globules form it is best to allow the solution to cool when the globules will solidify they can then be filtered off and picked out from the insoluble residue dried weighed ignited and again weighed the loss being counted as sulphur with iron pyrites this difficulty seldom occurs metallic sulphides when fused with an excess of nitre are completely oxidised if the ore is rich in sulphur some inert body such as sodium chloride or better sodium carbonate is added to dilute the action with pure sulphur the action is so energetic as to cause an explosion so that care should be taken with burnt ores incompletely calcined pyrites there is sufficient oxide of iron present to prevent too rapid action these fusions with nitre are best conducted in a platinum dish covered with a piece of platinum foil the ore is ground with the nitre to ensure complete mixing the heat need not be excessive so that a single bunsen burner placed beneath the dish will suffice if the bottom of the dish is seen to be redhot it is sufficient on cooling and extracting with water the sulphur will pass into solution as potassium sulphate which is then filtered off from the insoluble oxides of iron copper c the filtrate after having been treated with a large excess of hydrochloric acid evaporated to dryness and redissolved in water is ready for the determination lead sulphate may be dissolved by boiling with ammonium acetate the insoluble sulphates of barium strontium and lime are decomposed by fusing with 4 or 5 times their weight of fusion mixture the alkaline sulphates are then dissolved out with water and filtered off from the insoluble residue the filtrate is rendered acid with hydrochloric acid separationthe determination of the sulphuric acid in these solutions by precipitation with barium chloride also serves as a separation but in hot acid solutions containing copper and more especially iron salts the baric sulphate has a strong tendency to carry down amounts of those bodies varying no doubt with the conditions of the precipitation boiling hydrochloric acid fails to completely extract them moreover the use of hot concentrated hydrochloric acid causes a loss by dissolving barium sulphate nitric acid and nitrates must be decomposed by prolonged boiling and evaporation with hydrochloric acid the iron may be removed by adding a slight excess of ammonia to the faintly acid solution filtering off and washing the precipitated ferric hydrate with hot water by slightly acidulating the filtrate with hydrochloric acid it will be rendered ready for the determination gravimetric method this assay is one of those which strikingly shows the necessity of getting the assay solution under proper conditions in order to obtain satisfactory results the method has been repeatedly investigated and the conclusion arrived at that it can be correct only by accident yet there are many chemists who get good results and place considerable faith in its accuracy this can only be due to differences in the manner of working it is generally understood that nitric acid or nitrates must be absent and our experience fully confirms this precipitations in nitrate solutions are worthless as the following experiments show in each experiment the bulk of the solution was 150 cc the solutions contained 10 grams of nitre were freely acid with hydrochloric acid and were precipitated while boiling with slight excess of baric chloride sulphuric acid taken 0020 gram 0050 gram 0100 gram found 0019 0047 0098 taken 0500 1004 1000 found 0526 1126 1126 all the precipitates were boiled with hydrochloric acid and thoroughly washed before weighing the results of some other experiments on this subject are given under sulphur in the examination of commercial copper page 207 the solution having been obtained free from nitrates and chlorates and containing but little free hydrochloric acid is largely diluted heated to boiling and precipitated with a moderate excess of a solution of chloride of barium 8 parts of the crystallized barium chloride are sufficient for 1 of sulphur it is allowed to settle for halfanhour and then decanted through a filter the precipitate is shaken up with boiling water rendered slightly acid filtered washed dried ignited and weighed the ignited precipitate when pure is white and is not decomposed at a red heat it is barium sulphate baso4 and contains 1373 per cent of sulphur or 3433 per cent of sulphuric oxide so3 determination of sulphur in pyritesweigh up half a gram of the dried and powdered sample and treat with 10 cc of a mixture of 3 volumes of nitric acid and 1 volume of hydrochloric acid occasionally heating evaporate to dryness treat with 5 cc of hydrochloric acid and again evaporate take up with 1 cc of hydrochloric acid and 100 cc of hot water filter through a small filter and wash the residue may contain sulphates of lead barium or lime it must be separately examined if the total sulphur is wanted the filtrate is heated and rendered slightly alkaline with ammonia filter off the precipitated ferric hydrate through a quick filter and wash with hot water if necessary evaporate the bulk to about 200 cc render faintly acid with hydrochloric acid and add 20 cc of solution of barium chloride allow to stand for halfanhour and decant through a filter wash with hot water dry ignite and weigh pure pyrites contains 5333 per cent of sulphur volumetric method this is based upon the easy conversion of all sulphur compounds into sulphates by fusion with nitre or by oxidation with nitric acid and on the determination of the sulphate formed by titration in an acetic acid solution with baric chloride101 the finishing point is determined by filtering off portions of the assay solution and testing with sulphuric acid a slight excess of baric chloride will cause a precipitate the process may be divided into1 the preparation of the solution and 2 the titration preparation of the solutionweigh up from 1 to 5 grams of the dried and powdered substance and mix intimately with 4 grams of powdered nitre clean out the mortar with another gram of nitre and add this as a cover heat in a platinum crucible for fifteen minutes at a low temperature cool and extract with water in an evaporatingdish about 9 inches across and holding 700 or 800 cc add 10 grams of sodium acetate and 10 cc of acetic acid and dilute to half a litre boil the solution is ready for titrating substances which lose sulphur on heating such as pyrites are thus treatedweigh up 1 gram and evaporate nearly to dryness with 10 cc each of nitric and hydrochloric acids take up with 10 cc of hydrochloric acid and again boil down to a small bulk dilute and transfer to a 9inch evaporatingdish add 10 grams of sodium acetate and 5 cc of acetic acid dilute to half a litre and boil the solution is ready for titrating sulphates may be dissolved up in the dish itself with the help of a cc or so of hydrochloric acid sodium acetate and acetic acid are then added and after dilution and boiling the solutions are at once titrated the solution before titration must contain no free mineral acid but 5 or 10 cc of acetic acid should be present it must contain 10 grams of sodium acetate or sufficient to convert any free mineral acid into its corresponding sodic salt or if chlorides nitrates or sulphates of the metals are present sufficient to decompose them if a precipitation occurs as is the case with ferric salts c the solution is titrated with the precipitate in it the titrationthe standard solution of barium chloride is made by dissolving 7625 grams of the crystallized salt bacl22h2o in distilled water and diluting to 1 litre 100 cc will equal 1 gram of sulphur as indicator use dilute sulphuric acid the strength of the solution may be checked by the titration of 5 grams of ferrous sulphate oxidized with permanganate of potassium or a few drops of nitric acid which should require 575 cc of the barium chloride solution or any pure sulphate of known composition can be used anhydrous salts should be preferred illustration fig 65 fill an ordinary 100 cc burette with the solution of barium chloride the evaporating dish containing the assay solution is placed on a round burner as shown in fig 65 and the solution is kept steadily boiling an ordinary bunsenburner flame will cause bumping and should not be used run in the standard solution in quantity known to be insufficient then withdraw a portion of about 2 cc with a pipette and filter through a fine filterpaper into a test tube run in another 05 cc of the standard solution and withdraw and filter into a test tube another portion of 2 cc and continue this operation until halfadozen or more portions have been drawn off the test tubes should be arranged in order in a stand resting on a piece of paper so that each test tube representing 05 cc of the standard baric chloride may have its value recorded beneath it fig 66 add to each test tube 3 drops of dilute sulphuric acid that which shows the first appearance of a precipitate marks the point at which the titration is complete suppose for example that the test tube marked 485 cc shows no precipitate while that at 490 cc shows one it is evident that the finishing point lies between these readings with a little practice one can judge from the appearance of the precipitate in the 49 cc tube whether 14 cc should be deducted or not illustration fig 66 it is better to add dilute sulphuric acid and to watch for the appearance of a precipitate in the test tube than to add baric chloride and to look for its nonappearance besides baric chloride is much less likely to be present in a test tube as impurity than sulphates are in this way the chance of error from what are termed accidental causes is diminished the following experiments show the effect of variation in the conditions of titration make a standard solution of sulphuric acid by diluting 4365 grams of sulphuric acid sp g 16165 to 1 litre 100 cc will contain 1 gram of sulphur an equivalent solution may be made by dissolving 10062 grams of sodium sulphate crystals na2so410h2o or 8688 grams of ferrous sulphate feso47h2o in water oxidising the latter and diluting to 1 litre the order in which these experiments are given is that in which they were made in an investigation into the conditions under which the titration could most accurately be effected effect of hydrochloric and nitric acidsthe titrations were performed in the manner already described but sodic acetate and acetic acid were absent twenty cc of the standard solution of sulphuric acid were used hydrochloric acid present 00 cc

sodic acetate and acetic acid did not interfere it became desirable to make some experiments on the finishing point the first object sought for was the smallest amount of the standard baric chloride in 500 cc of water required to give an indication when tested in the manner already described baric chloride conditions of assay solution required water only 005 cc with 10 grams of sodium acetate and 5 cc of acetic acid 005 the same with 5 grams of nitre 010 like the last but with 5 grams of salt instead of nitre 010 these show that as small an amount of baric chloride solution as is equal to only 0000002 gram of sulphur in the 2 cc of solution tested yields a decided precipitate on the addition of 3 drops of sulphuric acid to determine whether the same finishing point is obtained on testing the filtered portions in the test tubes with baric chloride as is obtained on testing with sulphuric acid a titration was made with 20 cc of standard solution of sulphuric acid together with the usual quantities of sodic acetate and acetic acid and two lots of 2 cc each were filtered into two sets of test tubes after each addition of the standard baric chloride to one series 3 drops of baric chloride solution were added and to the other 3 drops of sulphuric acid the results were with dilute with baric baric chloride added sulphuric acid chloride solution 195 cc clear cloudy 1975 clear cloudy 200 finished finished 2025 cloudy clear 205 cloudy clear the two methods of testing give the same result but this balance is disturbed in the presence of much nitre the indications with baric

sulphuric acid effect of varying sulphurin these and the subsequent experiments the titrations were performed in the presence of 10 grams of sodic acetate and 10 cc of acetic acid in the manner

in the absence of ferric salts phosphates and arsenates count as sulphur in two series of experiments for determining the effect of varying amounts of sulphur in the form of ferrous sulphate we obtained the following resultsin the first series the assay solution was prepared in the manner we have described for pyrites and in the second series by fusion with nitre sulphur added 0050 gram 0100

used in an assay and since the requisite amount of nitre considerably exceeds that sufficient to oxidise the sulphur not more than 05 gram of unoxidised sulphur should be present in the portion of the sample weighed up for determination when the amount of sulphur present is not known within reasonable limits the test portions may be tried with a drop of baric chloride solution instead of sulphuric acid so that the diminishing quantity of precipitate may give warning of an approach to the finishing point determination of sulphur in blendeweigh up 1 gram of dried and powdered blende and mix and

heat gently with a bunsen burner till the nitre melts and the stuff shows signs of deflagrating remove the heat and allow the action to go on by itself for a minute or so then heat over the bunsen burner for 10 minutes cool transfer the whole to the titratingdish boil with 500 cc of water remove the small dish and foil add sodic acetate and acetic acid and titrate for example 1 gram required 345 cc of barium chloride standard 1005 gram s which is equivalent to 347 per cent sulphur the theoretical percentage is 348 determination of sulphur in chalcocite grey copper oreproceed as in the last experiment but since the action with nitre is more moderate no special precautions need be taken on heating a platinum dish may be used an example which was heated for 30 minutes required 205 cc

dilute with water transfer to a titratingdish add 10 grams of sodic acetate and 5 cc of acetic acid and dilute with water to 500 cc boil and titrate an example with 1 gram of a pure crystallized pyrites required 527 cc of the barium chloride solution which is equivalent to 530 per cent of sulphur theory requires 533 per cent of sulphur determination of sulphur in mispickeltake 1 gram of the powdered ore and evaporate with 10 cc of nitric acid and take up with 3 or 4 cc of hydrochloric acid if any globules of sulphur remain again evaporate with nitric acid dilute and transfer to the titratingdish add 10 grams of sodic acetate dilute with water boil and titrate the mispickel carries according to theory exactly sufficient iron to precipitate the arsenic as ferric arsenate in an acetic acid solution so no more iron need be added the ferric arsenate will separate out as a yellowishwhite flocculent precipitate an example required in duplicate experiment 185 cc and 187 cc of barium chloride equivalent to 187 per cent of sulphur the formula fes2feas2 requires 196 percent but the sulphur generally varies considerably from this amount determination of sulphur in burnt

sulphateswhen the sulphur exists in the sample received by the assayer in an oxidised state as sulphate it is usual to report it in terms of sulphuric oxide so3 in this case the metal must also be reported as oxide for example an analysis of copper sulphate would be thus reported oxide of copper cuo 318 sulphuric oxide so3 321 water 361 1000 the percentage of sulphur multiplied by 25 gives the percentage of sulphuric oxide thus a sample of copper sulphate containing 1285 per cent of sulphur will contain 1285 25 or 3212 per cent of sulphuric oxide in minerals and metallurgical products it is common to find the sulphur in both conditionsie as sulphate and sulphide generally in these the percentage of sulphur only is wanted but this will depend entirely on commercial requirements and not on the fancy of the assayer soluble sulphates are determined separately by extracting with small quantities of cold water so as to avoid the separation of basic sulphates or if the sulphides present are not at the same time attacked by dilute hydrochloric acid lead sulphate may be extracted by boiling with ammonic acetate whilst barium strontium and perhaps calcium sulphate will be mainly found in the residue insoluble in acids weigh up from 2 to 5 grams of the material according to the amount of sulphur judged to be present and dissolve them in the titratingdish with 1 cc of hydrochloric acid and 50 cc of water add 10 grams of sodic acetate and 10 cc of acetic acid dilute boil and titrate in the case of ferric salts half the quantity of acetic acid will be better as then the ferric iron will be precipitated and a colourless solution will be left in which the end reaction is more readily distinguished determined in this way 5 gram samples of the following salts gave the results

or 340 per cent of sulphuric oxide theory requires 343 per cent of the latter since both carbonate of soda and potash are liable to contain sulphates a blank determination should be made on 5 grams of the fusion mixture and the amount found be deducted from that got in the assay practical exercises 1 the price of sulphur in an ore being 412d per unit in the northern markets what would be the price of a ton of ore containing 49 per cent of sulphur what would be the effect on the price of an error of 025 per cent in the assay 2 pyrites carries 50 per cent of sulphur and on calcining yields 70 per

a source of sulphur for sulphuric acid making 4 how would you determine the percentage of sulphuric oxide in a sample of gypsum what is sulphuric oxide and what relation does it bear to sulphur 5 a mineral contains 207 per cent of water 324 per cent of lime and 186 per cent of sulphur what is its probable composition what experiment would you try to determine the accuracy of your conclusion selenium occurs in nature combined with copper mercury and lead in certain rare minerals in small quantities it is found in many ores it is detected in solution by the red precipitate produced on boiling the acid solution with sodium sulphite this reaction is used for its determination solutionthe solution is effected by boiling with nitric acid or aqua regia or by fusing with nitre to separate the selenium the solution is evaporated with an excess of hydrochloric acid and a little sodium or potassium chloride this destroys any nitric acid that may be present and reduces selenic acid h2seo4 to selenious h2seo3 the solution is diluted with water and treated with a solution of sulphite of soda it is warmed and at last boiled the selenium separates as a red precipitate which on boiling becomes denser and black it is collected on a weighed filter washed with hot water dried at 100 c and weighed as pure selenium selenium can be precipitated with sulphuretted hydrogen as a sulphide which is readily soluble in ammonium sulphide this sulphide may be oxidised with hydrochloric acid and chlorate of potash and the selenium separated in the manner described tellurium tellurium occurs in nature native and in combination with gold silver bismuth and lead it is sometimes met with in assaying gold ores it may be detected by the purple colour it imparts to strong sulphuric acid when dissolved in the cold and by the black precipitate of metallic tellurium which its solutions yield on treatment with a reducing agent telluric acid is reduced to tellurous with evolution of chlorine on boiling with hydrochloric acid solution is effected by boiling with aqua regia or by fusing with nitre and sodium carbonate separationtellurium closely resembles selenium in its reactions it is separated and determined in the same way like it it forms a sulphide soluble in ammonium sulphide it is distinguished from selenium by the insolubility in a solution of cyanide of

phosphorus nitrogen arsenic the chief source of the arsenic of commerce is arsenical pyrites or mispickel which contains about 45 per cent of arsenic as arsenic also occurs as a constituent of several comparatively rare minerals and as an impurity it is very widely distributed white arsenic is an oxide of arsenic and is obtained by roasting arsenical ores and refining the material crude arsenic which condenses in the flues arsenic itself is volatile and many of its compounds have the same property it forms two welldefined series of salts corresponding to the oxides arsenious oxide as2o3 and arsenic oxide as2o5 these combine with bases to form arsenites and arsenates respectively boiling with nitric acid converts the lower into the higher oxide and powerful reducingagents such as cuprous chloride have the opposite effect arsenic may be detected by dissolving the substance in hydrochloric acid or in aqua regia avoiding an excess of nitric acid and adding a little of this solution to the contents of a small flask in which hydrogen is being made by the action of zinc and hydrochloric acid the ignited jet of hydrogen assumes a blue colour if arsenic is present and a cold porcelain dish held in the flame fig 67 becomes coated with a dark deposit of metallic arsenic antimony produces a similar effect but is distinguished by the insolubility of its deposit in a cold solution of bleachingpowder illustration fig 67 arsenites are distinguished by the volatility of the chloride by decolorising a solution of permanganate of potassium and by immediately giving a yellow precipitate with sulphuretted hydrogen arsenates are distinguished after converting into soda salts by boiling with carbonate of soda and neutralising by giving with nitrate of silver a red precipitate and with magnesia mixture a white crystalline one dry assaythere is no dry assay which is trustworthy the following method is sometimes used to find the proportion of arsenious oxide in crude arsenicweigh up 5 grams of the dried sample and place them in a clean dry testtube about 6 inches long tie a small filterpaper over the mouth of the tube so as to prevent aircurrents heat the tube cautiously so as to sublime off the white arsenic into the upper part of the tube cut off the bottom of the testtube by wetting whilst hot scrape out the arsenic and weigh it the weight gives an approximate idea of the quantity and the colour of the quality of the white arsenic obtainable from the sample some workers sellers weigh the residue and determine the white arsenic by difference in determining the percentage of moisture in these samples the substance is dried on a waterbath or in a wateroven wet methods solutionwhere as in crude arsenic the substance is arsenious oxide as2o3 mixed with impurities the arsenic is best got into solution by warming with caustic soda and neutralising the excess with hydrochloric acid it will be present as sodium arsenite metals and alloys are acted on by means of nitric acid or the arsenic may be at the same time dissolved and separated by distilling with a stronglyacid solution of ferric chloride in the way described under volumetric methods with minerals mattes c solution is thus effectedthe finelypowdered substance is mixed in a large platinum or porcelain crucible with from six to ten times its weight of a mixture of equal parts of carbonate of soda and nitre the mass is then heated gradually to fusion and kept for a few minutes in that state when cold it is extracted with warm water and filtered from the insoluble residue the solution acidified with nitric acid and boiled contains the arsenic as sodium arsenate with mispickel and those substances which easily give off arsenic on heating the substance is first treated with nitric acid evaporated to dryness and then the residue is treated in the way just described when the arsenic is present as arsenite or arsenide distillation with an acid solution of ferric chloride will give the whole of the arsenic in the distillate free from any metal except perhaps tin as stannic chloride with arsenates dissolve the substance in acid and then add an excess of soda pass sulphuretted hydrogen into the solution warm and filter acidulate the filtrate and pass sulphuretted hydrogen decant off the liquid through a filter and digest the precipitate with ammonic carbonate filter and reprecipitate with hydrochloric acid and sulphuretted hydrogen allow to stand in a warm place and filter off the yellow sulphide of arsenic wash it into a beaker clean the filterpaper if necessary with a drop or two of dilute ammonia evaporate with 10 cc of dilute nitric acid to a small bulk dilute and filter off the globules of sulphur the filtrate contains the arsenic as arsenic acid gravimetric method having got the arsenic into solution as arsenic acid and in a volume not much exceeding 50 cc add about 20 cc of dilute ammonia and 20 cc of magnesia mixture stir with a glass rod and allow to settle overnight filter and wash with dilute ammonia avoiding the use of large quantities of wash water dry transfer the precipitate to a berlin crucible and clean the filterpaper thoroughly burn this paper carefully and completely and add the ash to the contents of the crucible together with 4 or 5 drops of nitric acid evaporate with a bunsen burner and slowly ignite finishing off with the blowpipe or muffle cool and weigh the ignited precipitate is pyrarsenate of magnesia mg2as2o7 and contains 484 per cent of arsenic as instead of igniting the precipitate with nitric acid it may be collected on a weighed filterpaper dried at 100 c and weighed as ammonicmagnesic arsenate 2ammgaso4h2o which contains 395 per cent of arsenic the results in this case are likely to be a little higher the drying is very tedious and is likely to leave behind more water than is allowed for in the formula in a series of determinations in which the arsenic was weighed in both forms the results were ammonicmagnesic arsenic magnesium pyrarsenate arsenic arsenate in grams in grams in grams in grams 00080 00032 00065 00031 00400 00158 00330 00160 00799 00316 00633 00306 01600 00632

firstmentioned method this is done by titrating with a standard solution of iodine and in the latter with a solution of uranium acetate where the arsenic already exists as arsenious oxide or where it is most conveniently separated by distillation as arsenious chloride the iodine method should be used but when the arsenic is separated as ammonicmagnesic arsenate or as sulphide the uranium acetate titration should be adopted iodine process this is based on the fact that sodium arsenite in a solution containing an excess of bicarbonate of soda is indirectly oxidised by iodine to sodium arsenate103 and that an excess of iodine may be recognised by the blue colour it strikes with starch the process is divided into two parts1 the preparation of the solution and 2 the titration preparation of the solutionfor substances like crude arsenic in which the arsenic is present as arsenious oxide the method is as followstake a portion which shall contain from 025 to 05 gram of the oxide place in a beaker and cover with 10 cc of sodic hydrate solution warm till dissolved put a small piece of litmus paper in the solution and render acid with dilute hydrochloric acid add 2 grams of bicarbonate of soda in solution filter if necessary and dilute to 100 cc the solution is now ready for titrating illustration fig 68 where the arsenic has to be separated as arsenious chloride the process is as follows104weigh up 1 gram of the finelypowdered ore metals should be hammered out into a thin foil or be used as filings and place in a 16ounce flask provided with a wellfitting cork and connected with a utube as shown in the drawing fig 68 the utube should contain 2 or 3 cc of water and is cooled by being placed in a jar or large beaker of cold water the water used for cooling should be renewed for each assay pour on the assay in the flask 50 cc of a ferric chloride mixture made by dissolving 600 grams of calcium chloride and 300 grams of ferric chloride in 600 cc of hydrochloric acid and making up to 1 litre with water firmly cork up the apparatus and boil over a small bunsenburner flame for fifteen or twenty minutes but avoid evaporating to dryness disconnect the flask and pour away its contents at once to prevent breakage of the flask by their solidification the arsenic will be condensed in the utube together with the greater part of the hydrochloric acid transfer the distillate to a beaker washing out the tube two or three times with water add a small piece of litmus paper neutralise with ammonia render faintly acid with dilute hydrochloric acid add 2 grams of bicarbonate of soda in solution and dilute to 250 cc the solution is now ready for titrating the arsenic comes over in the early part of the distillation as will be seen from the following experiment made on 1 gram of copper precipitate in which experiment the distillate was collected in separate portions at equal intervals and the arsenic in each portion determined time iodine equivalent to arsenic distilling required in the distillate 5 minutes 120 cc 00450 gram 5 017 00005 5 00 5 00 to dryness 00 the volume of each distillate was about 5 cc in this operation the metals are converted into chlorides by the action of ferric chloride which gives up a part of its chlorine and becomes reduced to the ferrous salt the calcium chloride does not enter into the chemical reaction but raises the temperature at which the solution boils and is essential for the completion of the distillation105 two experiments with material containing 348 per cent of arsenic gave1 with ferric chloride alone 274 per cent and 2 with the addition of calcium chloride 348 per cent it is always necessary to make a blank determination with 1 gram of electrotype copper to find out the amount of arsenic in the ferric chloride mixture106 unfortunately a correction is always required this amounts to about 015 per cent of arsenic on each assay even when the mixture has been purified and this constitutes the weakness of the method since in some cases the correction is as much as or even greater than the percentage to be determined the acid distillate containing the arsenious chloride may be left for an hour or so without much fear of oxidation but it is safer to neutralise and then to add the bicarbonate of soda as the following experiments show several portions of a solution each having a bulk of 100 cc were exposed for varying lengths of time and the arsenic in each determined acid solutions neutralised solutions time exposed iodine arsenic found iodine arsenic found required required 182 cc

beaker 16933 grams of iodine and 30 grams of potassium iodide in crystals add a few cc of water and when dissolved dilute to 1 litre 100 cc will equal 0500 gram of arsenic a solution of starch similar to that used in the iodidecopper assay will be required use 2 cc for each assay variations in the quantity of starch used do not interfere but the solution must be freshly prepared as after seven or eight days it becomes useless to standardise the iodine solution weigh up 03 gram of white arsenic dissolve in caustic soda neutralise after acidulating add 2 grams of bicarbonate of soda and 2 cc of the starch solution and dilute to 200 cc with cold water fill a burette having a glass stopcock with the iodine solution and run it into the solution of arsenic rapidly at first and then more cautiously till a final drop produces a blue colour throughout the solution calculate the standard in the usual way white arsenic contains 7576 per cent of arsenic the following experiments show the effect of variation in the conditions of the titration make a solution of arsenic by dissolving 660 grams of white arsenic in 100 cc of sodic hydrate solution render slightly acid with hydrochloric acid add 10 grains of bicarbonate of soda and dilute to 1 litre 100 cc will contain 050 gram of arsenic effect of varying temperaturethe reaction goes on very quickly in the cold and since there is no occasion for heating all titrations should therefore be carried out cold effect of varying bulkin these experiments 20 cc of arsenic solution were taken 2 grams of bicarbonate of soda and 2 cc of starch solution added and water supplied to the required bulk the results were bulk 500 cc 1000 cc 2500 cc 5000 cc iodine required 200 200 200 200 considerable variation in bulk does not interfere effect of varying bicarbonate of sodathis salt must be present in each titration in considerable excess to prevent the interference of free acid the bicarbonate must be dissolved without heating as neutral carbonates should be avoided bicarbonate added 1 gram 2 grams 5 grams 10 grams iodine required 201 cc 200 cc 201 cc 200 cc these results show that large variation in the quantity of bicarbonate has no effect effect of free acidin these experiments the arsenic taken the starch and the bulk were as before but no bicarbonate was added in one case the solution was rendered acid with 5 cc of acetic acid and in the other with 5 cc of hydrochloric acid in both cases the interference was strongly marked and no satisfactory finishing point could be obtained this was much more marked with the hydrochloric acid effect of foreign saltsthe process for getting the arsenic into solution will exclude all metals except tin but the solution will be charged with sodium or ammonium salts in the process of neutralising so that it is only necessary to see if these cause any interference the alkaline hydrates including ammonia are plainly inadmissible since no free iodine can exist in their presence monocarbonates similarly interfere but to a much less extent hence the necessity for rendering the assay distinctly acid before adding the bicarbonate of soda with 20 cc of arsenic solution and with bulk soda and starch as before the results obtained were iodine required with 20 grams of ammonic chloride 200 cc 20 grams of sodium chloride 200 20 grams of sodium acetate 200 0050 gram of tin as stannic chloride 196 without any addition 200 the interference of the stannic salt is probably mechanical the precipitate carrying down some arsenious acid effect of varying arsenicwith bulk

the amount of arsenic found in this experiment from that previously obtained working in this way on a copper containing 038 per cent of arsenic and 080 per cent of antimony 038 per cent of arsenic was found determination of white arsenic in crude arsenicweigh out 1 gram of the dried and powdered substance or 05 gram if rich and digest with 10 cc of a 10 per cent solution of soda dilute to about 50 cc and filter render faintly acid with hydrochloric acid and filter if necessary add 2 or 3 grams of bicarbonate of soda in solution then 5 cc of starch and titrate the cold solution with the standard solution of iodine the following is an example 1 gram of crude arsenic required 537 cc iodine 100 cc iodine 06000 gram white arsenic 100 537 06 03222 or 322 per cent with the testtube method of dry assaying this same sample gave results varying from 33 to 35 per cent of white arsenic which judging from its appearance was impure uranic acetate process this may be looked upon as an alternative to the gravimetric method it is applicable in all cases where the arsenic exists in solution as arsenic acid or as arsenate of soda the process may be considered in two parts 1 the preparation of the solution and 2 the titration preparation of the solutionif the arsenic has been separated as sulphide it is sufficient to attack it with 10 or 15 cc of nitric acid and to heat gently till dissolved avoiding too high a temperature at first afterwards continue the heat till the separated sulphur runs into globules and the bulk of the acid has been reduced to 3 or 4 cc dilute with 20 or 30 cc of water put in a piece of litmus paper and add dilute ammonia until just alkaline then add 5 cc of the sodium acetate and acetic acid solution which should make the solution distinctly acid dilute to 150 cc and heat to boiling the solution is ready for titrating when the arsenic exists in a nitric acid solution mixed with much copper it is separated in the way described under examination of commercial copper arsenic and phosphorus pages 208 209 if the arsenic has been separated as ammoniummagnesium arsenate and phosphates are known to be absent dissolve the precipitate after filtering but without washing in dilute hydrochloric acid add dilute ammonia till a slight precipitate is formed and then 5 cc of the sodium acetate and acetic acid solution dilute to 150 cc and heat to boiling titrate if phosphates are present which will always be the case if they were present in the original substance and no separation with sulphuretted hydrogen has been made the phosphorus will count in the subsequent titration as arsenic one part of phosphorus counting as 24 parts of arsenic it will be necessary to dissolve the mixed arsenate and phosphate of magnesia in hydrochloric acid add about four or five times as much iron as ferric chloride as the combined phosphorus and arsenic present will unite with and separate by the basic acetate process as described under phosphorus in the examination of commercial copper page 209 obviously when phosphates are present it is easier to separate the arsenic as sulphide than to precipitate it with the magnesia mixture the titrationthe standard solution of uranium acetate is made by dissolving 341 grams of the salt with the help of 25 cc of acetic acid in water and diluting to 1 litre the water and acid are added a little at a time and warmed till solution is effected then cooled and diluted to the required volume 100 cc will equal 050 gram of arsenic the sodic acetate and acetic acid solution is made by dissolving 100 grams of sodic acetate in 500 cc of acetic acid and diluting with water to 1 litre five cc are used for each assay the solution of potassic ferrocyanide used as indicator is made by dissolving 10 grams of the salt in 100 cc of water to standardise the solution of uranium acetate weigh up a quantity of white arsenic as2o3 which shall be about equivalent to the arsenic contained in the assay 01 or 02 gram transfer to a flask and dissolve in 10 cc of nitric acid with the aid of heat evaporate to a small bulk taking care to avoid the presence of hydrochloric acid dilute with water add a small piece of litmus paper render faintly alkaline with ammonia then add 5 cc of the sodic acetate mixture dilute to 150 cc and heat to boiling fill an ordinary burette with the uranium acetate solution and run into the assay a quantity known to be insufficient again heat for a minute or two arrange a series of drops of the solution of ferrocyanide of potassium on a porcelain slab and with the help of a glass rod bring a drop of the assay solution in contact with one of these if no colour is produced run in the uranium acetate 1 cc at a time testing after each addition till a brown colour is developed it is best to overdo the assay and to count back it is not necessary to filter off a portion of the assay before testing with the ferrocyanide since the precipitate uranic arsenate has no effect the following experiments show the effect of variation in the conditions of titration make a solution of arsenic acid by dissolving 495 grams of arsenious acid as2o3 in a covered beaker with 35 cc of nitric acid evaporate down to 7 or 8 cc and dilute with water to 1 litre 100 cc will contain 0375 gram of arsenic use 20 cc for each experiment effect of varying temperatureit is generally recommended to titrate the boiling solution since it is possible that the precipitation is only complete on boiling low results are obtained in a cold solution the apparent excess of uranium acetate striking a colour at once on boiling however it ceases to do so consequently the solution should always be boiled directly before testing in four experiments made in the way described but with 20 cc of a solution of arsenic acid stronger than that given 100 cc 05 gram as the results at varying temperatures were temperature 15 c 30 c 70 c 100 c uranium required 180 cc 185 cc 185 cc 187 cc effect

variations in bulk are to be avoided effect of varying sodium acetatethese experiments were carried out like those last noticed but the bulk was 150 cc and varying amounts of sodic acetate were added in excess of the quantity used in the experiments previously described sodic acetate added 0 gram 1 gram 10 grams 20 grams uranium required 145 cc 145 cc 160 cc 180 cc it is evidently important that the quantity of this salt present in each titration be measured out so as to avoid variation effect of varying the sodium acetate and acetic acid solutionacetic acid also affects the results but in the opposite direction by preventing the precipitation of uranium arsenate with varying volumes of the solution now under notice the results were solution added 00 cc 50 cc 100 cc 150 cc uranium required 145 145 145 140 solution added 200 300 400 500 uranium required 132 100 60 20 these show that the quantity ordered 5 cc must be adhered to effect of foreign saltsin these experiments 10 grams of the salt the effect of which it was desired to determine were added to a solution in other respects resembling those previously used salt added ammonic ammonic ammonic magnesium sulphate nitrate chloride sulphate uranium required 155 cc 155 cc 153 cc 153 cc without any addition 150 cc were required and in another experiment in which 30 grams of ammonic salts were present 156 cc of uranium solution were required such variations in the amount of ammonic salts as occur in ordinary working are unimportant phosphates of course interfere in fact the uranium acetate solution can be standardised by titrating with a known weight of phosphate and calculating its equivalent of arsenic thus in an experiment with 06 gram of hydric sodic phosphate na2hpo412h2o equivalent to 005195 gram of phosphorus or 01256 gram of arsenic 2325 cc of a solution of uranium acetate were required the same solution standardised with white arsenic gave a standard of which 100 cc 05333 gram arsenic on this standard the 06 gram of sodic phosphate should have required 235 cc experiments in which 01 gram of bismuth and 01 gram of antimony were present with 01 gram of arsenic showed no interference on the titration ferric or aluminic salts would remove their equivalent of arsenic and consequently must be removed before titrating effect of varying arsenicvarying amounts of metallic arsenic were

water and pass sulphuretted hydrogen to reduce the ferric iron to the ferrous state then add 20 cc of dilute ammonia and again pass sulphuretted hydrogen warm filter and evaporate the filtrate to drive off the excess of ammonia then add 10 cc of nitric acid and boil down till the sulphide of arsenic at first precipitated is dissolved neutralise add 5 cc of sodium acetate and acetic acid solution transfer to a pint flask boil and titrate for example an impure sample of ore required in duplicate assay of half a gram each when treated in the abovementioned way 396 and 395 cc of the uranium acetate solution 100 cc 0537 gram of arsenic equivalent to 02114 gram of arsenic or 423 per cent an alternative method is as follows powder the ore very finely and weigh up 5 gram place in a 234 inch berlin dish and add strong nitric acid one drop at a time until the action ceases with care there need be no very violent reaction dry over a water bath cover with 2 grams of nitre and over this spread 5 grams of a mixture of equal parts of nitre and carbonate of soda fuse in a muffle or over a large gentle blowpipe flame for 4 or 5 minutes this will spoil the dish allow to cool and boil out in a larger dish with 100 cc of water filter and wash into an 8 oz flask acidify the liquor with nitric and boil down to about 100 cc the acid should not be in too large excess but an excess is needed to destroy nitrites neutralise with soda or ammonia add 5 cc of the mixture of sodium acetate and acetic acid titrate with uranium acetate determination of arsenic as in crude arsenicthe method given under the iodine titration simply determines that portion of the arsenic which is present in the substance as arsenious oxide or white arsenic the following method will give the total arsenic in the sample it would be incorrect to report this as so much per cent of arsenious oxide although it may be reported as so much per cent of arsenic equivalent to so much per cent of white arsenic thus arsenic 300 per cent equivalent to white arsenic 396 the equivalent of white arsenic is calculated by multiplying the percentage of arsenic by 132 the method of determining the percentage of arsenic is as followsboil 1 gram of the sample with 10 cc of nitric acid when the bulk of the solution has been reduced to onehalf and red fumes are no longer evolved dilute with a little water and filter into a flask neutralise the filtrate add 5 cc of sodic acetate solution boil and filter the precipitate ferric arsenate is transferred to a small beaker treated with 5 cc of dilute ammonia and sulphuretted hydrogen passed through it the iron sulphide is filtered off and the filtrate evaporated with an excess of nitric acid when the solution is clear it is neutralised and 1 or 2 cc of sodic acetate solution having been added is then mixed with the first filtrate the solution is boiled and titrated a sample treated in this way required 492 cc of the uranium acetate solution 100 cc 0537 gram of arsenic equivalent to 264 per cent determination of arsenic in brimstonetake 10 grams of the substance and powder in a mortar rub up with 10 cc of dilute ammonia and a little water rinse into a pint flask pass a current of sulphuretted hydrogen and warm on a hot plate for a few minutes filter acidulate the filtrate with sulphuric acid filter off the precipitate attack it with 10 cc of nitric acid and proceed as in the other determinations practical exercises 1 mispickel contains 450 per cent of arsenic to how much white arsenic will this be equivalent 2 how would you make a standard solution of iodine so that 100 cc shall be equivalent to 1 gram of white arsenic 3 what weight of arsenic is contained in 1 gram of pyrarsenate of magnesia and what weight of ammonicmagnesic arsenate would it be equivalent to 4 the residue after heating 10 grams of crude arsenic weighed 062 gram what information does this give as to the composition of the substance if another 10 grams of the substance heated on a waterbath lost 043 gram what conclusions would you draw and how would you report your results 5 if a sample of copper contained 05 per cent of arsenic and 1 gram of it were taken for an assay how much standard uranium acetate solution would be required in the titration phosphorus and phosphates phosphorus rarely occurs among minerals except in its highest oxidized state phosphoric oxide p2o5 in which it occurs abundantly as rock phosphate a variety of apatite which is mainly phosphate of lime phosphates of most of the metallic oxides are found phosphoric oxide in small quantities is widely diffused and is a constituent of most rocks its presence in varying amounts in iron ores is a matter of importance since it affects the quality of the iron obtainable from them phosphorus occurs in alloys in the unoxidized state it is directly combined with the metal forming a phosphide in this manner it occurs in meteoric iron the alloy phosphorbronze is made up of copper tin zinc and phosphorus phosphates are mined in large quantities for the use of manure manufacturers and for making phosphorus phosphorus and arsenic closely resemble each other in their chemical properties more especially those which the assayer makes use of for their determination phosphorus forms several series of salts but the phosphates are the only ones which need be considered pyrophosphate of magnesia which is the form in which phosphoric oxide is generally weighed differs from the ordinary phosphate in the proportion of base to acid metaphosphates differ in the same way if these are present it must be remembered they act differently with some reagents from the ordinary phosphates which are called orthophosphates they are however all convertible into orthophosphates by some means which will remove their base such as fusion with alkaline carbonates boiling with strong acids c108 phosphides are converted into phosphates by the action of nitric acid or other oxidizing agents dilute acids when they act on the substance evolve phosphuretted hydrogen ph3 the student should be on his guard against losing phosphorus in this manner there is no dry assay for phosphorus all assays for it are made either gravimetrically or volumetrically the separation of phosphoric oxide is made as followsthe ore or metal is dissolved in acid and evaporated to render the silica insoluble it is taken up with hydrochloric acid diluted with water and treated with sulphuretted hydrogen the filtrate is boiled to get rid of the excess of gas and treated with nitric acid to peroxidize the iron present if the iron is not present in more than sufficient quantity to form ferric phosphate with all the phosphorus present some ferric chloride is added the iron is then separated as basic acetate the precipitate will contain the phosphorus together with any arsenic acid not reduced by the sulphuretted hydrogen the precipitate should have a decided brown colour the precipitate is washed transferred to a flask and treated first with ammonia and then with a current of sulphuretted hydrogen the filtrate from this acidulated with hydrochloric acid and if necessary filtered contains the phosphorus as phosphoric acid this method is not applicable in the presence of alumina chromium titanium or tin if the solution is effected with nitric acid the precipitate obtained by the action of nitric acid on tin retains any phosphoric or arsenic oxide that may be present a method of separation more generally applicable and more convenient to work is based on the precipitation of a yellow phosphomolybdate of ammonia109 by the action of an excess of ammonic molybdate upon a solution of a phosphate in nitric acid dissolve the substance by treatment with acid and evaporate to dryness take up with 10 cc of nitric acid and add 20 grams of ammonic nitrate together with a little water next put in the solution of ammonium molybdate solution in the proportion of about 50 cc for each 01 gram of phosphoric oxide judged to be present warm to about 80 c and allow to stand for an hour filter and wash with a 10 per cent solution of ammonic nitrate it is not necessary that the whole of the precipitate be placed on the filter but the beaker must be completely cleaned dissolve the precipitate off the filter with dilute ammonia and run the solution into the original beaker run in from a burette slowly and with stirring magnesia mixture using about 15 cc for each 01 gram of phosphoric oxide allow to stand for one hour the white crystalline precipitate contains the phosphorus as ammoniummagnesium phosphate phosphate of lead is decomposed by sulphuric acid the lead is converted into the insoluble lead sulphate and the phosphoric acid is dissolved phosphate of copper and phosphate of iron may be treated with sulphuretted hydrogen the former in an acid and the latter in an alkaline solution phosphate of alumina is generally weighed without separation of the alumina since this requires a fusion in all cases the aim is to get the phosphoric oxide either free or combined with some metal whose phosphate is soluble in ammonia joulies method of separation is as followsone to ten grams of the sample are treated with hydrochloric acid and evaporated to dryness with the addition if any pyrites is present of a little nitric acid the residue is taken up with hydrochloric acid cooled transferred to a graduated flask and diluted to the mark it is then shaken up filtered through a dry filter and a measured portion containing about 005 gram of phosphoric acid transferred to a small beaker ten cc of a citricacid solution of magnesia110 is added and then an excess of ammonia if an immediate precipitate is formed a fresh portion must be measured out and treated with 20 cc of the citrate of magnesia solution and with ammonia as before the beaker is put aside for from two to twelve hours the precipitate is then filtered off and washed with weak ammonia it contains the phosphorus as ammoniummagnesium phosphate gravimetric determination if the phosphate is not already in the form of ammonicmagnesic phosphate it is converted into this by the addition to its solution of an excess of ammonia and magnesia mixture in order to get the precipitate pure the magnesia mixture is run in gradually by drops from a burette with constant stirring a white crystalline precipitate at once falls if much phosphorus is present but if there is only a small quantity it may be an hour or two before it shows itself the solution is best allowed to rest for twelve or fifteen hours overnight before filtering the presence of tartaric acid should be avoided and the appearance of the precipitate should be crystalline the solution is decanted through a filter and the precipitate washed with dilute ammonia using as little as may be necessary the precipitate is dried transferred to a weighed berlin or platinum crucible the filterpaper is carefully burnt and its ash added to the precipitate which is then ignited at first gently over a bunsen burner and then more strongly over the blowpipe or in the muffle the residue is a white mass of magnesium pyrophosphate containing 2792 per cent of phosphorus or 6396 per cent of phosphoric oxide volumetric method instead of separating and weighing this compound the phosphoric oxide in it can be determined by titration in many cases the ore may be dissolved and immediately titrated without previous separation it is better however to carry the separation so far as to get phosphoric acid an alkaline phosphate or the magnesia precipitate it may then be prepared for titration in the following waythe precipitate in the last case without much washing is dissolved in a little hydrochloric acid and the solution in any case rendered fairly acid dilute ammonia is added till it is just alkaline and then 5 cc of the sodic acetate and acetic acid mixture as described under the arsenic assay this should yield a clear distinctlyacid solution it is diluted to 100 or 150 cc heated to boiling and titrated with the uranium acetate solution using that of potassic ferrocyanide as indicator the standard solution required is made by dissolving 35 grams of uranium acetate in water with the aid of 25 cc of acetic acid and diluting to 1 litre an equivalent solution of phosphoric oxide is made by dissolving 2521 grams of crystallised hydric disodic phosphate hna2po412h2o in water and making up to 1 litre 100 cc will contain 05 gram of phosphoric oxide p2o5 or 02183 gram of phosphorus in making this solution transparent crystals only must be used the uranium acetate solution is only approximately equivalent to this so that its exact standard must be determined sodic acetate and acetic acid solutionit is the same as that described under arsenic111 use 5 cc for each assay the following experiments show the effect of variation in the conditions of the titration effect of varying temperaturethe solution should be titrated while boiling this is especially necessary for the last few cc in order to get a decided and fixed finishing point temperature 15 c 30 c 70 c 100 c uranium

of p2o5 4 you have reason to believe that a precipitate which has been weighed as magnetic pyrophosphate contains some arsenate how would you determine the amount of phosphate really present 5 twenty cc of a solution of sodic phosphate containing 0100 gram of p2o5 was found to require a solution containing 0700 gram of hydrated uranium acetate in a titration the precipitate contains 8009 per cent uranium oxide and 1991 per cent of phosphoric oxide what percentage of uranium oxide was contained in the uranic acetate nitrogen and nitrates nitrogen occurs in nature in the free state and forms about fourfifths of the atmosphere in combination as nitrate it is found in nitre kno3 and chili saltpetre nano3 minerals which have a commercial importance the latter occurs in beds and is extensively worked for use as a manure and in the preparation of nitric acid nitrogen is mainly characterised by negative properties although many of its compounds are very energetic bodies it is a gas present everywhere but so inactive that the assayer can always afford to ignore its presence and except in testing furnace gases c he is never called on to determine its quantity the nitrates are an important class of salts and may be looked on as compounds of the bases with nitric pentoxide n2o5 they are with the exception of a few basic compounds soluble in water and are remarkable for the ease with which they give up their oxygen the alkaline nitrates fuse readily and lose oxygen with effervescence forming nitrites while at a higher temperature they yield more oxygen and lose their nitrogen either as a lower oxide or as nitrogen the nitrates of the metals on heating leave the oxide of the metal it is as yielders of oxygen that nitrates are so largely used in the manufacture of explosives gunpowder contains from 65 to 75 per cent of potassium nitrate nitre nitrates are best detected and determined by their yielding nitric oxide when treated with sulphuric acid and a suitable reducing agent such as ferrous sulphate mercury or copper nitric oxide is a colourless gas very slightly soluble in water it combines at once with oxygen on mixing with the air to form brown nitrous fumes and dissolves in a solution of ferrous sulphate producing a characteristic blackishbrown colour it is this colour which affords the best and most easilyapplied test for nitrates the substance suspected to contain nitrates is dissolved in about 1 cc of water and treated with an equal volume of strong sulphuric acid after cooling a solution of ferrous sulphate is poured on its surface so as to form a layer resting on it on standing a brown or black ring is developed where the liquids join if any nitrate or nitrite is present nitrites are distinguished from nitrates by effervescing and yielding brown fumes when treated with a little dilute sulphuric acid the separation of nitrates is in many cases difficult generally on treating the substance with water the nitrate will be in the solution and is filtered off from any insoluble matter in the exceptional cases it is got into solution by treating with a boiling solution of sodium carbonate the nitrate will contain it as an alkaline nitrate since however in their determination nitrates are never separated and weighed as such the difficulty of separating them has little importance usually the determination can be made on the original aqueous solution and it is never necessary to do more than remove any special substance which has a bad effect and this is easily done by the usual reagents gravimetric determination it follows from what has been said that there is no direct gravimetric determination the percentage of nitrogen pentoxide n2o5 in a comparatively pure nitrate is sometimes determined indirectly in the following wayplace in a platinumcrucible 4 or 5 grams of powdered and cleaned quartz ignite cool in a desiccator and weigh with the cover mix 1 gram of the dried and powdered salt with the quartz in the crucible by stirring with a stout platinumwire cover the crucible and heat in a bunsenburner flame at scarcely visible redness for halfanhour cool and weigh the loss in weight gives the amount of nitrogen pentoxide sulphates and chlorides in moderate quantity do not interfere the following is an example of the process crucible and sand 266485 grams nitre taken 10000 276485 weight after ignition 271160 loss on ignition 05325 this is equal to 5325 per cent of nitrogen pentoxide volumetric determination this is based on the oxidising action of nitric acid or of nitrates in acid solutions on ferrous salts the pentoxide n2o5 of the nitrate is reduced to nitric oxide no so that 336 parts of iron peroxidised represent 108 parts of nitric pentoxide as oxidising agent112 the quantity of iron peroxidised is determined by taking a known quantity of ferrous salt oxidizing with a weighed sample of nitrate and then determining the residual ferrous iron by titration with bichromate or permanganate of potassium solution the difference between the ferrous iron taken and that found gives the amount oxidized by the nitrate the speed with which nitric oxide takes up oxygen from the air and thus becomes capable of oxidising more iron renders some precautions necessary ferrous chloride should therefore be used since it is easier to expel nitric oxide by boiling from solutions of a chloride than it is from those of a sulphate the process is as followsdissolve 2 grams of thin soft iron wire in 50 cc of hydrochloric acid in a flask provided with an arrangement for maintaining an atmosphere of carbon dioxide when the iron has dissolved allow the solution to cool and add 05 gram of the nitrate heat gently for a few minutes and then boil until the nitric oxide is expelled an atmosphere of carbon dioxide must be kept up dilute with water and titrate the residual iron with standard solution of bichromate of potassium the standard bichromate is made by dissolving 175 grams of the salt k2cr2o7 in water and diluting to 1 litre 100 cc equal 2 grams of iron deduct the weight of iron found from the 2 grams originally taken and multiply by 03214 this gives the weight of the pentoxide in the sample in an example 05 gram of nitre was taken and 594 cc of the bichromate solution were required the 594 cc thus used are equivalent to 1198 gram of iron this leaves 0822 gram as the quantity oxidised by the nitre which multiplied by 03214 gives 02642 gram for the nitrogen pentoxide or 528 per cent gasometric method this is based upon the measurement of the nitric oxide evolved on shaking up a weighed quantity of the nitrate with sulphuric acid over mercury in a nitrometer each cc of nitric oxide obtained when reduced to normal temperature and pressure is equivalent to 0627 milligram of nitrogen 1343 of nitric oxide 2418 of nitric pentoxide 2820 of nitric acid 3805 of sodium nitrate 4523 of potassium nitrate in working on substances not rich in nitrates an ordinary nitrometer fig 69 is used but in the assay of sodium nitrate nitroglycerine c an instrument provided with a bulb having a capacity of 100 cc is employed illustration fig 69 the plan of working is as followsthe measuring tube is filled with mercury until it reaches up into the tap and the levellingtube is placed so that it contains an inch or two of mercury if the nitrate is in solution 2 or 3 cc of the liquid dilute liquids are brought to this bulk by evaporation are measured into the cup the levellingtube is lowered a little and the tap cautiously opened until all but the last drop of the liquid has run in the cup is then rinsed with 2 or 3 cc of sulphuric acid which is run in in the same way and the operation is repeated with another lot of acid the measuringtube is now taken from the clamp and shaken for two or three minutes until no more gas is given off it is replaced and the mercurylevel in the two tubes adjusted then it is allowed to stand until the froth has subsided and the gas has cooled to the temperature of the room the volume of the gas is then read off in adjusting the level account must be taken of the sulphuric acid in the measuringtube this is allowed for by having the mercury higher in the other tube by say 1 mm for each 65 mm of sulphuric acid or it is counterpoised by an equal height of sulphuric acid in the levellingtube in which case the two mercurylevels are made to correspond on opening the tap after reading off the volume there should be no change in the level of the mercury if it should rise or fall a little a slight increase or decrease say 01 cc is made to the volume previously read off in working with nitrate of soda c in the bulb nitrometer it is necessary to take a quantity of the substance which will yield more than 100 and less than 150 cc of the gas footnotes 103 na3aso3 h2o 2i na3aso4 2hi the acid is at once neutralised 104 mr thomas gibb is the originator of this ingenious process 105 by taking hold of the water present it may prevent the dissociation of arsenious chloride 106 it is difficult to get ferric chloride free from arsenic but the following treatment will remove 80 or 90 per cent of the arsenic contained in the commercial materialdissolve 2 or 3 lbs of ferric chloride with the smallest amount of water that will effect solution with the addition of 100 cc of hydrochloric acid add a solution of sulphurous acid in quantity sufficient to reduce 2 or 3 per cent of the iron to the ferrous state allow to stand a week and then boil to remove the hydrochloric acid added nitric acid which is prejudicial is also removed by this treatment 107 when the amount of arsenic to be estimated is small as in refined coppers it is better to use a weaker solution of iodine this is made by diluting 200 cc of the standard solution with water to 1 litre each cc will equal 01 per cent if 1 gram of the metal has been taken for the assay 108 the constitution of these phosphates may be thus illustrated magnesic metaphosphate mgop2o5 magnesic pyrophosphate 2mgop2o5 magnesic orthophosphate 3mgop2o5 109 the composition of which is moo2 9074 p2o5 314 nh42o 357 h2o 255 10000 110 this is made by adding 27 grams of magnesium carbonate a little at a time to a solution of 270 grams of citric acid in 350 cc of warm water and when dissolved adding 400 cc of dilute ammonia and making up the bulk to 1 litre 20 cc of the solution is sufficient for 01 gram of p2o5 although more will be required if much iron or alumina is present 111 for the details of the titration the student is referred to the same place 112 n2o5 6feo 3fe2o3 2no chapter xviii silicon carbon boron silicon and silicates in assaying more especially products direct from the mine there is always found when the rock is siliceous a quantity of white sandylooking substance insoluble in acids which is sometimes accompanied by a light gelatinous material very difficult to filter this is variously described as insoluble sand insoluble silicates gangue or rocky matter it may be pure quartz but oftener it is mixed with silicates from the rock containing the mineral some silicates but not many are completely decomposed by boiling with hydrochloric acid or aqua regia and others are partly so they yield a gelatinous precipitate of silica which greatly interferes with the filtering it is a common practice with assayers to carry the first attack of the sample with acids to dryness and to take up with a fresh portion of acid by this means the separated silica becomes granular and insoluble and capable of being filtered off and washed with comparative ease this residue may be ignited and weighed and be reported as so much per cent of silica and silicates insoluble in acids unless specially wanted a determination of its constituents need not be made when required the analysis is best made on the ignited residue and separately reported as analysis of the insoluble portion silicon only occurs in nature in the oxidised state but the oxide generally known as silica sio2 is common being represented by the abundant mineralsquartz flint c silica combined with alumina lime oxide of iron magnesia and the alkalies forms a large number of rockforming minerals most rock masses other than limestones contain over 50 per cent of silica the following are analyses of some of the commoner silicates but it must be noted

of the analysis of this and similar substances is the assayer called on to report the percentage of silicon silicon is readily converted into silica by the action of oxidizing agents silica forms only one series of saltsthe silicateswhich have in many cases a complex constitution thus there are a large number of double silicates which vary among themselves not only in the relation of base to acid which is the essential difference but also in the ratio of the bases between themselves which varies with almost every specimen silica is detected by heating the substance with a fluoride and sulphuric acid in a platinumcrucible on holding a rod moistened with a drop of water over the escaping fumes the white crust of silica formed on the drop of water shows its presence the insolubility of a fragment of the mineral in a bead of microcosmic salt is also a very good test the fragment on prolonged heating does not lose its angular form there is no dry assay for this substance nor volumetric method when the determination is required it is carried out gravimetrically and generally by the following plan if the sample contains oxides sulphides c in any quantity these are first dissolved out by treatment with acid evaporated to dryness taken up with hydrochloric acid and filtered the dried residue is treated in the same way as the silicates some silicates are completely decomposed by such treatment but it saves time unless one is sure that no undecomposable silicate is present to treat these in the same way as the others on the other hand there are some silicates which are only attacked with difficulty even by fusion with alkaline carbonates consequently it is always well to have the substance reduced to the finest state of division by careful powdering as this greatly assists the subsequent action with very hard silicates the grinding away of the mortar in this operation will be perceptible the foreign matter thus introduced must not be ignored previously igniting the substance sometimes assists the powdering but it is best to use a steel mortar the particles of steel can be removed by a magnet or where the nature of the substance will allow it by boiling with a little dilute hydrochloric acid the dried and powdered material is intimately mixed with four times its weight of fusion mixture in a platinumcrucible or dish it is then moderately heated over a bunsen burner and afterwards more strongly fused over a blast or enclosed in a clay crucible in the windfurnace the action is continued until the fused mass is perfectly tranquil with very refractory substances the action must be long continued at a high temperature when sufficiently cold the crucible is examined to see that no particles of foreign matter are adhering to its outer surface it is then transferred to a five or sixinch evaporatingdish where its contents are acted upon with warm water for some time the melt will slowly dissolve but the solution should be hastened by keeping the liquid moderately acid with hydrochloric acid when the melt has dissolved clean and remove the platinumdish and evaporate the solution to a paste continue the evaporation to dryness on a waterbath not on the hot plate and whilst drying stir with a glass rod feeling at the bottom of the dish for any unfused particles which if present can be detected by their grittiness if there is much grit it will be necessary to repeat the assay but with a small quantity it will only be necessary to refuse the grit and silica after ignition during solution of the melt and evaporation which may be carried on together a clear solution will not be obtained a flocculent silica will separate out and towards the end of the evaporation the mass will get gelatinous the drying of the jelly must be finished on the waterbath first because at this temperature the silica is rendered insoluble in hydrochloric acid whilst the solubility of the alumina iron c is unaffected which would not be the case at a much higher temperature and second because the gelatinous residue requires very cautious drying to prevent loss from spirting when dry the substance is moistened and heated with strong hydrochloric acid and the sides of the dish are washed down with water the silica is washed by decantation two or three times with hydrochloric acid and hot water before being thrown on to the filter the filtrate is again evaporated to dryness taken up with a little hydrochloric acid and water and again filtered the residue on the filter is silica the two lots of silica are washed free from chlorides with hot water dried on an airbath transferred to a platinumcrucible ignited gently at first at last strongly over the blast or in a muffle cooled in a desiccator and weighed the white powdery precipitate is silica sio2 and its weight multiplied by 100 and divided by the weight of ore taken gives the percentage of silica in the sample where the percentage of silicon is wanted which is very rarely the case it is got by multiplying this result by 04667 it is always necessary to examine the purity of the body weighed as silica this is done by refusing the material weighed and redetermining the silica in it or better by mixing a weighed portion in a platinumdish with a little strong sulphuric acid covering with hydrofluoric acid and evaporating in the latter case the silica will be converted into fluoride which will be driven off and the impurities will be left behind as sulphates of barium phosphate and oxide of tin titanium c this must be weighed and deducted from the weight of the silica in a complete examination of a silicate it should be treated with the precipitate containing alumina ferric oxide c examination of silicates the student interested in the analysis of rocks and rockforming minerals is advised to consult a valuable paper by dr wf hillebrand in the bulletin of the united states geological survey no 148 to which i am very largely indebted in the revision of the following pages moisturefive grams of the powdered sample is dried between watchglasses in the wateroven for two hours or till its weight is constant and the loss is reported as water lost at 100 c the rest of the determinations are made on this dried mineral combined water cweigh up 1 gram of the substance and ignite over the blowpipe for some time in a platinumcrucible cool in a desiccator and weigh record the loss as loss on ignition not as combined water silicathe ignition should have been performed in an oxidising atmosphere in a muffle or over a slanting blowpipe flame this will ensure the oxidation of any pyrites or other sulphide present which if unoxidised would injure the crucible in the next operation the ignited residue is mixed with 6 or 7 grams of anhydrous sodium carbonate this reagent should be the purest obtainable but its purity should be checked or rather its impurities should be determined by running a check or blank assay with 10 grams of it through the stages of the analysis the impurities will be chiefly silica alumina and lime and altogether they ought not to exceed 1 milligram the crucible with the mixture is heated at first gently over a bunsen and afterwards more strongly in an oxidising atmosphere in a muffle or over the blowpipe the fused mass is allowed to cool in the crucible and is then dissolved out in a basin with water and a small excess of hydrochloric acid after the removal and cleaning of the crucible the liquor is evaporated almost to dryness dr hillebrand advises stopping short of complete dryness the residue is taken up with a little hydrochloric acid and water and filtered and washed the liquor including the washings is again evaporated and taken up with water and a little acid usually about 1 per cent of silica will be thus recovered it is to be filtered off and washed and added to the main silica the filtrate is reserved the silica thoroughly washed is dried and ignited at a high temperature for twenty or thirty minutes it is then weighed in a platinum crucible after weighing it is treated with hydrofluoric acid and a little sulphuric carefully evaporated and ignited strongly the residue which in extreme cases may amount to 2 or 3 per cent of the rock is weighed and deducted from the weight of the impure silica it is retained in the crucible alumina cthe filtrate from silica is treated by the basic acetate method that is it is first treated by a cautious addition of a solution of soda almost to the point of producing a precipitate in order to neutralise the excess of acid 2 or 3 grams of sodium acetate are added and the whole boiled for a minute or so the precipitate is filtered off and washed only slightly save the filtrate the precipitate is dissolved in hydrochloric or perhaps better in nitric acid and is reprecipitated by adding an excess of ammonia and boiling the precipitate is filtered and washed with water containing 2 per cent of ammonium nitrate both filtrates are evaporated separately to a small bulk a drop or two of ammonia being added to the second towards the finish they are next filtered into a 6 or 8ounce flask through a small filter the second filtrate coming after and serving in a manner as wash water for the first113 the two washed alumina precipitates are dried and placed in the platinum crucible containing the residue from silica after treatment with hydrofluoric acid they are then ignited in an oxidising atmosphere at a high temperature for about 10 minutes the weight including that of the residue from the silica is noted as that of alumina c the weighed oxides are next fused with bisulphate of potash for some hours the bisulphate should have been first fused apart until the effervescence from the escape of steam has stopped the melt is dissolved out with cold water and dilute sulphuric acid and any insoluble residue is filtered off washed ignited and weighed the filtrate is reserved for determinations of iron and titanium the residue after weighing may be treated with hydrofluoric and sulphuric acids for any silica114 which would be determined by loss it may be tested for barium sulphate by treatment with hot strong sulphuric acid in which this salt dissolves but is again insoluble and so comes out as a white precipitate on diluting with cold water the acid also must be cold before adding the water the filtrate containing the iron is reduced with sulphuretted hydrogen boiled till free from that gas filtered and titrated with a standard solution of permanganate of potassium the iron found is calculated to ferric oxide by dividing by 7 the iron solution after titration serves for the determination of titanium oxide tio2 this is done colorimetrically by adding peroxide of hydrogen free from hydrofluoric acid and comparing the brown colour produced with that produced by the addition of a standard solution of titanium to an equal volume of water containing sulphuric acid115 the alumina is determined by difference from the weight of the combined precipitate which has been recorded as alumina c deduct 1 the residue insoluble after fusion with bisulphate 2 the ferric oxide 3 the titanium oxide and 4 the phosphoric oxide p2o5 the amount of which is subsequently determined in a separate portion this gives the alumina manganous oxide cthe filtrate from the alumina c contained in a 6 or 8ounce flask which it nearly fills is made slightly alkaline with ammonia and treated with a small excess of ammonium sulphide the flask is then corked and placed on one side for some time a day or so so that the manganese sulphide may separate the precipitate is filtered off and washed with water containing ammonium chloride and a few drops of ammonium sulphide the filtrate is reserved for lime c the precipitate is digested with sulphuretted hydrogen water to which onefifth of its volume of strong hydrochloric acid has been added this dissolves the sulphides of zinc and manganese any black residue should be tested for copper and perhaps nickel the solution is evaporated to dryness taken up with a little water and treated with a small excess of solution of carbonate of soda it is boiled and again evaporated washed out with hot water and filtered on to a small filter dried ignited and weighed as mn3o4 it is calculated to mno it may contain and should be tested for oxide of zinc which if present must be deducted if the dish becomes stained during evaporation take up with a few drops of hydrochloric and sulphurous acids evaporate and then treat with carbonate of soda lime cthe filtrate from the manganese sulphide is boiled and without cooling treated with ammonium oxalate in solution which also should be heated to boiling the liquid is filtered off and reserved for magnesia the precipitate is dissolved in very little hydrochloric acid and reprecipitated by adding ammonium oxalate and ammonia to the boiling solution the filtrate and washings from this are reserved for magnesia the precipitate is either dissolved in dilute sulphuric and titrated with permanganate of potash as described under lime p 322 or it is ignited and weighed as oxide in this last case it may be examined for barium and strontium the former of which will rarely be present magnesiathe filtrate from the first lime precipitate is treated with sodium phosphate and ammonia and allowed to stand overnight it is then filtered the precipitate is dissolved in hydrochloric acid the solution is filtered into the beaker containing the solution from the second lime precipitate ammonia and sodium phosphate are again added and the precipitate after standing is filtered off washed with water containing ammonia it is then dried ignited and weighed as magnesium pyrophosphate this is calculated into magnesia potash and sodaweigh out 5 gram of the dried ore and mix with an equal quantity of ammonic chloride and to the mixture add gradually 4 grams of calcium carbonate precipitated introduce into a platinumcrucible and cover loosely heat at first gently and then at a red heat for from forty to sixty minutes transfer to a porcelain dish and digest with 60 or 80 cc of water warm and filter to the filtrate add ammonic carbonate and ammonia and filter evaporate the filtrate to dryness adding a few drops more of ammonic carbonate towards the end when dry heat gently and then raise the temperature to a little below redness dissolve in a small quantity of water add a drop of ammonic carbonate and filter through a small filter into a weighed platinum dish evaporate ignite gently and weigh the residue contains the soda and potash of the mineral as chlorides to determine the proportion of potassium dissolve this residue in a little water add platinum chloride in excess evaporate to a paste extract with alcohol decant through a small weighed filter wash with alcohol and dry at 100 c weigh the substance is potassium platinic chloride 2kclptcl4 its weight multiplied by 01941 will give the weight of potash k2o to find the proportion of soda multiply the weight of the potassium platinic chloride by 0306 this gives the weight of potassium chloride deduct this from the weight of the mixed chlorides first got the difference will be the sodium chloride which weight multiplied by 053 will give the weight of soda na2o ferrous oxidewhen a qualitative test shows both ferric and ferrous oxide to be present the proportion of the ferrous oxide must be separately determined the finely ground mineral mixed with dilute sulphuric acid is treated on a water bath with hydrofluoric acid solution is best effected in an atmosphere of carbonic acid in about an hour the decomposition is complete and the solution is diluted with cold water and titrated with the solution of bichromate or of permanganate of potassium the iron found is multiplied by 1286 and reported as ferrous oxide to find the proportion of ferric oxide the ferrous iron found is multiplied by 1428 and this is deducted from the weight of ferric oxide obtained by precipitation with ammonia the ammonia precipitate contains the whole of the iron as ferric oxide hence the necessity for calculating the ferrous oxide as ferric and deducting it phosphoric oxide p2o5weigh up 5 grams of the finelydivided and dry sample and digest with 10 or 20 cc of nitric acid evaporate to dryness on the waterbath take up with a little dilute nitric acid dilute with water and filter add a few grams of ammonic nitrate and 10 cc of ammonium molybdate solution heat nearly to boiling and allow to settle filter off and wash the yellow precipitate dissolve with dilute ammonia add magnesia mixture and allow to stand overnight filter wash with dilute ammonia dry ignite and weigh as pyrophosphate of magnesia the weight multiplied by 06396 gives the weight of phosphoric oxide soluble silicasome silicates are acted on by hydrochloric acid and leave on evaporation a residue which when the soluble salts have been washed out consists generally of the separated silica with perhaps quartz and unattacked silicates it should be ignited weighed and boiled with a solution containing less than 10 per cent of caustic soda

ferrous silicatestake 1 gram of the powdered slag treat with aqua regia evaporate to dryness extract with hydrochloric acid filter dry ignite and fuse the ignited residue with fusion mixture then separate and weigh the silica in the usual way slags are for the most part decomposed by boiling with aqua regia but it will be found more convenient and accurate to first extract with acids and then to treat the residue as an insoluble silicate estimation of silica and insoluble silicates in an oretake 2 grams of the powdered mineral evaporate with nitric acid if sulphides are present treat the

having the formula caosio2 carbon and carbonates carbon compounds enter so largely into the structure of organised bodies that their chemistry is generally considered apart from that of the other elements under the head of organic chemistry carbon occurs however among minerals not only in the oxidised state as carbonates but also in the elementary form as in diamond and graphite and combined with hydrogen oxygen c as in petroleums bitumens lignites shales and coals in small quantities organic matter is widely diffused in minerals and rocks in shales and clays it may amount to as much as 10 or 20 per cent mainly as bituminous and coaly matters the assayer has only to take account of the organic matter when it is of commercial importance so that in assays it is generally included under loss on ignition in coals shales lignites c the carbon compounds are on heating split up into oils and similar compounds the products of distillation may be classified as water gas tars coke and ash the assay of these bodies generally resolves itself into a distillation and in the case of the shales an examination of the distillates for the useful oils paraffin creosote c contained in them elementary carbon is found in nature in three different forms but these all react chemically in the same way they combine with oxygen to form the dioxide116 the weight of oxygen required to burn a given weight of any form of carbon is the same and the resulting product from all three has the same characteristic properties carbon dioxide is the common oxide of carbon a lower oxide exists but on burning it is converted into the dioxide wherever the oxidation of carbon takes place if there is sufficient oxygen carbon dioxide carbonic acid is formed this reaction is the one used for the determination of carbon in bodies generally the dioxide has acid properties and combines with lime and other bases forming a series of salts called carbonates the carboncompounds other than carbonates which will be subsequently considered occurring in minerals are generally characterised by their sparing solubility in acids the diamond is distinguished from other crystals by its hardness lustre and specific gravity it may be subjected to a red heat without being apparently affected but at a higher temperature it slowly burns away graphite also burns slowly but at a lower temperature the other bodies coals shales c differ considerably among themselves in the temperature at which they commence to burn some such as anthracite burn with little or no flame but most give off gases which burn with a luminous flame they deflagrate when sprinkled on fused nitre forming carbonate of potash in making this test the student must remember that sulphur and in fact all oxidisable bodies similarly deflagrate but it is only in the case of carbon compounds that carbonate of potash is formed carbon unites with iron and some of the metals to form carbides combined carbon of this kind is detected by the odour of the carburetted hydrogen evolved when the metal is treated with hydrochloric acid for example on dissolving steel in acid the natural carbon compounds although speaking generally insoluble in hydrochloric or nitric acids are more or less attacked by aqua regia the assayer seldom requires these compounds to be in solution the presence of organic matter117 interferes with most of the reactions which are used for the determination of the metals consequently in such cases it should be removed by calcination unless it is known that its presence will not interfere when calcination is not admissible it may be destroyed by heating with strong sulphuric acid and bichromate or permanganate of potash or by fusion with nitre carbon may be separated from other substances by conversion into carbon dioxide by burning in most cases substances soluble in acids are first removed and the insoluble residue dried weighed and then calcined or burned in a current of air the quantity of organic matter may be determined indirectly by the loss the substance undergoes but it is better to determine the organic carbon by confining the calcination in a tube and collecting and weighing the carbon dioxide formed each gram of carbon dioxide is equivalent to 02727 gram of carbon illustration fig 70 illustration fig 71 instead of a current of oxygen or air oxide of copper may be more conveniently used the operation is as followstake a clean and dry piece of combustion tube drawn out and closed at one end as shown in the figure fig 70 and about eighteen inches long fit it with a perforated cork connected with a utube containing freshlyfused calcium chloride in coarse grains and a set of potash bulbs fig 71 containing a strong solution of potash the exit of which last is provided with a small tube containing calcium chloride or a stick of potash both the utube and bulbs should have a loop of fine wire by which they may be suspended on the hook of the balance for convenience in weighing they must both be weighed before the combustion is commenced to prevent absorption of moisture during weighing c the ends are plugged with pieces of tube and glass rod fill the combustion tube to a depth of about eight inches with some copper oxide which has been recently ignited and cooled in a close vessel put in the weighed portion for assay and a little fresh copper oxide and mix in the tube by means of an iron wire shaped at the end after the manner of a corkscrew put in some more oxide of copper and clean the stirrer in it close loosely with a plug of recently ignited asbestos place in the furnace and connect the utube and bulbs in the way shown in the sketch fig 72 illustration fig 72 see that the joints are tight and then commence the combustion by lighting the burners nearest the utube make the first three or four inches red hot and gradually extend the heat backwards the length of the tube but avoid too rapid a disengagement of gas when gas ceases to come off open the pointed end of the tube and draw a current of dried air through the apparatus the carbon dioxide is absorbed in the potash bulbs and their increase in weight multiplied 02727 gives the amount of carbon in the substance taken the increase in weight in the calcium chloride tube will be due to the water formed by the oxidation of the combined hydrogen if this last is required the increase in weight multiplied by 0111 gives its amount coals the determination of the actual carbon in coals and shales is seldom called for if required it would be performed in the way just described118 the ordinary assay of a sample of coal involves the following determinationsmoisture volatile matter fixed carbon ash and sulphur these are thus carried out determination of moisturetake 3 grams of the powdered sample and dry in a waterbath for an hour or so the loss is reported as moisture coals carry from 1 to 2 per cent if the drying is carried too far coals gain a little in weight owing to oxidation so that it is not advisable to extend it over more than one or two hours determination of volatile matterthis determination is an approximate one and it is only when working under the same conditions with regard to time amount of coal taken and degree of heat used that concordant results can be arrived at it is a matter of importance whether the coal has been previously dried before heating or not since a difference of 2 per cent may be got by working on the dried or undried sample take 2 grams of the powdered but undried sample of coal place in a weighed platinum crucible and support this over a good bunsen burner by means of a thin platinumwire triangle the heat is continued until no further quantity of gas comes off and burns at the mouth this takes only a few minutes the cover is tightly fitted on and when cold the crucible is weighed the loss in weight after deducting the moisture gives the volatile matter and the residue consists of fixed carbon and ash determination of ashthe coke produced in the last operation is turned out into a porcelain dish and ignited over a bunsen burner till the residue is free from particles of carbon calcination is hastened by stirring with a platinum wire the operation may be done in a muffle but this gives results a few tenths of a per cent too low the dish is cooled in a dessicator and weighed the increase in weight gives the amount of ash and the difference between this and the weight of the coke gives the fixed carbon the assay is reported as follows moisture at 100 c per cent volatile matter fixed carbon ash contains sulphur per cent determination of sulphurthe sulphur exists in the coal partly in organic combination partly as metallic sulphide iron pyrites marcasite c and perhaps as sulphate so that the sulphur determination must be separately reported since a portion will go off with the volatile matter and the remainder would be retained and weighed with the coke the sulphur is thus determinedtake 1 gram of the coal and mix with 15 gram of a mixture of 2 parts of calcined magnesia and 1 part of carbonate of soda and heat in a platinum crucible for one hour or until oxidation is complete turn out the mass and extract it with water and bromine filter acidulate with hydrochloric acid boil off the bromine and precipitate with baric chloride estimating gravimetrically as given under sulphur another method is as followstake 1 gram of the coal and drop it gradually from a sheet of note paper on to 5 grams of fused nitre contained in a platinum dish extract with water acidify with acetic acid and estimate volumetrically as described under sulphur illustration fig 73 calorific effect of coalsthe heatgiving value of a coal is best expressed in the number of pounds of water previously heated to the boiling point which it will convert into steam this is generally termed its evaporativepower it may be determined by means of the calorimeter fig 73 this consists of a glass cylinder marked to hold 29010 grains of water the instrument consists of a perforated copper stand provided with a socket and three springs the socket holds a copper cylinder which is charged with 30 grains of the dried coal mixed with 300 grains of a mixture of 3 parts of potassium chlorate and 1 part of nitre the charge is well packed in the cylinder and provided with a small fuse of cotton saturated with nitre fill the glass cylinder to its mark with water and take the temperature with a thermometer marked in degrees fahrenheit ignite the fuse and immediately cover with the outer copper cylinder extinguisherfashion which will be held in its place by the springs the stopcock should be closed before this is done place the apparatus quickly in the cylinder of water when the action is over open the stopcock and agitate the water by raising and lowering the instrument a few times again take the temperature the rise in temperature plus 10 per cent for the heat used in warming the apparatus and lost by radiation gives the evaporativepower the following is an example temperature before experiment 670 f temperature after 790 rise 120 110th 12 gives 132 one pound of the coal will evaporate 132 pounds of water shales etc the assay of these is carried out in the same way as that of coals but the volatile matters are separately examined and in consequence a larger quantity of material must be used for the moisture volatile matter fixed carbon and ash the determinations are the same but a special distillation must be made to obtain a sufficient quantity of the volatile products for subsequent examination take 500 or 1000 grams of the wellsampled and powdered shale and introduce into a castiron retort as shown in fig 74 lute the joint with fireclay place the cover on and bolt it down the bolts should have a covering of fireclay to protect them from the action of the fire place the retort in a wind furnace supporting it on a brick and pack well around with coke build up the furnace around and over the retort with loose firebricks and heat gradually illustration fig 74 as soon as water begins to drip the tube of the retort is cooled by wrapping a wet cloth around it and keeping wet with water the water is kept from running into the receiver by a ring of damp fireclay a quantity of gas first comes over and will be lost afterwards water and oily matters the retort must be red hot at the close of the distillation and when nothing more distils off which occurs in about two or three hours the wet cloth is removed and the tube heated with a bunsen burner to drive forward the matter condensed in it into the receiver and thus to clean the tube it can be seen when the tube is clean by looking up through it into the redhot retort the receiver is then removed and the retort taken from the furnace is allowed to cool when cold it is opened and the fixed carbon and ash weighed as a check on the smaller assay the distillate of water and oil is warmed and will separate into two layers the upper one of which is oil and the lower water these are measured and if the specific gravity of the oil is taken its weight may be calculated if the two liquids do not separate well the water may be filtered off after cooling through a damped filter the separation is however best effected in a separator fig 75 the liquids are poured into this allowed to settle and the lower layer drained off the volume of the water is measured and its weight calculated in per cents on the amount of shale taken illustration fig 75 examination of the oila sufficient quantity of the oil must be got so that if one distillation does not yield enough the requisite quantity must be obtained by making two or more distillations the oils are mixed and the mixture after having had its volume and specific gravity ascertained is placed in a copper retort and redistilled with the aid of a current of steam the residue in the retort is coke the distillate is separated from the water by means of the separator and shaken for ten minutes with onetwentieth of its bulk of sulphuric acid sp g 170 the temperature should not be allowed to rise above 40 allow to stand and run off the acid tar the oil is now shaken up with from 10 cc to 20 cc of sodic hydrate solution sp g 13 allowed to stand warmed for halfanhour and the sodatar run off on mixing this sodatar with dilute acid the crude shale oil creosote separates and is measured off the purified oil is next redistilled in fractions which come over in the following ordernaphtha light oil heavy oil and still bottoms for the first product which is only got from certain shales the receiver is changed when the distillate has a specific gravity of 078 for the second product the process is continued till a drop of the distillate caught as it falls from the neck of the retort on a cold spatula shows signs of solidifying this is crude light oil the receiver is changed and the heavy oil comes over towards the end a thick brown or yellow viscid product is got the receiver is again changed and the distillation carried to dryness the crude light oil is washed cold with 2 per cent of sulphuric acid concentrated and afterwards with excess of soda thus purified it is again distilled to dryness three fractions being collected as before naphtha which is added to the main portion and measured light oil which is also measured and heavy oil which is added to that got in the first distillation this last is poured into a flatbottom capsule and allowed to cool slowly the temperature may with advantage be carried below freezingpoint the cooled cake is pressed between folds of linen and the paraffin scale detached and weighed the results may be reported thus naphtha sp g light oil sp g

using hydrochloric acid to dissolve the iron instead of the copper solutionweigh up 2 grams of the iron or a larger quantity if very poor in carbon and attack it with 30 grams of ammoniccupric chloride119 dissolved in 100 cc of water let the reaction proceed for a quarterofanhour and then warm until the copper is dissolved allow to settle and filter through a filteringtube this is a piece of combustion tube drawn out and narrowed at one end as shown in fig 76 the narrow part is blocked with a pea of baked clay and on this is placed halfaninch of silica sand previously calcined to remove organic matter then a small plug of asbestos and then a quarterofaninch of sand the tube is connected with a pump working at a gentle pressure and the solution is filtered through the tube with the aid of a small funnel fig 77 the residue is washed first with dilute hydrochloric acid and then with distilled water the tube is dried by aspirating air through it and gently warming with a bunsen burner the tube is then placed in a small combustionfurnace and connected with calcium chloride and potash bulbs as shown in fig 78 the potash bulb to the right of the figure must be weighed a slow stream of air is drawn through the apparatus and the heat gradually raised in from thirty minutes to one hour the combustion will be complete the potash bulbs are then disconnected and weighed and the increase multiplied by 02727 gives the weight of carbon carbonates carbon dioxide which is formed by the complete oxidation of carbon is a gas with a sweetish odour and taste having a strong affinity for alkalies and forming a series of compounds termed carbonates the gas itself occurs in nature and is sometimes met with in quantity in mining the carbonates occur largely in nature forming mountain masses of limestone c carbonates of many of the metals such as carbonate of lead cerussite carbonate of iron chalybite carbonates of copper malachite and chessylite and carbonate of magnesia magnesite are common all the carbonates those of the alkalies and alkaline earths excepted are completely decomposed on ignition into the oxide of the metal and carbon dioxide but the temperature required for this decomposition varies with the nature of the base all carbonates are soluble with effervescence in dilute acids some such as chalybite and magnesite require the aid of heat the alkaline carbonates are soluble in water the rest with the exception of the bicarbonates are insoluble therein carbonates are recognised by their effervescence with acidsa stream of bubbles of gas are given off which collect in the tube and possess the property of extinguishing a lighted match the most characteristic test for the gas is a white precipitate which is produced by passing it into lime or barytawater or into a solution of subacetate of lead the expulsion of carbon dioxide by the stronger acids serves for the separation of this body from the other acids and bases dry assaythere is no dry assay in use any method which may be adopted will necessarily be applicable only to special compounds wet methods there are several methods in use which leave little to be desired either in speed or accuracy we will give 1 a gravimetric method in which the estimation may be made directly by weighing the carbonic acid or indirectly by estimating the carbon dioxide from the loss 2 a volumetric one by which an indirect determination is made of the gas and 3 a gasometric method in which the volume of carbon dioxide given off is measured and its weight deducted illustration fig 79 illustration fig 80 direct gravimetric methodfit up the apparatus shown in the diagram fig 79 the various tubes are supported by a fixed rod with nails and wire loops and connected by short lengths of rubbertubing the first tube contains sodalime the small flask is fitted with a rubberstopper perforated with two holes through one of which passes the tube of a pipette holding 25 or 30 cc this pipette is to contain the acid the substance to be determined is weighed out into the flask the second tube contains strong sulphuric acid the third pumice stone saturated with copper sulphate solution and dried until nearly white at 200 c the fourth contains recently fused calcium chloride and the fifth which is the weighed tube in which the carbonic acid is absorbed contains calcium chloride and sodalime120 as shown in fig 80 the sixth also contains calcium chloride and sodalime its object is to prevent the access of moisture and carbonic acid to the weighed tube from this direction it is connected with an aspirator having weighed the utube and got the apparatus in order weigh up 1 2 or 5 grams of the substance and place in the flask fill the pipette with dilute acid close the clamp and cork the flask then see that the apparatus is tight open the clamp and allow from 10 to 20 cc of the acid to run on to the assay carbonic acid will be evolved and will be driven through the tubes the gas should bubble through the sulphuric acid in a moderate and regular stream when the effervescence slackens the clamp is opened and the greater part of the remaining acid run in when the effervescence has ceased the clamp is opened to its full extent and a current of air drawn through with an aspirator a gentle heat is applied to the flask but it should not be prolonged or carried to boiling after the removal of the heat a gentle current of air is drawn through the apparatus for 30 or 40 minutes the weighed utube which in the early part of the operation will have become warm if much carbonic acid was present will by this time be cold it is disconnected plugged and weighed the increase in weight is due to the carbon dioxide of the sample exampleore taken 1 gram weight of tube before 426525 grams after 430940 increase equals co2 04415 illustration fig 81 indirect gravimetric or determination by losstake a geisslers carbonicacid apparatus fig 81 and place in the double bulb some strong sulphuric acid put into the other bulb the stopcock being closed 3 or 4 cc of nitric acid diluted with water leave the apparatus in the balancebox for a few minutes and weigh introduce into the flask through a about 1 gram of the powdered substance and again weigh to find the exact amount added allow the acid to run gradually on to the carbonate and when solution is complete heat and aspirate cool and again weigh the loss in weight is the carbonic acid for example weight of apparatus and acids 85494 grams marble 86879 equal to marble taken 1385 weight of apparatus and marble 86879 grams minus carbonic acid 862692 equal to carbonic acid 06098 1385 100 06098 x x 4403 per cent the substance contains 4403 per cent of carbonic acid a duplicate experiment gave 4373 per cent this method is quicker but less exact than the direct gravimetric determination volumetric method this which is of somewhat limited application is based upon the determination of the quantity of acid required to decompose the carbonate it consists in adding to a weighed quantity of the mineral a known amount of standard solution of acid which is in excess of that required to effect the decomposition the quantity of residual acid is then determined by titrating with standard solution of alkali this method has been described under lime gasometric method this method is the quickest of all and the least troublesome after the apparatus has been once prepared it yields fairly accurate results when worked in the manner described below but if greater precautions are taken the results are exact it depends on the measurement of the volume of gas given off on treating the weighed sample with acid the apparatus described page 52 is used weigh out a portion of the mineral which shall contain not more than 015 gram of carbonic acid or 04 gram of carbonate of lime and put it in the bottle put in the inner tube 10 cc of dilute hydrochloric acid 11 cork tightly and read off the level of the liquid in the burette after adjusting the pressure turn the acid over on to the mineral run out the water so as to keep the level in the two burettes the same when effervescence has ceased rotate the contents of the bottle finally adjust the level in the burettes and read off the volume the increase in volume is due to the evolved carbon dioxide at the same time read off the volume corrector some of the carbon dioxide remains dissolved in the acid in the generating bottle and the quantity thus dissolved will depend on the amount of carbonate as well as on the amount of acid present consequently a measured quantity of acid should be used in each assay and a comparative experiment made with a known weight of pure carbonate of lime which will yield about the same volume of gas the number of cc of gas got in the assay multiplied by 47 will give the number of milligrams of pure carbonate of lime that must be taken for the standard with ordinary work the error rarely exceeds half a cc the following example will illustrate the calculations one gram of a mineral was taken and yielded 490 cc of gas the volume corrector reading was 1004 cc 02405 gram of pure carbonate of lime was then taken and treated in the same way 505 cc of gas were got the volume corrector still read 1004 cc 02405 gram of carbonate of lime is equivalent to 01058 gram of carbon dioxide then 505 490 01058 x x 1026 per cent estimation of carbonic acid in the air of minesaccording to a series of analyses by angus smith the proportion of carbonic acid in the air of underground workings varied from 004 to 27 per cent by volume in places where men are working the proportion ought not to reach 025 per cent a simple method of determining whether a sample of air reaches this limit 025 per cent is described by dr c le neve foster in the proceedings of the mining association and institute of cornwall for 1888 the apparatus used is an ordinary corked 8ounce medicine bottle this is filled with the air to be examined by sucking out its contents with a piece of rubbertube halfanounce of dilute limewater121 tinted with phenolphthalein is poured in if on corking the bottle and shaking the colour is not discharged the air contains less than 025 per cent of carbon dioxide if the colour fades slowly and does not finally vanish till after a great deal of shaking it may be assumed that the percentage of carbon dioxide does not greatly exceed one quarter whereas if the disappearance is rapid after a very few shakes the contrary of course is the case the dilute limewater is measured out and carried in ordinary halfounce phials this method does not pretend to great accuracy but as a method of distinguishing between good and bad air it is very convenient and will be found useful for determining the actual proportion in the air the following plan is adoptedtake a bottle which will hold about 50 ounces and measure its capacity fill the bottle with the air to be examined pour in 100 cc of limewater and shake up for some time add phenolphthalein and titrate the remaining calcium hydrate with standard solution of oxalic acid the solution of oxalic acid is made by dissolving 225 grams of recrystallised oxalic acid h2c2o42h2o in water and diluting to 1 litre one cc 0001 gram of lime cao or 00007857 gram of carbon dioxide take 100 cc of the same limewater to which add the same amount of phenolphthalein as before titrate the difference between the two readings gives the amount of acid equivalent to the limewater neutralised by the carbon dioxide the number of cc thus used up when multiplied by 03989 gives the number of cc of carbon dioxide at 0 c and 760 mm in the volume of air taken this volume which is that of the bottle less 100 cc must in accurate work be reduced to the normal temperature and pressure122 the percentage by volume can then be calculated practical exercises 1 in a gasometric determination 713 cc of gas were obtained from 02055 gram of mineral the volume

hydrochloric acid boron and borates boron occurs in nature as boric acid or sassoline h3bo3 borax or tincal na2b4o710h2o ulexite or boronatrocalcite 2cab4o7na2b4o7 borocalcite cab4o74h2o boracite 2mg3b8o15mgcl2 and some other minerals boric acid is also a constituent of certain silicates such as tourmaline axinite and datholite the natural borates are used in the preparation of borax which is largely employed as a preservative agent for fluxing and for other purposes there is only one series of boron compounds which have any importance these are the borates in which the trioxide b2o3 acts the part of a weak acid the addition of any acid liberates boric acid which separates out in cold solutions as a crystalline precipitate boric acid is soluble in alcohol and in hot water on evaporating these solutions it is volatilised although the anhydrous oxide is fixed at a red heat the borates are mostly fusible compounds and are soluble in acids and in solutions of ammonic salts detectionboron in small quantities will escape detection unless specially looked for but there is no difficulty in detecting its presence heated in the bunsenburner flame with turners test it gives an evanescent yellowishgreen colour due to fluoride of boron bf3 turners test is a mixture of 5 parts of bisulphate of potash and 1 part of fluor spar boric acid itself imparts a characteristic green colour to the flame which gives a spectrum made up of four wellmarked and equidistant lines three in the green and one in the blue solutions of boric acid give with turmeric paper which has been dipped into it and dried a characteristic red tint this is a very delicate test but in trying it a blank experiment should be carried out alongside with a solution made up of the same reagents which have been used in liberating the boric acid in the sample solution and separationthe solution presents no difficulty but the separation is troublesome the best method is that of gooch who if necessary first fuses with carbonate of soda and after the removal of chlorides and fluorides by nitrate of silver or a lime salt evaporates the aqueous extract with nitric or acetic acid to dryness in a retort and subsequently with repeated doses of 10 cc each of methyl alcohol the distillate contains the boron as boric acid half a gram of the trioxide b2o3 is completely carried over by two evaporations each with 10 cc of the alcohol but if water or foreign salts are present more than this is required in ordinary cases six such evaporations are sufficient for 02 gram of the oxide123 gravimetric determination before the introduction of goochs process it was usual to determine the boron trioxide by difference if the alcoholic distillate containing the boric acid is digested with about 1 gram a known weight of lime for ten or fifteen minutes the alcohol can be evaporated off without danger of loss either calcium nitrate or acetate which will be formed at the same time yields lime upon subsequent ignition consequently the increase in weight after ignition upon that of the lime taken gives the amount of boron trioxide present the trioxide contains 314 per cent of boron b since magnesia does not form a soluble hydrate it cannot satisfactorily be used instead of lime illustration fig 82 the apparatus required is shown in fig 82 it consists of a small retort or evaporating vessel made out of a pipette of 200 cc capacity this is heated by means of a paraffinbath at 130 or 140 c it is connected with an upright condenser at the lower end of which is a small flask which serves as a receiver the quantity of the borate taken should contain not more than 02 gram of the trioxide insoluble compounds are dissolved in nitric acid at once or if necessary first fused with sodium carbonate with soluble and alkaline borates sufficient nitric acid is added to render it faintly acid the solution is then introduced into the retort the lime to retain the boric acid in the distillate is ignited in the crucible in which the evaporation of the distillate is to be made subsequently it is then cooled in the desiccator for ten minutes and weighed the lime is transferred to the receiving flask and slaked with a little water the retort is lowered into the bath so that only the rear dips below the surface the evaporation is carried to dryness the retort being lowered further into the bath as the evaporation proceeds ten cc of methyl alcohol are introduced upon the residue and the evaporation again started six such portions of alcohol are thus distilled and 2 cc of water are introduced and evaporated between the second and third as also between the fourth and fifth distillations if acetic acid is used instead of nitric in the first instance this addition of water is unnecessary the distillate is evaporated in the crucible ignited over the blowpipe cooled in the desiccator for ten minutes and weighed the increase in weight gives the boron trioxide the results tend to be from 1 to 2 milligrams too high volumetric method this method is applicable to the indirect determination of boric acid in borax and similar compounds it is based on the measurement of the quantity of normal solution of acid required to replace the boric acid and consequently is rather a measure of the soda present the process is an alkalimetric one and is carried out as followsweigh up 3 grams of the sample and dissolve in water tint with methyl orange and run in from an ordinary burette normal solution of sulphuric acid until a pink tint is got 100 cc of the normal solution of acid are equal to 70 grams of boron trioxide b2o3 or 101 grams of anhydrous borax na2b4o7 examination of boraxin addition to the determination just given the following determinations are also required watertake about 2 grams and heat to tranquil fusion in a platinum crucible count the loss in weight as water sulphuric oxidetake 2 grams dissolve in water acidify with hydrochloric acid filter and precipitate with barium chloride wash the precipitate ignite and weigh as barium sulphate see sulphur chlorinetake 2 grams dissolve in water acidify with nitric acid filter and add silver

1580 670 appendix b estimation of small quantities of gold124 in the case of small buttons of gold the weight can be determined more easily and accurately by measuring with the help of a microscope than by the actual use of a balance moreover the method of measurement is applicable to the determination of quantities of gold too minute to affect even the most delicate balance for quantities of gold of from 5 to 005 milligram a microscope with 12 inch objective and b eyepiece is suitable the measurements are made with the help of a scale engraved or better photographed on a circular piece of glass which rests on the diaphragm of the eyepiece this scale and the object upon the stage can be easily brought into focus at the same time the button of gold obtained by cupelling is loosened from the cupel by gently touching with the moistened point of a knife it generally adheres to the knife and is then transferred to a glass slide the slide is placed on the stage of the microscope illuminated from below and the button is brought into focus and so placed that it apparently coincides with the scale the diameters in two or three directions avoiding the flattened surface are then read off the different directions being got by rotating the eyepiece the mean diameter is taken the weight of the button is arrived at by comparing with the mean diameter of a standard prill of gold of known weight the weights are in the proportion of the cubes of the diameters for example suppose a prill has been obtained which measures 125 divisions of the scale and that a standard prill weighing 01 milligram measures 111 divisions the weight will be calculated as follows 1113 1253 01 x 01125125125 x 0143 milligram 111111111 the calculations are simplified by the use of a table of cubes the standard prills used in the comparison should not differ much in size from the prills to be determined they are prepared by alloying known weights of gold and lead so as to get an alloy of known composition say one per cent gold portions of the alloy containing the weight of gold required say 01 milligram are then weighed off and cupelled on small smooth cupels made with the finest boneash care must be taken to remove the cupels as soon as cupellation has finished several standard prills of the same size should be made at the same time and their mean diameter calculated the lead for making the goldlead alloy is prepared from litharge purified by reducing from it about 10 per cent of its lead by fusion with a suitable proportion of flour the purified litharge is powdered mixed with sufficient flour and reduced to metal in determining the gold contained in small buttons of silvergold alloy obtained in assaying and in which the silver is almost sure to be in excess of that required for parting transfer the button from the cupel to a small clean porcelain crucible pour on it a drop or two of nitric acid diluted with half its bulk of water and heat gently and cautiously until action has ceased if the residual gold is broken up move the crucible so as to bring the particles together so that they may cohere wash three or four times with distilled water about half filling the crucible each time and decanting off against the finger dry the crucible in a warm place and when dry but whilst still black take the gold up on a small piece of pure lead half a grain of lead is sufficient and it is best to hold it on the point of a blunt penknife and press it on the gold in the crucible the latter generally adheres transfer to a small smooth cupel and place in the muffle when the cupellation has finished the button of gold is measured as already described practical notes on the iodide process of copper assaying for the following remarks and experiments we are indebted to mr jw westmoreland who has had considerable experience with the process having dissolved the ore he converts the metals into sulphates by evaporating with sulphuric acid the copper is then separated as subsulphide by means of hyposulphite of soda and the precipitate is washed dried and calcined the resulting oxide of copper is then dissolved in nitric acid and to the concentrated solution a saturated solution of carbonate of soda is added in sufficient quantity to throw down a considerable proportion of the copper acetic acid is added to dissolve the precipitate and when this is effected more of the acid is poured on so as to render the solution strongly acid to this potassium iodide crystals are added in the proportion of ten parts of iodide to each one part of copper supposed to be present the solution is then titrated with hypo as usual for the examination of technical products experiments made in sulphuric acid solutions have no value since arsenic acid which is generally present to a greater or less extent affects the end reaction in such solutions bismuth may also interfere the solution best suited for the assay is one containing acetate of soda and free acetic acid the presence of acetate of soda counteracts the interference of arsenic and of bismuth the return of the blue colour after titration is due to the excessive dilution of the assay or to an insufficiency of potassium iodide or to the presence of nitrous fumes the interference of an excess of sodium acetate is avoided by adding more iodide crystals to the extent of doubling the usual amount the interference of lead can be avoided by the addition of sulphuric acid or of phosphate of soda to the acid solution containing the copper and before neutralising with carbonate of soda the end reaction is however with care distinguishable without this addition the following experiments each containing 0648 gram of lead were made by him in illustration copper taken reagent added copper found end reaction 2092 gram 2077 gram fairly satisfactory 2101 2092 2167 sulphuric acid 2152 2117 2108 2109 phosphate of soda 2092 good colourless 2205 2174 rather yellow effect of sodium acetateeach

except with the excessive quantities of acetate of soda and the insufficiency of potassium iodide in the cases of c and f there was no difficulty with the afterblueing method of separating cobalt and nickel the following method of separating and estimating cobalt and nickel has been described by mr james hope125 with whom it has been in daily use for several years with completely satisfactory results the quantity of ore taken should contain about 5 gram of the mixed metals it is dissolved in hydrochloric acid or aqua regia and the solution evaporated to dryness the residue is taken up with dilute hydrochloric acid and hot water the solution is filtered off from the silica freed from second group metals by treatment with sulphuretted hydrogen and filtered and after oxidation with nitric acid is separated from iron and alumina by the basic acetate method page 233 the precipitate is redissolved in a little hydrochloric acid and again precipitated by sodium acetate the two filtrates are mixed and treated with a little acetic acid and the cobalt and nickel are then precipitated as sulphides by a current of sulphuretted hydrogen the precipitate is filtered off washed dried and calcined and the resulting oxides are weighed to get an idea as to the quantity of the two metals present the calcined precipitate is dissolved in a small covered beaker in aqua regia with the help of a few drops of bromine to remove any separated sulphur and the solution evaporated to dryness with a few drops of sulphuric acid the residue is dissolved in hot water diluted to about 50 cc and heated to boiling about 2 grams four times the quantity of mixed metals present of ammonium phosphate amh2po4 are weighed off dissolved in the smallest possible quantity of water and boiled for a minute or two with a few cc of dilute sulphuric acid this is added to the boilinghot solution of cobalt and nickel which is then treated cautiously with dilute ammonia until the precipitate partially dissolves the addition of the ammonia is continued drop by drop with constant stirring until the cobalt comes down as a pink precipitate of ammonium cobalt phosphate amcopo4 the beaker is placed on the top of a water bath with occasional stirring for five or ten minutes the blue liquid containing the nickel is decanted through a small filter and the precipitate is dissolved with a few drops of dilute sulphuric acid the resulting solution is treated with a small excess of ammonium phosphate and the cobalt again precipitated by the cautious addition of ammonia exactly as before the precipitate containing the whole of the cobalt is filtered off and washed with small quantities of hot water the filtrate is added to the previous one containing the greater part of the nickel the ammonium cobalt phosphate is dried transferred to a platinum crucible and ignited over a bunsen flame for fifteen or twenty minutes a purple coloured cobalt pyrophosphate co2p2o7 is thus formed and is weighed it contains 403 per cent of cobalt the mixed filtrates containing the nickel are placed in a tall beaker and dilated if necessary to about 200 cc ten cc of strong ammonia are added and the solution heated to 70 c is ready for electrolysis a battery of two 112 pint bunsen cells is used this is found capable of depositing from 15 to 20 gram of nickel per hour and from two to three hours is generally sufficient for the electrolysis the electrode with the deposited nickel is washed with distilled water afterwards with alcohol as described under copper and is then dried and weighed the following results obtained with this method by mr hope illustrate the accuracy of the method they were obtained by working on solutions containing known weights of the two metals taken found cobalt

no 4 vol ix april 30 1890 appendix c a lecture on the theory of sampling the problem of the sampler is essentially the same as that of the student of statistics one aims at getting a small parcel of ore the other a number of data but each hopes to obtain what shall represent a true average applicable to a much larger mass of material ignoring the mechanical part of the problems the sampling errors of the one and the deviations from the average of the other are the same thing it may be doubted whether many not specially trained in the study of statistics could answer such a question as the followingseven hundred thousand men being employed there are in a given year one thousand deaths from accident assuming the conditions to remain unaltered within what limits could one foretell the number of deaths by accident in any other year on the other hand there is a widespread belief in the efficacy of what is called the law of averages even the ordinary newspaper reader is accustomed to look on the national deathrate or birthrate as a thing capable of being stated with accuracy to one or two places of decimals and he knows that the annual number of suicides is practically constant if a man played whist often and kept a record of the number of trumps n each hand he would find fortune treated him quite fairly in a years play the average number would deviate very little from the theoretical average ie onequarter of thirteen and a knowledge of this truth is useful and that not merely in keeping ejaculations in due restraint but every good player knows more than this he has a sense of what variations in the number of trumps may reasonably be expected for example he will be prepared to risk something on neither of his opponents having more than five trumps and will accept it as a practical certainty that no one has more than eight much of what is known as good judgment is based on a proper estimate of deviations from the average the question has an important bearing on sampling as may be seen from the fact that shuffling and dealing at cards are but modifications of the wellknown mixing and quartering of the sampler because of this bearing on sampling and for other reasons i became many years ago much interested in the question and gave to its solution perhaps more labour than it was worth in books on medical statistics the answer to the question is stated in a mathematical formula called poissons formula which in a modified form i shall give further on but this did not satisfy me because i wanted to learn what a reasonably safe limit of error actually meant and this could be best learnt by experiment so with the help of some friends i went in for a thorough course of pennytossing tossing a penny twenty times an average result would be ten heads and ten tails to find the deviations from this we tossed two hundred twenties ie four thousand times of the two hundred thirtythree gave the exact average viz10 heads sixtyfour gave an error of one viz9 or 11 heads fortynine an error of two twentysix an error of three twenty an error of four eight gave an error of five and this limit was not exceeded from these we may say that six is a reasonably safe limit of error ninetyseven cases say onehalf gave an error not exceeding one and the mean error is 18 in other words in twenty tosses you will not get more than 16 nor less than 4 heads you are as likely as not to get 9 10 or 11 heads and lastly if you lost in twenty throws all heads or tails over 10 your average loss would be 18 penny or say roughly 2d on the twenty throws it was necessary to compare these with another series containing a larger average say that of 100 heads in 200 throws i confess the labour of tossing pennies two hundred at a time was little to our taste so from a bag of pennies borrowed from the bank we weighed out samples containing two hundred and for an evening we were busy counting heads and tails in these the heads in sixty samples ranged from 80 to 114 one hundred heads occurred seven times the extent and frequency of the errors is shown in the table errorno of errorno of errorno of times times times 1 8 6 3 11 1 2 5 7 3 14 3 3 6 8 3 15 1 4 3 9 7 18 2 5 6 10 1 20 1 we may call the limit of error 21 twentynine results out of sixty say onehalf had an error not exceeding 4 and the mean error is 56 in comparing these with the series 10 in 20 we must working by rule divide not by 10 but by 316 the square root of 10 for if we multiply an average by any number126 the error is also multiplied but only by the square root of the number the error varies as the square root of the number now 21316 66 limit of error for 10 in 20 56316 18 mean error 4316 12 probable error it will be seen that these calculated results agree fairly well with those actually obtained the rule by which these calculations are made is important and will bear further illustration to calculate the number of heads in 3200 throws we have to find the limit of error on a true average of 1600 in 3200 this being 16 times the average of 100 in 200 the corresponding errors must be multiplied by 4 this gives 214 84 limit of error 564 224 mean error 44 16 probable error the results i have actually obtained with these large numbers are hardly enough to base much on but have a value by way of confirmation expecting 1600 heads the actual numbers were 1560 1596 1643 1557 1591 1605 1615 1545 it will be seen that exactly half are within the probable error but this considering the small number of results must be more or less of an accident it is more to the point they are all well within the limits of error i have a large number of other results which with a single exception are all in accord with those given and this exception only just overstepped the limits it was like a case of nine trumps which though in a sense possible is very unlikely to happen in any ones experience but even now we are not quite in a position to answer the question with which we started if you refer to it you will see that we are face to face with this problem the limit of variation on the 1000 who died would be say 70127 ignoring decimals but if we calculate on the number who did not die viz699000128 we shall get a variation 26 times as great as this but it is evident the variation must be the same in each case i submitted this kind of problem also to the test of experiment the results of which gave me great faith in poissons formula imagine two hundred pennies in a bag all heads up any shaking will spoil this arrangement and give a certain proportion of tails and further the probable effect of shaking and turning will be to reduce the preponderance of heads or tails whichever may be in excess this of course is the reason why we are so unlikely to get more than 120 of them in either position but if the two hundred pennies are increased to 20000 by adding pennies which have tails on both sides then the shaking or mixing would be less effective we should still expect as an average result to get the 100 heads but in 20000 instead of 200 the variation will be 28 or 29 on the 100 instead of 20 and this is a better limit in such cases taking 28 as the limit of error on 100 instances and proportionally increasing the others so that the mean error becomes 78 and the probable error 56 we may now calculate the answer without gross mistake the probable variation on the 1000 deaths by accident will be 18 the mean variation will be 246 and the limits of variation 885 one such table showing in five years a mean number of deaths of about 1120 per annum gives an annual deviation of about 50 up or down of this it will be seen at once that an improvement of 30 or 40 in any one year would be without meaning but that an improvement of from 100 to 200 would indicate some change for the better in the circumstances of the industry before applying these principles to the elucidation of some of the problems of sampling it will be well to give poissons formula in a modified form and to illustrate its working let x equal the number of cases of one sort y the cases of the other sort and z the total in the example z will be the 700000 engaged in the industry x will be the 1000 killed by accidents and y will be the 699000 who did not so die the limit of deviation or error calculated by poissons formula will be the square root of 8xyz replacing x y and z by the figures of the example we get the square root of 81000699000700000 which works out to the square root of 798857 or 893 which means that we may reasonably expect the number of deaths not to vary from 1000 by more than 89 ie they will be between 1090 and 910 it will be seen that this number is in very satisfactory agreement with 885 given by the rougher calculation based on my own experiments to come to the question of sampling consider a powder of uniform fineness and fine enough to pass through an 80 sieve for purposes of calculation this may be assumed to be made up of particles of about oneeighth of a millimetre across say roughly 1200 of an inch cubed this gives the content as about 1500 strictly 1512 of a cubic mm now one cubic mm of water weighs 1 milligram therefore 500 such particles if they have the specific gravity of water weigh 1 milligram and otherwise weigh 1 milligram multiplied by the sp gr 500 particles of ruby silver pyrargyrite129 will weigh 58 milligrams and will contain nearly 35 milligrams of silver now suppose a portion of 32667 grams 110 assay ton of silver ore to contain 500 such particles of ruby silver and no other material carrying silver such an ore would contain 35 ozs of silver to the ton but the limits of variation on 500 particles would be 28130 multiplied by the square root of 5 or 62 particles thus the limit of sampling error would amount to just oneeighth of the silver present or say to rather more than 4 ozs to the ton the mean sampling error would be rather more than a quarter of this or say about 13 ozs to the ton on the other hand if one took for the assay a charge six times greater say about 20 grams the number of particles would be 3000 and the limits of variation would be 28 multiplied by the square root of 30 or 153 particles which is very closely 120 of the silver present or say 175 ozs to the ton whilst the mean error would amount to about 5 ozs to the ton to work these examples by poissons formula let us assume the gangue to have a mean sp gr of 3 then 500 particles would weigh 3 milligrams and 32609131 grams would contain 543500 particles there would be then 500 of ruby silver and 543500 of gangue together 544000 and the formula gives the square root of 8500543500544000 which works out to 63 particles as against 62 by the other method a practical conclusion from this is of course that either the ore must be powdered more finely or a larger portion than 3 grams must be taken for the assay moreover it is evident that on such an ore no small sample must be taken containing less than several million particles consider now a copper ore of the same uniform fineness containing particles of copper pyrites sp gr 4 of which 1000 particles will weigh 8 milligrams mixed with gangue of which 1000 particles weigh 6 milligrams if one gram of such ore contain 5 gram of copper pyrites 1725 gram copper and 5 gram of gangue these will contain 62500 and say 83500 particles respectively altogether 146000 particles with poissons formula this gives the limit of sampling error as the square root of 86250083500146000 or 521 particles but a variation of 521 on 62500 is a variation of 83 per cent the percentage of copper in the ore is 1725 per cent and 83 per cent of this is 14 per cent the limits of sampling error therefore are 1711 per cent and 1739 per cent again it must be remembered that the mean sampling error would be a little over onequarter of this or say from 172 per cent to 173 per cent the practical conclusion is that a powder of this degree of fineness is not fine enough in the last place let us consider a similar iron ore containing 90 per cent of hmatite sp gr 5 and 10 per cent of gangue sp gr 3 1 gram of such ore will contain 90000 particles of hmatite weighing 9 gram and containing 63 gram of iron with say 16500 particles of gangue weighing 1 gram altogether 106500 particles poissons formula then gives the limits of variation as the square root of 89000016500106500 or 334 particles but 334 on 90000 is 023 on 630 which is the percentage of iron present the limits of sampling error then are 6277 per cent and 6323 per cent and the mean variation is from 6294 per cent to 6306 per cent these examples are worthy of careful consideration and it must be remembered that the calculations are made on the assumption that the ore is made up of uniform particles of mineral of such fineness as would pass easily through an 80 sieve but which does not pretend to represent with great exactness the fineness of the powdered ore customary in practice they show that having passed through such a sieve is no proof of sufficient powdering not that all ores powdered and so sifted are unfit for assaying this last would be an absurd and illogical conclusion if an ore be powdered to a fairly fine sand and then be passed through a series of sieves say a 40 60 and 80 in such a state that little or none remains on the first but the others retain a large proportion then of that which comes through the 80 sieve perhaps twothirds by weight may be even coarser than the powder i have used in the example of the rest most may be of about half this diameter the weight of the really fine powder may be quite inconsiderable on the other hand if the grinding be continued until on sifting little or nothing that is powderable remains on the sieves then in the sifted product the proportions will be very different this last of course is the only right way of powdering also it is evident that so much depends on the manner of powdering that nothing precise can be stated as to the average coarseness of the powder suppose however by good powdering a product is obtained which may be represented by a uniform powder with particles 120th of a millimetre in diameter say roughly 1500 inch compared with the previous powder the diameter has been divided by 25 their number therefore in any given weight has been increased by the cube of 25 which is 156 but the value of a sample varies as the square root of the number of particles hence the reduction in size and consequent increase in number has made the sample nearly four times better than before and it will be seen that this brings the sampling error within tolerable limits there are one or two words of warning which should be given in the first place using a 90 sieve instead of an 80 must not be too much relied on the powder i took in the example would pass through it it is a question of good powdering rather than of fine sifting in the second place a set of say halfadozen assays concordant within 1 oz where the theory gives 4 ozs as the limit of error does not upset the theory the theory itself states this as likely it is the error you may get in one or two assays out of a hundred not the error you are likely to get in any one assay which is considered under the heading limit of error accepting the result just arrived at that a portion of 1 gram may be safely taken for an assay if the particles are 120th of a millimetre in diameter the further question remains as to what weight of the original sample must be reduced to this degree of fineness this may be answered on the principle that the same degree of excellence should be aimed at in each of a series of samplings this principle is illustrated in the table on page 2 a fine sand such as would pass a 40 sieve but be retained on a 60 sieve would be fairly represented by particles onequarter of a millimetre in diameter this being five times coarser to contain the same number of particles must be 125 times the cube of 5 as heavy therefore 125 grams of it can be taken with the same degree of safety as 1 gram of the finer powder of such a sand about this weight should be taken and reduced to the finer powder if the ore were in coarse sand say in particles 1 millimetre in diameter this would be four times as coarse as that last considered and we should have to take 64 times as much of it 64 times 125 grams is 8 kilos or say roughly from 15 to 20 lbs this should be crushed to the finer size and mixed then from 100 to 150 grams should be taken and ground to the finest powder there is however a reason why on the coarser stuff a smaller proportion may safely be used this becomes more evident if we consider a still coarser sample a heap of ore in stones about 2 inches across would be 50 times coarser than the sand and an equivalent sample would need to be 125000 times heavier this would amount to about 1000 tons experienced samplers would say that under such conditions so large a sample was hardly necessary this is because i have assumed in the calculations that the grains of copper pyrites for example were all copper pyrites and the particles of gangue were free from copper this would be true or nearly so for the very fine powder but far from true in the case of the ore heap in the heap probably few of the stones would be pure ore and still fewer would be free from copper the stones would differ among themselves in their copper contents only within certain comparatively narrow limits and it is evident that if replacing one stone by another instead of resulting in the gain or loss of all the copper one or other contained merely affected the result to onetenth of this amount then a sample of 1100th of the weight say 10 tons would be equally safe it should be remembered however that while the man who samples on a large scale can safely and properly reduce the size of his samples on this account yet the principle is one which counts less and less as the stuff becomes more finely divided and ought to be ignored in the working down of the smaller samples which come to the assayer footnotes 126 the 10 in 20 multiplied by 10 100 in 200 127 multiply the
