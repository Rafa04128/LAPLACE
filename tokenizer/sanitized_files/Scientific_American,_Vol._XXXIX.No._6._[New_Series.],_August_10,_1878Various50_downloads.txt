tired out with tramping about the buildings and grounds is only too pleased to refresh his eyes with some of that exquisite miniature water scenery which is scattered about the grounds we take our illustration from the london graphic improvements in silk worm breeding galignani states that a very curious discovery has just been made which if found as practicable in application as it seems to promise may create a very considerable change in the production of silk it is nothing more nor less than the possibility of obtaining two yields in the year of the raw material instead of one as at present the moth lays its eggs in may or june and these do not hatch before the spring of the following year but sometimes they are observed to hatch spontaneously ten or twelve days after they are laid it was such a circumstance as this coming to the attention of m ducloux professor of the faculty of sciences at lyons that led him to undertake a series of experiments on the subject by means of which he has found that this premature hatching can be produced at will the means for effecting the object are very simplerubbing the eggs with a hair brush subjecting them to the action of electricity or more surely still by dipping them for half a minute in concentrated sulphuric acid m boll who has also turned his attention to the same subject states that the same effect is produced by hydrochloric nitric or even acetic and tartaric acid finally a submersion of a few seconds in water heated to 50 cent 122 fah is equally efficacious however m ducloux states that the operation must be performed while the eggs are quite young the second or third day at the outside when this new hatching is accomplished the mulberry tree is in its full vigor and the weather so favorable that the rearing of the worm is liable to much less risk than during the early days of spring when the sudden atmospheric changes are very detrimental and frequently fatal to the growing caterpillars the natural history of the eel according to the reports of shad fishermen the chief enemy of the shad is the eel which not only follows that fish up the streams and devours the spawn but often attacks the shad after they are caught in the nets entering the shad at the gill openings the eels suck out the spawn and entrails and leave the fish perfectly clean the finest and fattest shad are the ones selected it is a curious circumstance that of a fish so well known as the eel so many of its life habits should be in dispute an animated discussion has been going on in germany quite recently with regard to the natural history of this fish and in a late number of a scientific journal the following points are set down as pretty well substantiated though a fresh water fish which passes the greater part of its life in rivers the eel spawns in the sea that it is viviparous is extremely improbable the eel found in the upper waters of rivers is almost always female at the age of four years it goes down to the sea to spawn and never returns to fresh water the spawning process is somehow dangerous to the eel thousands being found dead near the mouths of rivers with their ovaries empty the descent of the fish to the sea does not appear to take place at any definite period but is probably dependent on the season for spawning the male is always much smaller than the female and never exceeds half a yard in length the males never ascend to the head waters of rivers but keep continually in the sea or in the lower reaches of the river nothing is definitely known about the spawning season though it is probable that the eggs are deposited in the sea not far from the mouths of rivers illustration the paris exhibitiona sketch in the park illustration scientific american in gothic

iron making the success of the danks puddling furnace fired with pulverized coal seems to be no longer a matter of doubt in england it is stated that messrs hopkins gilkes co the well known iron makers of the north of england have succeeded in turning out from it from cleveland pig alone iron capable of bearing tests which staffordshire iron has not yet surpassed the english iron manufacturers in their struggle with us are wisely taking advantage of every improvement in their line to keep ahead of us and are likely to be successful unless our manufacturers arouse from their fancied security we are now underselling the english at home and abroad in many articles of manufacture because so much of our work is done by machinery and is consequently better and cheaper than can be produced by hand labor at the lowest living rate of wages but so soon as the english masters and workmen shall fully appreciate this fact the same machines run there with cheaper labor will deprive us of our present advantages already we notice several instances in which the workmen renouncing their prejudices have willingly consented to the substitution of machine for hand work and we doubt not that the success of these innovations conjoined with the pressure of the times will ere long create a complete revolution in the ideas of the british workmen so that instead of longer opposing they will demand the improved appliances and facilities for work converting them from rivals or opponents to allies such a radical change is not necessarily far in the future for the logic of it has long been working in the brains of both masters and men and may reasonably bear fruit at any time we fear that when this time arrives our makers of iron especially will wake up to the consciousness that they have not kept up with the advance the telephone as a promoter of science every new thing whether it be in the realm of mind or matter has an influence on whatever existed before of a similar kind to modify develop and improve it or to doom it to oblivion whatever is new necessitates a better knowledge of the old so that the world gains not only by the acquirement of the new thing but also by a better understanding of things already known a discovery published sets a thousand minds at work and immediately there is a host of experimentalists who in their desire to make and try the new thing for themselves begin without a knowledge of the science or art to which the discovery pertains and inevitably fail after failure comes research which to be of value must be extended every investigator can recall the novelty that induced his first experiments and can recount his trials in his search for information among the inventions or discoveries that have induced extended experiment the telephone may without doubt be mentioned as the chief for no sooner was the first speaking telephone brought out than here and there all over the country it was imitated persons who never had the slightest knowledge of electrical science had a desire to see and test the telephone to do this first of all requires a degree of mechanical skill acoustics must be understood and a knowledge of the four branches of electrical science is requisite as the telephone involves galvanism magnetism electrical resistance induction and many of the nicer points which can be understood by investigation only and this not only in the direction indicated but in the allied branches of physics and also in chemistry familiarity with these things develops a scientific taste that will not be easily satisfied the characteristic avidity with which the american people seize upon a novelty has been wonderfully exemplified by the manner in which the telephone mania has spread in consequence of this science has received an impetus and now we have everywhere embryo electricians and experimentalists where before were only the unscientific letter from professor hughes we print in another column a letter received from mr d e hughes concerning the distinction he finds between his microphone and mr edisons carbon telephone mr hughes is very confident that the two inventions have nothing in common and that they bear no resemblance to each other in form material or principles we would not question mr hughes sincerity in all this no doubt he honestly believes that the invention of mr edison represents no field of discovery and is restricted in its uses to telephony whilst the microphone demonstrates and represents the whole field of nature but the fact of his believing this is only another proof that he utterly fails to understand or appreciate the real scope and character of mr edisons work to those familiar not only with mr edisons telephone but with the long line of experimental investigation that had to be gone through with before he was able to control the excessive sensitiveness of the elements of his original discovery it is very clear that mr hughes has been working upon and overestimating the importance of one phase and that a limited phase of mr edisons investigations we propose shortly to review at length the evidence of mr edisons priority in the invention or discovery of all that the microphone covers this purely as a question of scientific interest for the personal elements of the controversy between mr edison on the one side and messrs preece and hughes on the other we care nothing the scientific american export edition the inquiry for american manufactured products and machinery abroad seems to grow in volume and variety daily and though in comparison with our capacity to produce the foreign demand is yet small its possibilities are unlimited to increase the demand the immediate problem is to make known throughout the world in the most attractive fashion possible the wide range of articles which america is prepared to furnish and which other nations have use for as a medium for conveying such intelligence the monthly export edition of the scientific american is unequaled the table of contents of the second issue to be found in another column will give an idea of the wide range and permanent as well as timely interest of the matter it circulates it is a magazine of valuable information that will be preserved and repeatedly read the handsomely illustrated advertising pages supplement the text and make it at once the freshest fullest and most attractive periodical of the sort in the world an examination of the index of advertisers will show how widely its advantages for reaching foreign buyers have been appreciated by leading american houses in the advertising page xxv appears a list of some eight hundred foreign commercial places in which the circulation of the paper is guaranteed as evidence that it reaches those for whom such publications are intended fountain pens for several days we have had in use in our office examples of the mackinnon fountain pen and find it to be a very serviceable and effective instrument this is a handsome looking pen with a hollow handle in which a supply of ink is carried and the fluid flows from the point in the act of writing the necessity of an inkstand is thus avoided one of the difficulties heretofore with pens of this character has been to insure a free and certain delivery of the ink and also to bring the instrument within the compass and weight of an ordinary pen the inventor seems to have admirably succeeded in the example before us the ink flows with certainty and there is no scratching as with the ordinary pen it writes with facility on either smooth or rough paper writes even more smoothly than a lead pencil may be carried in the pocket is always ready for use there is no spilling or blotting of ink the construction is simple durable and the action effective one filling lasts a week or more according to the extent of use these are some of the qualities that our use of the pen so far has seemed to demonstrate and which made us think that whoever supplies himself with a mackinnon pen will possess a good thing the sole agency is at no 21 park row new york city the sun by s p langley allegheny observatory pa when with a powerful telescope we return to the study of the suns surface we meet a formidable difficulty which our first simple means did not present this arises from the nearly constant tremors of our own atmosphere through which we have to look it is not that the tremor does not exist with the smaller instrument but now our higher magnifying power exaggerates it causes everything to appear unsteady and blurry however good the glass and makes the same kind of trouble for the eye which we should experience if we tried to read very fine print across the top of a hot stove whence columns of tremulous air were rising there is no remedy for this unless it is assiduous watching and infinite patience for in almost every day there will come one or more brief intervals lasting sometimes minutes sometimes only seconds during which the air seems momentarily tranquil we must be on the watch for hours to seize these favorable moments and piecing together what we have seen in them in the course of time we obtain such knowledge of the more curious features of the solar surface as we now possess the eye aches after gazing for a minute steadily at the full moon and the suns light is from 300000 to 600000 times brighter than full moon light while its heat is in still greater proportion the object lens of such a telescope as the equatorial at allegheny is 13 inches in diameter and it is such light and such heat concentrated by it that we have to gaze on the best contrivance so far found for diminishing both and without which our present acquaintance with the real appearance and character of sunspots would not have been gained depends upon a curious property of light discovered by a french physicist malus in the beginning of this century let a fig 10 be a piece of plane unsilvered glass receiving the solar rays and reflecting them to a second similar one b which itself reflects them again in the direction c of course since the glass is transparent most of the rays will pass through a and not be reflected of those which reach b again most will pass through so that not a hundredth part of the original beam reaches c this then is so far a gain but of itself of little use since such is the solar brilliancy that even this small fraction would to an eye at c appear blindingly bright now if we rotate b about the line joining it with a keeping always the same reflecting angle with it it might naturally be supposed that the light would merely be reflected in a new direction unchanged in quantity but according to the curious discovery of malus this is not what happens what does happen is that the second glass after being given a quarter turn though always kept at the same angle seems to lose its power of reflection almost altogether the light which comes from it now is diminished enormously and yet nothing is distorted or displaced everything is seen correctly if enough light remains to see it by at all and the ray is said to have been polarized by reflection it would be out of place to enter here on the cause of the phenomenon the fact is certain and is a very precious one for the astronomer can now diminish the suns light till it is bearable by the weakest eye without any distortion of what he is looking at and without disturbing the natural tints by colored glasses in practice a third and sometimes a fourth reflector each of a wedge shaped optically plane piece of unsilvered glass are thus introduced and by a simple rotation of the last one the light is graded at pleasure so that with such an instrument called the polarizing eyepiece fig a i have often watched the suns magnified image for four or five hours together with no more distress to the eye than in reading a newspaper with this in favorable moments we see that the suns surface away from the spots everywhere is made up of hundreds of thousands of small intensely brilliant bodies that seem to be floating in a gray medium which though itself no doubt very bright appears dark by comparison what these little things are is still uncertain whatever they are they are the immediate principal source of the suns light and heat to get an idea of their size we must resort to some more delicate means of measurement than we used in the case of the watch the filar micrometer consists essentially of two excessively fine strands of cobwebs or rather of spiders cocoon called technically wires stretched parallel to each other and placed just at the focus of the telescope suppose one of them to be fixed and the second to be movable keeping always parallel to the first by means of a screw having perhaps one hundred threads to the inch and a large drum shaped head divided into one hundred equal parts so that moving this head by one division carries the second wire 110000 part of an inch nearer to the first motions smaller than this can clearly be registered but it will be evident that everything here really depends upon the accuracy of the screw the guide screw of the best lathe is a coarse piece of work by comparison with micrometer screws as now constructed especially those for making the gratings to be described later for recent uses of them demand perhaps the most accurate workmanship of anything in mechanicsthe maker of one which will pass some lately invented tests is entitled at any rate to call himself a workman illustration fig 11 since the wires are stretched precisely in the focus where the principal image of the sun is formed and move in it they and the features of the surface form one picture as magnified by the eye lens so that they appear as if moving about on the sun itself we can first set them far enough apart for instance to take in the whole of a spot and then by bringing them together measure its apparent diameter in ten thousandths of an inch then measuring the diameter of the whole sun we have evidently the proportion that one bears to the other and hence the means of easily calculating the real size a powerful piece of clockwork attached to the equatorial keeps it slowly rotating on its axis at the same angular rate as that with which the sun moves in the sky so that any spot or other object there will seem to stay fixed with relation to the wires if we choose all day long the picture of wires spots and all may be projected on a screen if desired and fig 11 shows the field of view with the micrometer wires lying across a spot so seen on the 6th of march 1873 part of a cambric needle with the end of a fine thread is represented also as being projected on the screen along with the wires to give a better idea of the delicacy of the latter now we may measure if we please the size of one of those bright objects which have just been spoken of as being countable by hundreds of thousands these little things are then seen to be really of considerable size measuring from one to three seconds of arc so that a second of arc here being over 400 miles the average surface of each individual of these myriads is found to be considerably larger than great britain near the edge of the disk under favorable circumstances they appear to rise up through the obscuring atmosphere which darkens the limb and gathered here and there in groups of hundreds to form the white cloudlike patches facul which may sometimes be seen even with a spyglasssomething in the sun brighter than the sun itself to employ the expression by which huyghens described them nearly two hundred years ago they are too minute and delicate objects to be rendered at all in our engraving but this is true also of much of the detail to be seen at times in the spots themselves the wood cuts make no pretense to do more than give an outline of the more prominent features of which we are now about to speak the wonderful beauty of some of their details must be taken on trust from the writers imperfect description of what no pencil has ever yet rendered and what the photograph has not yet seized illustration fig a illustration fig 10 bearing this in mind let us now suppose that while using the polarizing eyepiece on the part of the spot distinguished by the little circle we have one of those rare opportunities when we can by the temporary steadiness of our tremulous atmosphere use the higher powers of the telescope and magnify the little circle till it appears as in fig 12 we have now nearly the same view as if we were brought close to the surface of the sun and suspended over this part of the spot all the faint outer shade seen in the smaller views the penumbra is seen to be made up of long white filaments twisted into curious ropelike forms while the central part is like a great flame ending in fiery spires over these hang what look like clouds such as we sometimes see in our highest sky but more transparent than the finest lace vail would be and having not the fleecy look of our clouds but the appearance of being filled with almost infinitely delicate threads of light perhaps the best idea of what is so hard to describe because so unlike anything on earth is got by supposing ourselves to look through successive vails of white lace filled with flowerlike patterns at some great body of white flame beyond while between the spires of the flame and separating it from the border are depths of shade passing into blackness with all this there is something crystalline about the appearance which it is hard to render an idea offrostfigures on a window pane may help us as an image though imperfect in fact the intense whiteness of everything is oddly suggestive of something very cold rather than very hot as we know it really i have had much the same impression when looking into the open mouth of a puddling furnace at the lumps of pure white iron swimming halfmelted in the grayer fluid about them here however the temperature leaves nothing solid nothing liquid even the iron and other metals of which we know these spotforms do in part at least consist are turned into vapor by the inconceivable heat and everything we are looking at consists probably of clouds of such vapor for it is fluctuating and changing from one form into another while we look on forms as evanescent almost as those of sunset clouds and far more beautiful in everything but color are shifting before us and here and there we see or think we see in the sweep of their curves beyond evidences of mighty whirlwinds greater by far than the largest terrestrial cyclone at work while we are looking and trying to make the most of every moment our atmosphere grows tremulous again the shapes get confused there is nothing left distinct but such coarser features as our engraving shows and the wonderful sight is over when we consider that this little portion of the spot we have been looking at is larger than the north and south american continents together and that we could yet see its parts change from minute to minute it must be evident that the actual motion must have been rapid almost beyond conceptiona speed of from 20 to 50 miles a second being commonly observed and sometimes exceeded a cannon ball moves less than of a mile per second i have seen a portion of the photosphere or bright general surface of the sun drawn into a spot much as any floating thing would be drawn into a whirlpool and then though it occupied by measurement over 3000000 miles in area completely break up and change so as to be unrecognizable in less than twenty minutes when we come to discuss the subject of the suns heat we shall find that the temperature of a blast furnace or of the oxyhydrogen blowpipe is low compared with that which obtains all over such a vast region and remembering this it is evident that its disappearance is a cataclysm of which the most tremendous volcanic outburst here gives no conception we cannot by any terrestrial comparison describe it for we have no comparison for it in human experience if we try to picture such an effect on the earth we may say in anothers words that these solar whirlwinds are such as coming down upon us from the north would in thirty seconds after they had crossed the st lawrence be in the gulf of mexico carrying with them the whole surface of the continent in a mass not simply of ruin but of glowing vapor in which the vapors arising from the dissolution of the materials composing the cities of boston new york and chicago would be mixed in a single indistinguishable cloud these vast cavities then in the sun we call spots are not solid things and not properly to be compared even to masses of slag or scoria swimming on a molten surface they are rather rents in that bright cloud surface of the sun which we call the photosphere and through which we look down to lower regions their shape may be very rudely likened to a funnel with sides at first slowly sloping the penumbra and then suddenly going down into the central darkness the umbra this central darkness has itself gradations of shade and cloud forms may be seen there obscurely glowing with a reddish tinge far down its depths but we never see to any solid bottom and the hypothesis of a habitable sun far within the hot surface suggested by sir william herschel is now utterly abandoned we are able now to explain in part that mysterious feature in the suns rotation before insisted on for if the sun be not a solid or a liquid but a mass of glowing vapor it is evidently possible that one part of it may turn faster than another why it so turns we repeat no one knows but the fact that it does is now seen to bear the strongest testimony to the probable gaseous form of the sun throughout its massat any rate to the gaseous or vaporous nature of everything we see we must not forget however that under such enormous temperature and pressure as prevail there the conditions may bein fact must bevery different from any familiar to us here so that when we speak of clouds and use like expressions we are to be understood as implying rather an analogy than an exact resemblance illustration fig 12 we must expect with the great advances photography has lately made to know more of this part of our subject which we may call solar meteorology at the next spot maximum than ever before and by that time it may be hoped that some of the wonderful forms described above so imperfectly will have been caught for us by the camera for parts 1 and 2 see

of the puddling apparatus invented by mr oestlund as used at the finspong ironworks the gas generator a is of the common swedish type as used for charcoal the tube k conducts the gases into the refining pot a this pot has a lining of refinery slag which is melted as the apparatus revolves to get it to adhere to the sides the revolution of the pot a on its axis d is effected by the action of the beveled wheels b and b and the pulley c which takes from an iron chain the power given off by a turbine the spindle d is supported in the bearings e and e c carrying a pair of trunnions which form the axis of oscillation and allow the apparatus to rise or fall the whole of this mechanism being supported on the plummer blocks f f one of the trunnions e is prolonged so as to form the axis of the beveled wheel b and the pulley c the latter sliding along the trunnion so as to put b in or out of gear the bush e is tied by means of the stay g to the upper end of the toothed segment g the lower extremity of which is connected with the second bush at the end of the spindle by means of the pinion h revolving on standards i i and the segmental rack g the pot can be raised or lowered without interfering with the action of the beveled wheels illustration apparatus for mechanical puddling the gas from the generator is brought to the mouth of the pot by the tubes k and m the air necessary for the combustion of the gas is brought in by a tube l branching from the air main l the air tube l passes into the gas tube and is continued concentrically within the latter the gas and air tubes both have joints at m and m by means of the bar n which has a counterpoise to keep the moving parts in position the tubes can be brought from or toward the mouth of the pot so as to make it free of access to the workman with a key fitting on the stem n the tubes can be turned in m so as to give the currents of gas and air a more or less oblique direction to screen the workmen from the heat of the pot a disk of iron o lined with fire clay on the side next the pot is fitted to the end of the tubes illustration apparatus for mechanical puddling before running the metal into the pot the latter must be heated to such a degree that the slag lining is pasty or semifluid at its surface generally an hour and a half will be spent in heating with gas to this point there should be sufficient live coal in the pot when the gas is first let in to keep up its combustion should it be extinguished by excess of air or gas it must be relit as soon as the pot begins to get red hot the full heat can be put on the gas generator is tended in the usual way with the ordinary precautions to keep ashes and dust out of the gas tube lumps of charcoal are heaped up to the height of the top of the flue the wind pressure for the generator was 33 to 41 millimeters of mercury that of the wind for the combustion of the gas at finspong the blast is not heated being only 16 millimeters the pressure of the gas in the tube near the pot was 62 millimeters of mercury the method of working viewed chemically does not sensibly differ from puddling although giving as good perhaps better results at a much less cost there are three principal periods in the operation 1 the period before boiling 2 the boiling itself 3 the end of the boiling and the formation of balls when cast metal is poured into the pot a shovelful or two of refinery slag is added the temperature of the bath is thus brought down it thickens and boils the pot revolving at the rate of 30 or 40 revolutions a minute the metal is worked with a rabble either to cool it or to get the slag to incorporate with it as is done in puddling note must be taken of the temperature of the melted metal and that of the pot at the moment of charging the heat during working being regulated accordingly by increasing or diminishing the inflow of air and gas when circumstances are favorable boiling begins five minutes after the metal is run into the pot and it lasts about ten minutes boiling having begun the batch swells the iron forms granulates and seems to cling to the rabble and the sides of the pot the rotation of the pot is continued as well as the working to separate out parts which are not yet refined but no more cold cinder is put in while boiling goes on the temperature is regulated so that the pig does not cling to the side of the pot during a complete revolution but so that the particles next the side fall back into the bath when the side comes uppermost in the revolution the heat is raised a little when the iron can be felt by the rabble to be completely refined when shining lumps make their appearance in the bath and the iron begins to cling to the walls at the moment therefore that the temperature is brought to its highest point and the iron begins to agglutinate the rotation of the pot should be stopped and either immediately or after the delay of a couple of minutes it is removed if the iron does not ball well it is not completely refined and the pot may be started again if the iron is firm enough already the isolated particles are exposed to the hottest flame possible the blast being carried to its maximum the refining is thus completely finished and all the particles are agglomerated the mobility of the gas tube at m is of advantage in this operation it is sometimes useful to start the pot again to round up the puddled ball but it is best if this has been formed with the rabble the iron from a charge of 75 kilos of pig may be divided with advantage into a couple of balls a third may be made of the iron separated from the walls of the pot to get out the balls the pot is lowered and the workmen use tongs pointed rabble and hooked bar if things have gone well the balls ought to come out soft at a welding heat filled with cinder like puddled balls but a little more resisting and solid under the hammer they are forged into bars and these are at once passed to the rolls if nothing hinders the balling and shingling these operations will not consume more than fifteen minutes photographic engraving scamonis process is as follows the original drawings are carefully touched up so that the whites are as pure and the blacks as intense as possible and then the negative is taken in the ordinary way the plate being backed in the camera with damp red blotting paper to prevent reflection from the camera or back of the plate the negative is developed in the ordinary manner intensified by mercuric chloride and varnished a positive picture is taken in the camera the negative being carefully screened from any light coming between it and the lens this is intensified by pyrogallic acid and afterward washed with a pure water to which a little ammonia has been added it is then immersed in mercuric chloride for half an hour and again intensified with pyrogallic acid this is repeated several times when the intensity of the lines is considerable the plate is well washed treated with potassium iodide and finally with ammonia the image successively appearing yellow green brown and then violet brown the plate is then thoroughly drained and the image is treated successively with a solution of platinic chloride auric chloride ferrous sulphate and finally by pyrogallic acid which has the property of solidifying the metallic deposits the metallic relief thus obtained is dried over a spirit lamp and covered with an excessively thin varnish this varnish which is evidently a special preparation retains sufficient tackiness to hold powdered graphite on its surface the bronze powder now used may be employed instead which is dusted on in the usual manner after giving the plate a border of wax it is placed in an electrotyping bath and a perfect facsimile in intaglio is obtained from which prints may be taken in a printing press a new deep sea thermometer perhaps some of our readers may have seen a description of a form of thermometer devised by mm negretti and zambra for the purpose of ascertaining the temperature of the ocean at great depths this consisted of a tube bent into the shape of a siphon which when it had reached the desired depth was made by means of an ingenious arrangement to pour all the mercury found above a certain point near the reservoir into the second arm of the siphon this second arm which like the other was a capillary tube carried a scale of divisions on which might be read the temperature of the depths to which the instrument had been lowered this thermometer gave all the results that might have been expected the ship challenger during its polar expedition had on board a certain number of these instruments the report of capt g s nares made to the english admiralty describes all the benefits that we may hope to reap from a serious study of the temperature of the ocean at different depths and not the least of these are those that pertain to the fishery interest notwithstanding the good results given by this instrument its inventors have endeavored to render it still more practical and more within the reach of all by diminishing the cost of construction and increasing its compactness illustration fig 1 fig 2 fig 3 new thermometer for obtaining the temperature of the ocean at great depths fig 1 represents the thermometer isolated from its case it is an ordinary thermometer furnished at a with a little device that m negretti has already made use of in the construction of his larger instrument and which allows the liquid to run from the reservoir into the capillary tube when the temperature rises without letting it flow back when it lowers if moreover the precaution has been taken to incline the tube slightly reservoir upward at b there is a bulge in the tube in which a certain quantity of mercury may lodge this bulge is placed in such a way that the mercury resulting from the dilatation of the reservoir may come to it and continue its ascension in the capillary tube when the reservoir is down the thermometer being vertical but cannot get out when the reservoir is upward we should add that these thermometers are constructed so as to give the variations of temperature within determined limits the small reservoir b is indispensable to the well working of the apparatus for in seeking the temperature at a certain depth the instrument may on being drawn up pass through warmer strata and it is necessary therefore to provide the reservoir with a means of diffusing the small quantity of mercury resulting from this excess of temperature the tube has also a small bulge at its upper extremity at c the thermometer is placed in a small wooden case having a double bottom throughout its length in this double bottom are placed a certain number of lead balls that can run from one end of the case to the other and of sufficient weight to render the instrument buoyant in sea water to use the apparatus one end of a cord is passed through a hole in the case under the reservoir of the thermometer and the other end is tied to the sounding line at a certain distance from the lead fig 2 while the line is descending the thermometer will remain reservoir downward fig 2 but when it is again drawn up the thermometer case will take the position indicated in fig 3 and the column of mercury breaking at a will fall into the capillary tube the divisions of which as will be seen at fig 1 are reversed as to the thermometer itself it is important to protect it against the pressure which becomes so considerable at great depths to do this the reservoir is surrounded by an envelope of thick glass about three quarters full of mercury the mercury serves to transmit the temperature to the reservoir and should the exterior envelope yield to the effects of pressure the reservoir proper would not be affected the mercury not exactly filling the annular part which surrounds it new inventions george e palmer of cedar rapids iowa has patented an improved ironing board on which the garments may be held in stretched state while being smoothed with the irons and readily adjusted thereon to any required degree of tension by a simple attachment

unfastened and is easily and quickly fastened and unfastened even with cold or gloved hands the downer well at corry pa is now down over 1300 feet and an oil bearing sand has been struck of about five feet thickness illustration communications in gothic script our patent law to the editor of the scientific american while i cannot handle this subject with any master talent nor afford to devote the time which should be given to so important a subject before expressing an opinion yet i can less afford to keep quiet and allow shrewd avarice to manipulate or titled ignorance to legislate my property out of existence property there is no property in patents i often hear said and how about the invention covered by a patent is that property a large majority of people may say no and deny the justice of a patent law on the contrary i as an inventor think an invention is genuine property and as such should be under the same protection in common law as all other property instead of requiring a special law by which the people magnanimously grant me the privilege for a short time of using what was never theirs what they never knew of until i brought it into existence but what is real property and by what title is it held mother earth from which we sprung by which we exist and to which we return is without question real estate how is it obtained how held history answers by conquest by subjugation but these words conquest and subjugation have a more significant meaning than the spoiling of one people by another they are the actual price of possession he who toiling subjugates the soil is undoubted owner of its production by virtue of the highest blessing on recordby the sweat of thy brow shalt thou obtain bread and this principle is so far acknowledged that the laborer holds a lien on the product of his labor even though the property belongs to another mr a has an unpromising piece of land on which he would like to raise corn he analyzes the soil experiments upon it chemically reads up on the properties and components of corn the effects of fertilizers and acids upon the soil and makes himself a fool and laughingstock generally among his neighbors because he steps out of the beaten track by which they have succeeded in making the ground barren he does not have much success the first year and is sympathizingly consoled with i told you so but he perseveres and wins the reputation of being visionary and as stubborn as a mule in the meantime he becomes more familiar with his subject sees more clearly the requirements of the case finds he must post himself more thoroughly in certain branches of science in order to conduct his experiments wrestles with this obstacle and that and finally discovers a fertilizer based on some natural law of rotation and produces a crop of corn never before equaled now his neighbors come out with this very intelligent question how did you happen to think of it and they further very condescendingly remark that is a rousing crop i guess ill try the same thing myself how did you say you mixed the stuff this man is the true conqueror he has endured privation and scorn fought obstacles and in subduing them has eliminated a new principle in agriculture that is an engine of power to all generations shall his crops be his only reward shall they who laughed him to scorn step into his reward without sharing the labor that produced it this is a simile for thousands of inventions only that the inventor is seldom situated to plant the corn on his own land and reap the harvest then which of you will say that he has not a just lien on every mans crop raised by his process for a per cent of the gains thereby there is a bill before congress favoring a periodical taxation of patents under the pretext of removing useless patents from the path of later inventors let me show you how one inventor looks at that my neighbor has a vacant lot on which he is unable to build but joined to mine it would increase the value of my property vastly now cant you legislate that old heap of rubbish into my possession somehow of course he is waiting for the rise of property around him to sell his lot well but cant you make that appear unnatural and that he is a dog in the manger it is also said that sharpers get control of old patents and lay an embargo on legitimate business i reply first no one could be damaged by the owner of a patent unless he infringed that owners right second if he does infringe it shows that said patent is valuable otherwise he need not infringe and if valuable why should not he pay for it mr b in the employ of mr c watches the machine he uses and spends his leisure hours in working out an improvement which he patents and offers to c for sale but as the invention is useless except as attached to cs machine he thinks b cant help himself and adopts the improvement without paying for it when a few years have built up a great industry and c is rich from his spoils b steps in with a few friends at his back incorporated especially to make c shell out of course this is bad and ought to be legislated against if it were not valuable c need not use it it is not becoming to the congress of a great nation to spend its time in legislating worthless patents out of existence all such will die a natural death and if there is sufficient worth in any patent to claim your consideration the inventor is entitled to its price whether he waits four years or fifteen for his pay i speak of myself not as an individual but as representing in this letter a class without whose achievements america in her proud length and breadth could not today have been for the last half of my past life over twenty years i have been an inventor schooled in adversity accustomed to disappointment sometimes successful enjoying no luxuries but the conquest of obstacles and often forced to simple pursuits to keep the pot boiling yet i expect to spend the rest of my life inventing feeling strong in the school of experience and hoping for such prosperity as will enable me to work out some of the larger problems in view if those in power would really aid the inventor let them increase his facilities for information circulate the patent office gazette at one dollar a year a nominal subscription to insure bona fide readers and pay the balance out of the patent office surplus now accumulated this both to educate and to save inventors from going over old ground bringing more talent up to the standard of today lessen rather than increase patent office fees enable the commissioner to give the strictest possible examination on every application for a patent that when issued it shall bear a bona fide value by retaining the most competent examiners at a salary adequate to keep them reduce the cumbrous machinery of patent litigation to about this text in two headings first is plaintiff the first inventor allow one month to find that out if not disproved in that time allow it second does defendant infringe allow one month to decide that if not proven discharge the case with cost to plaintiff if proved cost and damage to be settled by defendant in thirty days the ability of wealthy corporations to absorb with impunity the product of all talent within their reach and put off the day of reckoning until plaintiff is swallowed in cost is the greatest present discouragement to inventors our patent law is now better than any amendment yet proposed will leave it if you must tinker over it remember all laws are for protection of the weak the bulldog does not need law to take the bone from the spaniel just in proportion as you damage the patent law you destroy the accomplishments and purpose of my life therefore i have spoken so could a thousand more w x stevens east brookfield mass the edison carbon telephone and hughes microphone to the editor of the scientific american mr edison finds a resemblance between his carbon telephone and my microphone i can find none whatever the microphone in its numerous forms that i have already made and varied by many others since is simply the embodiment of a discovery i have made in which i consider the microphone as the first step to new and perhaps more wonderful applications i have proved that all bodies solid liquid and gaseous are in a state of molecular agitation when under the influence of sonorous vibrations no matter if it is a piece of board walls of a house street fields or woods sea or air all are in this constant state of vibration which simply becomes more evident as the sonorous vibrations are more powerful this i have proved by the discovery that when two or more electrical conducting bodies are placed in contact under very slight constant pressure resting on any body whatever they will of themselves transform a constant electrical current into an undulatory current representing in its exact form the vibrations of the matter on which it reposes it requires no complicated arrangement and no special material and to most experimenters the three simple iron nails that i have described form the best and most sensitive microphone but these contact points would soon oxidize so naturally i prefer some conducting material which will not oxidize mr edisons carbon telephone represents the principle of the varying pressure of a diaphragm or its equivalent on a button of carbon varying the amount of electricity in accordance with this change of pressure it represents no field of discovery and its uses are restricted to telephony the three nails i have spoken of will not only do all and that far better than edisons carbon telephone in telephony but has the power of taking up sounds inaudible to human ears and rendering them audible in fact a true microphone besides it has the merit of demonstrating the molecular action which is constantly occurring in all matter under the influence of sonorous vibrations here we have certainly no resemblance in form materials or principles to mr edisons telephone the carbon telephone represents a special material in a special way to a special purpose the microphone demonstrates and represents the whole field of nature the whole world of matter is suitable to act upon and the whole of the electrical conducting materials are suitable to its demonstrations the one represents a patentable improvement the other a discovery too great and of too wide bearing for any one to be justified in holding it by patent and claiming as his own that which belongs to the worlds domain london july 2 1878 d e hughes new industrial enterprises the increasing wealth of a nation as well as the profitable and steady employment of its capital and people depends upon a continual increase of the producing power whenever there are latent resources undeveloped or opportunities for establishing the first foundation of an industry leading as it will to the originating of hundreds of auxiliary ones an unusual effort should be made to bring it into existence if in the power of individuals to accomplish so much the better if needing an association with state or national influence then this association should be formed it is incumbent upon individuals that they possess a sufficient pride in the prosperity of the country to give every possible attention and assistance to a careful practical demonstration of the feasibility of all the new industrial enterprises which may be presented with reasonable assurance of final success not in a great expenditure of money influence is better than money and a potential interest in a new enterprise is often better than capital the industrial resources of the united states are by no means worked to their full capacity the people by no means make all they consume the finer articles of use and requiring much labor and often the highest skill are imported from foreign nations a premium of 10000 offered for an improved method in any known present process of production or manufacture would be almost sure to be called for while america exports 175000000 worth of raw cotton annually to be worked up by other people is it not possible to so increase the manufacture in america as to keep the greater part of that raw material and to export the cloth instead is it not practicable to establish great numbers more of sugar estates in the same tropical climate is it not practicable to lay the foundation of half a dozen beet sugar mills in the country to begin the weaving of linen goods and to teach our farmers that they may produce all the flax fiber as fast as required to start a ramie industry in a small way and teach the process to those who will engage in it will not our silk men put a velvet industry into operation as a germ from which a future industry may grow and we might name a hundred other lesser enterprises which have hardly name in this country but every one of which is needed and will add to the wealth of the people replanting and transplanting teeth dr g r thomas of detroit in the current number of the dental cosmos states that this operation of replanting has become so common with him and the results so uniformly satisfactory that he does not hesitate to perform it on any tooth in the mouth if the case demands it and he finds the cases that demand it and the number that he operates upon continually multiplying he makes it a point to examine the end of the roots of nearly all his cases of abscessed teeth and a record of more than 150 cases with but one loss and that in the mouth of a man so timid that he utterly refused to bear the pain which nearly always follows for a few minutes therefore necessitating reextraction convinces him that the operation is not only practical but decidedly beneficial to both patient and operator for one sitting is all that he has ever really found necessary to the full and complete restoration of the case in the present article however dr thomas states that it is his object not so much to speak of replanting as of transplanting which he has reason to believe is just as practical so far as the mere reattachment is concerned as is replanting he details in illustration a case in which he successfully performed the operation inserting in the mouth of a gentleman who had lost a right superior cuspidate a solid and healthy tooth that he had removed from a ladys mouth four weeks previously he opened into canal and pulp chamber of the tooth from the apex of the root only cut the end off one eighth of an inch it being that much too long reduced the size somewhat in the center of the root it being a trifle larger than the root extracted filled and placed it in position he states that the occlusion shape and color were perfect so much so that several dentists who saw the case were not able to distinguish the transplanted tooth from the others the two features in the case that he calls particular attention to are first that although the tooth had been in his office four weeks there is today no perceptible change in color and second that the reattachment is as perfect as though it had been transplanted or replanted the same day of extraction the operation was performed about three months ago dr thomas knows of but two obstacles in the way of the perfect practicability of transplanting first the difficulty of obtaining the proper teeth at the proper time and second the possibility of inoculation the latter is the more formidable of the two and to escape the ills that might follow the greatest caution is necessary the first difficulty is more easily gotten over for it is not necessary that the tooth transplanted should correspond exactly in shape and size to the one extracted if it is too large it may be carefully reduced or if too small new osseous deposit will supply the deficiency neither is it necessary as we have seen that the transplanted tooth should be a freshly extracted one as a demonstration of what modern dental surgery is capable of performing dr thomas statements are very interesting it is doubtful however whether popular prejudice will allow this practice of transplanting to become of much use american institute exhibition for fortyseven years the american institute of new york has opened its doors and invited american inventors and manufacturers to exhibit their productions and again this year it renews its invitation to all to such as wish to reach the capitalist and consumer they must admit that new york is the place for details apply to the general superintendent by mail or otherwise on the 22d of june cloud bursts occurred in the mountains northeast of san buenaventura cal causing the ventura river to pour down such a volume of muddy water that the ocean was discolored for a distance of six miles the distillation of coal bituminous coal of which there are several varieties is the best suited for the production of coal gas the newcastle coal is principally used in the manufacture of london gas scotch parrot coal produces a superior gas but the coke produced is of inferior quality boghead coal is also used for gas makingin fact every kind of coal except anthracite may be used for this purpose the bituminous shale produces a very good gas and it is used partly to supply the place of cannel or parrot coal as carbon and hydrogen principally with oxygen are the elements from which gas is formed most substances containing these elements can be partially converted into gas and gas has been made from grease or kitchen waste oil peat rosin and wood besides coal a ton of newcastle or caking coal yields about 9000 cubic feet of gas scotch coal about 11000 english cannel about 10000 and shale about 7000 with illuminating powers in the ratio of about 13 25 22 and 36 respectively the coal is put in retorts r commonly made of fire clay and often of cast iron these retorts are from 6 feet to 9 feet long and from 1 foot to 1 foot 8 inches in breadth they are made like the letter d elliptical cylindrical or bean shaped they are built into an arched oven and heated by furnaces f beneath one three five seven or more are built in the same oven the mouthpieces are of cast iron and project outward from the oven so as to allow ascension pipes a p to be fixed to convey the gas generated from the coal to the hydraulic main h m after the coal has been introduced into the retorts their mouths are closed with lids luted round the edges with clay and kept tight by a screw the retorts are kept at a bright red heat if the temperature be too low less gas and more tar are produced less residue being left while should the temperature be too high the product is more volatile more residue remaining and should the gas remain for any length of time in contact with the highly heated retort it is partially decomposed carbon being deposited thereby lessening the illuminating power and choking up the retort and more carbon disulphide is produced at a high temperature the object is to maintain a medium temperature in order to obtain a better gas having the greatest illuminating power in about four or five hours the coal in the retort will have given off all its gas the mouth of the retort is opened and the coke is raked out into large iron vessels and extinguished by water a fresh charge is immediately introduced by means of a long scoop in the cherryred retort and the door luted to the ascension pipes which convey the gas from the retorts pass straight up for a few feet then turn round forming an arch then pass downward into the hydraulic main beneath the level of the liquid contained in it and bubble up through the liquid into the upper portion of the main on commencing the main is half filled with water but after working some time this water is displaced by the fluid products of distillation in this way the opening into each retort is closed so that a charge can be withdrawn and replaced without interfering with the action of the other retorts and pipes the liquid tar ammoniacal water and gas pass from the end e of the hydraulic main down through the pipe p and the liquid falls down into the tar well t w while the crude gas goes on into the chest c partially filled with the liquid so that the plates p p from the top dip into it to within a few inches of the bottom these dip plates are placed in the chest so as to separate the openings into each pair of condensing pipes c c so that the gas passing into the chest finds no exit except up c1 and down c2 and there being no dip plate between c2 and c3 it passes up c3 and down c4 and as there is no dip plate to prevent its progress it passes up c5 and down c6 into the lime or iron purifiers l i the condensers are kept cool by exposure to the atmosphere and are often cooled by a stream of water from a tank above the gas cools quickly and liquids passing along with the gas in a state of vapor are condensed and fall into the chest and pass by an overflow pipe into the tar well the purifier is a cast iron vessel l i containing a number of perforated shelves s1 s1 s1 on which slaked lime to the depth of about 4 inches or much greater thickness of iron oxide and sawdust is placed the gas passes up through the shelves s s s and down through the shelves s1 s1 s1 through the pipe g into the gas holder and from thence through the pipe m to the main pipe the lime abstracts carbonic anhydride sulphureted hydrogen cyanogen naphthalin and a portion of the ammonia but not carbon disulphide which latter may be absorbed by passing the gas through a solution of sodic hydrate and plumbic oxide mixed with sawdust gas containing cs2 on burning produces h2so4 which injures books and furniture in rooms however the quantity of cs2 in gas is generally so minute as to be practically uninjurious by a proper regulation of the temperature during distillation the quantity produced is infinitesimal when the lime is saturated it is removed and fresh supplied but the iron after use can be reconverted into oxide by exposure to the atmosphere and used repeatedly when iron is used a separate lime purifier is necessary to remove carbonic anhydride the last traces of ammonia are removed before passing to the gas holder by passing the gas through dilute sulphuric acid or up through the interior of a tower having perforated shelves covered with coke in small pieces through which a constant supply of fresh water percolates this washing removes some of the more condensable hydrocarbons and lessens the illuminating power of the gas before the gas passes from the condensers into the purifiers it passes through a kind of pump termed an exhauster driven by steam power this action relieves the retorts from the pressure of the gas passing through the hydraulic main etc it diminishes the deposit of graphite in the retorts and lessens leakage in them should there be any flaws it also has the beneficial effect of producing a gas of a higher illuminating power since the relief of pressure in the retorts produces a more favorable condition of combustion illustration the distillation of coal the following are some of the bodies

english mechanic a short history of petroleum the lumbermans gazette gives the following short history of petroleum the production of petroleum as an article of trade dates from the 28th of august 1859 when colonel drake in a well 69 feet deep struck oil and coined a phrase that will last as long as the english language from that beginning it has increased to an annual production of 14500000 barrels of crude oil the first export was in 1861 of 27000 barrels valued at 1000000 and the export of petroleum in the year 1877 was in round numbers 62000000 the annual product of petroleum todaycrude and refinedis greater in value than the entire production of iron and is more than double that of the anthracite coal of the state of pennsylvania and exceeds the gold and silver product of the whole country as an article of export it is fourth and contests closely for the third rank our leading exports are relatively as follows cotton annually from 175000000 to 227000000 flour from 69000000 to 130000000 pork and its products bacon ham and lard from 57000000 to 82000000 and petroleum from 48000000 to 62000000 the total export of petroleum from 1861 to and including 1877 16 years has been 442698968 custom house valuation from the best sources of information there are at this time 10000 oil wells producing and drilling which at a cost of 5000 per well would make an investment of 50000000 in this branch of the business tankage now existing of a capacity of 6000000 barrels cost 2000000 and 7000000 has been invested in about 2000 miles of pipe lines connected with the wells the entire investment for the existing oil production including purchase money of territory is something over 100000000 which amount cannot be lessened much if any for as wells cease to produce new ones have been constantly drilled to take their place minute forms of life the rev w h dallinger lately delivered a lecture at the royal institution descriptive of the recent researches of dr drysdale and himself the object of the lecture was mainly to explain the method of research which had been employed the first essays of the opticians to produce high powers were as might be expected feeble these powers amplified but did not analyze hence it began to be questioned whether one could see more really with a high power than with a moderate one and this was true at the time but it is not so now the optician has risen to the emergency and provided us with powers of great magnifying capacity which carry an equivalent capacity for analysis they open up structure in a wonderful way when rightly used the lecturer began by projecting upon the screen the magnified image of a wasps stingan object about the 120th of an inch in natural sizeand beside it was placed a piece of the point of a cambric sewing needle of the same length magnified to the same extent the details of the sting were very delicate and refined but the minute needle point became riven and torn and blunt under the powerful analysis of the lens showing what the lecturer meant by magnifying power not mere enlargement but the bringing out of details infinitely beyond us save through the well made lens this was further illustrated by means of the delicate structure of the radiolaria and still further by means of a rarely delicate valve of the diatom known as n rhomboides with a magnification of 600 diameters no structure of any kind was visible but by gradually using 1200 1800 and 2400 diameters it was made manifest how the ultimate structure of this organic atom displayed itself but this power of analysis was carried still further by means of the minutest known organic form bacterium termo the lecturer had in connection with dr drysdale discovered that the movements of this marvelously minute living thing were effected by means of a pair of fine fibers or flagella these were so delicate as to be invisible to everything but the most powerful and specially constructed lenses and the most delicate retinas but since this discovery dr koch of germany had actually photographed the flagella of much larger bacteria such as bacillus subtilis and expressed his conviction that the whole group was flagellate mr dallinger determined then to try to measure the diameter of this minute flagellum of b termo that the real power of magnification in our present lenses might be tested this was a most difficult task but 200 measurements were made with four different lenses and the results were for the mean of the first 50 measurements 000000489208 for the second 000000488673 for the third 000000488024 for the fourth 000000488200 giving a mean value for the whole expressed in vulgar fractions of the 1204700 of an inch as the diameter of the flagellum of b termo with such power of analysis it was manifest that immense results might be expected from a good use of the highest powers the proper method of using them was next dwelt on and then the apparatus was described by means of which a drop of fluid containing any organism that was being studied might be prevented from evaporating while under the scrutiny of the most powerful lenses and for an indefinite length of time the importance of studying such organisms in this wayby continuous observationwas then plainly shown some of the peculiar inferences of dr bastian as to the transmutation of bacteria into monads and monads into amoeb etc being explained by discontinuity of observation wages in england consul general badeau reports that during the past five years wages have increased gradually about 10 per cent

m bouchut has recently introduced to the notice of the members of the acadmie des sciences a cuirasse of vulcanized caoutchouc which he has used with success for the treatment of cancerous and other tumors of the breast in this country there has been much division of opinion upon the utility of pressure in the treatment of cancer some surgeons regarding it as harmful or but rarely useful others attributing to it great retardation of the rapidity of growth of the tumor or even cure the surgeons of middlesex hospital studied it systematically some years ago and gave an unfavorable report the theory of the plan is certainly good a neoplasia like a healthy tissue is dependent upon its blood supply for vitality and growth and complete anmia causes the death of a tumor as it does of a patch of brain substance it will be remembered that mr haward last year related at the clinical society a case in point he ligatured the left lingual artery for a recurrent epithelioma of the tongue the tumor sloughed away and a fortnight before the patients death from blood poisoning the tongue was quite healed in just the same way ischmia will impair the vitality and so lessen the growth of a tumor the difficulty is rather in the practical application of this theory the knowledge that we now possess of the mode of growth of cancers gives us at least one important indication if we have to deal with a neoplasia that grows at the periphery by gradual infiltration of the surrounding tissues it is plain that for pressure to be useful it must be applied around the tumor rather than over it where by compressing and obstructing the capillaries it would cause overfullness of those at the circumference it is the periphery of a cancer that is its active part and we must therefore produce ischmia around and not in the tumor in the application of the treatment this must be obtained by the careful adjustment of elastic pads or cotton wool and as the whole success of the plan depends upon the skill with which this is done too much attention cannot be given to it we cannot regard pressure as a substitute for removal of a cancer but in the frequent cases where this is impracticable it appears to be the best substitute at present open to the surgeon m bouchuts cuirasse would seem to be an improvement upon the spring pads and other appliances in use in this countrylancet new cutting and boring attachment for lathes our engraving represents a useful little machine which is intended for attachment to lathes although it is exceedingly simple it is capable of performing a great variety of work the machine is used in two ways either by attachment to a rigid support as shown in fig 1 or by suspending it by a belt so that it is capable of universal motion as shown in fig 2 the supporting frame a has three boxes for the spindle b and on the shaft at one side of the middle box there are planing knives c on the opposite side there is a balance wheel and a pulley for receiving the driving belt the spindle b extends beyond the ends of the frame a and has at each end a socket for receiving interchangeable cutting and boring tools one end of the spindle is externally threaded to receive a face plate to which may be attached a disk of wood for receiving sandpaper for smoothing and polishing wood or metal the frame a is held to its work by means of handles a and the spindle is driven by a round belt that passes over a suspended pulley e and also over the pulley on the lathe mandrel the entire attachment is balanced by a weight f attached to a cord that passes over a fixed pulley f to the pulley e to which it is secured by a swivel hook that permits of turning the belt in any direction the belt is guided by small pulleys h so that the device may be turned without running the belt from the pulley on the spindle guides g are attached to the frame a for guiding the material being operated upon by the planing knives the frame a may be supported by attachment to an arm i at the lower end of the screwacted follower j which slides in a rigid support k the arm i has a notched disk which is engaged by a spring detent which holds the frame at any desired inclination among the kinds of work that may be done on this machine may be mentioned shaping and edging fluting and beading table legs balusters etc dovetailing boring carving paneling shaping or friezing mouldings scroll or fret work inlaying and engraving blind stile mortising and blind slat planing by changing the inclination of the spindle different varieties of mouldings may be produced by the same cutter the machine may be used as an emery grinder and it may also be used for drilling and shaping metals for further information address mathew rice augusta ga decrease of the new york rainfall in his report for 1876 director draper of the new york meteorological observatory in central park showed that a careful examination of the records in his office proved that there had been in late years a change in the rainfall of new york and its vicinity affecting seriously its water supply the decrease had been steady since 1869 previous to which there had been an increase in his report for 1877 mr draper discusses the question whether the change continues or is likely to continue in the same direction and comes to the conclusion that the rainfall of new york will most probably continue to decrease by fluctuations for several years to come also that the variations are very nearly the same in the two portions of the year the division date being july 1 new steam valve the improved valve shown partly in section in the engraving is designed for removing the water of condensation from steam pipes so that dry steam may be furnished illustration saunders steam valve in the engraving the globe valve a is of the usual form except that the casing below the valve seat is enlarged forming a pocket b which communicates through an aperture at the bottom with a small valve c the steam in passing through the valve fills the pocket and there deposits any water that may have condensed from the steam in its passage through the steam pipe the increased depth of the lower portion of the valve prevents siphoning which takes place in valves of the ordinary form the valve c is kept slightly open to discharge the water at the moment it collects in the pocket the water is thus prevented from passing onward to the engine or other point of use illustration cutting and boring attachment for lathes this valve affords a ready means of supplying dry steam to sulphuric acid chambers we are informed that by its use a chamber in ordinary working order will produce acid 3 to 5 baum stronger than can be obtained with ordinary globe valves thirty steam pipes arranged at different points are found to deliver into a chamber in the space of five minutes from 4 to 16 ounces of condense water according to the circumstances of distance temperature of the air size of pipe etc these valves being placed close to the chamber separating all the condense water deliver with certainty uniformly dry steam without the inconvenience of ordinary steam traps or other expensive appliances this valve was patented through the scientific american patent agency may 21 1878 for further particulars address mr joseph saunders 975 third avenue brooklyn n y a hint from the mormons exgovernor hendricks in a recent industrial address alluded to the highly prosperous condition of the mormons as existing previous to the influx of the gentiles into utah saying that to the fact that they produced all they consumed i attribute their wonderful prosperity this remark associated with the prosperity of other communities in different parts of the country would suggest the query of why the principle cannot be more largely applied to the whole nation certainly the resources of the whole country would indicate a much greater diversity of production and if there was the same regard for a uniform building up of our industrial system there would seem to be need of but little importation certainly of goods which can be readily made and which our people need the labor to produce new agricultural inventions joseph george of springfield greene co mo has patented an improved form of cultivator or shovel plow designed to be convertible into either a single double or triple shovel plow as occasion may require it consists in two detachable clamping plates which hold the plow beams and their arrangement with respect to the said beams and the handles of the plow whereby a single bolt is made to secure the forward ends of the handles and clamp the plates to hold the plow beams in place russel o bean of macedonia miss is the inventor of an improved seed planter for planting cotton and other seeds and

has devised an improved machine for distributing poison upon potato plants to destroy the potato bug it may also be used for sowing seeds william v mcconnell and charles m dickerson of crockett texas have invented an improved fruit picker having cupshaped selfopening spring jaws attached to its handle and operated by a cord to close upon and clamp the fruit it also has a hollow extensible adjustable handle and a fruit receiver quick work two years ago a farmermiller and his wife at carrolton mo furnished some invited guests with bread baked in eight and a quarter minutes from the time the wheat was standing in the field this year it was determined to make still better time accordingly elaborate preparations were made to reap thrash grind and bake the grain with the least possible loss of time in 1 minute 15 seconds the wheat about a peck was cut and thrashed and put on the back of a swift horse to be carried to the mill 16 rods away in 2 minutes 17 seconds the flour was delivered to mrs lawton and in 3m 55s from the starting of the reaper the first griddle cake was done in 4 minutes 37 seconds from the starting of the reaper a pan of biscuits was delivered to the assembled guests after that according to the carrolton democrat other pans of delicious one minute biscuits were baked more at leisure and eagerly devoured with the usual accompaniment of boiled ham and speech making the rhinoceros hornbill illustration the rhinoceros hornbill there are many strange and wonderful forms among the feathered tribes but there are perhaps none which more astonish the beholder who sees them for the first time than the group of birds known by the name of hornbills they are all distinguished by a very large beak to which is added a singular helmetlike appendage equaling in size the beak itself in some species while in others it is so small as to attract but little notice on account of the enormous size of the beak and helmet the bird appears to be overweighted by the mass of horny substance which it has to carry but on closer investigation the whole structure is found to be singularly light and yet very strong the whole interior being composed of numerous honeycombed cells with very thin walls and wide spaces the walls being so arranged as to give very great strength when the bill is used for biting and with a very slight expenditure of material the greatest development of beak and helmet is found in the rhinoceros hornbill although there are many others which have these appendages of great size the beak varies greatly in proportion to the age of the individual the helmet being almost imperceptible when it is first hatched and the bill not very striking in dimensions the beak gains in size as the bird gains in strength in the adult the helmet and beak attain their full proportions it is said that a wrinkle is added every year to the number of the furrows found on the bill the object of the helmet is obscure but the probability is that it may aid the bird in producing the loud roaring cry for which it is so celebrated the hornbill is lively and active leaping from bough to bough with great lightness and appearing not to be in the least incommoded by its huge beak its flight is laborious and when in the air the bird has a habit of clattering its great mandibles together which together with the noise of the wings produces a weird sound the food of the hornbill seems to consist of both animal and vegetable matters we take our illustration from woods natural history saw tempering by natural gas beaver falls pa contains several gas wells at an average depth of eleven hundred feet yielding about 100000 cubic feet of gas every twentyfour hours this gas has been introduced into a large saw tempering furnace at that place in the works of emerson smith co the furnace is 8 feet wide by 14 feet long it is said to be a perfect success giving a uniform heat and there being no sulphur or impurity in the gas the steel is not deteriorated in the operation of heating the japanese building at the paris exhibition illustration the japanese building at the paris exhibition japan on the terrestrial globe lies furthest away in that direction beyond the far west of america and beyond the wide pacific the japanese structure has a simple and solid aspect resembling the portal of a halffortified mansion with massive timber frames at the sides but it is adorned with two handsome porcelain fountains and each of these is designed to represent the stump of a tree supporting a shell into which the water

building at albany new york the engines will be of the companys usual horizontal type with automatic cut off and will be elaborately finished the explosiveness of flour professors peck and peckham of the university of minnesota have been making an extensive series of experiments to determine the cause of the recent flour mill explosion at minneapolis the substances tested were coarse and fine bran material from stone grinding wheat wheat dust from wheat dust house middlings general mill dust dust from middlings machines dust from flour dust house from stones and flour when thrown in a body on a light all these substances put the light out blown by a bellows into the air surrounding a gas flame the following results were obtained coarse bran would not burn fine bran and flour dust burn quickly with considerable blaze middlings burn quicker but with less flame all the other substances burn very quickly very much like gunpowder in all these cases there was a space around the flash where the dust was not thick enough to ignite from particle to particle hence it remained in the air after the explosion flour dust flour middlings etc when mixed with air thick enough to ignite from particle to particle and separated so that each particle is surrounded by air will unite with the oxygen in the air producing a gas at high temperature which requires an additional space hence the bursting there is no gas which comes from flour or middlings that is an explosive it is the direct combination with the air that produces gas requiring additional space powerful electric sparks from the electric machine and from the leyden jar were passed through the air filled with dust of the different kinds but without an explosion in any case a platinum wire kept at a white heat by a galvanic battery would not produce an explosion the dust would collect upon it and char to black coals but would not blaze nor explode a piece of glowing charcoal kept hot by the bellows would not produce an explosion when surrounded by dust but when fanned into a blaze the explosion followed a common kerosene lantern when surrounded by dust of all degrees of density would not produce an explosion but when the dust was blown into the bottom through the globe and out of the top it would ignite to explode quickly the dust must be dry evidently when an explosion has been started in a volume of dusty air loose flour maybe blown into the air and made a source of danger new engineering inventions erskine h bronson of ottawa ontario canada has patented an improvement in automatic switches for railways which consists in an arrangement of sliding cams for moving the switch rails and in treadles to be operated by the pilot wheels of the locomotive and in intermediate mechanism for connecting the treadles with the switch operating cams the object being to provide a switch will be operated by the pilot wheels of the locomotive as it approaches the movable switch rails an improved refrigerator car has been patented by michael haughey of st louis missouri the object of this invention is to ventilate and cool railway cars used in the transportation of perishable articles this car has a novel ventilator and ice box and is provided with a new form of nonconducting walls crooked journalism in the english scientific journal engineering of june 21 1878 appears a six column article on edisons carbon telephone illustrated with ten engravings from mr prescotts recent work on the speaking telephone talking phonograph and other novelties the descriptions of the cuts and the rest of the information given so far as correct obviously come from the same source so far as correct unhappily for the honor of scientific journalism the writers desire is plainly not so much to do justice to truth as to exalt mr hughes at the expense of mr edison to this end he has studiously suppressed from mr prescotts description of the carbon telephone the points which establish mr edisons claim to the prior invention or discovery of everything involved in mr hughes microphone while he has as studiously dwelt upon those same points as constituting the peculiar merits of mr hughes work for example while he uses fig 21 of mr prescotts book he leaves out the very important little diagram numbered 20 it represents one form of the apparatus to which sir william thomson refers in the letter in which he says it is certain that at the meeting of the british association at plymouth last september a method of magnifying sound in an electric telephone was described as having been invented by mr edison which was identical in principle and in some details with that brought forward by mr hughes the figure looks altogether too much like one form of mr hughes microphone to allow of its use in an article intended to establish the novelty of mr hughes discovery the omissions from the text are quite as significant under the first cut used in engineering mr prescott says in the latest form of transmitter which mr edison has introduced the vibrating diaphragm is done away with altogether it having been found that much better results are obtained when a rigid plate of metal is substituted in its place the inflexible plate of course merely serves in consequence of its comparatively large area to concentrate a considerable portion of the sonorous waves upon the small carbon disk or button a much greater degree of pressure for any given effort of the speaker is thus brought to bear on the disk than could be obtained if only its small surface alone were used the engineering writer coolly suppresses this important statement he does worse he puts in its place the false statement that the essential principle of mr edisons transmitter consists in causing a diaphragm vibrating under the influence of sonorous vibrations to vary the pressure upon and therefore the resistance of a piece of carbon and so on a little further on while repeating mr edisons account of the experiments which led to the abandonment of the vibrating diaphragm page 226 of mr prescotts book the engineering writer drops out the following remark by mr edison i discovered that my principle unlike all other acoustical devices for the transmission of speech did not require any vibration of the diaphragmthat in fact the sound waves could be transformed into electrical pulsations without the movement of any intervening mechanism worse yet in the very face of mr edisons assertion to the contraryan assertion which he could not by any possibility have overlookedthis most unscientific journalist says mr edison finds it necessary to insert a diaphragm in all forms of his apparatus that being the mechanical contrivance employed by which sonorous vibrations are converted into variations of mechanical pressure and by which variations in the conductivity of the carbon or other material is insured on the other hand mr hughes employs no diaphragm at all the sonorous vibrations in his apparatus acting directly upon the conducting material or through whatever solid substance to which they may be attached in this way throughout the offending article the writer persistently robs edison to magnify hughes giving credit to mr hughes for exactly what he has suppressed from mr prescotts book to insist as he does that because mr edison covers his carbon button with a rigid iron plate in his very practical telephone therefore a vibrating diaphragm is an essential feature of mr edisons invention is a very shallow quibble in the face of mr edisons and mr prescotts statements that the carbon button acts precisely the same in the absence of such covering though not so strongly mr edisons laboratory records show a great variety of experiments in which the carbon was talked against without any intervening mechanism in a telephone for popular use however to be held in the hand turned upside down talked into exposed to dust and the weather it was obviously necessary to use some means for holding the carbon in place and to prevent its sensitiveness from being destroyed by dirt and the moisture of the breath when in use for this purpose a rigid iron partition seemed at once convenient and durable it is not in any sense a vibrating diaphragm with a persistence worthy of a better cause the engineering writer returns to the point he seems especially anxious to enforce toward the end of the article he says in every instrument described by mr edison the diaphragm is the ruling genie of the instrument professor hughes however has through his great discovery been enabled to show that variations of resistance can be imparted to an electrical current not only without a diaphragm but with very much better results when no such accessory is employed the animus of all this is only too apparent altogether the article is the most dishonest piece of writing we have ever seen in a scientific periodical and although the article appears in the editorial columns of engineering we prefer for the honor of scientific journalism to think that the management of that paper was not party to the rascally act it is more credible that a gross imposition has been practiced by some trusted member of the engineering staff or by some contributor whose position seemed to justify the acceptance of his utterances without any attempt at their verification it is well known here to whom in london at mr edisons request mr prescott sent proofs of the matter abused together with electros of the cuts used in engineering accordingly the burden of dishonor lies upon or between a prominent british official on the one hand and on the other a journal which cannot afford to leave the matter unexplained whoever is hurt we sincerely hope that the fair fame of scientific journalism for candor and honesty may come off unstained a more perfect production the highest skill in manufacture or in production of any kind is not yet the prevailing characteristic of american industry uniformity of production of whatever kind is of much greater importance than to attempt the manufacture of any grade for which the material or the tools the machinery or the knowledge of the workmen is not fitted the highest condition of product in any nation is to produce the finest or highest cost articles in the most perfect manner and to have material and machinery adopted and the skilled workmen so as to be able to so produce economically but until the master hand is satisfied of all the requisites for producing fine goods he should confine production to the best his facilities will make in the most perfect uniform manner samples of fine goods are shown all over the country every day and were consumers or merchants sure that the product would be the same there would be much less difficulty in introducing and more homemade goods used where now importations are depended upon the stevens crash mills import raw flax because it is to be had according to sample perfectly classified and saves the employment of skilled labor to assort and classify and of purchasing a great deal not wanted the manufacturers of edge tools and knives use imported steel because it is warranted and the warrant proves good while the uncertainty of american steel is such that a knife will often crack in tempering and cause the loss of labor worth ten times the difference in the price of the steel samples of alpacas and other dress goods are shown in our jobbing houses fully equal to any imported goods but the goods when received are quite often of various grades and imperfections of character the imperfect or second quality productions find sale but at a much lower price and are to be found at second rate places the imperfections slight and the goods perhaps generally quite as serviceable but not absolutely so and first class houses catering to those who pay highest prices cannot afford to have any other house carry better articles than they do the use of perfect appliances and the best material and the employment of the highest skill are not yet the first step and an absolute necessity as it should be in america the supply of such machinery material and labor can be had if those who propose to enter the production of first class articles will insist upon it and if such supplies are appreciated by the payment of their higher value the american standard of production is not the highest and it can be materially elevated and while as at present too many common articles are supplied the leading manufacturers should turn to producing finer the finest and in smaller quantities to take the place of many articles now imported and to supply the new market which such productions will always create in any country the wool product of the world from an interesting article on the wool trade of the pacific coast published in a recent number of the san francisco journal of commerce we learn that the number of sheep in the world is now estimated at from four hundred and eightyfour to six hundred millions of which the united states has about 36000000 and great britain the same number from 1801 to 1875 the wool clip of great britain and ireland increased from 94000000 to 325000000 pounds that of france has increased almost as rapidly though the wool is finer as a rule and hence the superiority of french cloths australia produces nearly as much wool as the parent countrygreat britain the united states product increased from very little at the beginning of the century to about 200000000 pounds at the present time of this california has produced about one fourth and the pacific coast as a whole almost one third if the ratio of growth shown in the past prevails in the future the day is not far distant when the pacific coast will produce at least one half the wool produced in the united states as not only california and oregon but also washington idaho montana utah and new mexico are well adapted to its production the wool clip of australia is about 284000000 pounds that of buenos ayres and the river plata 222500000 pounds other countries not previously given 463000000 pounds the total clip of the world last year was about 1497500000 pounds worth 150000000 this when scoured would yield about 852000000 pounds of clean wool street main joints at the annual meeting of the new england association of gas engineers mr thomas of williamsburg made the following remarks on this subject in my early experience with the williamsburg gaslight company with which i became connected in the year 1854 i found pretty nearly all the street mains that were laid were connected with cement joints while there is no doubt in my own mind that a joint can be made perfectly tight with cement i much prefer the lead joint another thing to be taken into consideration to keep tight joints is that the mains should be laid a sufficient depth under the surface to protect them from the action of severe frosts a great many of the mains were not more than 18 inches or 2 feet below the surface of the streets and at this depth in our climate it is a matter of impossibility to keep joints tight as the action of the frost in winter will displace the mains and cause the joints to leak from the bad manner in which our mains were laid and the cement joints leaking so much we could not afford to turn gas on during the day had we done so we should not have had any to supply the city at night and we were thus compelled to shut off the gas just as soon as there was any apology for daylight and keep it shut off as late as possible in the evening with the most careful working in this manner for a period of nine or twelve months our losses from leakage amounted to about 52 to 55 per cent of the gas manufactured a great part of this loss was caused by the cement joints leaking and also a part due to the fact that the mains were not at sufficient depth under the surface to protect them from the action of the frost as soon as we possibly could i went over the whole of our mains there was about 17 miles in all stripping them cutting out the cement and rejointing them with lead in one season we got the loss from leakage down to 20 per cent and this with the gas turned on during the 24 hours of the day one great objection to cement joints is the rigidity of them in cases where pipes have been disturbed by other excavations and settled i found in all cases that the mains were broken in a leading main from our old works with cement joints the main a 10inch one was broken entirely off and fractured lengthwise besides by the upheaval of the ground from frost in some of the same mains that we had rejointed with lead the mains were drawn apart drawing the lead out but with very little loss of gas as the gasket being driven in tight prevented any great leakage in cases of this kind the lead was easily driven back and the joint made perfectly tight again i have never in our city put in any street mains that i have not used lead in the joints and in laying mains we always make them gas tight with the gasket used at the present time we have over 90 miles of street mains laid and outside of our loss from street lamps we get paid for three foot burners and they average about 3 foot our loss from leakage will not exceed 6 per cent we have suffered severe loss of gas from sewering in our city in some cases where there are railroad tracks in the streets the sewers have been run on both sides of the street alongside and parallel with our pipes these excavations are much deeper than our mains lie and the earth is always filled in loosely and left to settle in cases of this kind whole blocks of mains were dragged down the pipe broken and the joints partially pulled apart at the same time the leakage from the joints was not so great the gasket preventing the leakage in laying street mains what you want particularly to attend to and especially in the east here where you have colder weather than we have we have not seen much winter until we came on here is to get them down under the surface a sufficient depth to protect them from the frost with us the least depth is 2 feet 9 inches under the surface of the street and i am confident could our mains remain in the ground as we put them down our loss from leakage by them would be very small indeed while as i stated in the beginning i have no doubt that a cement joint can be made tight i can see no benefit in using cement for the purpose as i consider lead far superior in accommodating itself to any upheaval or settling of the earth where the mains are laid down successful shad hatching professor j w milner who has charge of the shad hatching operations under the direction of the united states fish commissioner professor baird is now engaged in the preparation of the report of the work for the season just completed speaking of the work on the atlantic seaboard and the distribution of young fish the report says that at the salmon creek station on albemarle sound they obtained 12730000 eggs and turned out 3000000 young fish at the havre de grace station 12230000 eggs were obtained and 9575000 young fish were turned out about 6000000 young shad

or lemon verbena lippia citriodora seems to have other qualities to recommend it than those of the fragrance for which it is usually cultivated the author of a recent work entitled among the spanish people describes it as being systematically gathered in spain where it is regarded as a fine stomachic and cordial it is used either in the form of a cold decoction sweetened or five or six leaves are put into a teacup and hot tea poured upon them the author says that the flavor of the tea thus prepared is simply delicious and no one who has drunk his pekoe with it will ever again drink it without a sprig of lemon verbena and he further states that if this be used one need never suffer from flatulence never be made nervous or oldmaidish never have cholera diarrhea or loss of appetite a

made in 9 hours superior excellence of american goods the post of birmingham england remarks with regard to american competition that perhaps the most humiliating feature of the business for british manufacturers is the fact that their competitors are prevailing not through the cheapness but through the excellence of their goods time was when english workmanship ranked second to none and the names of our great manufacturing firms were a guarantee for the sterling quality of the goods they turned out but competitions trades unions piece work short hours and other incidents of the march of progress have altered all that complaints received by hardware merchants from their customers abroad are not confined to the goods of second class firms manufacturers who have obtained a worldwide reputation for their products are frequently convicted of sending out scamped and unfinished work and they do not venture to deny the impeachment pleading only that the most vigilant must be sometimes at fault and that their men unfortunately are not to be depended upon in other cases it is the merchants or their customers who are to blame for the inferior quality of the articles by cutting prices so low as to preclude the possibility of honest work thinking probably that anything is good enough for a foreign or colonial market but whatever the cause the fact is now undeniable that a great deal of the manufactured produce shipped from this country of late years has been of a very low standard and that the american manufacturers have consequently had an easy task in beating it petroleum oils as lubricators oils from petroleum are now produced suitable for nearly every mechanical process for which animal oils have heretofore been used not excepting those intended for cylinder purposes a serious objection attaching to the animal oils is present in petroleum if through the exhaust steam some of the oil be carried into the boiler foaming or priming is the consequence but the same thing happening in the case of petroleum is rather a benefit than otherwise for it not only does not cause foaming but it prevents incrustation or adhesion of the scale or deposit and this aids in the preservation of the boiler and is perhaps the best preventive of the many everywhere suggested often in removing the cylinder head and the plate covering the valves of an engine we see evidences of corrosion or action on the surfaces differing entirely from ordinary wear and the engineer is generally at a loss how to account for it according to the general impression grease or animal oil is the preservative of the metal and is the last thing suspected of being the cause of its general disintegration the reason of this is that vegetable and animal oils consist of fatty acids such as stearic magaric oleic etc they are combined with glycerin as a base and under ordinary conditions are neutrals to metals generally and on being applied they keep them from rusting by shielding them from the action of air and moisture but in the course of time the influence of the air causes decomposition and oxidation the oils become rancid as it is called which is acid and they act on the metals what happens at the ordinary temperature slowly goes on rapidly in the steam cylinder where a new condition is reached the oils are subjected to the heat of high pressure steam which dissociates or frees these acids from their base and in this condition they attack the metal and hence destroy it this applies as well to vegetable as to oils of animal origin fish or sperm oil included petroleum and oils derived therefrom generally called mineral oils are entirely free from this objection petroleum contains no oxygen and hence it cannot form an acid and therefore cannot attack metal it is entirely neutral and so bland that it may be and is used medicinally as a dressing to wounds and badly abraded surfaces where cerates of ordinary dressing would give paincoal trade journal influence of light on plants and animals professor paul bert who has recently devoted a great deal of attention to the study of the influence of light on animals and plants denies that the leaves of the sensitive plant close on the approach of evening the same as if they had been touched by the hand on the contrary he finds that from 9 in the evening after drooping they expand again and attain the maximum of rigidity at 2 in the morning what is commonly called the sensitiveness of plants is but the external manifestations of the influences of light professor bert placed plants in lanterns of different colored glass those under the influence of green glass drooped in the course of a few days as completely as if placed in utter darkness proving that green rays are useless and equal to none at all in a few weeks all plants without exception thus treated died it has been proved by the experiments of zimiriareff that the reducing power of the green matter of plants is proportionate to the quantity of red rays absorbed and bert shows that green glass precisely intercepts these colored rays and that plants exist more or less healthily in blue and violet rays in the animal world phenomena of a directly opposite nature are found and of a more complex character here the light acts on the skin and the movements of the body either directly or through the visual organs m pouchet has shown the changes in color that certain animals undergo according to the medium in which they live for instance young turbots resting on white sand assume an ashy tint but when resting on a black bottom become brown when deprived of its eyes the fish exhibits no change of color in its skin the phenomenon therefore seems to be nervous or optical professor bert placed a piece of paper with a cut design on the back of a sleeping chameleon on bringing a lamp near the animal the skin gradually became brown and on removing the paper a well defined image of the pattern appeared in this case the light acted directly and without nervous intervention if however the eye of the chameleon be extracted the corresponding side of the animal becomes insensible to the influence of the light professor berts conclusion therefore is that the circulation in the transparent layers of the skin must be affected by light according to dr bouchard a sunstroke is the effect of the direct action of light upon the skin produced by the blue and violet rays the heat producing rays have no part in such accidents as proved by the fact that workmen exposed to intense heats do not feel their fatal effect professor bert in a series of experiments on a variety of animals found that none avoided light but all rather sought it and the lowest forms like the highest absorbed the same rays as regards intensity of color however there was a difference some being more partial to one ray than another thus the microscopic daphne of the pond preferred yellow violet was less in request spiders seemed to enjoy blue rather than red raysso resembling people suffering from color blindness no two persons are sensible to the same shades or tones while absorbing the same light and this would seem to indicate that the retina possesses a selective power new mechanical inventions an improved weighing scale has been patented by hosea willard of vergennes vt the object of this invention is to economize time in ascertaining the weight of an article by avoiding the necessity for shifting the poise on the scale beam it consists in providing a scale beam with a number of dishes suspended from different points on said beam and representing or corresponding with different weights so that the weight of an article may be ascertained by placing it in one or more of said dishes and observing which dish is depressed william john of rigdon ind has patented an improved tire setting and cooling apparatus by which the tire may be set by one person easily and quickly without burning the fellies and without straining the wheel by the unequal cooling of the tire joseph a mumford of avondale nova scotia canada has patented an improved machine for sawing and jointing shingles this machine cannot be properly described without engravings it has an ingenious feeding device and its flywheel carries the jointing knives illbalanced production the philadelphia record sensibly remarks that the popular complaint of overproduction is a mistake though of a few things we make or mine too much our main trouble arises from not producing enough in variety if not in quantity the wants of mankind never can be satisfied every new means of supplying a want creates new wants they grow by what they feed on as long as humanity is so constituted overproduction in a general and enlarged sense is impossible it is this impossible thing with which the reformers would deal who propose to work fewer hours each day or fewer hours in the week the trouble they deplore does not exist the remedy they propose defeats itself a man cannot get rid of his load by shifting it from his right hand to his left hand production will not be stopped by making men their own employers certain hours in the day or certain days in the week instead of allowing them to pursue their usual avocations the real trouble which the labor reformers seem incompetent to fathom is that there is not enough diversity in employments what is desired is more work in productive enterprises a more diffused industry and a closer commercial connection with those countries wherein we can make desirable exchanges both of our raw material and our manufactured products every miner that drops his pick and takes up a hoe every idle man that turns himself into an earner of wages every person that picks up some loose thread of employment every capitalist that takes advantage of stagnating industry and cheap material to build a house or beautify or improve a country seat or set on foot some new process of manufacture does something toward working out the problem which is puzzling the economists in good time the surplus iron and coal will be sold new populations will want new railroads recuperated capital will gather confidence and take hold of new enterprises and the whole nation will move forward again to more assured prosperity and to vaster undertakings labor in germany the consul at barmen reports that for agricultural labor the pay varies greatly according to the proximity to or remoteness from manufacturing centers and ranges from fiftysix cents a day in the neighborhood of barmen to thirtyone cents a day in the lower rhine valley and as low as eighteen cents in parts of silesia at barmen crefeld and dsseldorf carpenters coppersmiths plumbers machinists and wagonsmiths earn fiftyone to seventyfive cents daily saddlers and shoemakers fortyseven to fiftytwo cents daily bakers and brewers with board and lodging from 142 to 214 weekly and without board from sixty cents a day to 428 a week farm hands are paid from 107 to 215 yearly with maintenance railroad laborers from fiftysix to eightythree cents per day and as high as ninetyfive cents daily for piece work on tunnels silk weavers can earn 215 to 285 a week per loom factory women 215 and children 1 a week business and wages are very low in good times wages are eighty per cent higher the cost of the necessaries of life has increased some fifty per cent in thirteen years although it is now but little higher than five years ago a man and wife with two or three children can live in two or three rooms in a poor and comfortless manner for 275 a year and to support such an establishment all the members have to work ten or twelve hours daily for a family of six persons the cost is about 7 per weekan amount but few families can earn as the depression of trade and the reduction of time allow few to do a full weeks work although wages are nominally a trifle higher than five years ago petroleum june review drilling well account the low price of oil and large accumulation of stock in the producing regions have had the effect to lessen operations in this department during the month of june the total number of drilling wells in all the districts at the close of the month was 266 which was 110 less than in the preceding month rigs erected and being erected 243 against 309 last month the number of drilling wells completed during the month was 269 being 151 less than in may aggregate production of the new wells was 3788 barrels against 6851 barrels in may the total number of dry holes developed in the month was 22 against 42 in may the operators in the great northern field bradford district have curtailed operations to an extent which will compare favorably with the operators in the other portions of the producing regions as will be seen by the following statement namely number of wells drilling at the close of the month 187 against 284 at the close of the previous month number of drilling wells completed in june 193 against 346 in may number of rigs erected and being erected 196 against 234 in may production the daily average production for the month was 40575 barrels being a decrease of 227 barrels the new wells completed in june failed to make good the falling off of the old ones by decreasing the daily average 227 barrels bradford district shows a daily average production of 16000 barrels being an increase of 1280 barrels over last month the aggregate production in june of all the other districts combined with the aid of 76 new wells decreased the daily average 1507 barrels shipments the shipments in june out

remarkable poisoning of a lake a contributor to nature describes the remarkable poisoning of lake alexandrinaone of the bodies of water which form the estuary of the murray river australia this year the water of the river has been unusually warm and low and the inflow to the lakes very slight the consequence has been an excessive growth of a conferva which is indigenous to these lakes and confined to them this alga nodularia spumigera is very light and floats on the water except during breezes when it becomes diffused and being driven to the lee shores forms a thick scum like green oil paint this scum which is from two to six inches thick and of a pasty consistency being swallowed by cattle when drinking acts poisonously and rapidly causes death the symptoms of the poisoning are stupor and unconsciousness falling and remaining quiet as if asleep unless touched when convulsions are induced the head and neck being drawn back by a rigid spasm subsiding before death the poison causes the death of sheep in from one to six or eight hours of horses in from eight to twentyfour hours of dogs in from four to five hours and of pigs in three or four hours a post mortem shows the plant is rapidly absorbed into the circulation where it must act as a ferment and causes disorganization as the cattle will not touch the puddle where the plant scum has collected and become putrid all they take is quite fresh and the poisoning is therefore not due to drinking a putrescent fluid full of bacteria as was suggested when the scum collects and dries on the banks it forms a green crust when however it is left in wet pools it rapidly decomposes emitting a most horrible stench like putrid urine but previous to reaching this stage it gives out a smell like that of very rancid butter a blue pigment exudes from this decomposing matter having some remarkable properties it is remarkably fluorescent being red by reflected and blue by transmitted light it appears to be a product of the decomposition and allied to the coloring matter found in some lichens astronomical notes by berlin h wright penn yan n y saturday august 10 1878 the following calculations are adapted to the

sight presented itself to the observers who were looking for a transit of one of the satellites a very dark spot much larger than a satellite was seen on the eastern edge of the disk as shown in the above diagram it moved rapidly westward along the upper margin of the northern belt and passed off at 1 oclock 24 minutes am 12th from its first internal contact till its last external contact was just 3h 19m pittsburg time it appeared to be a solid opaque body truly spherical very sharply defined and most intensely black the transit of the satellite occurred at 15 minutes after 11 oclock and had no unusual appearance now what was that dark body we are constant observers of the heavenly bodies though not deeply versed in the science of astronomy and are anxious to know if any one can give us some light on the subject the telescopes used were a 2 inch and 5 inch achromatic magnifying 154 and 216 diameters but the 154 was chiefly used joseph wampler james r gemmill mckeesport pa july 11 1878 illustration some of professor marshs recent discoveries mr s w williston the assistant of professor marsh has been giving to the omaha bee some interesting facts with regard to the great reptilian fossils recently discovered in wyoming and colorado the bones found represent reptiles of many sizes from that of a cat up to one sixty feet high the latter found at como wyoming belonged to the crocodile order but the remains give evidence that the animal stood up on its hind legs like a kangaroo another found in colorado is estimated by professor marsh to have been 100 feet long a great many remains of the same general class but belonging to different species have been collected and sent east among them from three to four hundred specimens of the dinosaur and about a thousand pterodactyls have been shipped from colorado wyoming and kansas the wings of one of the latter were from thirty to forty feet from tip to tip seventeen different species of these flying dragons have been found in the chalk of western kansas there have also been found six species of toothed birds comparatively little has been done toward classifying the late finds the task is such an enormous one great importance is attached to them however since nothing of the kind had been found in america until a little over a year ago and great stress had been laid by certain geologists on their absence another remarkable feature of the discovery was that the fossils which had been reported as not existing in this country had hardly been brought to light in one locality before thousands of tons of them were simultaneously discovered in half a dozen different places trying to save a hundred and fifty million dollars a year professor riley recently appointed government entomologist and attached to the agricultural department reports that specimens of insects injurious to agriculture are constantly being sent to the department from all parts of the country with requests for information in every instance if a proper examination could be made an effectual remedy could be found and not less than 150000000 saved to the country annually recently a worm entirely new to science was sent to the department by an iowa farmer whose orchard of several thousand apple trees had been rendered unproductive for several years by the new depredator for the interests of western fruit growers this insect should immediately be investigated professor riley asserts that the 5000 recently voted by congress for the investigation of the cotton worm which has sometimes damaged the cotton crop of the south as much as 20000000 in a single fortnight might have been used to better advantage by the department the salary of the entomologist will use up all the money leaving next to nothing for experiments for the eradication of the pest industrial education all are agreed that some education is necessary but what the great proportion of those having the direction of our educational system and facilities in charge still cling to a system which was established long before the first mechanical operation came into existence before the present system of mans relation to man socially industrially politically or commercially was heard of and notwithstanding the revolutions and advancement in all other things there is a determined resistance to any attempt at revolution in what shall be considered education there is an effort to establish compulsory education but what is the child to be taught as if in league with the false theories of the rights of labor these efforts take the apprentices from the shops force them away from where they would learn something and confine them inside a school house to learnwhat certainly nothing of the materials or tools or pursuits by which they are to obtain their livelihood the child knows nothing of when or by whom the compass was discovered the printing press the use of powder electricity of steam or of any one of the thousand mechanical operations now controlling every department of life does any school boy know how many kingdoms there are in the natural world or whether an animal a vegetable and a mineral all belong to the same or to different ones will he know that from instinct the young of animals seeks its food and expands its lungs as by the same instinct the root of a seed sucks up its nourishment from the soil and sends its leaves up to breathe the air will he know anything of the nature or requirements of the soils or the plants that grow in them will this compulsory education teach the boy anything of the iron furnace the foundry or rolling mill or the uses or handling of any of their products will it teach him anything of woods and their value or for what and how they are useful to man will this knowledge for which the powers of the state are to be required to force him to know itwill it teach him anything of the nature or uses of metals of metal working or the business depending upon them will it teach him anything of gold or silver copper or brass anything of pottery of bone ivory celluloid etc will he learn anything of hides leather or the production of these necessary articles will he know whether the word textile applies to anything but a spiders web or the wing of a butterfly whether the united states make import or grow cotton wool silk flax and hemp will he know anything of commerce railroads telegraphs printing and the great number of clerk labors in the larger towns will he have learned a single thing which will assist him in his work of life will not every boy thus taken out of the shop and placed at the compulsory schooling find after he has mastered all it has to give him that he yet knows nothing that he must then commence where he was and serve his apprenticeship that instead of compulsory education his past years have been wasted in obtaining but a compulsory ignorance business and personal the charge for insertion under this head is one dollar
