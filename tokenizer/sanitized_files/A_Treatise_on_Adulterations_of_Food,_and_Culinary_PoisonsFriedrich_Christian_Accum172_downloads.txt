and other articles employed in domestic economy and methods of detecting them by fredrick accum operative chemist and member of the principal academies and societies of arts and sciences in europe philadelphia printed and published by abm small 1820 preface this treatise as its title expresses is intended to exhibit easy methods of detecting the fraudulent adulterations of food and of other articles classed either among the necessaries or luxuries of the table and to put the unwary on their guard against the use of such commodities as are contaminated with substances deleterious to health every person is aware that bread beer wine and other substances employed in domestic economy are frequently met with in an adulterated state and the late convictions of numerous individuals for counterfeiting and adulterating tea coffee bread beer pepper and other articles of diet are still fresh in the memory of the public to such perfection of ingenuity has the system of counterfeiting and adulterating various commodities of life arrived in this country that spurious articles are every where to be found in the market made up so skilfully as to elude the discrimination of the most experienced judges but of all possible nefarious traffic and deception practised by mercenary dealers that of adulterating the articles intended for human food with ingredients deleterious to health is the most criminal and in the mind of every honest man must excite feelings of regret and disgust numerous facts are on record of human food contaminated with poisonous ingredients having been vended to the public and the annals of medicine record tragical events ensuing from the use of such food the eager and insatiable thirst for gain is proof against prohibitions and penalties and the possible sacrifice of a fellowcreatures life is a secondary consideration among unprincipled dealers however invidious the office may appear and however painful the duty may be of exposing the names of individuals who have been convicted of adulterating food yet it was necessary for the verification of my statement that cases should be adduced in their support and i have carefully avoided citing any except those which are authenticated in parliamentary documents and other public records to render this treatise still more useful i have also animadverted on certain material errors sometimes unconsciously committed through accident or ignorance in private families during the preparation of various articles of food and of delicacies for the table in stating the experimental proceedings necessary for the detection of the frauds which it has been my object to expose i have confined myself to the task of pointing out such operations only as may be performed by persons unacquainted with chemical science and it has been my purpose to express all necessary rules and instructions in the plainest language divested of those recondite terms of science which would be out of place in a work intended for general perusal the design of the treatise will be fully answered if the views here given should induce a single reader to pursue the object for which it is published or if it should tend to impress on the mind of the public the magnitude of an evil which in many cases prevails to an extent so alarming that we may exclaim with the sons of the prophet there is death in the pot for the abolition of such nefarious practices it is the interest of all classes of the community to cooperate fredrick accum london 1820 contents preliminary observations on the adulteration of food page 13

and culinary poisons preliminary observations of all the frauds practised by mercenary dealers there is none more reprehensible and at the same time more prevalent than the sophistication of the various articles of food this unprincipled and nefarious practice increasing in degree as it has been found difficult of detection is now applied to almost every commodity which can be classed among either the necessaries or the luxuries of life and is carried on to a most alarming extent in every part of the united kingdom it has been pursued by men who from the magnitude and apparent respectability of their concerns would be the least obnoxious to public suspicion and their successful example has called forth from among the retail dealers a multitude of competitors in the same iniquitous course to such perfection of ingenuity has this system of adulterating food arrived that spurious articles of various kinds are every where to be found made up so skilfully as to baffle the discrimination of the most experienced judges among the number of substances used in domestic economy which are now very generally found sophisticated may be distinguishedtea coffee bread beer wine spiritous liquors salad oil pepper vinegar mustard cream and other articles of subsistence indeed it would be difficult to mention a single article of food which is not to be met with in an adulterated state and there are some substances which are scarcely ever to be procured genuine some of these spurious compounds are comparatively harmless when used as food and as in these cases merely substances of inferior value are substituted for more costly and genuine ingredients the sophistication though it may affect our purse does not injure our health of this kind are the manufacture of factitious pepper the adulterations of mustard vinegar cream c others however are highly deleterious and to this class belong the adulterations of beer wines spiritous liquors pickles salad oil and many others there are particular chemists who make it a regular trade to supply drugs or nefarious preparations to the unprincipled brewer of porter or ale others perform the same office to the wine and spirit merchant and others again to the grocer and the oilman the operators carry on their processes chiefly in secresy and under some delusive firm with the ostensible denotements of a fair and lawful establishment these illicit pursuits have assumed all the order and method of a regular trade they may severally claim to be distinguished as an art and mystery for the workmen employed in them are often wholly ignorant of the nature of the substances which pass through their hands and of the purposes to which they are ultimately applied to elude the vigilance of the inquisitive to defeat the scrutiny of the revenue officer and to ensure the secresy of these mysteries the processes are very ingeniously divided and subdivided among individual operators and the manufacture is purposely carried on in separate establishments the task of proportioning the ingredients for use is assigned to one individual while the composition and preparation of them may be said to form a distinct part of the business and is entrusted to another workman most of the articles are transmitted to the consumer in a disguised state or in such a form that their real nature cannot possibly be detected by the unwary thus the extract of coculus indicus employed by fraudulent manufacturers of maltliquors to impart an intoxicating quality to porter or ales is known in the market by the name of black extract ostensibly destined for the use of tanners and dyers it is obtained by boiling the berries of the coculus indicus in water and converting by a subsequent evaporation this decoction into a stiff black tenacious mass possessing in a high degree the narcotic and intoxicating quality of the poisonous berry from which it is prepared another substance composed of extract of quassia and liquorice juice used by fraudulent brewers to economise both malt and hops is technically called multum1 the quantities of coculus indicus berries as well as of black extract imported into this country for adulterating malt liquors are enormous it forms a considerable branch of commerce in the hands of a few brokers yet singular as it may seem no inquiry appears to have been hitherto made by the officers of the revenue respecting its application many other substances employed in the adulteration of beer ale and spiritous liquors are in a similar manner intentionally disguised and of the persons by whom they are purchased a great number are totally unacquainted with their nature or composition an extract said to be innocent sold in casks containing from half a cwt to five cwt by the brewers druggists under the name of bittern is composed of calcined sulphate of iron copperas extract of coculus indicus berries extract of quassia and spanish liquorice it would be very easy to adduce in support of these remarks the testimony of numerous individuals by whom i have been professionally engaged to examine certain mixtures said to be perfectly innocent which are used in very extensive manufactories of the above description indeed during the long period devoted to the practice of my profession i have had abundant reason to be convinced that a vast number of dealers of the highest respectability have vended to their customers articles absolutely poisonous which they themselves considered as harmless and which they would not have offered for sale had they been apprised of the spurious and pernicious nature of the compounds and of the purposes to which they were destined for instance i have known cases in which brandy merchants were not aware that the substance which they frequently purchase under the delusive name of flash for strengthening and clarifying spiritous liquors and which is held out as consisting of burnt sugar and isinglass only in the form of an extract is in reality a compound of sugar with extract of capsicum and that to the acrid and pungent qualities of the capsicum is to be ascribed the heightened flavour of brandy and rum when coloured with the abovementioned matter in other cases the alebrewer has been supplied with readyground coriander seeds previously mixed with a portion of nux vomica and quassia to give a bitter taste and narcotic property to the beverage the retail venders of mustard do not appear to be aware that mustard seed alone cannot produce when ground a powder of so intense and brilliant a colour as that of the common mustard of commerce nor would the powder of real mustard when mixed with salt and water without the addition of a portion of pulverised capsicum keep for so long a time as the mustard usually offered for sale many other instances of unconscious deceptions might be mentioned which were practised by persons of upright and honourable minds it is a painful reflection that the division of labour which has been so instrumental in bringing the manufactures of this country to their present flourishing state should have also tended to conceal and facilitate the fraudulent practices in question and that from a correspondent ramification of commerce into a multitude of distinct branches particularly in the metropolis and the large towns of the empire the traffic in adulterated commodities should find its way through so many circuitous channels as to defy the most scrutinising endeavour to trace it to its source it is not less lamentable that the extensive application of chemistry to the useful purposes of life should have been perverted into an auxiliary to this nefarious traffic but happily for the science it may without difficulty be converted into a means of detecting the abuse to effect which very little chemical skill is required and the course to be pursued forms the object of the following pages the baker asserts that he does not put alum into bread but he is well aware that in purchasing a certain quantity of flour he must take a sack of sharp whites a term given to flour contaminated with a quantity of alum without which it would be impossible for him to produce light white and porous bread from a halfspoiled material the wholesale mealman frequently purchases this spurious commodity which forms a separate branch of business in the hands of certain individuals in order to enable himself to sell his decayed and halfspoiled flour other individuals furnish the baker with alum mixed up with salt under the obscure denomination of stuff there are wholesale manufacturing chemists whose sole business is to crystallise alum in such a form as will adapt this salt to the purpose of being mixed in a crystalline state with the crystals of common salt to disguise the character of the compound the mixture called stuff is composed of one part of alum in minute crystals and three of common salt in many other trades a similar mode of proceeding prevails potatoes are soaked in water to augment their weight the practice of sophisticating the necessaries of life being reduced to systematic regularity is ranked by public opinion among other mercantile pursuits and is not only regarded with less disgust than formerly but is almost generally esteemed as a justifiable way to wealth it is really astonishing that the penal law is not more effectually enforced against practices so inimical to the public welfare the man who robs a fellow subject of a few shillings on the highway is sentenced to death while he who distributes a slow poison to a whole community escapes unpunished it has been urged by some that under so vast a system of finance as that of great britain it is expedient that the revenue should be collected in large amounts and therefore that the severity of the law should be relaxed in favour of all mercantile concerns in proportion to their extent encouragement must be given to large capitalists and where an extensive brewery or distillery yields an important contribution to the revenue no strict scrutiny need be adopted in regard to the quality of the article from which such contribution is raised provided the excise do not suffer by the fraud but the principles of the constitution afford no sanction to this preference and the true interests of the country require that it should be abolished for a tax dependent upon deception must be at best precarious and must be sooner or later diminished by the irresistible diffusion of knowledge sound policy requires that the law should be impartially enforced in all cases and if its penalties were extended to abuses of which it does not now take cognisance there is no doubt that the revenue would be abundantly benefited another species of fraud to which i shall at present but briefly advert and which has increased to so alarming an extent that it loudly calls for the interference of government is the adulteration of drugs and medicines ninetenths of the most potent drugs and chemical preparations used in pharmacy are vended in a sophisticated state by dealers who would be the last to be suspected it is well known that of the article peruvian bark there is a variety of species inferior to the genuine that too little discrimination is exercised by the collectors of this precious medicament that it is carelessly assorted and is frequently packed in green hides that much of it arrives in spain in a halfdecayed state mixed with fragments of other vegetables and various extraneous substances and in this state is distributed throughout europe but as if this were not a sufficient deterioration the public are often served with a spurious compound of mahogany sawdust and oak wood ground into powder mixed with a proportion of good quinquina and sold as genuine bark powder every chemist knows that there are mills constantly at work in this metropolis which furnish bark powder at a much cheaper rate than the substance can be procured for in its natural state the price of the best genuine bark upon an average is not lower than twelve shillings the pound but immense quantities of powder bark are supplied to the apothecaries at three or four shillings a pound it is also notorious that there are manufacturers of spurious rhubarb powder ipecacuanha powder2 jamess powder and other simple and compound medicines of great potency who carry on their diabolical trade on an amazingly large scale indeed the quantity of medical preparations thus sophisticated exceeds belief cheapness and not genuineness and excellence is the grand desideratum with the unprincipled dealers in drugs and medicines those who are familiar with chemistry may easily convince themselves of the existence of the fraud by subjecting to a chemical examination either spirits of hartshorn magnesia calcined magnesia calomel or any other chemical preparation in general demand spirit of hartshorn is counterfeited by mixing liquid caustic ammonia with the distilled spirit of hartshorn to increase the pungency of its odour and to enable it to bear an addition of water the fraud is detected by adding spirit of wine to the sophisticated spirit for if no considerable coagulation ensues the adulteration is proved it may also be discovered by the hartshorn spirit not producing a brisk effervescence when mixed with muriatic or nitric acid magnesia usually contains a portion of lime originating from hard water being used instead of soft in the preparation of this medicine to ascertain the purity of magnesia add to a portion of it a little sulphuric acid diluted with ten times its bulk of water if the magnesia be completely soluble and the solution remains transparent it may be pronounced pure but not otherwise or dissolve a portion of the magnesia in muriatic acid and add a solution of subcarbonate of ammonia if any lime be present it will form a precipitate whereas pure magnesia will remain in solution calcined magnesia is seldom met with in a pure state it may be assayed by the same tests as the common magnesia it ought not to effervesce at all with dilute sulphuric acid and if the magnesia and acid be put together into one scale of a balance no diminution of weight should ensue on mixing them together calcined magnesia however is very seldom so pure as to be totally dissolved by diluted sulphuric acid for a small insoluble residue generally remains consisting chiefly of silicious earth derived from the alkali employed in the preparation of it the solution in sulphuric acid when largely diluted ought not to afford any precipitation by the addition of oxalate of ammonia the genuineness of calomel may be ascertained by boiling for a few minutes one part with 132 part of muriate of ammonia in ten parts of distilled water when carbonate of potash is added to the filtered solution no precipitation will ensue if the calomel be pure indeed some of the most common and cheap drugs do not escape the adulterating hand of the unprincipled druggist syrup of buckthorn for example instead of being prepared from the juice of buckthorn berries rhamnus catharticus is made from the fruit of the blackberry bearing alder and the dogberry tree a mixture of the berries of the buckthorn and blackberry bearing alder and of the dogberry tree may be seen publicly exposed for sale by some of the venders of medicinal herbs this abuse may be discovered by opening the berries those of buckthorn have almost always four seeds of the alder two and of the dogberry only one buckthorn berries bruised on white paper stain it of a green colour which the others do not instead of wormseed artemisia santonica the seeds of tansy are frequently offered for sale or a mixture of both a great many of the essential oils obtained from the more expensive spices are frequently so much adulterated that it is not easy to meet with such as are at all fit for use nor are these adulterations easily discoverable the grosser abuses indeed may be readily detected thus if the oil be adulterated with alcohol it will turn milky on the addition of water if with expressed oils alcohol will dissolve the volatile and leave the other behind if with oil of turpentine on dipping a piece of paper in the mixture and drying it with a gentle heat the turpentine will be betrayed by its smell the more subtile artists however have contrived other methods of sophistication which elude all trials and as all volatile oils agree in the general properties of solubility in spirit of wine and volatility in the heat of boiling water c it is plain that they may be variously mixed with each other or the dearer sophisticated with the cheaper without any possibility of discovering the abuse by any of the beforementioned trials perfumers assert that the smell and taste are the only certain tests of which the nature of the thing will admit for example if a bark should have in every respect the appearance of good cinnamon and should be proved indisputably to be the genuine bark of the cinnamon tree yet if it want the cinnamon flavour or has it but in a low degree we reject it and the case is the same with the essential oil of cinnamon it is only from use and habit or comparisons with specimens of known quality that we can judge of the goodness either of the drugs themselves or of their oils most of the arrowroot the fecula of the maranta arudinacea sold by druggists is a mixture of potatoe starch and arrowroot the same system of adulteration extends to articles used in various trades and manufactures for instance linen tape and various other household commodities of that kind instead of being manufactured of linen thread only are made up of linen and cotton colours for painting not only those used by artists such as ultramarine3 carmine4 and lake5 antwerp blue6 chrome yellow7 and indian ink8 but also the coarser colours used by the common housepainter are more or less adulterated thus of the latter kind white lead9 is mixed with carbonate or sulphate of barytes vermilion10 with red lead soap used in housekeeping is frequently adulterated with a considerable portion of fine white clay brought from st stephens in cornwall in the manufacture of printing paper a large quantity of plaster of paris is added to the paper stuff to increase the weight of the manufactured article the selvage of cloth is often dyed with a permanent colour and artfully stitched to the edge of cloth dyed with a fugitive dye the frauds committed in the tanning of skins and in the manufacture of cutlery and jewelry exceed belief the object of all unprincipled modern manufacturers seems to be the sparing of their time and labour as much as possible and to increase the quantity of the articles they produce without much regard to their quality the ingenuity and perseverance of selfinterest is proof against prohibitions and contrives to elude the vigilance of the most active government the eager and insatiable thirst for gain which seems to be a leading characteristic of the times calls into action every human faculty and gives an irresistible impulse to the power of invention and where lucre becomes the reigning principle the possible sacrifice of even a fellow creatures life is a secondary consideration in reference to the deterioration of almost all the necessaries and comforts of existence it may be justly observed in a civil as well as a religious sense that in the midst of life we are in death footnotes 1 the times may 18 1818 the king v richard bowman the defendant was a brewer living in wappingstreet wapping and was charged with having in his possession a drug called multum and a quantity of copperas the articles were produced by thomas gates an excise officer who had after a search found them on the defendants premises the court sentenced the defendant to pay a fine of 200l the king v luke lyons the defendant is a brewer and was brought up under an indictment charging him with having made use of various deleterious drugs in his brewery among which were capsicum copperas c the defendant was ordered to pay the fines of 20l upon the first count 200l upon the third and 200l upon the seventh count in the indictment the king v thomas evans the charge against this defendant was that he had in his possession fortyseven barrels of stale unpalatable beer on the 11th of march john wilson an excise officer went to the storehouse and found fortyseven casks containing fortythree barrels and a half of sour unwholesome beer several samples of the beer were produced all of them of a different colour and filled with sediment a fine of 30l was ordered to be paid by the defendant 2 of this root several varieties are imported the white sort which has no wrinkles and no perceptible bitterness in taste and which though taken in a large dose has scarcely any effect at all after being pulverised by fraudulent druggists and mixed with a portion of emetic tartar is sold at a low price for the powder of genuine ipecacuanha root 3 genuine ultramarine should become deprived of its colour when thrown into concentrated nitric acid 4 genuine carmine should be totally soluble in liquid ammonia 5 genuine madder and carmine lakes should be totally soluble by boiling in a concentrated solution of soda or potash 6 genuine antwerp blue should not become deprived of its colour when thrown into liquid chlorine 7 genuine chrome yellow should not effervesce with nitric acid 8 the best indian ink breaks splintery with a smooth glossy fracture and feels soft and not gritty when rubbed against the teeth 9 genuine white lead should be completely soluble in nitric acid and the solution should remain transparent when mingled with a solution of sulphate of soda 10 genuine vermilion should become totally volatilised on being exposed to a red heat and it should not impart a red colour to spirit of wine when digested with it remarks on the effect of different kinds of waters in their application to domestic economy and the arts and methods of ascertaining their purity it requires not much reflection to become convinced that the waters which issue from the recesses of the earth and form springs wells rivers or lakes often materially differ from each other in their taste and other obvious properties there are few people who have not observed a difference in the waters used for domestic purposes and in the arts and the distinctions of hard and soft water are familiar to every body water perfectly pure is scarcely ever met with in nature it must also be obvious that the health and comfort of families and the conveniences of domestic life are materially affected by the supply of good and wholesome water hence a knowledge of the quality and salubrity of the different kinds of waters employed in the common concerns of life on account of the abundant daily use we make of them in the preparation of food is unquestionably an object of considerable importance and demands our attention the effects produced by the foreign matters which water may contain are more considerable and of greater importance than might at first be imagined it cannot be denied that such waters as are hard or loaded with earthy matter have a decided effect upon some important functions of the human body they increase the distressing symptoms under which those persons labour who are afflicted with what is commonly called gravel complaints and many other ailments might be named that are always aggravated by the use of waters abounding in saline and earthy substances the purity of the waters employed in some of the arts and manufactures is an object of not less consequence in the process of brewing malt liquors soft water is preferable to hard every brewer knows that the largest possible quantity of the extractive matter of the malt is obtained in the least possible time and at the smallest cost by means of soft water in the art of the dyer hard water not only opposes the solution of several dye stuffs but it also alters the natural tints of some delicate colours whilst in others again it precipitates the earthy and saline matters with which it is impregnated into the delicate fibres of the stuff and thus impedes the softness and brilliancy of the dye the bleacher cannot use with advantage waters impregnated with earthy salts and a minute portion of iron imparts to the cloth a yellowish hue to the manufacturer of painters colours water as pure as possible is absolutely essential for the successful preparation of several delicate pigments carmine madder lake ultramarine and indian yellow cannot be prepared without perfectly pure water for the steeping or raiting of flax soft water is absolutely necessary in hard water the flax may be immersed for months till its texture be injured and still the ligneous matter will not be decomposed and the fibres properly separated in the culinary art the effects of water more or less pure are likewise obvious good and pure water softens the fibres of animal and vegetable matters more readily than such as is called hard every cook knows that dry or ripe pease and other farinaceous seeds cannot readily be boiled soft in hard water because the farina of the seed is not perfectly soluble in water loaded with earthy salts green esculent vegetable substances are more tender when boiled in soft water than in hard water although hard water imparts to them a better colour the effects of hard and soft water may be easily shown in the following manner experiment let two separate portions of tealeaves be macerated by precisely the same processes in circumstances all alike in similar and separate vessels the one containing hard and the other soft water either hot or cold the infusion made with the soft water will have by far the strongest taste although it possesses less colour than the infusion made with the hard water it will strike a more intense black with a solution of sulphate of iron and afford a more abundant precipitate with a solution of animal jelly which at once shews that soft water has extracted more tanning matter and more gallic acid from the tealeaves than could be obtained from them under like circumstances by means of hard water many animals which are accustomed to drink soft water refuse hard water horses in particular prefer the former pigeons refuse hard water when they have been accustomed to soft water characters of good water a good criterion of the purity of water fit for domestic purposes is its softness this quality is at once obvious by the touch if we only wash our hands in it with soap good water should be beautifully transparent a slight opacity indicates extraneous matter to judge of the perfect transparency of water a quantity of it should be put into a deep glass vessel the larger the better so that we can look down perpendicularly into a considerable mass of the fluid we may then readily discover the slightest degree of muddiness much better than if the water be viewed through the glass placed between the eye and the light it should be perfectly colourless devoid of odour and its taste soft and agreeable it should send out airbubbles when poured from one vessel into another it should boil pulse soft and form with soap an uniform opaline fluid which does not separate after standing for several hours it is to the presence of common air and carbonic acid gas that common water owes its taste and many of the good effects which it produces on animals and vegetables spring water which contains more air has a more lively taste than river water hence the insipid or vapid taste of newly boiled water from which these gases are expelled fish cannot live in water deprived of those elastic fluids 100 cubic inches of the new river water with which part of this metropolis is supplied contains 225 of carbonic acid and 125 of common air the water of the river thames contains rather a larger quantity of common air and a smaller portion of carbonic acid if water not fully saturated with common air be agitated with this elastic fluid a portion of the air is absorbed but the two chief constituent gases of the atmosphere the oxygen and nitrogen are not equally affected the former being absorbed in preference to the latter according to mr dalton in agitating water with atmospheric air consisting of 79 of nitrogen and 21 of oxygen the water absorbs 164 of 79100 nitrogen gas 1234 and 127 of 21100 oxygen gas 778 amounting in all to 2012 water is freed from foreign matter by distillation and for any chemical process in which accuracy is requisite distilled water must be used hard waters may in general be cured in part by dropping into them a solution of subcarbonate of potash or if the hardness be owing only to the presence of supercarbonate of lime mere boiling will greatly remedy the defect part of the carbonic acid flies off and a neutral carbonate of lime falls down to the bottom it may then be used for washing scarcely curdling soap but if the hardness be owing in part to sulphate of lime boiling does not soften it at all when spring water is used for washing it is advantageous to leave it for some time exposed to the open air in a reservoir with a large surface part of the carbonic acid becomes thus dissipated and part of the carbonate of lime falls to the bottom mr dalton11 has observed that the more any spring is drawn from the softer the water becomes chemical constitution of the waters used in domestic economy and the arts rain water collected with every precaution as it descends from the clouds and at a distance from large towns or any other object capable of impregnating the atmosphere with foreign matters approaches more nearly to a state of purity than perhaps any other natural water even collected under these circumstances however it invariably contains a portion of common air and carbonic acid gas the specific gravity of rain water scarcely differs from that of distilled water and from the minute portions of the foreign ingredients which it generally contains it is very soft and admirably adapted for many culinary purposes and various processes in different manufactures and the arts freshfallen snow melted without the contact of air appears to be nearly free from air gaylussac and humboldt however affirm that it contains nearly the usual proportion of air water from melted ice does not contain so much air dew has been supposed to be saturated with air snow water has long laid under the imputation of occasioning those strumous swellings in the neck which deform the inhabitants of many of the alpine vallies but this opinion is not supported by any wellauthenticated indisputable facts and is rendered still more improbable if not entirely overturned by the frequency of the disease in sumatra12 where ice and snow are never seen in high northern latitudes thawed snow forms the constant drink of the inhabitants during winter and the vast masses of ice which float on the polar seas afford an abundant supply of fresh water to the mariner spring water includes wellwater and all others that arise from some depth below the surface of the earth and which are used at the fountainhead or at least before they have run any considerable distance exposed to the air indeed springs may be considered as rain water which has passed through the fissures of the earth and having accumulated at the bottom of declivities rises again to the surface forming springs and wells as wells take their origin at some depth from the surface and below the influence of the external atmosphere their temperature is in general pretty uniform during every vicissitude of season and always several degrees lower than the atmosphere they differ from one another according to the nature of the strata through which they issue for though the ingredients usually existing in them are in such minute quantities as to impart to the water no striking properties and do not render it unfit for common purposes yet they modify its nature very considerably hence the water of some springs is said to be hard of others soft some sweet others brackish according to the nature and degree of the inpregnating ingredients common springs are insensibly changed into mineral or medicinal springs as their foreign contents become larger or more unusual or in some instances they derive medicinal celebrity from the absence of those ingredients usually occurring in springwater as for example is the case with the malvern spring which is nearly pure water almost all springwaters possess the property termed hardness in a greater or less degree a property which depends chiefly upon the presence of supercarbonate or of sulphate of lime or of both and the quantity of these earthy salts varies very considerably in different instances mr dalton13 has shewn that one grain of sulphate of lime contained in 2000 grains of water converts it into the hardest spring water that is commonly met with the waters of deep wells are usually much harder than those of springs which overflow the mouth of the well but there are some exceptions to this rule the purest springs are those which occur in primitive rocks or beds of gravel or filter through sand or silicious strata in general large springs are purer than small ones and our old wells contain finer water than those that are new as the soluble parts through which the water filters in channels under ground become gradually washed away river water is a term applied to every running stream or rivulet exposed to the air and always flowing in an open channel it is formed of spring water which by exposure becomes more pure and of running land or surface water which although turbid from particles of the alluvial soil suspended in it is otherwise very pure it is purest when it runs over a gravelly or rocky bed and when its course is swift it is generally soft and more free from earthy salts than spring water but it usually contains less common air and carbonic acid gas for by the agitation of a long current and exposed to the temperature of the atmosphere part of its carbonic acid gas is disengaged and the lime held in solution by it is in part precipitated the loss of which contributes to the softness of the water its specific gravity thereby becomes less the taste not so harsh but less fresh and agreeable and out of a hard spring is often made a stream of sufficient purity for most of the purposes where a soft water is required the water called in this metropolis new river water contains a minute portion of muriate of lime carbonate of lime and muriate of soda some streams however that arise from clean silicious beds and flow in a sandy or stony channel are from the outset remarkably pure such as the mountain lakes and rivulets in the rocky districts of wales the source of the beautiful waters of the dee and numberless other rivers that flow through the hollow of every valley switzerland has long been celebrated for the purity and excellence of its waters which pour in copious streams from the mountains and give rise to the finest rivers in europe some rivers however that do not take their rise from a rocky soil and are indeed at first considerably charged with foreign matter during a long course even over a richly cultivated plain become remarkably pure as to saline contents but often fouled with mud containing much animal and vegetable matter which are rather suspended than held in true solution such is the water of the river thames which taken up at london at low water mark is very soft and good and after rest it contains but a very small portion of any thing that could prove pernicious or impede any manufacture it is also excellently fitted for seastore but it then undergoes a remarkable spontaneous change when preserved in wooden casks no water carried to sea becomes putrid sooner than that of the thames but the mode now adopted in the navy of substituting iron tanks for wooden casks tends greatly to obviate this disadvantage whoever will consider the situation of the thames and the immense population along its banks for so many miles must at once perceive the prodigious accumulation of animal matters of all kinds which by means of the common sewers constantly make their way into it these matters are no doubt in part the cause of the putrefaction which it is well known to undergo at sea and of the carburetted and sulphuretted hydrogen gases which are evolved from it when a wooden cask is opened after being kept a month or two a quantity of carburetted and sulphuretted hydrogen escapes and the water is so black and offensive as scarcely to be borne upon racking it off however into large earthen vessels and exposing it to the air it gradually deposits a quantity of black slimy mud becomes clear as crystal and remarkably sweet and palatable it might at first sight be expected that the water of the thames after having received all the contents of the sewers drains and water courses of a large town should acquire thereby such impregnation with foreign matters as to become very impure but it appears from the most accurate experiments that have been made that those kinds of impurities have no perceptible influence on the salubrious quality of a mass of water so immense and constantly kept in motion by the action of the tides some traces of animal matter may however be detected in the water of the thames for if nitrate of lead be dropped into it14 you will find that it becomes milky and that a white powder falls to the bottom which dissolves without effervescence in nitric acid it is therefore says dr thomson a combination of oxide of lead with some animal matter substances usually contained in common water and tests by which they are detected to acquire a knowledge of the general nature of common water it is only necessary to add to it a few chemical tests which will quickly indicate the presence or absence of the substances that may be expected almost the only salts contained in common waters are the carbonates sulphates and muriates of soda lime and magnesia and sometimes a very minute portion of iron may also be detected in them experiment fill a wineglass with distilled water and add to it a few drops of a solution of soap in alcohol the water will remain transparent this test is employed for ascertaining the presence of earthy salts in waters hence it produces no change when mingled with distilled or perfectly pure water but when added to water containing earthy salts a white flocculent matter becomes separated which speedily collects on the surface of the fluid now from the quantity of flocculent matter produced in equal quantities of water submitted to the test a tolerable notion may be formed of the degrees of hardness of different kinds of water at least so far as regards the fitness of the water for the ordinary purposes of domestic economy this may be rendered obvious in the following manner experiment fill a number of wineglasses with different kinds of pump or well water and let fall into each glass a few drops of the solution of soap in alcohol a turbidness will instantly ensue and a flocculent matter collect on the surface of the fluid if the mixture be left undisturbed the quantity of flocculent matter will be in the ratio of the quantity of earthy salts contained in the water it is obvious that the action of this test is not discriminative with regard to the chemical nature of the earthy salt present in the water it serves only to indicate the presence or absence of those kinds of substances which occasion that quality in water which is usually called hardness and which is always owing to salts with an earthy base if we wish to know the nature of the different acids and earths contained in the water the following test may be employed15 experiment add about twenty drops of a solution of oxalate of ammonia to half a wineglass of the water if a white precipitate ensues we conclude that the water contains lime by means of this test one grain of lime may be detected in 24250 of water if this test occasion a white precipitate in water taken fresh from the pump or spring and not after the water has been boiled and suffered to grow cold the lime is dissolved in the water by an excess of carbonic acid and if it continues to produce a precipitate in the water which has been concentrated by boiling we then are sure that the lime is combined with a fixed acid experiment to detect the presence of iron add to a wineglassful of the water a few drops of an infusion of nutgalls or better suffer a nutgall to be suspended in it for twentyfour hours which will cause the water to acquire a blueish black colour if iron be present experiment add a few grains of muriate of barytes to half a wineglass of the water to be examined if it produces a turbidness which does not disappear by the admixture of a few drops of muriatic acid the presence of sulphuric acid is rendered obvious experiment if a few drops of a solution of nitrate of silver occasions a milkiness with the water which vanishes again by the copious addition of liquid ammonia we have reason to believe that the water contains a salt one of the constituent parts of which is muriatic acid experiment if lime water or barytic water occasions a precipitate which again vanishes by the admixture of muriatic acid then carbonic acid is present in the water experiment if a solution of phosphate of soda produces a milkiness with the water after a previous addition to it of a similar quantity of neutral carbonate of ammonia we may then expect magnesia the application of this test is best made in the following manner concentrate a quantity of the water to be examined to about 120 part of its bulk and drop into about half a wineglassful about five grains of neutral carbonate of ammonia no magnesia becomes yet precipitated if this earth be present but on adding a like quantity of phosphate of soda the magnesia falls down as an insoluble salt it is essential that the carbonate of ammonia be neutral this test was first pointed out by dr wollaston the presence of oxygen gas loosely combined in water may readily be discovered in the following manner experiment fill a vial with water and add to it a small quantity of green sulphate of iron if the water be entirely free of oxygen and if the vessel be well stopped and completely filled the solution is transparent but if otherwise it soon becomes slightly turbid from the oxide of iron attracting the oxygen and a small portion of it in this more highly oxidated state leaving the acid and being precipitated or according to a method pointed out by driessen the water is to be boiled for two hours in a flask filled with it and immersed in a vessel of water kept boiling with the mouth of the flask under the surface of the water it is to be inverted in quicksilver taking care that no airbubble adheres to the side of the flask and being tinged with infusion of litmus a little nitrous gas is to be introduced if the oxygen gas has been sufficiently expelled from the water the purple colour of the litmus does not change while if oxygen be present it immediately becomes red16 if we examine the different waters which are used for the ordinary purposes of life and judge of them by the above tests we shall find them to differ considerably from each other some contain a large quantity of saline and earthy matters whilst others are nearly pure the differences are produced by the great solvent power which water exercises upon most substances wells should never be lined with bricks which render soft water hard or if bricks be employed they should be bedded in and covered with cement method of ascertaining the relative quantity of each of the different substances usually contained in common water to ascertain the quantity of earthy and saline matter contained in water the following is the most simple and easy method experiment put any measured quantity of the water into a platina or silver evaporating basin the weight of which is known and evaporate the water upon a steam bath at a temperature of about 180 nearly to dryness and lastly remove the basin to a sand bath and let the mass be evaporated to perfect dryness the weight of the platina basin being already known we have only to weigh it carefully when the solid saline contents of the water is attached to it the increase of weight gives the quantity of solid matter contained in a given quantity of the water experiment pour upon the saline contents a quantity of distilled water equal to that in which the obtained salts were originally dissolved if the whole saline matter become dissolved in this water there is reason to believe that the saline matter has not been altered during the evaporation of the water but if a portion remain undissolved as is usually the case then we may conclude that some of the salts have mutually decomposed each other when brought into a concentrated state by the evaporation and that salts have been formed which did not originally exist in the water before its evaporation we have already mentioned that almost the only salts contained in common waters are the carbonates sulphates and muriates of soda lime and magnesia and sometimes a very minute portion of iron having determined the different acids and bases present in the manner stated at p 49 we may easily ascertain the relative weight of each the following formula suggested by dr murray17 is fully as accurate a means of analysing waters as any other and it is easy of execution the weight of the saline ingredients of a given quantity of water being determined we may proceed to the accurate analysis of it in the following manner experiment measure out a determinate volume of the water as 500 or 1000 cubic inches and evaporate it gradually in an unglazed open vessel defended from dust to one third of its original bulk then divide this evaporated liquid into three equal portions experiment drop into the first portion muriate of barytes wash the precipitate collect it dry it at a red heat upon platina foil and weigh it digest it in nitric acid dry it and weigh it again the loss of weight indicates the quantity of carbonate of barytes which the precipitate contained the residual weight is sulphate of barytes the carbonic acid in the water is equivalent to 022 of the weight of the carbonate of barytes the sulphuric acid to 0339 of the weight of the sulphate of barytes experiment precipitate the second portion of the concentrated water by the addition of nitrate of silver wash the precipitate dry it and fuse it on a piece of foil platina previously weighed by weighing the foil containing the fused chloride of silver the weight of the precipitate may be ascertained the fourth part of this weight is equivalent to the weight of the muriatic acid contained in the portion of water precipitated experiment precipitate the third portion of the water by the addition of oxalate of ammonia wash and dry the precipitate expose it to a red heat on a platina foil or in a capsule of platina pour on it some dilute sulphuric acid digest for some time then evaporate to dryness expose the capsule to a pretty strong heat and lastly weigh the sulphate of lime thus produced 0453 of its weight indicate the quantity of lime in the portion of water precipitated experiment add to the same third portion of the water thus freed from lime a portion of a solution of neutral carbonate of ammonia and then add phosphoric acid drop by drop as long as any precipitate falls down wash the precipitate dry it and expose it to a red heat in a platina capsule it is phosphate of magnesia 0357 of the weight of this salt is equivalent to the weight of the magnesia contained in the water experiment if the water contain a minute portion of iron a quantity of it equal to one of the three preceding portions must be taken and mixed with a solution of benzoate of ammonia the precipitate being washed dried and exposed to a red heat and weighed ninetenths of its weight indicate the weight of protoxide of iron contained in the water in this manner the quantity of all the substances contained in the water will be ascertained except there be any soda to know the amount of it the following method pointed out by dr murray answers very well experiment evaporate a portion of the water to one third of its bulk precipitate the carbonic and sulphuric acids by the addition of muriate of barytes taking care not to add any excess of the tests precipitate the lime by oxalate of ammonia and the magnesia by carbonate of ammonia and phosphoric acid page 52 then evaporate the liquid thus treated to dryness a quantity of common salt will remain let this be exposed to a red heat 04 of its weight indicate the sodium contained in the bulk of water employed and 04 sodium are equivalent to 053 of soda it seems hardly requisite to mention some other substances that occasionally make their appearance in the waters used for domestic purposes a fine divided sand is a common constituent which is easily obtained in a separate state we have only to evaporate a portion of the water to dryness and redissolve the saline residue in distilled water the silicious sand remains undissolved and betrays itself by its insolubility in acids and its easy fusibility into a transparant glass with soda before the blowpipe deleterious effects of keeping water for domestic economy in leaden reservoirs the deleterious effect of lead when taken into the stomach is at present so universally known that it is quite unnecessary to adduce any argument in proof of its dangerous tendency the ancients were upwards of 2000 years ago as well aware of the pernicious quality of this metal as we are at the present day and indeed they appeared to have been much more apprehensive of its effects and scrupulous in the application of it to purposes of domestic economy their precautions may have been occasionally carried to an unnecessary length this was the natural consequence of the imperfect state of experimental knowledge at that period when men were unable to detect the poisonous mattersto be over scrupulous in the use of such water was an error on the right side the moderns on the other hand in part perhaps from an illfounded confidence and inattention to a careful and continued examination of its effects have fallen into an opposite error there can be no doubt that the mode of preserving water intended for food or drink in leaden reservoirs is exceedingly improper and although pure water exercises no sensible action upon metallic lead provided air be excluded the metal is certainly acted on by the water when air is admitted this effect is so obvious that it cannot escape the notice of the least attentive observer the white line which may be seen at the surface of the water preserved in leaden cisterns where the metal touches the water and where the air is admitted is a carbonate of lead formed at the expense of the metal this substance when taken into the stomach is highly deleterious to health this was the reason which induced the ancients to condemn leaden pipes for the conveyance of water it having been remarked that persons who swallowed the sediment of such water became affected with disorders of the bowels18 leaden water reservoirs were condemned in ancient times by hyppocrates galen and vitruvius as dangerous in addition to which we may depend on the observations of van swieten tronchin and others who have quoted numerous unhappy examples of whole families poisoned by water which had remained in reservoirs of lead dr johnston dr percival sir george baker and dr lamb have likewise recorded numerous instances where dangerous diseases ensued from the use of water impregnated with lead different potable waters have unequal solvent powers on this metal in some places the use of leaden pumps has been discontinued from the expense entailed upon the proprietors by the constant want of repair dr lamb19 states an instance where the proprietor of a well ordered his plumber to make the lead of a pump of double the thickness of the metal usually employed for pumps to save the charge of repairs because he had observed that the water was so hard as he called it that it corroded the lead very soon the following instance is related by sir george baker20 a gentleman was the father of a numerous offspring having had oneandtwenty children of whom eight died young and thirteen survived their parents during their infancy and indeed until they had quitted the place of their usual residence they were all remarkably unhealthy being particularly subject to disorders of the stomach and bowels the father during many years was paralytic the mother for a long time was subject to colics and bilious obstructions after the death of the parents the family sold the house which they had so long inhabited the purchaser found it necessary to repair the pump this was made of lead which upon examination was found to be so corroded that several perforations were observed in the cylinder in which the bucket plays and the cistern in the upper part was reduced to the thinness of common brown paper and was full of holes like a sieve i have myself seen numerous instances where leaden cisterns have been completely corroded by the action of water with which they were in contact and there is perhaps not a plumber who cannot give testimony of having experienced numerous similar instances in the practice of his trade i have been frequently called upon to examine leaden cisterns which had become leaky on account of the action of the water which they contained and i could adduce an instance of a legal controversy having taken place to settle the disputes between the proprietors of an estate and a plumber originating from a similar causethe plumber being accused of having furnished a faulty reservoir whereas the case was proved to be owing to the chemical action of the water on the lead water containing a large quantity of common air and carbonic acid gas always acts very sensibly on metallic lead water which has no sensible action in its natural state upon lead may acquire the capability of acting on it by heterogeneous matter which it may accidentally receive numerous instances have shewn that vegetable matter such as leaves falling into leaden cisterns filled with water imparted to the water a considerable solvent power of action on the lead which in its natural state it did not possess hence the necessity of keeping leaden cisterns clean and this is the more necessary as their situations expose them to accidental impurities the noted saturnine colic of amsterdam described by tronchin originated from such a circumstance as also the case related by van swieten21 of a whole family afflicted with the same complaint from such a cistern and it is highly probable that the case of disease recorded by dr duncan22 proceeded more from some foulness in the cistern than from the solvent power of the water in this instance the officers of the packet boat used water for their drink and cooking out of a leaden cistern whilst the sailors used the water taken from the same source except that theirs was kept in wooden vessels the consequence was that all the officers were seized with the colic and all the men continued healthy the carelessness of the bulk of mankind dr lambe very justly observes to these things is so great that to repeat them again and again cannot be wholly useless although the great majority of persons who daily use water kept in leaden cisterns receive no sensible injury yet the apparent salubrity must be ascribed to the great slowness of its operation and the minuteness of the dose taken the effects of which become modified by different causes and different constitutions and according to the predisposition to diseases inherent in different individuals the supposed security of the multitude who use the water with impunity amounts to no more than presumption in favour of any individual which may or may not be confirmed by experience independent of the morbid susceptibility of impressions which distinguish certain habits there is besides much variety in the original constitution of the human frame of which we are totally ignorant the susceptibility or proneness to disease of each individual must be esteemed peculiar to himself confiding to the experience of others is a ground of security which may prove fallacious and the danger can with certainty be obviated only by avoiding its source and considering the various and complicated changes of the human frame under different circumstances and at different ages it is neither impossible nor improbable that the substances taken into the system at one period and even for a series of years with apparent impunity may notwithstanding at another period be eventually the occasion of disease and of death the experience of a single person or of many persons however numerous is quite incompetent to the decision of a question of this nature the pernicious effects of an intemperate use of spiritous liquors is not less certain because we often see habitual drunkards enjoy a state of good health and arrive at old age and the same may be said of individuals who indulge in vices of all kinds evidently destructive to life many of whom in spite of their bad habits attain to a vigorous old age23 in confirmation of these remarks we adduce the following account of the effect of water contaminated by lead given by sir g baker the most remarkable case on the subject that now occurs to my memory is that of lord ashburnhams family in sussex to which spring water was supplied from a considerable distance in leaden pipes in consequence his lordships servants were every year tormented with colic and some of them died an eminent physician of battle who corresponded with me on the subject sent up some gallons of that water which were analysed by dr higgins who reported that the water had contained more than the common quantity of carbonic acid and that he found in it lead in solution which he attributed to the carbonic acid in consequence of this lord ashburnham substituted wooden for leaden pipes and from that time his family have had no particular complaints in their bowels richmond sept 27 1802 method of detecting lead when contained in water one of the most delicate tests for detecting lead is water impregnated with sulphuretted hydrogen gas which instantly imparts to the fluid containing the minutest quantity of lead a brown or blackish tinge this test is so delicate that distilled water when condensed by a leaden pipe in a still tub is affected by it to shew the action of this test the following experiments will serve experiment pour into a wineglass containing distilled water an equal quantity of water impregnated with sulphuretted hydrogen gas no change will take place but if a 14 of a grain of acetate of lead sugar of lead of commerce or any other preparation of lead be added the mixture will instantly turn brown and darkcoloured to apply this test one part of the suspected water need merely to be mingled with a like quantity of water impregnated with sulphuretted hydrogen or better a larger quantity a gallon for example of the water may be concentrated by evaporation to about half a pint and then submitted to the action of the test another and more efficient mode of applying this test is to pass a current of sulphuretted hydrogen gas through the suspected water in the following manner experiment illustration take a bottle a or florence flask adapt to the mouth of it a cork furnished with a glass tube b bent at right angles let one leg of the tube be immersed in the vial c containing the water to be examined as shewn in the following sketch then take one part of sulphuret of antimony of commerce break it into pieces of half the size of split pease put it into the flask and pour upon it four parts of common concentrated muriatic acid spirit of salt of commerce sulphuretted hydrogen gas will become disengaged from the materials in abundance and pass through the water in the vial c let the extrication of the gas be continued for about five minutes and if the minutest quantity of lead be present the water will acquire a darkbrown or blackish tinge the extrication of the gas is facilitated by the application of a gentle heat the action of the sulphuretted hydrogen test when applied in this manner is astonishingly great for one part of acetate of lead may be detected by means of it in 20000 parts of water24 another test for readily detecting lead in water is sulphuretted chyazate of potash first pointed out as such by mr porret a few drops of this reagent added to water containing lead occasion a white precipitate consisting of small brilliant scales of a considerable lustre sulphate of potash or sulphate of soda is likewise a very delicate test for detecting minute portions of lead dr thomson25 discovered by means of it one part of lead in 100000 parts of water and this acute philosopher considers it as the most unequivocal test of lead that we possess dr thomson remarks that no other precipitate can well be confounded with it except sulphate of barytes and there is no probability of the presence of barytes existing in common water carbonate of potash or carbonate of soda may also be used as agents to detect the presence of lead by means of these salts dr thomson was enabled to detect the presence of a smaller quantity of lead in distilled water than by the action of sulphuretted hydrogen but the reader must here be told that the use of these tests cannot be entrusted to an unskilful hand because the alkaline carbonates throw down also lime and magnesia two substances which are frequently found in common water the former tests namely water impregnated with sulphuretted hydrogen gas and nascent sulphuretted hydrogen are therefore preferable it is absolutely essential that the water impregnated with sulphuretted hydrogen when employed as a test for detecting very minute quantities of lead be fresh prepared and if sulphate of potash or sulphate of soda be used as tests they should be perfectly pure sulphate of potash is preferable to sulphate of soda it is likewise advisable to act with these tests upon water concentrated by boiling the water to which the test has been added does sometimes appear not to undergo any change at first it is therefore necessary to suffer the mixture to stand for a few hours after which time the action of the test will be more evident mr silvester26 has proposed gallic acid as a delicate test for detecting lead footnotes 11 dalton manchester memoirs vol iv p 55 12 marsdens history of sumatra 13 manchester memoirs vol x 1819 14 observations on the water with which tunbridge wells is chiefly supplied for

p 33 310 adulteration of wine it is sufficiently obvious that few of those commodities which are the objects of commerce are adulterated to a greater extent than wine all persons moderately conversant with the subject are aware that a portion of alum is added to young and meagre red wines for the purpose of brightening their colour that brazil wood or the husks of elderberries and bilberries27 are employed to impart a deep rich purple tint to red port of a pale faint colour that gypsum is used to render cloudy white wines transparent28 that an additional astringency is imparted to immature red wines by means of oakwood sawdust29 and the husks of filberts and that a mixture of spoiled foreign and homemade wines is converted into the wretched compound frequently sold in this town by the name of genuine old port various expedients are resorted to for the purpose of communicating particular flavours to insipid wines thus a nutty flavour is produced by bitter almonds factitious port wine is flavoured with a tincture drawn from the seeds of raisins and the ingredients employed to form the bouquet of highflavoured wines are sweetbrier orisroot clary cherry laurel water and elderflowers the flavouring ingredients used by manufacturers may all be purchased by those dealers in wine who are initiated in the mysteries of the trade and even a manuscript recipe book for preparing them and the whole mystery of managing all sorts of wines may be obtained on payment of a considerable fee the sophistication of wine with substances not absolutely noxious to health is carried to an enormous extent in this metropolis many thousand pipes of spoiled cyder are annually brought hither from the country for the purpose of being converted into factitious port wine the art of manufacturing spurious wine is a regular trade of great extent in this metropolis there is in this city a certain fraternity of chemical operators who work underground in holes caverns and dark retirements to conceal their mysteries from the eyes and observation of mankind these subterraneous philosophers are daily employed in the transmutation of liquors and by the power of magical drugs and incantations raising under the streets of london the choicest products of the hills and valleys of france they can squeeze bourdeaux out of the sloe and draw champagne from an apple virgil in that remarkable prophecy incultisque ruhens pendebit sentibus uva virg ecl iv 29 the ripening grape shall hang on every thorn seems to have hinted at this art which can turn a plantation of northern hedges into a vineyard these adepts are known among one another by the name of winebrewers and i am afraid do great injury not only to her majestys customs but to the bodies of many of her good subjects30 the following are a few of the recipes employed in the manufacture of spurious wine to make british port wine31take of british grape wine or good cyder 4 gallons of the juice of red beet root two quarts brandy two quarts logwood 4 ounces rhatany root bruised half a pound first infuse the logwood and rhatany root in brandy and a gallon of grape wine or cyder for one week then strain off the liquor and mix it with the other ingredients keep it in a cask for a month when it will be fit to bottle british champagnetake of white sugar 8 pounds the whitest brown sugar 7 pounds crystalline lemon acid or tartaric acid 1 ounce and a quarter pure water 8 gallons white grape wine two quarts or perry 4 quarts of french brandy 3 pints put the sugar in the water skimming it occasionally for two hours then pour it into a tub and dissolve in it the acid before it is cold add some yeast and ferment put it into a clean cask and add the other ingredients the cask is then to be well bunged and kept in a cool place for two or three months then bottle it and keep it cool for a month longer when it will be fit for use if it should not be perfectly clear after standing in the cask two or three months it should be rendered so by the use of isinglass by adding 1 lb of fresh or preserved strawberries and 2 ounces of powdered cochineal the pink champagne may be made southampton port32take cyder 36 gallons elder wine 11 gallons brandy 5 gallons damson wine 11 gallons mix the particular and separate department in this factitious wine trade called crusting consists in lining the interior surface of empty winebottles in part with a red crust of supertartrate of potash by suffering a saturated hot solution of this salt coloured red with a decoction of brazilwood to crystallize within them and after this simulation of maturity is perfected they are filled with the compound called port wine other artisans are regularly employed in staining the lower extremities of bottlecorks with a fine red colour to appear on being drawn as if they had been long in contact with the wine the preparation of an astringent extract to produce from spoiled homemade and foreign wines a genuine old port by mere admixture or to impart to a weak wine a rough austere taste a fine colour and a peculiar flavour forms one branch of the business of particular winecoopers while the mellowing and restoring of spoiled white wines is the sole occupation of men who are called refiners of wine we have stated that a crystalline crust is formed on the interior surface of bottles for the purpose of misleading the unwary into a belief that the wine contained in them is of a certain age a correspondent operation is performed on the wooden cask the whole interior of which is stained artificially with a crystalline crust of supertartrate of potash artfully affixed in a manner precisely similar to that before stated thus the winemerchant after bottling off a pipe of wine is enabled to impose on the understanding of his customers by taking to pieces the cask and exhibiting the beautiful dark coloured and fine crystalline crust as an indubitable proof of the age of the wine a practice by no means uncommon to flatter the vanity of those who pride themselves in their acute discrimination of wines these and many other sophistications which have long been practised with impunity are considered as legitimate by those who pride themselves for their skill in the art of managing or according to the familiar phrase doctoring wines the plea alleged in exculpation of them is that though deceptive they are harmless but even admitting this as a palliation yet they form only one department of an art which includes other processes of a tendency absolutely criminal several wellauthenticated facts have convinced me that the adulteration of wine with substances deleterious to health is certainly practised oftener than is perhaps suspected and it would be easy to give some instances of very serious effects having arisen from wines contaminated with deleterious substances were this a subject on which i meant to speak the following statement is copied from the monthly magazine for march 1811 p 188 on the 17th of january the passengers by the highflyer coach from the north dined as usual at newark a bottle of port wine was ordered on tasting which one of the passengers observed that it had an unpleasant flavour and begged that it might be changed the waiter took away the bottle poured into a fresh decanter half the wine which had been objected to and filled it up from another bottle this he took into the room and the greater part was drank by the passengers who after the coach had set out towards grantham were seized with extreme sickness one gentleman in particular who had taken more of the wine than the others it was thought would have died but has since recovered the half of the bottle of wine sent out of the passengers room was put aside for the purpose of mixing negus in the evening mr bland of newark went into the hotel and drank a glass or two of wine and water he returned home at his usual hour and went to bed in the middle of the night he was taken so ill as to induce mrs bland to send for his brother an apothecary in the town but before that gentleman arrived he was dead an inquest was held and the jury after the fullest enquiry and the examination of the surgeons by whom the body was opened returned a verdict ofdied by poison the most dangerous adulteration of wine is by some preparations of lead which possess the property of stopping the progress of acescence of wine and also of rendering white wines when muddy transparent i have good reason to state that lead is certainly employed for this purpose the effect is very rapid and there appears to be no other method known of rapidly recovering ropy wines wine merchants persuade themselves that the minute quantity of lead employed for that purpose is perfectly harmless and that no atom of lead remains in the wine chemical analysis proves the contrary and the practice of clarifying spoiled white wines by means of lead must be pronounced as highly deleterious lead in whatever state it be taken into the stomach occasions terrible diseases and wine adulterated with the minutest quantity of it becomes a slow poison the merchant or dealer who practises this dangerous sophistication adds the crime of murder to that of fraud and deliberately scatters the seeds of disease and death among those consumers who contribute to his emolument if to debase the current coin of the realm be denounced as a capital offence what punishment should be awarded against a practice which converts into poison a liquor used for sacred purposes dr watson33 relates that the method of adulterating wine with lead was at one time a common practice in paris dr warren34 states an instance of thirtytwo persons having become severely ill after drinking white wine that had been adulterated with lead one of them died and one became paralytic in grahams treatise on winemaking35 under the article of secrets belonging to the mysteries of vintners p 31 lead is recommended to prevent wine from becoming acid the following lines are copied from mr grahams work to hinder wine from turning put a pound of melted lead in fair water into your cask pretty warm and stop it close to soften grey wine put in a little vinegar wherein litharge has been well steeped and boil some honey to draw out the wax strain it through a cloth and put a quart of it into a tierce of wine and this will mend it the ancients knew that lead rendered harsh wines milder and preserved it from acidity without being aware that it was pernicious it was therefore long used with confidence and when its effects were discovered they were not ascribed to that metal but to some other cause36 when the greek and roman wine merchants wished to try whether their wine was spoiled they immersed in it a plate of lead37 if the colour of the lead were corroded they concluded that their wine was spoiled wine may become accidentally impregnated with lead it is well known that bottles in which wine has been kept are usually cleaned by means of shot which by its rolling motion detaches the supertartrate of potash from the sides of the bottles this practice which is generally pursued by winemerchants may give rise to serious consequences as will become evident from the following case38 a gentleman who had never in his life experienced a days illness and who was constantly in the habit of drinking half a bottle of madeira wine after his dinner was taken ill three hours after dinner with a severe pain in the stomach and violent bowel colic which gradually yielded within twelve hours to the remedies prescribed by his medical adviser the day following he drank the remainder of the same bottle of wine which was left the preceding day and within two hours afterwards he was again seized with the most violent colliquative pains headach shiverings and great pain over the whole body his apothecary becoming suspicious that the wine he had drank might be the cause of the disease ordered the bottle from which the wine had been decanted to be brought to him with a view that he might examine the dregs if any were left the bottle happening to slip out of the hand of the servant disclosed a row of shot wedged forcibly into the angular bentup circumference of it on examining the beads of shot they crumbled into dust the outer crust defended by a coat of black lead with which the shot is glazed being alone left unacted on whilst the remainder of the metal was dissolved the wine therefore had become contaminated with lead and arsenic the shot being a compound of these metals which no doubt had produced the mischief test for detecting the deleterious adulterations of wine a ready reagent for detecting the presence of lead or any other deleterious metal in wine is known by the name of the wine test it consists of water saturated with sulphuretted hydrogen gas acidulated with muriatic acid by adding one part of it to two of wine or any other liquid suspected to contain lead a dark coloured or black precipitate will fall down which does not disappear by an addition of muriatic acid and this precipitate dried and fused before the blowpipe on a piece of charcoal yields a globule of metallic lead this test does not precipitate iron the muriatic acid retains iron in solution when combined with sulphuretted hydrogen and any acid in the wine has no effect in precipitating any of the sulphur of the test liquor or a still more efficacious method is to pass a current of sulphuretted hydrogen gas through the wine in the manner described p 70 having previously acidulated the wine with muriatic acid the wine test sometimes employed is prepared in the following mannermix equal parts of finely powdered sulphur and of slacked quicklime and expose it to a red heat for twenty minutes to thirtysix grains of this sulphuret of lime add twentysix grains of supertartrate of potassa put the mixture into an ounce bottle and fill up the bottle with water that has been previously boiled and suffered to cool the liquor after having been repeatedly shaken and allowed to become clear by the subsidence of the undissolved matter may then be poured into another phial into which about twenty drops of muriatic acid have been previously put it is then ready for use this test when mingled with wine containing lead or copper turns the wine of a darkbrown or black colour but the mere application of sulphuretted hydrogen gas to wine acidulated by muriatic acid is a far more preferable mode of detecting lead in wine m vogel39 has lately recommended acetate of lead as a test for detecting extraneous colours in red wine he remarks that none of the substances that can be employed for colouring wine such as the berries of the vaccinium mirtillus bilberries elderberries and campeach wood produce with genuine red wine a greenish grey precipitate which is the colour that is procured by this test by means of genuine red wines wine coloured with the juice of the bilberries or elderberries or campeach wood produces with acetate of lead a deep blue precipitate and brazilwood red saunders and the red beet produce a colour which is precipitated red by acetate of lead wine coloured by beet root is also rendered colourless by lime water but the weakest acid brings back the colour as the colouring matter of red wines resides in the skin of the grape m vogel prepared a quantity of skins and reduced them to powder in this state he found that they communicated to alcohol a deep red colour a paper stained with this colour was rendered red by acids and green by alkalies m vogel made a quantity of red wine from black grapes for the purpose of his experiments and this produced the genuine greyish green precipitate with acetate of lead he also found the same coloured precipitate in two specimens of red wine the genuineness of which could not be suspected the one from chateaumarguaux and the other from the neighbourhood of coblentz specific differences and component parts of wine every body knows that no product of the arts varies so much as wine that different countries and sometimes the different provinces of the same country produce different wines these differences no doubt must be attributed chiefly to the climate in which the vineyard is situatedto its culturethe quantity of sugar contained in the grape juicethe manufacture of the wine or the mode of suffering its fermentation to be accomplished if the grapes be gathered unripe the wine abounds with acid but if the fruit be gathered ripe the wine will be rich when the proportion of sugar in the grape is sufficient and the fermentation complete the wine is perfect and generous if the quantity of sugar be too large part of it remains undecomposed as the fermentation is languid and the wine is sweet and luscious if on the contrary it contains even when full ripe only a small portion of sugar the wine is thin and weak and if it be bottled before the fermentation be completed part of the sugar remains undecomposed the fermentation will go on slowly in the bottle and on drawing the cork the wine sparkles in the glass as for example champagne such wines are not sufficiently mature when the must is separated from the husk of the red grape before it is fermented the wine has little or no colour these are called white wines if on the contrary the husks are allowed to remain in the must while the fermentation is going on the alcohol dissolves the colouring matter of the husks and the wine is coloured such are called red wines hence white wines are often prepared from red grapes the liquor being drawn off before it has acquired the red colour for the skin of the grape only gives the colour besides in these principal circumstances wines vary much in flavour all wines contain one common and identical principle from which their similar effects are produced namely brandy or alcohol it is especially by the different proportions of brandy contained in wines that they differ most from one another when wine is distilled the alcohol readily separates the spirit thus obtained is well known under the name of brandy all wines contain also a free acid hence they turn blue tincture of cabbage red the acid found in the greatest abundance in grape wines is tartaric acid every wine contains likewise a portion of supertartrate of potash and extractive matter derived from the juice of the grape these substances deposit slowly in the vessel in which they are kept to this is owing the improvement of wine from age those wines which effervesce or froth when poured into a glass contain also carbonic acid to which their briskness is owing the peculiar flavour and odour of different kinds of wines probably depend upon the presence of a volatile oil so small in quantity that it cannot be separated easy method of ascertaining the quantity of brandy contained in various sorts of wine the strength of all wines depends upon the quantity of alcohol or brandy which they contain mr brande and gaylussac have proved by very decisive experiments that all wines contain brandy or alcohol ready formed the following is the process discovered by mr brande for ascertaining the quantity of spirit or brandy contained in different sorts of wine experiment add to eight parts by measure of the wine to be examined one part of a concentrated solution of subacetate of lead a dense insoluble precipitate will ensue which is a combination of the test liquor with the colouring extractive and acid matter of the wine shake the mixture for a few minutes pour the whole upon a filtre and collect the filtered fluid it contains the brandy or spirit and water of the wine together with a portion of the subacetate of lead add in small quantities at a time to this fluid warm dry and pure subcarbonate of potash not salt of tartar or subcarbonate of potash of commerce which has previously been freed from water by heat till the last portion added remains undissolved the brandy or spirit contained in the fluid will become separated for the subcarbonate of potash abstracts from it the whole of the water with which it was combined the brandy or spirit of wine forming a distinct stratum which floats upon the aqueous solution of the alkaline salt if the experiment be made in a glass tube from onehalf inch to two inches in diameter and graduated into 100 equal parts the per centage of spirit in a given

a vinous liquor is obtained of such we have in this country the gooseberry the currant the elderberry the cherry c which ferment well and affords what are called homemade wines they differ chiefly from foreign wines in containing a much larger quantity of acid dr macculloch42 has remarked that the acid in homemade wines is principally the malic acid while in grape wines it is the tartaric acid the great deficiency in these wines independent of the flavour which chiefly originates not from the juice but from the seeds and husks of the fruits is the excess of acid which is but imperfectly concealed by the addition of sugar this is owing chiefly as dr macculloch remarks to the tartaric acid existing in the grape juice in the state of supertartrate of potash which is in part decomposed during the fermentation and the rest becomes gradually precipitated whilst the malic acid exists in the currant and gooseberry juice in the form of malate of potash which salt does not appear to suffer a decomposition during the fermentation of the wine and by its greater solubility is retained in the wine hence dr macculloch recommends the addition of supertartrate of potash in the manufacture of british wines they also contain a much larger proportion of mucilage than wines made from grapes the juice of the gooseberry contains some portion of tartaric acid hence it is better suited for the production of what is called english champagne than any other fruit of this country footnotes 27 dried bilberries are imported from germany under the fallacious name of berrydye 28 the

this country on the manufacture of homemade wines adulteration of bread this is one of the sophistications of the articles of food most commonly practised in this metropolis where the goodness of bread is estimated entirely by its whiteness it is therefore usual to add a certain quantity of alum to the dough this improves the look of the bread very much and renders it whiter and firmer good white and porous bread may certainly be manufactured from good wheaten flour alone but to produce the degree of whiteness rendered indispensable by the caprice of the consumers in london it is necessary unless the very best flour is employed that the dough should be bleached and no substance has hitherto been found to answer this purpose better than alum without this salt it is impossible to make bread from the kind of flour usually employed by the london bakers so white as that which is commonly sold in the metropolis if the alum be omitted the bread has a slight yellowish grey hueas may be seen in the instance of what is called homemade bread of private families such bread remains longer moist than bread made with alum yet it is not so light and full of eyes or porous and it has also a different taste the quantity of alum requisite to produce the required whiteness and porosity depends entirely upon the genuineness of the flour and the quality of the grain from which the flour is obtained the mealman makes different sorts of flour from the same kind of grain the best flour is mostly used by the biscuit bakers and pastry cooks and the inferior sorts in the making of bread the bakers flour is very often made of the worst kinds of damaged foreign wheat and other cereal grains mixed with them in grinding the wheat into flour in this capital no fewer than six distinct kinds of wheaten flour are brought into market they are called fine flour seconds middlings fine middlings coarse middlings and twentypenny flour common garden beans and pease are also frequently ground up among the london bread flour i have been assured by several bakers on whose testimony i can rely that the small profit attached to the bakers trade and the bad quality of the flour induces the generality of the london bakers to use alum in the making of their bread the smallest quantity of alum that can be employed with effect to produce a white light and porous bread from an inferior kind of flour i have my own bakers authority to state is from three to four ounces to a sack of flour weighing 240 pounds the alum is either mixed well in the form of powder with a quantity of flour previously made into a liquid paste with water and then incorporated with the dough or the alum is dissolved in the water employed for mixing up the whole quantity of the flour for making the dough let us suppose that the baker intends to convert five bushels or a sack of flour into loaves with the least adulteration practised he pours the flour into the kneading trough and sifts it through a fine wire sieve which makes it lie very light and serves to separate any impurities with which the flour may be mixed two ounces of alum are then dissolved in about a quart of boiling water and the solution poured into the seasoningtub four or five pounds of salt are likewise put into the tub and a pailful of hotwater when this mixture has cooled down to the temperature of about 84 three or four pints of yeast are added the whole is mixed strained through the seasoning sieve emptied into a hole in the flour and mixed up with the requisite portion of it to the consistence of a thick batter some dry flour is then sprinkled over the top and it is covered up with cloths in this situation it is left about three hours it gradually swells and breaks through the dry flour scattered on its surface an additional quantity of warm water in which one ounce of alum is dissolved is now added and the dough is made up into a paste as before the whole is then covered up in this situation it is left for a few hours the whole is then intimately kneaded with more water for upwards of an hour the dough is cut into pieces with a knife and penned to one side of the trough some dry flour is sprinkled over it and it is left in this state for about four hours it is then kneaded again for halfanhour the dough is now cut into pieces and weighed in order to furnish the requisite quantity for each loaf the loaves are left in the oven about two hours and a half when taken out they are carefully covered up to prevent as much as possible the loss of weight43 the following account of making a sack of five bushels of flour into bread is taken from dr p markhams considerations on the ingredients used in the adulteration of bread flour and bread p 21 5 bushels of flour 8 ounces of alum44 4 lbs of salt 12 a gallon of yeast mixed with about 3 gallons of water lbs the whole quantity of breadflour obtained from the bushel of wheat weighs 48 lbs fine pollard 414 coarse pollard 4 bran 234 11 the whole together 59 to which add the loss of weight in manufacturing a bushel of wheat 2 produces the original weight 61 the theory of the bleaching property of alum as manifested in the panification of an inferior kind of flour is by no means well understood and indeed it is really surprising that the effect should be produced by so small a quantity of that substance two or three ounces of alum being sufficient for a sack of flour from experiments in which i have been employed with the assistance of skilful bakers i am authorised to state that without the addition of alum it does not appear possible to make white light and porous bread such as is used in this metropolis unless the flour be of the very best quality another substance employed by fraudulent bakers is subcarbonate of ammonia with this salt they realise the important consideration of producing light and porous bread from spoiled or what is technically called sour flour this salt which becomes wholly converted into a gaseous state during the operation of baking causes the dough to swell up into air bubbles which carry before them the stiff dough and thus it renders the dough porous the salt itself is at the same time totally volatilised during the operation of baking thus not a vestige of carbonate of ammonia remains in the bread this salt is also largely employed by the biscuit and gingerbread bakers potatoes are likewise largely and perhaps constantly used by fraudulent bakers as a cheap ingredient to enhance their profit the potatoes being boiled are triturated passed through a sieve and incorporated with the dough by kneading this adulteration does not materially injure the bread the bakers assert that the bad quality of the flour renders the addition of potatoes advantageous as well to the baker as to the purchaser and that without this admixture in the manufacture of bread it would be impossible to carry on the trade of a baker but the grievance is that the same price is taken for a potatoe loaf as for a loaf of genuine bread though it must cost the baker less i have witness that five bushels of flour three ounces of alum six pounds of salt one bushel of potatoes boiled into a stiff paste and three quarts of yeast with the requisite quantity of water produce a white light and highly palatable bread such are the artifices practised in the preparation of bread45 and it must be allowed on contrasting them with those sophistications practised by manufacturers of other articles of food that they are comparatively unimportant however some medical men have no hesitation in attributing many diseases incidental to children to the use of eating adulterated bread others again will not admit these allegations they persuade themselves that the small quantity of alum added to the bread perhaps upon an average from eight to ten grains to a quartern loaf is absolutely harmless dr edmund davy professor of chemistry at the cork institution has communicated the following important facts to the public concerning the manufacture of bread the carbonate of magnesia of the shops when well mixed with flour in the proportion of from twenty to forty grains to a pound of flour materially improves it for the purpose of making bread loaves made with the addition of carbonate of magnesia rise well in the oven and after being baked the bread is light and spongy has a good taste and keeps well in cases when the new flour is of an indifferent quality from twenty to thirty grains of carbonate of magnesia to a pound of the flour will considerably improve the bread when the flour is of the worst quality forty grains to a pound of flour seem necessary to produce the same effect as the improvement in the bread from new flour depends upon the carbonate of magnesia it is necessary that care should be taken to mix it intimately with the flour previous to the making of the dough mr davy made a great number of comparative experiments with other substances mixed in different proportions with new bread flour the fixed alkalies both in their pure and carbonated state when used in small quantity to a certain extent were found to improve the bread made from new flour but no substance was so efficacious in this respect as carbonate of magnesia the greater number of his experiments were performed on the worst new seconds flour mr davy could procure he also made some trials on seconds and firsts of different quality in some cases the results were more striking and satisfactory than in others but in every instance the improvement of the bread by carbonate of magnesia was obvious mr davy observes that a pound of carbonate of magnesia would be sufficient to mix with two hundred and fiftysix pounds of new flour or at the rate of thirty grains to the pound and supposing a pound of carbonate of magnesia to cost halfacrown the additional expense would be only half a farthing in the pound of flour mr davy conceives that not the slightest danger can be apprehended from the use of such an innocent substance as the carbonate of magnesia in such small proportion as is necessary to improve bread from new flour method of detecting the presence of alum in bread pour upon two ounces of the suspected bread half a pint of boiling distilled water boil the mixture for a few minutes and filter it through unsized paper evaporate the fluid to about one fourth of its original bulk and let gradually fall into the clear fluid a solution of muriate of barytes if a copious white precipitate ensues which does not disappear by the addition of pure nitric acid the presence of alum may be suspected bread made without alum produces when assayed in this manner merely a very slight precipitate which originates from a minute portion of sulphate of magnesia contained in all common salt of commerce and bread made with salt freed from sulphate of magnesia produces an infusion with water which does not become disturbed by the barytic test other means of detecting all the constituent parts of alum namely the alumine sulphuric acid and potash so as to render the presence of the alum unequivocal will readily suggest itself to those who are familiar with analytical chemistry namely one of the readiest means is to decompose the vegetable matter of the bread by the action of chlorate of potash in a platina crucible at a red heat and then to assay the residuary massby means of muriate of barytes for sulphuric acid by ammonia for alumine and by muriate of platina for potash46 the above method of detecting the presence of alum must therefore be taken with some limitation there is no unequivocal test for detecting in a ready manner the presence of alum in bread on account of the impurity of the common salt used in the making of bread if we could in the ordinary way of bread making employ common salt absolutely free from foreign saline substances the mode of detecting the presence of alum or at least one of its constituent parts namely the sulphuric acid would be very easy some conjecture may nevertheless be formed of the presence or absence of alum by assaying the infusion of bread in the manner stated p 109 and comparing the assay with the results afforded by an infusion of homemade or household bread known to be genuine and actually assayed in a similar manner easy method of judging of the goodness of bread corn and breadflour millers judge of the goodness of bread corn by the quantity of bran which the grain produces such grains as are full and plump that have a bright and shining appearance without any shrivelling and shrinking in the covering of the skin are the best for wrinkled grains have a greater quantity of skin or bran than such as are sound or plump pastrycooks and bakers judge of the goodness of flour in the manner in which it comports itself in kneading the best kind of wheaten flour assumes at the instant it is formed into paste by the addition of water a very gluey ductile and elastic paste easy to be kneaded and which may be elongated flattened and drawn in every direction without breaking for the following fact we are indebted to mr hatchet grain which has been heated or burnt in the stack may in the following manner be rendered fit for being made into bread the wheat must be put into a vessel capable of holding at least three times the quantity and the vessel filled with boiling water the grain should then be occasionally stirred and the hollow decayed grains which float may be removed when the water has become cold or in about half an hour it is drawn off then rince the corn with cold water and having completely drained it spread it thinly on the floor of a kiln and thus thoroughly dry it stirring and turning it frequently during this part of the process47 footnotes 43 the sack of marketable flour is by law obliged to weigh 240 pounds which is the produce of five bushels of wheat and is upon an average supposed to make eighty quartern loaves of bread and consequently sixteen of such loaves are made from each bushel of good wheat it is admitted however that two or three loaves more than the above quantity can be made from the sack of flour when it is the genuine produce of good wheat that is in the proportion of about sixteen and a half loaves from each bushel of sound grain and it may be presumed sixteen from a bushel of medium corn the expense in london of making the sack of flour into bread and disposing of it is about nine shillings a bushel of wheat upon an average weighs sixtyone pounds when ground the meal weighs 6034 lbs which on being dressed produces 4634 lbs of flour of the sort called seconds which alone is used for the making of bread in london and throughout the greater part of this country and of pollard and bran 1234 lbs which quantity when bolted produces 3 lbs of fine flour this when sifted produces in good second flour 114 lb 44 whilst correcting this sheet for the press the printer

particularly porter the favourite beverage of the inhabitants of london and of other large towns is amongst those articles in the manufacture of which the greatest frauds are frequently committed the statute prohibits the brewer from using any ingredients in his brewings except malt and hops but it too often happens that those who suppose they are drinking a nutritious beverage made of these ingredients only are entirely deceived the beverage may in fact be neither more nor less than a compound of the most deleterious substances and it is also clear that all ranks of society are alike exposed to the nefarious fraud the proofs of this statement will be shewn hereafter48 the author49 of a practical treatise on brewing which has run through eleven editions after having stated the various ingredients for brewing porter observes that however much they may surprise however pernicious or disagreeable they may appear he has always found them requisite in the brewing of porter and he thinks they must invariably be used by those who wish to continue the taste flavour and appearance of the beer50 and though several acts of parliament have been passed to prevent porter brewers from using many of them yet the author can affirm from experience he could never produce the present flavoured porter without them51 the intoxicating qualities of porter are to be ascribed to the various drugs intermixed with it it is evident some porter is more heady than other and it arises from the greater or less quantity of stupifying ingredients malt to produce intoxication must be used in such large quantities as would very much diminish if not totally exclude the brewers profit the practice of adulterating beer appears to be of early date by an act so long ago as queen anne the brewers are prohibited from mixing cocculus indicus or any unwholesome ingredients in their beer under severe penalties but few instances of convictions under this act are to be met with in the public records for nearly a century to shew that they have augmented in our own days we shall exhibit an abstract from documents laid lately before parliament52 these will not only amply prove that unwholesome ingredients are used by fraudulent brewers and that very deleterious substances are also vended both to brewers and publicans for adulterating beer but that the ingredients mixed up in the brewers enchanting cauldron are placed above all competition even with the potent charms of macbeths witches root of hemlock diggd i the dark for a charm of powrful trouble like a hellbroth boil and bubble double double toil and trouble fire burn and cauldron bubble the fraud of imparting to porter and ale an intoxicating quality by narcotic substances appears to have flourished during the period of the late french war for if we examine the importation lists of drugs it will be noticed that the quantities of cocculus indicus imported in a given time prior to that period will bear no comparison with the quantity imported in the same space of time during the war although an additional duty was laid upon this commodity such has been the amount brought into this country in five years that it far exceeds the quantity imported during twelve years anterior to the above epoch the price of this drug has risen within these ten years from two shillings to seven shillings the pound it was at the period to which we have alluded that the preparation of an extract of cocculus indicus first appeared as a new saleable commodity in the pricecurrents of brewersdruggists it was at the same time also that a mr jackson of notorious memory fell upon the idea of brewing beer from various drugs without any malt and hops this chemist did not turn brewer himself but he struck out the more profitable trade of teaching his mystery to the brewers for a handsome fee from that time forwards written directions and recipebooks for using the chemical preparations to be substituted for malt and hops were respectively sold and many adepts soon afterwards appeared every where to instruct brewers in the nefarious practice first pointed out by mr jackson from that time also the fraternity of brewerschemists took its rise they made it their chief business to send travellers all over the country with lists and samples exhibiting the price and quality of the articles manufactured by them for the use of brewers only their trade spread far and wide but it was amongst the country brewers chiefly that they found the most customers and it is amongst them up to the present day as i am assured by some of these operators on whose veracity i can rely that the greatest quantities of unlawful ingredients are sold the act of parliament53 prohibits chemists grocers and druggists from supplying illegal ingredients to brewers under a heavy penalty as is obvious from the following abstract of the act no druggist vender of or dealer in drugs or chemist or other person shall sell or deliver to any licensed brewer dealer in or retailer of beer knowing him to be such or shall sell or deliver to any person on account of or in trust for any such brewer dealer or retailer any liquor called by

brewer 20l porter the method of brewing porter has not been the same at all times as it is at present at first the only essential difference in the methods of brewing this liquor and that of other kinds of beer was that porter was brewed from brown malt only and this gave to it both the colour and flavour required of late years it has been brewed from mixtures of pale and brown malt these at some establishments are mashed separately and the worts from each are afterwards mixed together the proportion of pale and brown malt used for brewing porter varies in different breweries some employ nearly two parts of pale malt and one part of brown malt but each brewer appears to have his own proportion which the intelligent manufacturer varies according to the nature and qualities of the malt three pounds of hops are upon an average allowed to every barrel thirtysix gallons of porter when the price of malt on account of the great increase in the price of barley during the late war was very high the london brewers discovered that a larger quantity of wort of a given strength could be obtained from pale malt than from brown malt they therefore increased the quantity of the former and diminished that of the latter this produced beer of a paler colour and of a less bitter flavour to remedy these disadvantages they invented an artificial colouring substance prepared by boiling brown sugar till it acquired a very dark brown colour a solution of which was employed to darken the colour of the beer some brewers made use of the infusion of malt instead of sugar colouring to impart to the beer a bitter taste the fraudulent brewer employed quassia wood and wormwood as a substitute for hops but as the colouring of beer by means of sugar became in many instances a pretext for using illegal ingredients the legislature apprehensive from the mischief that might and actually did result from it passed an act prohibiting the use of burnt sugar in july 1817 and nothing but malt and hops is now allowed to enter into the composition of beer even the use of isinglass for clarifying beer is contrary to law no sooner had the beercolouring act been repealed than other persons obtained a patent for effecting the purpose of imparting an artificial colour to porter by means of brown malt specifically prepared for that purpose only the beer coloured by the new method is more liable to become spoiled than when coloured by the process formerly practised the colouring malt does not contain any considerable portion of saccharine matter the grain is by mere torrefaction converted into a gumlike substance wholly soluble in water which renders the beer more liable to pass into the acetous fermentation than the common brown malt is capable of doing because the latter if prepared from good barley contains a portion of saccharine matter of which the patent malt is destitute but as brown malt is generally prepared from the worst kind of barley and as the patent malt can only be made from good grain it may become on that account an useful article to the brewer at least it gives colour and body to the beer but it cannot materially economise the quantity of malt necessary to produce good porter some brewers of eminence in this town have assured me that the use of this mode of colouring beer is wholly unnecessary and that porter of the requisite colour may be brewed better without it hence this kind of malt is not used in their establishments the quantity of gumlike matter which it contains gives too much ferment to the beer and renders it liable to spoil repeated experiments made on a large scale have settled this fact strength and specific differences of different kinds of porter the strength of all kinds of beer like that of wine depends on the quantity of spirit contained in a given bulk of the liquor the reader need scarcely be told that of no article there are more varieties than of porter this no doubt arises from the different mode of manufacturing the beer although the ingredients are the same this difference is more striking in the porter manufactured among country brewers than it is in the beer brewed by the eminent london porter brewers the totality of the london porter exhibits but very slight differences both with respect to strength or quantity of spirit and solid extractive matter contained in a given bulk of it the spirit may be stated upon an average to be 450 per cent in porter retailed at the publicans the solid matter is from twentyone to twentythree pounds per barrel of thirtysix gallons the countrybrewed porter is seldom well fermented and seldom contains so large a quantity of spirit it usually abounds in mucilage hence it becomes turbid when mixed with alcohol such beer cannot keep without becoming sour it has been matter of frequent complaint that all the porter now brewed is not what porter was formerly this idea may be true with some exceptions my professional occupations have during these twentyeight years repeatedly obliged me to examine the strength of london porter brewed by different brewers and from the minutes made on that subject i am authorised to state that the porter now brewed by the eminent london brewers is unquestionably stronger than that which was brewed at different periods during the late french war samples of brown stout with which i have been obligingly favoured whilst writing this treatise by messrs barclay perkins and comessrs truman hanbury and comessrs henry meux and coand other eminent brewers of this capitalafforded upon an average 725 per cent of alcohol of 0833 specific gravity and porter from the same houses yielded upon an average 525 per cent of alcohol of the same specific gravity55 this beer received from the brewers was taken from the same store from which the publicans are supplied it is nevertheless singular to observe that from fifteen samples of beer of the same denominations procured from different retailers the proportions of spirit fell considerably short of the above quantities samples of brown stout procured from the retailers afforded upon an average 650 per cent of alcohol and the average strength of the porter was 450 per cent whence can this difference between the beer furnished by the brewer and that retailed by the publican arise we shall not be at a loss to answer this question when we find that so many retailers of porter have been prosecuted and convicted for mixing table beer with their strong beer this is prohibited by law as becomes obvious by the following words of the act56 if any common or other brewer innkeeper victualler or retailer of beer or ale shall mix or suffer to be mixed any strong beer ale or worts with table beer worts or water in any tub or measure he shall forfeit 50l the difference between strong and table beer is thus settled by parliament all beer or ale57 above the price of eighteen shillings per barrel exclusive of ale duties now payable viz ten shillings per barrel or that may be hereafter payable in respect thereof shall be deemed strong beer or ale and all beer of the price of eighteen shillings the barrel or under exclusive of the duty payable viz two shillings per barrel in respect thereof shall be deemed table beer within the meaning of this and all other acts now in force or that may hereafter be passed in relation to beer or ale

substances used for adulterating beer we have stated already p 113 that nothing is allowed by law to enter into the composition of beer but malt and hops the substances used by fraudulent brewers for adulterating beer are chiefly the following quassia which gives to beer a bitter taste is substituted for hops but hops possesses a more agreeable aromatic flavour and there is also reason to believe that they render beer less liable to spoil by keeping a property which does not belong to quassia it requires but little discrimination to distinguish very clearly the peculiar bitterness of quassia in adulterated porter vast quantities of the shavings of this wood are sold in a halftorrefied and ground state to disguise its obvious character and to prevent its being recognised among the waste materials of the brewers wormwood59 has likewise been used by fraudulent brewers the adulterating of hops is prohibited by the legislature60 if any person shall put any drug or ingredient whatever into hops to alter the colour or scent thereof every person so offending convicted by the oath of one witness before one justice of peace for the county or place where the offence was committed shall forfeit 5l for every hundred weight beer rendered bitter by quassia never keeps well unless it be kept in a place possessing a temperature considerably lower than the temperature of the surrounding atmosphere and this is not well practicable in large establishments the use of boiling the wort of beer with hops is partly to communicate a peculiar aromatic flavour which the hop contains partly to cover the sweetness of undecomposed saccharine matter and also to separate by virtue of the gallic acid and tannin it contains a portion of a peculiar vegetable mucilage somewhat resembling gluten which is still diffused through the beer the compound thus produced separates in small flakes like those of curdled soap and by these means the beer is rendered less liable to spoil for nothing contributes more to the conversion of beer or any other vinous fluid into vinegar than mucilage hence also all fullbodied and clammy ales abounding in mucilage and which are generally ill fermented do not keep as perfect ale ought to do quassia is therefore unfit as a substitute for hops and even english hops are preferable to those imported from the continent for nitrate of silver and acetate of lead produce a more abundant precipitate from an infusion of english hops than can be obtained from a like infusion by the same agents from foreign hops one of the qualities of good porter is that it should bear a fine frothy head as it is technically termed because professed judges of this beverage would not pronounce the liquor excellent although it possessed all other good qualities of porter without this requisite to impart to porter this property of frothing when poured from one vessel into another or to produce what is also termed a cauliflower head the mixture called beerheading composed of common green vitriol sulphate of iron alum and salt is added this addition to the beer is generally made by the publicans61 it is unnecessary to genuine beer which of itself possesses the property of bearing a strong white froth without these additions and it is only in consequence of table beer being mixed with strong beer that the frothing property of the porter is lost from experiments i have tried on this subject i have reason to believe that the sulphate of iron added for that purpose does not possess the power ascribed to it but the publicans frequently when they fine a butt of beer by means of isinglass adulterate the porter at the same time with table beer together with a quantity of molasses and a small portion of extract of gentian root to keep up the peculiar flavour of the porter and it is to the molasses chiefly which gives a spissitude to the beer that the frothing property must be ascribed for without it the sulphate of iron does not produce the property of frothing in diluted beer capsicum and grains of paradise two highly acrid substances are employed to give a pungent taste to weak insipid beer of late a concentrated tincture of these articles to be used for a similar purpose and possessing a powerful effect has appeared in the pricecurrents of brewers druggists ginger root coriander seed and orange peels are employed as flavouring substances chiefly by the ale brewers from these statements and the seizures that have been made of illegal ingredients at various breweries it is obvious that the adulterations of beer are not imaginary it will be noticed however that some of the sophistications are comparatively harmless whilst others are effected by substances deleterious to health the following list exhibits some of the unlawful substances seized at different breweries and at chemical laboratories list of illegal ingredients seized from 1812 to 1818 at various breweries and brewers druggists62 1812 july josiah nibbs

the high price and inferior quality of beer produced the following seized articlesone bladder of honey one bladder of extract of cocculus indicus ground guinea pepper or capsicum vitriol or copperas orange powder quassia ground beerheading hard multum another kind of multum or beer preparation liquorice powder and ground grains of paradise witness being asked where did you seize these things answer some of them were seized from brewers and some of them from brewers druggists within these two years past may 8 1818 another fraud frequently committed both by brewers and publicans as is evident from the excise report is the practice of adulterating strong beer with small beerthis fraud is prohibited by law since both the revenue and the public suffer by it63 the duty upon strong beer is ten shillings a barrel and upon table beer it is two shillings the revenue suffers because a larger quantity of beer is sold as strong beer that is at a price exceeding the price of table beer without the strong beer duty being paid in the next place the brewer suffers because the retailer gets table or mild beer and retails it as strong beer the following are the words of the act prohibiting the brewers mixing table beer with strong beer if any common brewer shall mix or suffer to be mixed any strong beer or strong worts with table beer or table worts or with water in any guile or fermenting tun after the declaration of the quantity of such guile shall have been made or if he shall at any time mix or suffer to be mixed strong beer or strong worts with table beer worts or with water in any vat cask tub measures or utensil not being an entered guile or fermenting tun he shall forfeit 200 pounds64 with respect to the persons who commit this offence mr carr65 the solicitor of the excise observes that they are generally brewers who carry on the double trade of brewing both strong and table beer it is almost impossible to prevent them from mixing one with the other and frauds of very great extent have been detected and the parties punished for that offence one brewer at plymouth evaded duties to the amount of 32000 pounds and other brewers who brew party guiles of beer carrying on the two trades of ale and table beer brewers where the trade is a victualling brewer which is different from the common brewer he being a person who sells only wholesale the victualling brewer being a brewer and also a seller by retail in the neighbourhood of london mr carr continues more particularly i speak from having had great experience from the informations and evidence which i have received that the retailers carry on a most extensive fraud upon the public in purchasing stale table beer or the bottoms of casks there are a class of men who go about and sell such beer at tablebeer price to public victuallers who mix it in their cellars if they receive beer from their brewers which is mild they purchase stale beer and if they receive stale beer they purchase common table beer for that purpose and many of the prosecutions are against retailers for that offence the following may serve in proof of this statement list of brewers prosecuted and convicted from 1813 to 1819 for adulterating strong beer with table beer66 thomas manton and another brewers for mixing strong and table beer verdict 300l mark morrell and another brewers for mixing

beer 250l and costs john williams and another brewers for mixing strong and table beer verdict 200l old or entire and new or mild beer it is necessary to state that every publican has two sorts of beer sent to him from the brewer the one is called mild which is beer sent out fresh as it is brewed the other is called old that is such as is brewed on purpose for keeping and which has been kept in store a twelvemonth or eighteen months the origin of the beer called entire is thus related by the editor of the picture of london before the year 1730 the malt liquors in general used in london were ale beer and twopenny and it was customary to call for a pint or tankard of halfandhalf ie half of ale and half of beer half of ale and half of twopenny in course of time it also became the practice to call for a pint or tankard of threethreads meaning a third of ale beer and twopenny and thus the publican had the trouble to go to three casks and turn three cocks for a pint of liquor to avoid this inconvenience and waste a brewer of the name of harwood conceived the idea of making a liquor which should partake of the same united flavours of ale beer and twopenny he did so and succeeded calling it entire or entire butt meaning that it was drawn entirely from one cask or butt and as it was a very hearty and nourishing liquor and supposed to be very suitable for porters and other working people it obtained the name of porter the system is now altered and porter is very generally compounded of two kinds or rather the same liquor in two different states the due admixture of which is palatable though neither is good alone one is mild porter and the other stale porter the former is that which has a slightly bitter flavour the latter has been kept longer this mixture the publican adapts to the palates of his several customers and effects the mixture very readily by means of a machine containing small pumps worked by handles in these are four pumps but only three spouts because two of the pumps throw out at the same spout one of these two pumps draws the mild and the other the stale porter from the casks down in the cellar and the publican by dexterously changing his hold works either pump and draws both kinds of beer at the same spout an indifferent observer supposes that since it all comes from one spout it is entire butt beer as the publican professes over his door and which has been decided by vulgar prejudice to be only good porter though the difference is not easily distinguished i have been informed by several eminent brewers that of late a far greater quantity is consumed of mild than of stale beer the entire beer of the modern brewer according to the statement of c barclay67 esq consists of some beer brewed expressly for the purpose of keeping it likewise contains a portion of returns from publicans a portion of beer from the bottoms of vats the beer that is drawn off from the pipes which convey the beer from one vat to another and from one part of the premises to another this beer is collected and put into vats mr barclay also states that it contains a certain portion of brown stout which is twenty shillings a barrel dearer than common beer and some bottling beer which is ten shillings a barrel dearer68 and that all these beers united are put into vats and that it depends upon various circumstances how long they may remain in those vats before they become perfectly bright when bright this beer is sent out to the publicans for their entire beer and there is sometimes a small quantity of mild beer mixed with it the present entire beer therefore is a very heterogeneous mixture composed of all the waste and spoiled beer of the publicansthe bottoms of buttsthe leavings of the potsthe drippings of the machines for drawing the beerthe remnants of beer that lay in the leaden pipes of the brewery with a portion of brown stout bottling beer and mild beer the old or entire beer we have examined as obtained from messrs barclays and other eminent london brewers is unquestionably a good compound but it does no longer appear to be necessary among fraudulent brewers to brew beer on purpose for keeping or to keep it twelve or eighteen months a more easy expeditious and economical method has been discovered to convert any sort of beer into entire beer merely by the admixture of a portion of sulphuric acid an imitation of the age of eighteen months is thus produced in an instant this process is technically called to bring beer forward or to make it hard the practice is a bad one the genuine old or entire beer of the honest brewer is quite a different compound it has a rich generous fullbodied taste without being acid and a vinous odour but it may perhaps not be generally known that this kind of beer always affords a less proportion of alcohol than is produced from mild beer the practice of bringing beer forward it is to be understood is resorted to only by fraudulent brewers69 if on the contrary the brewer has too large a stock of old beer on his hands recourse is had to an opposite practice of converting stale halfspoiled or sour beer into mild beer by the simple admixture of an alkali or an alkaline earth oystershell powder and subcarbonate of potash or soda are usually employed for that purpose these substances neutralise the excess of acid and render sour beer somewhat palatable by this process the beer becomes very liable to spoil it is the worst expedient that the brewer can practise the beer thus rendered mild soon loses its vinous taste it becomes vapid and speedily assumes a muddy grey colour and an exceedingly disagreeable taste these sophistications may be considered at first as minor crimes practised by fraudulent brewers when compared with the methods employed by them for rendering beer noxious to health by substances absolutely injurious to increase the intoxicating quality of beer the deleterious vegetable substance called cocculus indicus and the extract of this poisonous berry technically called black extract or by some hard multum are employed opium tobacco nux vomica and extract of poppies have also been used this fraud constitutes by far the most censurable offence committed by unprincipled brewers and it is a lamentable reflection to behold so great a number of brewers prosecuted and convicted of this crime nor is it less deplorable to find the names of druggists eminent in trade implicated in the fraud by selling the unlawful ingredients to brewers for fraudulent purposes list of brewers prosecuted and

instead of hops 5l and costs that a minute portion of an unwholesome ingredient daily taken in beer cannot fail to be productive of mischief admits of no doubt and there is reasons to believe that a small quantity of a narcotic substance and cocculus indicus is a powerful narcotic71 daily taken into the stomach together with an intoxicating liquor is highly more efficacious than it would be without the liquor the effect may be gradual and a strong constitution especially if it be assisted with constant and hard labour may counteract the destructive consequences perhaps for many years but it never fails to shew its baneful effects at last independent of this it is a wellestablished fact that porter drinkers are very liable to apoplexy and palsy without taking this narcotic poison if we judge from the preceding lists of prosecutions and convictions furnished by the solicitor of the excise72 it will be evident that many wholesale brewers as well as retail dealers stand very conspicuous among those offenders but the reader will likewise notice that there are no convictions in any instance against any of the eleven great london porter brewers73 for any illegal practice the great london brewers it appears believe that the publicans alone adulterate the beer that many of the latter have been convicted of this fraud the report of the board of excise amply shewssee p 129 the following statement relating to this subject we transcribe from a parliamentary document74 mr perkins being asked whether he believed that any of the inferior brewers adulterated beer answered i am satisfied there are some instances of that questiondo you believe publicans do answeri believe they do qto a great extent ayes qdo you believe they adulterate the beer you sell them ai am satisfied there are some instances of thatmr j martineau75 being asked the following question76in your judgment is any of the beer of the metropolis as retailed to the publican mixed with any deleterious ingredients answerin retailing beer in some instances it has been questionby whom in your opinion has that been done answerin that case by the publicans who vend it on this point it is but fair to the minor brewers to record also the answers of some officers of the revenue when they were asked whether they considered it more difficult to detect nefarious practices in large breweries than in small ones mr j rogers being thus questioned in the committee of the house of commons77 supposing the large brewers to use deleterious or any illegal ingredients to such an amount as could be of any importance to their concern do you think it would or would not be more easy to detect it in those large breweries than in small ones his answer was more difficult to detect it in the large ones and witness being asked to state the reason why answered their premises are so much larger and there is so much more strength that a cart load or two is got rid of in a minute or two witness had known in five minutes twenty barrels of molasses got rid of as soon as the door was shut another witness w wells an excise officer78 in describing the contrivances used to prevent detection stated that at a brewers at westham the adulterating substances were not kept on the premises but in the brewers house not the principal but the working brewers it not being considered when there as liable to seizure the brewer had a very large jacket made expressly for that purpose with very large pockets and on brewing mornings he would take his pockets full of the different ingredients witness supposed that such a mans jacket similar to what he had described would convey quite sufficient for any brewery in england as to cocculus indicus that it may be more difficult for the officers of the excise to detect fraudulent practices in large breweries than in small ones may be true to a certain extent but what eminent london porter brewer would stake his reputation on the chance of so paltry a gain in which he would inevitably be at the mercy of his own man the eleven great porter brewers of this metropolis are persons of so high respectability that there is no ground for the slightest suspicion that they would attempt any illegal practices which they were aware could not possibly escape detection in their extensive establishments and let it be remembered that none of them have been detected for any unlawful practices79 with regard to the processes of their manufacture or the adulteration of their beer method of detecting the adulteration of beer the detection of the adulteration of beer with deleterious vegetable substances is beyond the reach of chemical analysis the presence of sulphate of iron p 134 may be detected by evaporating the beer to perfect dryness and burning away the vegetable matter obtained by the action of chlorate of potash in a redhot crucible the sulphate of iron will be left behind among the residue in the crucible which when dissolved in water may be assayed for the constituent parts of the salt namely iron and sulphuric acid for the former by tincture of galls ammonia and prussiate of potash and for the latter by muriate of barytes80 beer which has been rendered fraudulently hard see p 148 by the admixture of sulphuric acid affords a white precipitate sulphate of barytes by dropping into it a solution of acetate or muriate of barytes and this precipitate when collected by filtering the mass and after having been dried and heated redhot for a few minutes in a platina crucible does not disappear by the addition of nitric or muriatic acid genuine old beer may produce a precipitate but the precipitate which it affords after having been made redhot in a platina crucible instantly becomes redissolved with effervescence by pouring on it some pure nitric or muriatic acid in that case the precipitate is malate not sulphate of barytes and is owing to a portion of malic acid having been formed in the beer but with regard to the vegetable materials deleterious to health it is extremely difficult in any instance to detect them by chemical agencies and in most cases it is quite impossible as in that of cocculus indicus in beer method of ascertaining the quantity of spirit contained in porter ale or other kinds of malt liquors take any quantity of the beer put it into a glass retort furnished with a receiver and distil with a gentle heat as long as any spirit passes over into the receiver which may be known by heating from time to time a small quantity of the obtained fluid in a teaspoon over a candle and bringing into contact with the vapour of it the flame of a piece of paper if the vapour of the distilled fluid catches fire the distillation must be continued until the vapour ceases to be set on fire by the contact of a flaming body to the distilled liquid thus obtained which is the spirit of the beer combined with water add in small quantities at a time pure subcarbonate of potash previously freed from water by having been exposed to a red heat till the last portion of this salt added remains undissolved in the fluid the spirit will thus become separated from the water because the subcarbonate of

illicit establishments for the manufacture of imitation tea leaves arrested not long ago the attention of the public and the parties by whom these manufactories were conducted together with the numerous venders of the factitious tea did not escape the hand of justice in proof of this statement it is only necessary to consult the london newspapers the times and the courier from march to july 1818 which show to what extent this nefarious traffic has been carried on and they report also the prosecutions and convictions of numerous individuals who have been guilty of the fraud the following are some of those prosecutions and convictions hatton gardenon saturday an information came to be heard at this office before thomas leach esq the sitting magistrate against a man of the name of edmund rhodes charged with having on the 12th of august last dyed fabricated and manufactured divers large quantities viz one hundred weight of sloe leaves one hundred weight of ash leaves one hundred weight of elder leaves and one hundred weight of the leaves of a certain other tree in imitation of tea contrary to the statute of the 17th of geo iii85 whereby the said edmund rhodes had for every pound of such leaves so manufactured forfeited the sum of 5l making the total of the penalties amount to 2000l the second count in the information charged the said rhodes with having in his possession the above quantity of sloe ash elder and other leaves under the like penalty of 2000l the third count charged him with having on the said 12th of august last in his possession divers quantities exceeding six pounds weight of each respective kind of leaves viz fifty pounds weight of green sloe leaves fifty pounds weight of green leaves of ash fifty pounds weight of green leaves of elder and fifty pounds weight of the green leaves of a certain other tree not having proved that such leaves were gathered with the consent of the owners of the trees and shrubs from which they were taken and that such leaves were gathered for some other use and not for the purpose of manufacturing the same in imitation of tea whereby he had forfeited for each pound weight the sum of 5l amounting in the whole to 1000l and in default of payment in each case subjected himself to be committed to the house of correction for not more than twelve months nor less than six months mr denton who appeared for the defendant who was absent said that he was a very poor man with a family of five children and was only the servant of the real manufacturer and an ignorant man from the country put into the premises to carry on the business without knowing what the leaves were intended for by direction of mr mayo who conducted the prosecution several barrels and bags filled with the imitation tea were then brought into the office and a sample from each handed round to the eye they seemed a good imitation of tea the defendant was convicted in the penalty of 500l on the second count the attorneygeneral against palmerthis was an action by the attorneygeneral against the defendant palmer charging him with having in his possession a quantity of sloeleaves and whitethorn leaves fabricated into an imitation of tea mr dauncey stated the case to the jury and observed that the defendant mr palmer was a grocer it would appear that a regular manufactory was established in goldstonestreet the parties by whom the manufactory was conducted was a person of the name of proctor and another person named j malins they engaged others to furnish them with leaves which after undergoing a certain process were sold to and drank by the public as tea the leaves in order to be converted into an article resembling black tea were first boiled then baked upon an iron plate and when dry rubbed with the hand in order to produce that curl which the genuine tea had this was the most wholesome part of the operation for the colour which was yet to be given to it was produced by logwood the green tea was manufactured in a manner more destructive to the constitution of those by whom it was drank the leaves being pressed and dried were laid upon sheets of copper where they received their colour from an article known by the name of dutch pink the article used in producing the appearance of the fine green bloom observable on the china tea was however decidedly a dead poison he alluded to verdigris which was added to the dutch pink in order to complete the operation this was the case which he had to bring before the jury and hence it would appear that at the moment they were supposing they were drinking a pleasant and nutritious beverage they were in fact in all probability drinking the produce of the hedges round the metropolis prepared for the purposes of deception in the most noxious manner he trusted he should be enabled to trace to the possession of the defendant eighty pounds weight of the commodity he had been describing thomas jones deposed that he knew proctor and was employed by him at the latter end of april 1817 to gather black and white thorn leaves sloe leaves were the black thorn witness also knew john malins the son of william malins a coffeeroaster he did not at first know the purpose for which the leaves were gathered but afterwards learnt they were to make imitation tea witness did not gather more than one hundred and a half weight of these leaves but he employed another person of the name of john bagster to gather them he had twopence per pound for them they were first boiled and the water squeezed from them in a press they were afterwards placed over a slowfire upon sheets of copper to dry while on the copper they were rubbed with the hand to curl them at the time of boiling there was a little verdigris put into the water this applied to green tea only after the leaves were dried they were sifted to separate the thorns and stalks after they were sifted more verdigris and some dutch pink were added the verdigris gave the leaves that green bloom observable on genuine tea the black tea went through a similar course as the green except the application of dutch pink a little verdigris was put in the boiling and to this was added a small quantity of logwood to dye it and thus the manufacture was complete the drying operation took place on sheets of iron witness knew the defendant edward palmer he took some of the mixture he had been describing to his shop the first time he took some was in may 1817 in the course of that month or the beginning of june he took four or five sevenpound parcels when he took it there it was taken up to the top of the house witness afterwards carried some to russellstreet which was taken to the top of the house about one hundred weight and three quarters from this quantity he carried fiftythree pounds weight to the house of the defendants porter by the desire of mr malins it was in paper parcels of seven pounds each john bagster proved that he had been employed by malins and proctor to gather sloe and whitethorn leaves they were taken to joness house and from thence to malins coffeeroasting premises witness received twopence per pound for them he saw the manufacturing going on but did not know much about it witness saw the leaves on sheets of copper in goldstonestreet this was the case for the crownverdict for the crown 840l the attorneygeneral against john prenticethis was an information similar to the last in which the defendant submitted to a verdict for the crown the attorneygeneral against lawson holmesin this case the defendant submitted to a verdict for the crown the attorneygeneral against john orkneythomas jones proved that the defendant was a grocer and in the month of may last he carried to his shop seven pounds of imitation tea by the order of john malins for which he received the money viz 15s 9d or 2s 3d per pound the jury found a verdict for the crownpenalties 70l the attorneygeneral against james

dowlingthis was a grocer jones proved that he delivered seven pounds of imitation tea at mr dowlings house and received the money for it namely 15s 9dpenalties 70l method of detecting the adulterations of tea the adulteration of tea may be evinced by comparing the botanical characters of the leaves of the two respective trees and by submitting them to the action of a few chemical tests the shape of the tealeaf is slender and narrow as shewn in this sketch the edges are deeply serrated and the end or extremity is acutely pointed the texture of the leaf is very delicate its surface smooth and glossy and its colour is a lively pale green illustration the sloeleaf and also the whitethorn leaf as shewn in this sketch is more rounded and the leaf is obtusely pointed the serratures or jags on the edges are not so deep the surface of the leaf is more uneven the texture not so delicate and the colour is a dark olive green illustration these characters of course can be observed only after the dried leaves have been suffered to macerate in water for about twentyfour hours the leaves of some sorts of tea may differ in size but the shape is the same in all of them because all the different kinds of tea imported from china are the produce of one species of plant and the difference between the green and souchong or black tea depends chiefly upon the climate soil culture age and mode of drying the leaves spurious black tea86 slightly moistened when rubbed on a sheet of white paper immediately produces a blueishblack stain and speedily affords when thrown into cold water a blueishblack tincture which instantly becomes reddened by letting fall into it a drop or two of sulphuric acid two ounces of the suspected leaves should be infused in halfapint of cold soft water and suffered to stand for about an hour genuine tea produces an ambercoloured infusion which does not become reddened by sulphuric acid all the samples of spurious green tea nineteen in number which i have examined were coloured with carbonate of copper a poisonous substance and not by means of verdigris or copperas87 the latter substances would instantly turn the tea black because both these metallic salts being soluble in water are acted on by the astringent matter of the leaves whether genuine or spurious and convert the infusion into ink tea rendered poisonous by carbonate of copper speedily imparts to liquid ammonia a fine sapphire blue tinge it is only necessary to shake up in a stopped vial for a few minutes a teaspoonful of the suspected leaves with about two tablespoonsful of liquid ammonia diluted with half its bulk of water the supernatant liquid will exhibit a fine blue colour if the minutest quantity of copper be present green tea coloured with carbonate of copper when thrown into water impregnated with sulphuretted hydrogen gas immediately acquires a black colour genuine green tea suffers no change from the action of these tests the presence of copper may be further rendered obvious by mixing one part of the suspected tealeaves reduced to powder with two or three parts of nitrate of potash or with two parts of chlorate of potash and projecting this mixture by small portions at a time into a platina or porcelainware crucible kept redhot in a coal fire the whole vegetable matter of the tea leaves will thus become destroyed and the oxide of copper left behind in combination with the potash of the nitrate of potash or saltpetre or with the muriate of potash if chlorate of potash has been employed if water acidulated with nitric acid be then poured into the crucible to dissolve the mass the presence of the copper may be rendered manifest by adding to the solution liquid ammonia in such quantity that the pungent odour of it predominates

counterfeiting ground coffee by means of pigeons beans and pease is another subject which not long ago arrested the attention of the public and from the numerous convictions of grocers prosecuted for the offence it is evident that this practice has been carried on for a long time and to a considerable extent the following statement exhibits some of the prosecutions instituted by the solicitor of the excise against persons convicted of the fraud of manufacturing spurious and adulterating genuine coffee alexander brady a grocer see p 182 prosecuted and convicted of selling shamcoffee said i

whose custody the same shall be found shall forfeit and lose the sum of one hundred pounds the attorneygeneral against william malinsthis was an information filed by the attorneygeneral against the defendant charging him he being a dealer in coffee with having in his possession a large quantity of imitation coffee made from scorched pease and beans resembling coffee and intended to be sold as such contrary to the statute of the 43d of the king whereby he became liable to pay a fine of 100l j lawes deposed that he had lived servant with the defendant he constantly roasted pease and beans and ground them into powder when so ground the powder very much resembled coffee sometimes the sweepings of the coffee were thrown in among the pease and beans witness carried out this powder to several grocers in different parts of the town thomas jones lived with the defendant his occupation was roasting and grinding pease and beans they looked when ground the same as coffee witness had seen mr john malins sweep up the refuse coffee and mix it with the pease and beans he had taken out this mixture to grocers j richardson an exciseofficer deposed that in december 1817 he went to the premises of the defendant and there seized four sacks five tubs and nine pounds in paper of a powder made to resemble coffee the quantity ground was 1567 pounds it had all the appearance of coffee and a little coffee being mixed with it any common person might be deceived he also seized two sacks containing 279 pounds of whole pease and beans roasted among the latter were some grains of coffee the witness here produced samples of the articles seized john lawes deposed that the articles exhibited were such as he was in the habit of manufacturing while in mr malins employment the jury found a verdict for the crownpenalty 100l the king against chalonermr chaloner a dealer in tea and coffee was charged on the oaths of charles henry lord and john pearson both excise officers with having in his possession on the 17th of march nine pounds of spurious coffee consisting of burnt pease beans and gravel or sand and a portion of coffee and with selling some of the same also with having in his possession seventeen pounds of vegetable powder and an article imitating coffee which contained not a particle of genuine coffee the defendant was convicted in the penalty of 90l the king against

the case being proved by the evidence of several witnesses the defendant was convicted in the penalty of 50l the king against toppingthis was an information against mr john lewis topping a dealer in tea and coffee charging him with having thirtyseven pounds of vegetable powder in his possession the article seized was produced to the commissioners of the excise the defendant was convicted in the penalty of 50l the king against samuel hallettthe defendant hallett a grocer and dealer in tea and coffee was charged with having seven pounds of imitation coffee in his possession charles henry lord an officer of the excise being sworn stated that he and spencer an officer went on the 28th of february last to the shop of the defendant and asked for an ounce of coffee at three halfpence per ounce he received the same and having paid for it left the shop he examined the article and found it was part coffee and part imitation coffee or what the defendant called vegetable powder which is nothing more nor less than burnt pease and beans ground in a mill spencer the officer of the excise corroborated the above evidence and stated that the shamcoffee seized at the defendants house was shown to mr joseph hubbard grocer and tea and coffee dealer in highstreet in the borough of southwark mr hubbard being sworn stated that he had examined the shamcoffee seized by the officers in the defendants shop the one ounce purchased by lord he knew to be nothing else than black pigeons beans there was no coffee amongst it the defendant was convicted in the penalty of 50l the king against foxmr edward fox grocer and dealer in tea and coffee was charged with having a large quantity of shamcoffee in his possession and with selling the same for genuine coffee henry spencer an officer of the excise stated that on the 21st of february he and lord another officer went to the defendants shop and purchased an ounce of coffee for which he paid three halfpence they examined it and he was satisfied it was not genuine coffee they purchased another ounce which he produced to the commissioners of the excise who examined it they were convinced it consisted partly of coffee and beans and pease the defendant in his defence said that the poor people wanted a lowprice article and by mixing the vegetable powder and coffee together he was able to sell it at three halfpence an ounce he had sold it for years he did it as a matter of accommodation to the poor who could not give a higher price he did not sell it for genuine coffee commissionerthen you have been defrauding the public for many years and injuring the revenue by your illicit practices the poor have an equal right to be supplied with as genuine an article as the rich he was convicted in the penalty of 50l the king against bradythe defendant mr alexander brady grocer and dealer in tea and coffee was charged with having on the 28th of february last in his possession eighteen pounds of shamcoffee and selling the same for genuine coffee lord and pearson excise officers stated that they purchased an ounce of coffee of the defendant on the 28th of february and upon examining it they discovered that it was made up of pease and beans ground with a small quantity of coffee they also found eighteen pounds of vegetable powder mixed with coffee in a state prepared for sale wrapped in papers one of the commissioners tasted some of the eighteen pounds of shamcoffee produced by the officers and declared that it was a most infamous stuff and unfit for human food defendantwhy i have sold it for twenty years commissionerthen you have been for twenty years acting most dishonestly defrauding the revenue and the health of the poor must have suffered very much by taking such an unwholesome article your having dealt in this article so long aggravates your case you have for twenty years been selling burnt beans and pease for genuine coffeeyou are convicted in the penalty of 50l the king against bowserthe excise officers stated that on the 28th of february they went to his shop he was a grocer dealer in tea and coffee they seized seven pounds and a half of vegetable powder which contained very little coffee if any and also a quarter of a pound of coffee mixed with vegetable powder the defendant pleaded guilty to the charge and prayed the court to mitigate the penalty he was convicted in the penalty of 50l the king against thomas owenthe defendant an extensive dealer in tea and coffee appeared to an information charging him with having in his possession and selling a quantity of deleterious ingredients and mixing them with coffee charles henry lord deposed that on the 26th of february he found at the shop of the defendant nineteen pounds of a composition consisting of beans and pease ground and prepared so as to imitate coffee he also discovered two pounds and a half of a mixture of coffee and vegetable powder on the same day he proceeded to another shop of the defendant and he there found five pounds more of the same stuff samples of the composition in its mixed and unmixed state were produced mr lawes addressed the commissioners on behalf of the defendant in mitigation of punishment for he did not mean to deny the offence his client was a very young man and had been most unfortunate in business he was not aware until lately of the existence of any law by which it could be punished the commissioners observed that they had a double duty to perform namely to protect the revenue from fraud and to prevent the public from being imposed upon and injured by ingredients served to them instead of the food they intended to purchase the fraud upon the revenue was in the estimation of the court the least part of the offence under all the circumstances however the court was inclined to be lenient to the defendant he was convicted in the penalty of 50l for each quantity of shamcoffee mr greely and mr william dando were fined 20l each and mr hirling and mr terry were fined 90l each for selling spurious coffee the adulteration of ground coffee with pease and beans is beyond the reach of chemical analysis but it may perhaps not be amiss on this occasion to give to our readers a piece of advice given by a retired grocer to a friend at no distant periodnever my good fellow he said purchase from a grocer any thing which passes through his mill you know not what you get instead of the article you expect to receivecoffee pepper and allspice are all mixed with substances which detract from their own natural qualitiespersons keeping mills of their own can at all times prevent these impositions adulteration of brandy rum and gin by the excise laws at present existing in this country the various degrees of strength of brandy rum arrack gin whiskey and other spiritous liquors chiefly composed of little else than spirit of wine are determined by the quantity of alcohol of a given specific gravity contained in the spiritous liquors of a supposed unknown strength the great public importance of this subject in this country where the consumption of spiritous liquors adds a vast sum to the public revenue has been the means of instituting many very interesting series of experiments on this subject the instrument used for that purpose by the customs and officers of excise is called sikess hydrometer88 which has now superseded the instrument called clarks hydrometer heretofore in use the specific gravity or strength of the legal standard spirit of the excise is technically called proof or proof spirit this liquor not being spirit sweetened or having any ingredient dissolved in it to defeat the strength thereof at the temperature of 57 faht weighs exactly 1213th parts of an equal measure of distilled water and with this spirit the strength of all other spiritous liquors are compared according to law the strength of spirit stronger than proof or over proof as it is termed by the revenue officers is indicated by the bulk of water necessary to reduce a given volume of it to the legal standard spirit denominated proofnamely if one gallon of water be required to bring twenty gallons of brandy rum or any other spirit to proof that spirit is said to be 1 to 20 over proof if one gallon of water be required to bring 15 10 5 or 2 gallons of the liquor to proof it is said to be 1 to 15 1 to 10 1 to 5 and 1 to 2 over proof the strength of brandy rum arrack gin or other spiritous liquors weaker than proof or under proof is estimated by the quantity of water which would be necessary to abstract or bring the spirit up to proof thus if from twenty gallons of brandy one gallon of water must be abstracted to bring it to proof it is said to be 1 in 20 under proof if from 15 10 5 or 2 gallons of the liquor 1 gallon of water must be abstracted to bring it to proof it is said to be 1 in 15 1 in 10 1 in 5 and 1 in 2 under proof it is necessary to understand this absurd language which is in use amongst the officers of excise and dealers in spirit in order to know what is meant in commerce by the strength of spiritous liquors of different denominations and hence for the business of the exciseman a table has been constructed expressing the strength or specific gravity of mixtures of different proportions of spirit and water at different degrees of temperature and according to this table the duty on spirit is now levied brandy and rum is seizable if sold by or found in the possession of the dealer unless it possesses a certain strength89 the following are the words of the act no distiller rectifier90 compounder or dealer shall serve or send out any foreign spirits of a lower strength than that of 1 in 6 under hydrometer proof91 nor have in his possession any foreign spirits mixed together except shrub cherry or raspberry brandy of lower strength than as aforesaid upon pain of such spirits being forfeited and such spirits with the casks and vessels containing the same may be seized by any officer of excise we have therefore a ready check against the frauds of the dishonest dealers in spiritous liquors if the spirit merchant engages to deliver a liquor of a certain strength the hydrometer is by far the most easy and expeditious check that can be adopted to guard against frauds of receiving a weaker liquor for a stronger one and to those individuals who are in the habit of purchasing large quantities of brandy rum or other spiritous liquors the hydrometer renders the greatest service for it is by no means an uncommon occurrence to meet with brandy rum and other spiritous liquors of a specific gravity very much below the pretended strength which the liquor ought to possess the following advice given to his readers92 by the author of a treatise on brewing and distilling may serve to put the unwary on their guard against some of the frauds practised by mercenary dealers it is a custom among retailing distillers which i have not taken notice of in this directory to put onethird or onefourth part of proof molasses brandy proportionably to what rum they dispose of which cannot be distinguished but by an extraordinary palate and does not at all lessen the body or proof of the goods but makes them about two shillings a gallon cheaper and must be well mixed and incorporated together in your retailing cask but you should keep some of the best rum not adulterated to please some customers whose judgment and palate must be humoured when you are to draw a sample of goods to shew a person that has judgment in the proof do not draw your goods into a phial to be tasted or make experiment of the strength thereof that way because the proof will not hold except the goods be exceedingly strong but draw the pattern of goods rather into a glass from the cock to run very small or rather draw off a small quantity into a little pewter pot and pour it into your glass extending your pot as high above the glasses as you can without wasting it which makes the goods carry a better head abundantly than if the same goods were to be put and tried in a phial you must be so prudent as to make a distinction of the persons you have to deal with what goods you sell to gentlemen for their own use who require a great deal of attendance and as much for time of payment you must take a considerably greater price than of others what goods you sell to persons where you believe there is a manifest or at least some hazard of your money you may safely sell for more than common profit what goods you sell to the poor especially medicinally as many of your goods are sanative be as compassionate as the cases require all brandies whether french spanish or english being proof goods will admit of one point of liquor93 to each gallon to be made up and incorporated therewith in your cask for retail or selling smaller quantities and all persons that insist upon having proof goods which not one in twenty understands you must supply out of what goods are not so reduced though at a higher price such is the advice given by mr shannon the mode of judging by the taste of spiritous liquors is deceitful a false strength is given to a weak liquor by infusing in it acrid vegetable substances or by adding to it a tincture of grains of paradise and guinea pepper these substances impart to weak brandy or rum an extremely hot and pungent taste brandy and rum is also frequently sophisticated with british molasses or sugarspirit coloured with burnt sugar the flavour which characterises french brandy and which is owing to a small portion of a peculiar essential oil contained in it is imitated by distilling british molassesspirit over wine lees94 but the spirit prior to being distilled over wine lees is previously deprived in part of its peculiar disagreeable flavour by rectification over fresh burnt charcoal and quicklime other brandymerchants employ a spirit obtained from raisin wine which is suffered to pass into an incipient ascescency the spirit thus procured partakes strongly of the flavour which is characteristic to foreign brandy oak sawdust and a spiritous tincture of raisin stones are likewise used to impart to new brandy and rum a ripe taste resembling brandy or rum long kept in oaken casks and a somewhat oily consistence so as to form a durable froth at its surface when strongly agitated in a vial the colouring substances are burnt sugar or molasses the latter gives to imitative brandy a luscious taste and fulness in the mouth these properties are said to render it particularly fit for the retail london customers the following is the method of compounding or making up as it is technically called brandy95 for retail gallons to ten puncheons of brandy 1081 add flavoured raisin spirit 118 tincture of grains of paradise 4 cherry laurel water 2 spirit of almond cakes 2 1207 add also 10 handfuls of oak sawdust and give it complexion with burnt sugar method of detecting the adulterations of brandy rum and malt spirit the false strength of brandy or rum is rendered obvious by diluting the suspected liquor with water the acrimony of the capsicum and grains of paradise or pepper may then be readily discovered by the taste the adulteration of brandy with british molasses or sugarspirit becomes evident by rubbing a portion of the suspected brandy between the palms of the hands the spirit as it evaporates leaves the disagreeable flavour which is peculiar to all british spirits or the liquor may be deprived of its alcohol by heating a portion in a spoon over a candle till the vapour ceases to catch fire on the approach of a lighted taper the residue thus obtained of genuine french brandy possesses a vinous odour still resembling the original flavour of the brandy whilst the residue produced from sophisticated brandy has a peculiarly disagreeable smell resembling gin or the breath of habitual drunkards arrack is coarsely imitated by adding to rum a small quantity of pyroligneous acid and some flowers acid of benzoe the compound thus produced however must be pronounced a bad one the author of a very popular cookery book96 directs two scruples of benzoic acid to be dissolved in one quart of rum to make mock arrack malt spirit malt spirit or gin the favourite liquor of the lower order of people which is characterised by the peculiar flavour of juniper berries over which the raw spirit is distilled is usually obtained from a mixture of malt and barley sometimes both molasses and corn are employed particularly if there be a scarcity of grain but the flavour of whiskey which is made from barley and oats is owing to the malted grain being dried with peat the smoke of which gives it the characteristic taste the malt distiller is not allowed to furnish under a heavy penalty any crude or raw spirit to the rectifier or manufacturer of gin of a greater strength than seven per cent over proof the rectifier who receives the spirit from the malt distiller is not allowed under a certain penalty to sweeten the liquor with sugar or other substances nor is he permitted to send out the spirit to his customers but of a certain strength as is obvious from the following words of the act no rectifier or compounder shall sell or send out any british brandy british rectified spirits british compounds or other british spirits of greater strength than that of one in five under hydrometer proof97 and if he shall sell and send out any such spirits of a greater strength than that of one in five under hydrometer proof such spirits with the casks or vessels containing the same shall be forfeited and may be seized by any officer of excise and he shall also forfeit treble the value of such spirit or 50l at the election of the kings attorneygeneral or the person who shall sue for the same the single value of such spirits to be estimated at the highest london price98 if we examine gin as retailed we shall soon be convinced that it is a custom pretty prevalent amongst dealers to weaken this liquor considerably with water and to sweeten it with sugar this fraud may readily be detected by evaporating a quantity of the liquor in a tablespoon over a candle to dryness the sugar will thus be rendered obvious in the form of a gumlike substance when the spirit is volatilised one hundred and twenty gallons of genuine gin as obtained from the wholesale manufactories are usually made up by fraudulent retailers into a saleable commodity with fourteen gallons of water and twentysix pounds of sugar now this dilution of the liquor produces a turbidness because the oil of juniper and other flavouring substances which the spirit holds in solution become precipitated by virtue of the water and thus cause the liquor to assume an opaline colour and the spirit thus weakened cannot readily be rendered clear again by subsidence several expedients are had recourse to to clarify the liquor in an expeditious manner some of which are harmless others are criminal because they render the liquor poisonous one of the methods which is innocent consists in adding to the weakened liquor first a portion of alum dissolved in water and then a solution of subcarbonate of potash the whole is stirred together and left undisturbed for twentyfour hours the precipitated alumine thus produced from the alum by virtue of the subcarbonate of potash acts as a strainer upon the milky liquor and carries down with it the finely divided oily matter which produced the blue colour of the diluted liquor roach or roman alum is also employed without any other addition for clarifying spiritous liquors to reduce unsweetened gin99 a tun of fine gin 252 gallons water 36 which added together make 288 gallons the doctor is now put on and it is further reduced with water 19 which gives total 307 gallons of gin this done let 1 lb of alum be just covered with water and dissolved by boiling rummage the whole well together and pour in the alum and the whole will be fine in a few hours to prepare and sweeten british gin100 get from your distiller an empty puncheon or cask which will contain about 133 gallons then take a cask of clear rectified spirits 120 gallons of the usual strength as rectifiers sell their goods at put the 120 gallons of spirits into your empty cask then take a quarter of an ounce of oil of vitriol half an ounce of oil of almonds a quarter of an ounce of oil of turpentine one ounce of oil of juniper berries half a pint of spirit of wine and half a pound of lump sugar beat or rub the above in a mortar when well rubbed together have ready prepared half a gallon of lime water one gallon of rose water mix the whole in either a pail or cask with a stick till every particle shall be dissolved then add to the foregoing twentyfive pounds of sugar dissolved in about nine gallons of rain or thames water or water that has been boiled mix the whole well together and stir them carefully with a stick in the 133 gallons cask to force down the same take and boil eight ounces of alum in three quarts of water for three quarters of an hour take it from the fire and dissolve by degrees six or seven ounces of salt of tartar when the same is milkwarm pour it into your gin and stir it well together as before for five minutes the same as you would a butt of beer newly fined let your cask stand as you mean to draw it at every time you purpose to sweeten again that cask must be well washed out and take great care never to shake your cask all the while it is drawing another method of fining spiritous liquors consists in adding to it first a solution of subacetate of lead and then a solution of alum this practice is highly dangerous because part of the sulphate of lead produced remains dissolved in the liquor which it thus renders poisonous unfortunately this method of clarifying spiritous liquors i have good reason to believe is more frequently practised than the preceding method because its action is more rapid and it imparts to the liquor a fine complexion or great refractive power hence some vestiges of lead may often be detected in malt spirit the weakened spirit is then sweetened with sugar and to cover the raw taste of the malt spirit false strength is given to it with grains of paradise guinea pepper capsicum and other acrid and aromatic substances method of detecting the presence of lead in spiritous liquors the presence of lead may be detected in spiritous liquors as stated on pages 70 and 86 the cordial called shrub frequently exhibits vestiges of copper this contamination i have been informed is accidental and originates from the metallic vessels employed in the manufacture of the liquor method of ascertaining the quantity of alcohol in different kinds of spiritous liquors the quantity of real alcohol in any spiritous liquors may readily be ascertained by simple distillation which process separates the alcohol from the water and foreign matters contained in the liquor put any quantity of brandy rum or malt spirit diluted with about onefourth its bulk of water into a retort fitted to a capacious receiver and distil with a gentle heat the strongest spirit distils over first into the receiver and the strength of the obtained products decreases till at last it contains so much water as no longer to be inflammable by the approach of a lighted taper when held in a spoon over a candle see p 160 if the process be continued the distilled product becomes milky scarcely spiritous to the smell and of an acidulous taste the distilling operation may then be discontinued if the first fourth or third part of the distilled product has been set apart it will be found a moderately strong alcohol and the remainder one more diluted if the whole distilled spirit be mixed with perfectly dry subcarbonate of potash the alcohol will float at the top of the potash as stated p 161 it will separate into two distinct fluids if the decanted alcohol be redistilled carefully with a very gentle heat over a small portion of dry quick lime or muriate of lime it will be obtained extremely pure and of a specific gravity of about 825 at 60 of temperature its flavour will vary according to the kind of

on being taken into the stomach in one poisonous sample which it fell to my lot to investigate the evil had been caused by the sophistication of the anotta employed for colouring cheese this substance was found to contain a portion of red lead a method of sophistication which has lately been confirmed by the following fact communicated to the public by mr j w wright of cambridge103 as a striking example of the extent to which adulterated articles of food may be unconsciously diffused and of the consequent difficulty of detecting the real fabricators of them it may not be uninteresting to relate to your readers the various steps by which the fraud of a poisonous adulteration of cheese was traced to its source your readers ought here to be told that several instances are on record that gloucester and other cheeses have been found contaminated with red lead and that this contamination has produced serious consequences in the instance now alluded to and probably in all other cases the deleterious mixture had been caused ignorantly by the adulteration of the anotta employed for colouring the cheese this substance in the instance i shall relate was found to contain a portion of red lead a species of adulteration which subsequent experiments have shewn to be by no means uncommon before i proceed further to trace this fraud to its source i shall briefly relate the circumstance which gave rise to its detection a gentleman who had occasion to reside for some time in a city in the west of england was one night seized with a distressing but indescribable pain in the region of the abdomen and of the stomach accompanied with a feeling of tension which occasioned much restlessness anxiety and repugnance to food he began to apprehend the access of an inflammatory disorder but in twentyfour hours the symptoms entirely subsided in four days afterwards he experienced an attack precisely similar and he then recollected that having on both occasions arrived from the country late in the evening he had ordered a plate of toasted gloucester cheese of which he had partaken heartily a dish which when at home regularly served him for supper he attributed his illness to the cheese the circumstance was mentioned to the mistress of the inn who expressed great surprise as the cheese in question was not purchased from a country dealer but from a highly respectable shop in london he therefore ascribed the beforementioned effects to some peculiarity in his constitution a few days afterwards he partook of the same cheese and he had scarcely retired to rest when a most violent cholic seized him which lasted the whole night and part of the ensuing day the cook was now directed henceforth not to serve up any toasted cheese and he never again experienced these distressing symptoms whilst this matter was a subject of conversation in the house a servantmaid mentioned that a kitten had been violently sick after having eaten the rind cut off from the cheese prepared for the gentlemans supper the landlady in consequence of this statement ordered the cheese to be examined by a chemist in the vicinity who returned for answer that the cheese was contaminated with lead so unexpected an answer arrested general attention and more particularly as the suspected cheese had been served up for several other customers application was therefore made by the london dealer to the farmer who manufactured the cheese he declared that he had bought the anotta of a mercantile traveller who had supplied him and his neighbours for years with that commodity without giving occasion to a single complaint on subsequent inquiries through a circuitous channel unnecessary to be detailed here at length on the part of the manufacturer of the cheese it was found that as the supplies of anotta had been defective and of inferior quality recourse had been had to the expedient of colouring the commodity with vermilion even this admixture could not be considered deleterious but on further application being made to the druggist who sold the article the answer was that the vermilion had been mixed with a portion of red lead and the deception was held to be perfectly innocent as frequently practised on the supposition that the vermilion would be used only as a pigment for housepainting thus the druggist sold his vermilion in the regular way of trade adulterated with red lead to increase his profit without any suspicion of the use to which it would be applied and the purchaser who adulterated the anotta presuming that the vermilion was genuine had no hesitation in heightening the colour of his spurious anotta with so harmless an adjunct thus through the circuitous and diversified operations of commerce a portion of deadly poison may find admission into the necessaries of life in a way which can attach no criminality to the parties through whose hands it has successively passed this dangerous sophistication may be detected by macerating a portion of the suspected cheese in water impregnated with sulphuretted hydrogen acidulated with muriatic acid which will instantly cause the cheese to assume a brown or black colour if the minutest portion of lead be present footnotes 103 repository of arts vol viii no 47 p 262 counterfeit pepper black pepper is the fruit of a shrubby creeping plant which grows wild in the east indies and is cultivated with much advantage for the sake of its berries in java and malabar the berries are gathered before they are ripe and are dried in the sun they become black and corrugated on the surface this factitious peppercorns have of late been detected mixed with genuine pepper is a fact sufficiently known104 such an adulteration may prove in many instances of household economy exceedingly vexatious and prejudicial to those who ignorantly make use of the spurious article i have examined large packages of both black and white pepper by order of the excise and have found them to contain about 16 per cent of this artificial compound the spurious pepper is made up of oil cakes the residue of lintseed from which the oil has been pressed common clay and a portion of cayenne pepper formed in a mass and granulated by being first pressed through a sieve and then rolled in a cask the mode of detecting the fraud is easy it is only necessary to throw a sample of the suspected pepper into a bowl of water the artificial peppercorns fall to powder whilst the true pepper remains whole ground pepper is very often sophisticated by adding to a portion of genuine pepper a quantity of pepper dust or the sweepings from the pepper warehouses mixed with a little cayenne pepper the sweepings are known and purchased in the market under the name of p d signifying pepper dust an inferior sort of this vile refuse or the sweepings of p d is distinguished among venders by the abbreviation of d p d denoting dust dirt of pepper dust the adulteration of pepper and the making and selling commodities in imitation of pepper are prohibited under a severe penalty the following are the words of the act105 and whereas commodities made in imitation of pepper have of late been sold and found in the possession of various dealers in pepper and other persons in great britain be it therefore enacted that from and after the said 5th day of july 1819 if any commodity or substance

shall be kept for sale sold or delivered or shall be offered or exposed to sale or shall be in the custody or possession of any dealer or seller of pepper the same together with all pepper with which the same shall be mixed shall be forfeited with the packages containing the same and shall and may be seized by any officer of excise and the person preparing manufacturing mixing as aforesaid selling exposing to sale or delivering the same or having the same in his her or their custody or possession shall forfeit the sum of one hundred pounds white pepper the common white pepper is factitious being prepared from the black pepper in the following mannerthe pepper is first steeped in sea water and urine and then exposed to the heat of the sun for several days till the rind or outer bark loosens it is then taken out of the steep and when dry it is rubbed with the hand till the rind falls off the white fruit is then dried and the remains of the rind blown away like chaff a great deal of the peculiar flavour and pungent hot taste of the pepper is taken off by this process white pepper is always inferior in flavour and quality to the black pepper however there is a sort of native white pepper produced on a species of the pepper plant which is much better than the factitious and indeed little inferior to the common black pepper footnotes 104 thomsons annals of chemistry 1816

especially of the capsicum frutescens or bird pepper which is the hottest of all this annual plant a native of south america is cultivated in large quantities in our westindia islands and even frequently in our gardens for the beauty of its pods which are long pointed and pendulous at first of a green colour and when ripe of a bright orange red they are filled with a dry loose pulp and contain many small flat kidneyshaped seeds the taste of capsicum is extremely pungent and acrimonious setting the mouth as it were on fire the principle on which its pungency depends is soluble in water and in alcohol it is sometimes adulterated with red lead to prevent it becoming bleached on exposure to light this fraud may be readily detected by shaking up part of it in a stopped vial containing water impregnated with sulphuretted hydrogen gas which will cause it speedily to assume a dark muddy black colour or the vegetable matter of the pepper may be destroyed by throwing a mixture of one part of the suspected pepper and three of nitrate of potash or two of chlorate of potash into a redhot crucible in small quantities at a time the mass left behind may then be digested in weak nitric acid and the solution assayed for lead by water impregnated with sulphuretted hydrogen poisonous pickles vegetable substances preserved in the state called pickles by means of the antiseptic power of vinegar whose sale frequently depends greatly upon a fine lively green colour and the consumption of which by seafaring people in particular is prodigious are sometimes

account of a young lady who amused herself while her hair was dressing with eating samphire pickles impregnated with copper she soon complained of pain in the stomach and in five days vomiting commenced which was incessant for two days after this her stomach became prodigiously distended and in nine days after eating the pickles death relieved her from her suffering among many recipes which modern authors of cookery books have given for imparting a green colour to pickles the following are particularly deserving of censure and it is to be hoped that they will be suppressed in future

p 352 354 adulteration of vinegar vinegar as prepared in this country from malt should be of a pale brown colour perfectly transparent of a pleasant somewhat pungent acid taste and fragrant odour but without any acrimony from the mucilaginous impurities which malt vinegar always contains it is apt on exposure to air to become turbid and ropy and at last vapid the inconvenience is best obviated by keeping the vinegar in bottles completely filled and well corked and it is of advantage to boil it in the bottles a few minutes before they are corked vinegar is sometimes largely adulterated with sulphuric acid to give it more acidity the presence of this acid is detected if on the addition of a solution of acetate of barytes a white precipitate is formed which is insoluble in nitric acid after having been made redhot in the fire see p 159 with the same intention of making the vinegar appear stronger different acrid vegetable substances are infused in it this fraud is difficult of detection but when tasted with attention the pungency of such vinegar will be found to depend rather on acrimony than acidity distilled vinegar which is employed for various purposes of domestic economy is frequently distilled not in glass as it ought to be but in common stills with a pewter pipe whence it cannot fail to acquire a metallic impregnation one ounce by measure should dissolve at least thirteen grains of white marble it should not form a precipitate on the addition of a solution of acetate of barytes or of water saturated with sulphuretted hydrogen the former circumstance shews that it is adulterated with sulphuric acid and the latter indicates a metal the metallic impregnation is best rendered obvious by sulphuretted hydrogen in the manner stated page 69 the distilled vinegar of commerce usually contains tin and not lead as has been asserted adulteration of cream cream is often adulterated with rice powder or arrow root the former is frequently employed for that purpose by pastry cooks in fabricating creams and custards for tarts and other kinds of pastry the latter is often used in the london dairies arrowroot is preferable to rice powder for when converted with milk into a thick mucilage by a gentle ebullition it imparts to cream previously diluted with milk a consistence and apparent richness by no means unpalatable without materially impairing the taste of the cream the arrowroot powder is mixed up with a small quantity of cold skimmed milk into a perfect smooth uniform mixture more milk is then added and the whole boiled for a few minutes to effect the solution of the arrowroot this compound when perfectly cold is mixed up with the cream from 220 to 260 grains or three large teaspoonfuls of arrow root are added to one pint of milk and one part of this solution is mixed with three of cream it is scarcely necessary to state that this sophistication is innocuous the fraud may be detected by adding to a teaspoonful of the sophisticated cream a few drops of a solution of iodine in spirit of wine which instantly produces with it a dark blue colour genuine cream acquires by the addition of this test a faint yellow tinge poisonous confectionery in the preparation of sugar plums comfits and other kinds of confectionery especially those sweetmeats of inferior quality frequently exposed to sale in the open streets for the allurement of children the grossest abuses are committed the white comfits called sugar pease are chiefly composed of a mixture of sugar starch and cornish clay a species of very white pipeclay and the red sugar drops are usually coloured with the inferior kind of vermilion the pigment is generally adulterated with red lead other kinds of sweetmeats are sometimes rendered poisonous by being coloured with preparations of copper the following account of mr miles110 may be advanced in proof of this statement some time ago while residing in the house of a confectioner i noticed the colouring of the green fancy sweetmeats being done by dissolving sapgreen in brandy now sapgreen itself as prepared from the juice of the buckthorn berries is no doubt a harmless substance but the manufacturers of this colour have for many years past produced various tints some extremely bright which there can be no doubt are effected by adding preparations of copper the sweetmeats which accompany these lines you will find exhibit vestiges of being contaminated with copperthe practice of colouring these articles of confectionery should therefore be banished the proprietors of which are not aware of the deleterious quality of the substances employed by them the foreign conserves such as small green limes citrons hoptops plums angelica roots c imported into this country and usually sold in round chip boxes are frequently impregnated with copper the adulteration of confitures by means of clay may be detected by simply dissolving the comfits in a large quantity of boiling water the clay after suffering the mixture to stand undisturbed for a few days will fall to the bottom of the vessel and on decanting the clear fluid and suffering the sediment to become dry gradually it may be obtained in a separate state if the adulteration has been effected by means of clay the obtained precipitate on exposure to a red heat in the bowl of a common tobaccopipe acquires a brick hardness the presence of copper may be detected by pouring over the comfits liquid ammonia which speedily acquires a blue colour if this metal be present the presence of lead is rendered obvious by water impregnated with sulphuretted hydrogen acidulated with muriatic acid see p 69 which assumes a dark brown or black colour if lead be present footnotes 110 philosoph mag no 258 vol 54 1819 p 317 poisonous catsup this article is very often subjected to one of the most reprehensible modes of adulteration ever devised quantities are daily to be met with which on a chemical examination are found to abound with copper indeed this condiment is often nothing else than the residue left behind after the process employed for obtaining distilled vinegar subsequently diluted with a decoction of the outer green husk of the walnut and seasoned with allspice cayenne pepper pimento onions and common salt the quantity of copper which we have more than once detected in this sauce used for seasoning and which on account of its cheapness is much resorted to by people in the lower walks of life has exceeded the proportion of lead to be met with in other articles employed in domestic economy the following account of mr lewis111 on this subject will be sufficient to cause the public to be on their guard being in the habit of frequently purchasing large quantities of pickles and other culinary sauces for the use of my establishment and also for foreign trade it fell lately to my lot to purchase from a manufacturer of those commodities a quantity of walnut catsup apparently of an excellent quality but to my great surprise i had reason to believe that the article might be contaminated with some deleterious substance from circumstances which happened in my business as a tavern keeper but which are unnecessary to be detailed here and it was this that induced me to make inquiry concerning the compounding of the suspected articles the catsup being prepared by boiling in a copper as is usually practised the outer green shell of walnuts after having been suffered to turn black on exposure to air in combination with common salt with a portion of pimento and pepperdust in common vinegar strengthened with some vinegar extract left behind as residue in the still of vinegar manufacturers i therefore suspected that the catsup might be impregnated with some copper to convince myself of this opinion i boiled down to dryness a quart of it in a stone pipkin which yielded to me a dark brown mass i put this mass into a crucible and kept it in a coal fire redhot till it became reduced to a porous black charcoal on urging the heat with a pair of bellows and stirring the mass in the crucible with the stem of a tobaccopipe it became after two hours exposure to an intense heat converted into a greyishwhite ash but no metal could be discriminated amongst it i now poured upon it some aqua fortis which dissolved nearly the whole of it with an effervescence and produced after having been suffered to stand to let the insoluble portion subside a bright grassgreen solution of a strong metallic taste after immersing into this solution the blade of a knife it became instantly covered with a bright coat of copper the walnut catsup was therefore evidently strongly impregnated with copper on informing the manufacturer of this fact he assured me that the same method of preparing the liquor was generally pursued and that he had manufactured the article in a like manner for upwards of twenty years such is the statement i wish to communicate and if you will allow it a place in your literary chronicle it may perhaps tend to put the unwary on their guard against the practice of preparing this sauce by boiling it in a copper which certainly may contaminate the liquor and render it poisonous footnotes 111 literary chronicle no 24 p 379 poisonous custard the leaves of the cherry laurel prunus laurocerasus a poisonous plant have a nutty flavour resembling that of the kernels of peachstones or of bitter almonds which to most palates is grateful these leaves have for many years been in use among cooks to communicate an almond or kernellike flavour to custards puddings creams blancmange and other delicacies of the table it has been asserted that the laurel poison in custards and other articles of cookery is on account of its being used in very small quantities quite harmless to refute this assertion numerous instances might be cited and among them a recent one in which four children suffered most severely from partaking of custard flavoured with the leaves of this poisonous plant several children at a boardingschool in the vicinity of richmond having partaken of some custard flavoured with the leaves of the cherry laurel as is frequently practised by cooks four of the poor innocents were taken severely ill in consequence two of them a girl six years of age and a boy of five years old fell into a profound sleep out of which they could not be roused notwithstanding the various medical exertions used the boy remained in a stupor ten hours and the girl nine hours the other two one of which was six years old a girl and a girl of seven years complained of severe pains in the epigastric region they all recovered after three days illness i am anxious to communicate to you this fact being convinced that your publication is read at all the scholastic establishments in this part of the country i hope you will allow these lines a corner in your literary chronicle where they may contribute to put the unwary on their guard against the deleterious effects of flavouring culinary dishes with that baneful herb the cherry laurel i am with respect yours sir thomas lidiard112 what person of sense or prudence then would trust to the discretion of an ignorant cook in mixing so dangerous an ingredient in his puddings and creams who but a maniac would choose to season his victuals with poison the water distilled from cherry laurel leaves is frequently mixed with brandy and other spiritous liquors to impart to them the flavour of the cordial called noyeau see also page 195 this fluid though long in frequent use as a flavouring substance was not known to be poisonous until the year 1728 when the sudden death of two women in dublin after drinking some of the common distilled cherry laurel water demonstrated its deleterious nature footnotes 112 literary chronicle no 22 p 3481819 poisonous anchovy sauce several samples which we have examined of this fish sauce have been found contaminated with lead the mode of preparation of this fish sauce consists in rubbing down the broken anchovy in a mortar and this triturated mass being of a dark brown colour receives without much risk of detection a certain quantity of venetian red added for the purpose of colouring it which if genuine is an innocent colouring substance but instances have occurred of this pigment having been adulterated with orange lead which is nothing else than a better kind of minium or red oxide of lead the fraud may be detected as stated p 229 the conscientious oilmen less anxious with respect to colour substitute for this poison the more harmless pigment called armenian bole the following recipe for making this fish sauce is copied from grays supplement to the pharmacopoeias p 241 anchovies 2 lbs to 4 lbs and a half pulp through a fine hair sieve boil the bones with common salt 7 oz in water 6 lbs strain add flour 7 oz and the pulp of the fish boil pass the whole through the sieve colour with venetian red to your fancy it should produce one gallon adulteration of lozenges lozenges particularly those into the composition of which substances enter that are not soluble in water as ginger cremor tartar magnesia c are often sophisticated the adulterating ingredient is usually pipeclay of which a liberal portion is substituted for sugar the following detection of this fraud was lately made by dr t lloyd113 some ginger lozenges having lately fallen into my hands i was not a little surprised to observe accidentally that when thrown into a coal fire they suffered but little change if one of the lozenges was laid on a shovel previously made redhot it speedily took fire but instead of burning with a blaze and becoming converted into a charcoal it took fire and burnt with a feeble flame for scarcely half a minute and there remained behind a stony hard substance retaining the form of the lozenge this unexpected result led me to examine these lozenges which were bought at a respectable chemists shop in the city and i soon became convinced that in the preparation of them a considerable quantity of common pipeclay had been substituted for sugar on making a complaint about this fraud at the shop where the article was sold i was informed that there were two kinds of ginger lozenges kept for sale the one at threepence the ounce and the other at sixpence per ounce and that the article furnished to me by mistake was the cheaper commodity the latter were distinguished by the epithet verum they being composed of sugar and ginger only but the former were manufactured partly of white cornish clay with a portion of sugar only with ginger and guinea pepper i was likewise informed that of tolu lozenges peppermint lozenges and ginger pearls and several other sorts of lozenges two kinds were kept that the reduced articles as they were called were manufactured for those very clever persons in their own conceit who are fond of haggling and insist on buying better bargains than other people shutting their eyes to the defects of an article so that they can enjoy the delight of getting it cheap and secondly for those persons who being but bad paymasters yet as the manufacturer for his own credits sake cannot charge more than the usual price of the articles he thinks himself therefore authorised to adulterate it in value to make up for the risk he runs and the long credit he must give the comfits called ginger pearls are frequently adulterated with clay these frauds may be detected in the manner stated page 225 footnotes 113 literary gazette no 146 poisonous olive oil this commodity is sometimes contaminated with lead because the fruit which yields the oil is submitted to the action of the press between leaden plates and it is moreover a practice particularly in spain to suffer the oil to become clear in leaden cisterns before it is brought to market for sale the french and italian olive oil is usually free from this impregnation olive oil is sometimes mixed with oil of poppy seeds but by exposing the mixture to the freezing temperature the olive oil freezes while that of the poppy seeds remains fluid and as oils which freeze with most difficulty are most apt to become rancid olive oil is deteriorated by the mixture of poppy oil good olive oil should have a pale yellow colour somewhat inclining to green a bland taste without smell and should congeal at 38 fahrenheit in this country it is frequently met with rancid the presence of lead is detected by shaking in a stopped vial one part of the suspected oil with two or three parts of water impregnated with sulphuretted hydrogen this agent will render the oil of a dark brown or black colour if any metal deleterious to health be present the practice of keeping this oil in pewter or leaden cisterns as is often the case is objectionable because the oil acts upon the metal the dealers in this commodity assert that it prevents the oil from becoming rancid and hence some retailers often suffer a pewter measure to remain immersed in the oil adulteration of mustard genuine mustard either in powder or in the state of a paste ready for use is perhaps rarely to be met with in the shops the article sold under the name of genuine durham mustard is usually a mixture of mustard and common wheaten flour with a portion of cayenne pepper and a large quantity of bay salt made with water into a paste ready for use some manufacturers adulterate their mustard with radishseed and pease flour it has often been stated that a fine yellow colour is given to mustard by means of turmeric we doubt the truth of this assertion the presence of the minutest quantity of turmeric may instantly be detected by adding to the mustard a few drops of a solution of potash or any other alkali which changes the bright yellow colour to a brown or deep orange tint two ounces and a half of cayenne pepper 112 lbs of bay salt 8 lbs of mustard flour and 112 lbs of wheaten flour made into a stiff paste with the requisite quantity of water in which the baysalt is previously dissolved forms the socalled genuine durham mustard sold in pots the salt and cayenne pepper contribute materially to the keeping of readymade mustard there is therefore nothing deleterious in the usual practice of adulterating this commodity of the table the fraud only tends to deteriorate the quality and flavour of the genuine article itself adulteration of lemon acid it is well known to every one that the expressed juice of lemons is extremely apt to spoil on account of the sugar mucilage and extractive matter which it contains and hence various means have been practised with the intention of rendering it less perishable and less bulky the juice has been evaporated to the consistence of rob but this always gives an unpleasant empyreumatic taste and does not separate the foreign matters so that it is still apt to spoil when agitated on board of ship in tropical climates it has been exposed to frost and part of the water removed under the form of ice but this is liable to all the former objections and besides where lemons are produced in sufficient quantity there is not a sufficient degree of cold the addition of a portion of spirit to the inspissated juice separates the mucilage but not the extractive matter and the sugar by means however of separating the foreign matters associated with it in the juice by chemical processes unnecessary to be detailed here citric acid is now manufactured perfectly pure and in a crystallised form and is sold under the name of concrete lemon acid in this state it is extremely convenient both for domestic and medicinal purposes one drachm when dissolved in one ounce of water is equal in strength to a like bulk of fresh lemon juice to communicate the lemon flavour it is only necessary to rub a lump of sugar on the rind of a lemon to become impregnated with a portion of the essential oil of the fruit and to add the sugar to the lemonade negus punch shrub jellies or culinary sauces prepared with the pure citric acid fraudulent dealers often substitute the cheaper tartareous acid for citric acid the negus and lemonade made by the pastrycooks and the liquor called punch sold at taverns in this metropolis is usually made with tartareous acid to discriminate citric acid from tartareous acid it is only necessary to add a concentrated solution of the suspected acid to a concentrated solution of muriate of potash taking care that the solution of the acid is in excess if a precipitate ensues the fraud is obvious because citric acid does not produce a precipitate with a solution of muriate or potash or by adding to a saturated solution of tartrate of potash a saturated solution of the suspected acid in excess which produces with it an almost insoluble precipitate in minute granular crystals pure citric acid produces no such effect when added in excess to tartrate of potash poisonous mushrooms mushrooms have been long used in sauces and other culinary preparations yet there are numerous instances on record of the deleterious effects of some species of these fungi almost all of which are fraught with poison114 pliny already exclaims against the luxury of his countrymen in this article and wonders what extraordinary pleasure there can be in eating such dangerous food115 but if the palate must be indulged with these treacherous luxuries or as seneca calls them voluptuous poison116 it is highly necessary that the mild eatable mushrooms should be gathered by persons skilful enough to distinguish the good from the false or poisonous which is not always the case nor are the characters which distinguish them strongly marked the following statement is published by mr glen surgeon of knightsbridge a poor man residing in knightsbridge took a walk in hyde park with the intention of gathering some mushrooms he collected a considerable number and after stewing them began to eat them he had finished the whole with the exception of about six or eight when about eight or ten minutes from the commencement of his meal he was suddenly seized with a dimness or mist before his eyes a giddiness of the head with a general trembling and sudden loss of powerso much so that he nearly fell off the chair to this succeeded loss of recollection he forgot where he was and all the circumstances of his case this deprivation soon went off and he so far rallied as to be able though with difficulty to get up with the intention of going to mr glen for assistancea distance of about five hundred yards he had not proceeded more than half way when his memory again failed him he lost his road although previously well acquainted with it he was met by a friend who with difficulty learned his state and conducted him to mr glens house his countenance betrayed great anxiety he reeled about like a drunken man and was greatly inclined to sleep his pulse was low and feeble mr glen immediately gave him an emetic draught the poison had so diminished the sensibility of the stomach that vomiting did not take place for near twenty minutes although another draught had been exhibited during this interval his drowsiness increased to such a degree that he was only kept awake by obliging him to walk round the room with assistance he also at this time complained of distressing pains in the calves of his legsfull vomiting was at length produced after the operation of the emetic he expressed himself generally better but still continued drowsy in the evening mr glen found him doing well the following case is recorded in the medical transactions vol ii a middleaged man having gathered what he called champignons they were stewed and eaten by himself and his wife their child also about four years old ate a little of them and the sippets of bread which were put into the liquor within five minutes after eating them the man began to stare in an unusual manner and was unable to shut his eyes all objects appeared to him coloured with a variety of colours he felt a palpitation in what he called his stomach and was so giddy that he could hardly stand he seemed to himself swelled all over his body he hardly knew what he did or said and sometimes was unable to speak at all these symptoms continued in a greater or less degree for twentyfour hours after which he felt little or no disorder soon after he perceived himself ill one scruple of white vitriol was given him and repeated two or three times with which he vomited plentifully the woman aged thirtynine felt all the same symptoms but in a higher degree she totally lost her voice and her senses and was either stupid or so furious that it was necessary she should be held the white vitriol was offered to her of which she was capable of taking but very little however after four or five hours she was much recovered but she continued many days far from being well and from enjoying her former health and strength she frequently fainted for the first week after and there was during a month longer an uneasy sense of heat and weight in her breast stomach and bowels with great flatulence her head was at first waking much confused and she often experienced palpitations tremblings and other hysteric affections to all which she had ever before been a stranger the child had some convulsive agitations of his arms but was otherwise little affected he was capable of taking half a scruple of ipecacuanha with which he vomited and was soon perfectly recovered mushroom catsup the edible mushroom is the basis of the sauce called mushroom catsup a great proportion of which is prepared by gardeners who grow the fungi the mushrooms employed for preparing this sauce are generally those which are in a putrefactive state and not having found a ready sale in the market for no vegetable substance is liable to so rapid a spontaneous decomposition as mushrooms in a few days after the fungus has been removed from the dungbed on which it grows it becomes the habitation of myriads of insects and if even the saleable mushroom be attentively examined it will frequently be found to swarm with life footnotes 114 fungi plerique veneno turgent linn amn acad 115 qu voluptas tanta ancipitis cibiplin nat hist xxii 23 116 sen ep 95 poisonous soda water the beverage called soda water is frequently contaminated both with copper and lead these metals being largely employed in the construction of the apparatus for preparing the carbonated water117 and the great excess of carbonic acid which the water contains particularly enables it to act strongly on the metallic substances of the apparatus a truth of which the reader will find no difficulty in convincing himself by suffering a stream of sulphuretted hydrogen gas to pass through the watersee p 70 footnotes 117 some manufacturers have been hence induced to construct the apparatus for manufacturing soda water wholly either of earthenware or of glass mr johnston of greek street soho was the first who pointed out to the public the absolute necessity of this precaution food poisoned by copper vessels many kinds of viands are frequently impregnated with copper in consequence of the employment of cooking utensils made of that metal by the use of such vessels in dressing food we are daily liable to be poisoned as almost all acid vegetables as well as sebaceous or pinguid substances employed in culinary preparations act upon copper and dissolve a portion of it and too many examples are met with of fatal consequences having ensued from eating food which had been dressed in copper vessels not well cleaned from the oxide of copper which they had contracted by being exposed to the action of air and moisture the inexcusable negligence of persons who make use of copper vessels has been productive of mortality so much more terrible as they have exerted their action on a great number of persons at once the annals of medicine furnish too many examples in support of this assertion to render it necessary to insist more upon it here mr thiery who wrote a thesis on the noxious quality of copper observes that our food receives its quantity of poison in the kitchen by the use of copper pans and dishes the brewer mingles poison in our beer by boiling it in copper vessels the sugarbaker employs copper pans the pastrycook bakes our tarts in copper moulds the confectioner uses copper vessels the oilman boils his pickles in copper or brass vessels and verdigris is plentifully formed by the action of the vinegar upon the metal though after all a single dose be not mortal yet a quantity of poison however small when taken at every meal must produce more fatal effects than are generally apprehended and different constitutions are differently affected by minute quantities of substances that act powerfully on the system the author of a tract entitled serious reflections on the dangers attending the use of copper vessels asserts that a numerous and frightful train of diseases is occasioned by the poisonous effects of pernicious matter received into the stomach insensibly with our victuals dr johnston118 gives an account of the melancholy catastrophe of three men being poisoned after excruciating sufferings in consequence of eating food cooked in an unclean copper vessel on board the cyclops frigate and besides these thirtythree men became ill from the same cause the following case119 is related by sir george baker m d some cyder which had been made in a gentlemans family being thought too sour was boiled with honey in a brewing vessel the rim of which was capped with lead all who drank this liquor were seized with a bowel colic more or less violently one of the servants died very soon in convulsions several others were cruelly tortured a long time the master of the family in particular notwithstanding all the assistance which art could give him never recovered his health but died miserably after having almost three years languished under a most tedious and incurable malady too much care and attention cannot be taken in preserving all culinary utensils of copper in a state unexceptionably fit for their destined purpose they should be frequently tinned and kept thoroughly clean nor should any food ever be suffered to remain in them for a longer time than is absolutely necessary to their preparation for the table but the sure preventive of its pernicious effect is to banish copper utensils from the kitchen altogether the following wholesome advice on this subject is given to cooks by the author of an excellent cookery book120 stewpans and soupkettles should be examined every time they are used these and their covers must be kept perfectly clean and well tinned not only on the inside but about a couple of inches on the outside so much mischief arises from their getting out of repair and if not kept nicely tinned all your work will be in vain the broths and soups will look green and dirty and taste bitter and poisonous and will be spoiled both for the eye and palate and your credit will be lost and as the health and even the life of the family depends upon this the cook may be sure her employer had rather pay the tinmans bill than the doctors the senate of sweden in the year 1753 prohibited copper vessels and ordered that none but such as were made of iron should be used in their fleet and armies footnotes 118 johnstons essay on poison p 102 119 medical transactions vol i p 213 120 apicius redivivus p 91 food poisoned by leaden vessels various kinds of food used in domestic economy are liable to become impregnated with lead the glazing of the common creamcoloured earthen ware which is composed of an oxide of lead readily yields to the action of vinegar and saline compounds and therefore jars and pots of this kind of stone ware are wholly unfit to contain jellies of fruits marmalade and similar conserves pickles should in no case be deposited in creamcoloured glazed earthenware the custom which still prevails in some parts of this country of keeping milk in leaden vessels for the use of the dairy is very improper in lancashire121 the dairies are furnished with milkpans made of lead and when mr parks expostulated with some individuals on the danger of this practice he was told that leaden milkpans throw up the cream much better than vessels of any other kind in some parts of the north of england it is customary for the innkeepers to prepare mintsalad by bruising and grinding the vegetable in a large wooden bowl with a ball of lead of twelve or fourteen pounds weight in this operation the mint is cut and portions of the lead are ground off at every revolution of the ponderous instrument in the same county it is a common practice to have brewingcoppers constructed with the bottom of copper and the whole sides of lead the baking of fruit tarts in creamcoloured earthenware and the salting and preserving of meat in leaden pans are no less objectionable all kinds of food which contain free vegetable acids or saline preparations attack utensils covered with a glaze in the composition of which lead enters as a component part the leaden beds of presses for squeezing the fruit in cyder countries have produced incalculable mischief these consequences never follow when the lead is combined with tin because this metal being more eager for oxidation prevents the solution of the lead when we consider the various unsuspected means by which the poisons of lead and copper gain admittance into the human body a very common but dangerous instance presents itself namely the practice of painting toys made for the amusement of children with poisonous substances viz red lead verdigris c children are apt to put every thing especially what gives them pleasure into their mouths the painting of toys with colouring substances that are poisonous ought therefore to be abolished a practice which lies the more open to censure as it is of no real utility footnotes 121
