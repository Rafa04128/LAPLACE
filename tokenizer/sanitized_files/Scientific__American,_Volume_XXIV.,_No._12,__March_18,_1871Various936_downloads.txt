recently been a most interesting discussion at the literary and philosophical society manchester on the above subject the paper which gave rise to the discussion was by mr brockbank who detailed many experiments and ended by stating his opinion that iron does become much weaker both in its cast and wrought states under the influence of low temperature but mr brockbanks paper was immediately followed by others by sir w fairbairn dr joule and mr spence which at once put an entirely new complexion on the matter dr joule says as is usual in a severe frost we have recently heard of many severe accidents consequent upon the fracture of the tires of the wheels of railway carriages the commonsense explanation of these accidents is that the ground being harder than usual the metal with which it is brought into contact is more severely tried than in ordinary circumstances in order apparently to excuse certain railway companies a pretence has been set up that iron and steel become brittle at a low temperature this pretence although put forth in defiance not only of all we know of the properties of materials but also of the experience of everyday life has yet obtained the credence of so many people that i thought it would be useful to make the following simple experiments 1st a freezing mixture of salt and snow was placed on a table wires of steel and of iron were stretched so that a part of them was in contact with the freezing mixture and another part out of it in every case i tried the wire broke outside of the mixture showing that it was weaker at 50 f than at about 12 f 2d i took twelve darning needles of good quality 3 in long 124 in thick the ends of these were placed against steel props 218 in asunder in making an experiment a wire was fastened to the middle of a needle the other end being attached to a spring weighingmachine this was then pulled until the needle gave way six of the needles taken at random were tried at a temperature of 55 f and the remaining six in a freezing mixture which brought down their temperature to 12 f the results were as follow warm needles cold needles 64 ounces broke 55 ounces broke 65 64 55 72 62 60 bent 44 68 broke 60 bent 40 average 5813 average 5956 i did not notice any perceptible difference in the perfection of elasticity in the two sets of needles the result as far as it goes is in favor of the cold metal 3d the above are doubtless decisive of the question at issue but as it might be alleged that the violence to which a railway wheel is subjected is more akin to a blow than a steady pull and as moreover the pretended brittleness is attributed more to cast iron than any other description of the metal i have made yet another kind of experiment i got a quantity of cast iron garden nails an inch and a quarter long and 18 in thick in the middle these i weighed and selected such as were nearly of the same weight i then arranged matters so that by removing a prop i could cause the blunt edge of a steel chisel weighted to 4lb 2oz to fall from a given height upon the middle of the nail as it was supported from each end 1116 in asunder in order to secure the absolute fairness of the trials the nails were taken at random and an experiment with a cold nail was always alternated with one at the ordinary temperature the nails to be cooled were placed in a mixture of salt and snow from which they were removed and struck with the hammer in less than 5 the collective result of the experiments the details of which need not be given was that 21 cold nails broke and 20 warm ones dr joule adds the experiments of lavoisier and laplace of smeaton of dulong and petit and of troughton conspire in giving a less expansion by heat to steel than iron especially if the former be in an untempered state but this would in certain limits have the effect of strengthening rather than of weakening an iron wheel with a tire of steel the general conclusion is this frost does not make either iron cast or wrought or steel brittle mr spence in his experiments decided on having some lengths of cast iron made of a uniform thickness of in square from the same metal and the same mould he writestwo of the four castings i got seemed to be good ones and i got the surface taken off and made them as regular a thickness as was practicable i then fixed two knifeedged wedges upon the surface of a plank at exactly nine inches distance from each other with an opening in the plank in the intervening space the bar being laid across the wedges a knifeedged hook was hung in the middle of the suspended piece of the bar and to the hook was hung a large scale on which to place weights the bar was tried first at a temperature of 60 f to find the breaking weight i placed 56lb weights one after another on the scale and when the ninth was put on the bar snapped this was the only unsatisfactory experiment as 14 or 28lb might have done it but i include it among others i now adopted another precaution by placing the one end of the plank on a fixed point and the other end on to a screwjack by raising which i could without any vibration bring the weight to bear upon the bar by this means small weights up to 7lb could be put on while hanging but when these had to be taken off and a large weight put on the scale was lowered to the rest and again raised after the change was made i may here state that a curious circumstance occurred twice which seems to indicate that mere raising of the weight without the slightest apparent vibration was equal in effect to an additional weight 3 cwts were on the scale a 14lb weight was added then 7lb then 4lb 2lb 1lb and 1lb making 4cwts and 1lb this was allowed to act for from one to two minutes and then lowered to take off the small weights which were replaced by a 56lb with the intention of adding small weights when suspended the whole was then raised so imperceptibly by the screw that the only way of ascertaining that it was suspended was by looking under the scale to see that it was clear of the rest as soon as it was halfaninch clear it snapped thus breaking at once with one pound less than it resisted for nearly two minutes six experiments were carefully conducted at 60 f the parts of the bars being selected so as to give to each set of experiments similar portions of both bars the results are marked on the pieces my assistant now prepared a refrigerating mixture which stood at zero the bars were immersed for some time in this and we prepared for the breaking trials to be made as quickly as could be consistently with accuracy and to secure the low temperature each bar on being placed in the machine had its surface at top covered with the freezing mixture the bars at zero broke with more regularity than at 60 but instead of the results confirming the general impression as to cold rendering iron more brittle they are calculated to substantiate an exactly opposite idea namely that reduction of temperature cteris paribus increases the strength of cast iron the only doubtful experiment of the whole twelve is the first and as it stands much the highest the probability is that it should be lower yet even taking it as it stands the average of the six experiments at 60 f gives 4cwt 4lb as the breaking weight of the bar at that temperature while the average of the six experiments at zero gives 4cwt 20lb as the breaking weight of the bar at zero being an increase of strength from the reduction of temperature equal to 35 per cent sir w fairbairn states it has been asserted in evidence given at the coroners inquest in a recent railway accident that the breaking of the steel tire was occasioned by the intensity of the frost which is supposed to have rendered the metal of which this particular tire was composed brittle this is the opinion of most persons but judging from my own experience such is not the fact some years since i endeavored to settle this question by a long and careful series of experiments on wrought iron from which it was proved that the resistance to a tensile chain was as great at the temperature of zero as it was at 60 or upwards until it attained a scarcely visible red heat the immense number of purposes to which both iron and steel are applied and the changes of temperature to which they are exposed renders the inquiry not only interesting in a scientific point of view but absolutely necessary to a knowledge of their security under the various influences of those changes it was for these reasons that the experiments in question were undertaken and the summary of results is sufficiently conclusive to show that changes of temperature are not always the cause of failure sir w fairbairn adds the danger arising from broken tires does not according to my opinion arise so much from changes of temperature as from the practice of heating them to a dull red heat and shrinking them on to the rim of the wheels this i believe is the general practice and the unequal and in some cases the severe strains to which they are subject has a direct tendency to break the tires oak graining in oil colors condensed from the building news there is a charm and feeling about work executed by the hand which gives it a value no mere machine work can possess machine work from its very nature necessitates a repetition of pattern which cannot be avoided handwork on the contrary can imitate every variety and follow nature so closely that no two pieces need be alike there is also in handwork a wide scope for the inventive faculty and the exercise of good taste both in form and color and skillful workmanship as a rule strong contrasts between the ground and the graining color should be avoided the figure and grain should of course be seen clearly but only so clearly as to be distinct without interfering with the general and uniform quietness of tone necessary to fulfil the conditions required by the laws of harmony and good taste violent contrasts and gaudy coloring are always vulgar brilliancy and richness of color are not necessarily vulgar it is the absence of the guiding power of knowledge and pure taste in their arrangement which degrades them to the rank of vulgarity we have before spoken of the importance of good combing and of the various kinds of combs used we now proceed to describe how the work is done the graining color is brushed over the work in the ordinary manner with a poundbrush care being taken not to put too much color on or else it is very liable to be dirty a dry duster is now used to stipple with which if properly done will distribute the color evenly it is now ready for combing in the real oak it will be found as a rule that the grain is invariably coarser on one side of the panel than on the other this arises from the very nature of the growth of the tree it is therefore well to imitate this pattern and in order to do so we take first a medium or coarse cut guttapercha comb and draw it down one side of the panel then use a finer one to complete it this comb will leave the marks of the grain in clear unbroken lines from top to bottom of the panel we now take a fine steel comb and go over the whole of the previous combing moving it in a slanting or diagonal direction across the previous grain or with a quick and short wavy motion or curl both the former and the latter motion will break up the long lines left by the guttapercha comb into short bits which of course represent the pores or grains of the real wood there are several other motions of the comb having the same end in view and by using the guttapercha or cork combs in conjunction with the fine steel an infinite variety of grain may be produced steel combs with one or more folds of thin rag placed over the ends of the teeth are a style of comb which has nothing to recommend it a natural variation in the grain may be produced by one comb alone according to the manner in which it is held for instance if we take a coarse or broadtoothed guttapercha comb and commence at the top of a panel with the comb placed at its full width if drawn down in this position it will leave a grain of the same width as the width of the teeth but if we start with the full width and gradually turn the comb or slightly incline it to one sidethat is to say on its edge we thereby graduate the grain from coarse to fine at pleasure and by holding the comb at a certain inclination we may actually make very fine the coarse comb a very important point is the formation of the joints in the wood as much of the effect of otherwise good work is lost in consequence of neglect in this respect in looking at a real oak door the joints of the stiles and rails are clearly and sharply defined not by any defect of workmanship but by the difference in the run of the grain the stiles being perpendicular and the rails horizontal the rails being cut sharp off by the stiles show a perfectly straight line the light also acts differently upon the two simply because the grain or fibre of the wood is exposed to its influence under different aspects this also tends to produce a difference in the depth of the color of rails and stiles and panels also it will be evident that no imitations can be considered really good except they include these seemingly unimportant points it is a common practice for grainers to imitate a broad piece of heart or sap of oak upon the back rail of almost every door they do and many of them are not even content with that but daub the stiles over from top to bottom with it also there is nothing so vulgar or in such bad taste it should only be done upon those parts of the work on which it would appear on a real oak door namely on the edges of the doors and on mouldings there is a vulgar pretentiousness about what we may call the sappy style of work which is very undesirable the figures cross the grain more or less abruptly and of course are of different shapes sizes and forms a knowledge of which can only be acquired by study of the real wood the figure may be wiped out with a piece of soft rag held tight over the thumb nail this should have two or three folds over the nail the superfluous rag being held by the other hand to prevent it hanging down and smearing the grain and every time a figure is wiped the rag should be moved slightly so that the same part of the rag will not be used twice thus insuring clean work it will often happen that the thumbnail will get broken or is too weak to stand the work in these cases or in fact in any case a good substitute or artificial thumbnail may be made of guttapercha thus a piece of thin sheet guttapercha is put into warm water and while soft is wrapped around the end of the thumb up to the first joint it is then pressed with the hand so as to fit and take the shape of the thumb and nail this cannot be done at one heating but will have to be put into the hot water again and the end pinched and squeezed into form to the shape of the nail and to fit easily upon the thumb when this gets hard it may be trimmed into perfect form with a penknife this artificial nail will answer the purpose admirably if properly made and even when the natural nail is good the guttapercha will serve to save it from injury good figuring may also be done by using the blank end of the steel comb with a rag folded over its edge we have also used a piece of guttapercha to take out the lights this should be squareended about one inch wide and three or four inches long and will do successful work of a certain class but not of the best many grainers use a piece of thin horn in shape something like a spatula about three or four inches long and three quarters of an inch wide with rounded ends and quite flexible with this tool the figure is cut or scooped outa sort of quick sidelong motion very difficult to describe and requiring a very considerable amount of practice before it can be worked with any success there is however the same objection to this tool as may be urged against the guttapercha for figuring namely that neither of them take the color clean away but leave an accumulation of color on the edge of the figure which is fatal to good work and therefore we cannot honestly recommend the use of any method but the wiping out with the thumbnail or its substitute when the figure is wiped out it will require to be softened by softening we mean the imitation of those half shades seen upon and about the figures in the real wood between and around the lights or figure in oak there is always a lighter tint of color this is imitated by doubling a piece of rag into a small roll and with the side of this the grain is partially wiped away but not to the extent of taking off the whole of the grain a recent but most admirable system of graining oak by means of overcombing is worked exactly the reverse of any of the foregoing methods that is to say the figure is first wiped out and the combing or grain is done afterwards when the graining color is dry in this wise the graining color is mixed somewhat thinner than for ordinary graining and is brushed over the work sparingly leaving it just sufficiently strong to show a clear distinction between the ground and the color the light or figure is then softened by drawing the end of a flat hoghair fitch or a small thin mottler across each figure and slightly softening with the badgerhair softener the figure is broken up a little with fine lines across it in parts such as may be seen in the real wood but previous to wiping out the figure streaks of light should be wiped out and softened on one side of the panel or across the stiles in imitation of the reflective lights seen in oak the color should also be partially wiped off the rails or stiles at their junction this tends to define the joint the color is now let to dry hard when it will be ready for overcombingthat is combing or graining over the figure hence its name and this will have to be done somewhat differently to the ordinary combing as thus the color is rubbed in as before and combed solely with the guttapercha combs but these are specially cut for the purpose they are best about 2 in wide the first must be cut with teeth about threesixteenths of an inch in width the next oneeighth and the third about onesixteenth the broadtoothed comb is first used and must be drawn down the panel with a wavy motion in short or long curls either will answer our purpose now the next size of comb is then drawn straight downthe straighter the better this has the effect of breaking the wavy combing into short and long straight bits similar to the pores or grain of the real wood both the first and second combing may be varied by holding the comb in a slanting direction and may be fine or coarse according to the width of the combs used now take a soft rag folded and with this partially clear off the grain which runs over the figure leaving only a sufficient quantity crossing the light or figure to be just distinguished exactly as it appears upon the figure in real oak the grain is also wiped off in parts on the plain spaces between the figure in order to break it up and take away any formality if this method be well and probably done a thoroughly deceptive imitation may be produced and except this end be kept in view no really good work will result knots and splices see engraving on first page 1 turn used in making up ropes 2 end tapered for the purpose of passing it readily through a loop to make this we unlay the rope for the necessary length reducing a rope diminishing in diameter towards the end which is finished by interlacing the ends without cutting them as it would weaken the work it is lastly whipped with small twine 3 tapered end covered with interlaced cordage for the purpose of making it stronger this is done with very small twine attached at one end to the small eye and at the other to the strands of the rope thus making a strong webbing around the end 4

interlacing commenced in one direction 15 interlacing finished the ends being worked under the strands as in a splice 16 pigtail commenced 17 interlacing fastened 18 pigtail with the strands taut 19 dead eye shown in two views 20 pigtail finished we pass the ends of the strands one under the other in the same way as if we were making a pudding splice thus bringing it in a line with the rope to which it is seized fast and the ends cut off 21 scull pigtail instead of holding the ends by a tie we interlace them again as in no 16 the one under the other 22 pigtail or larks nest we make this to the pennant of a cable which has several strands by taking the requisite number of turns over the pudding in such a manner that the strands shall lay under each other this pigtail forms a knot at the end of the rope it thus draws together two ropes as shown in no 32 forming a shroud knot in these two pigtails the strands are crossed before finishing the ends so that the button a is made with the strands a and b with those of the rope b 23 slip clinch to sailors knot 24 slip clinch secured 25 ordinary knot upon a double rope 26 bowline knot for a man to sit in at his work 27 called a short splice as it is not of great length and besides can be made quickly 30 long splice this extends from a to b we unlay the strands of each of the ropes we intend to join for about half the length that the splice will be putting each strand of the one between two strands of the other 31 simple fastening on a rope 32 a shroud knot 33 the ends of the rope are prepared for making the splice no 29 in the same manner as for the shroud knot in no 32 when the strands are untwisted we put the ends of two cords together as close as possible and place the ends of the one between the strands of the other above and below alternately so as to interlace them as in no 29 this splice is not however very strong and is only used when there is not time to make a long splice which is much the best 34 and 35

employed when hauling upon large ropes where the strength of several men are necessary 38 a pudding splice this is commenced like the others by placing the rope end to end the turns of the one being passed between those of the other having first swelled out the yarns by a ratstail we put them two by two one over the other twisting them tightly and opening a way for them with the marlinspike the inconvenience of this splice is that it is larger in diameter than the rope itself but when made sufficiently long by gradually reducing the size of the strands it has great strength 39 this shows two strands a and b of the ropes a b knotted together being drawn as tight as possible we unlay the strand a of the rope a for half the length of the splice and twist the strand b of the rope b strongly in its place tying a and b together tightly the same process is again gone through on the rope b the strand a of the rope a being knotted to the strand b of the rope b when all the strands are thus knotted together we interlace them with the strands of the cable thus the strands a a a are interlocked by being passed alternately above and below the turns of the cord b the ends being also sometimes whipped in the same manner the strands b b b pass alternately over and under the strands of the rope a and are in like manner whipped it is important that the several interlacings and knots should not meet at one point we reduce the size of the strands towards the end so that they loose themselves in the body of the splice cutting off such parts as may project this splice is employed for joining the ends of a rope when a chafed part has been cut out and is quite as strong as the rope itself 40 belayingpin opened to serve as a button these are used where it is necessary to stop or

the following report of its inspections in january 1871 during the month there were 522 visits of inspection made and 1030 boilers examined853 externally and 363 internally while 106 have been tested by hydraulic pressure number of defects in all discovered 431 of which 163 were regarded as dangerous these defects were as follows furnaces out of shape 243 dangerous fractures 4725 dangerous burned plates 2914 dangerous blistered plates 5410 dangerous cases of sediment and deposit 9718 dangerous cases of incrustation and scale 7024 dangerous to show how little attention is paid to the internal condition of boilers by incompetent engineers we copy the following from a letter of one of our inspectors in one tubular boiler i found sediment in the back end eight inches deep and extending forward more than four feet it seemed to be an accumulation of fine scale cemented together so that it was necessary to break it up with a hammer and chisel before it could be removed the engineer said he had cleaned the boilers only three days before and objected to my making another examination this is one of the many cases we find where the proprietor trusts everything about his boilers to his engineer supposing him to be reliable with such accumulation of sediment and deposit is it any wonder that sheets are burned a careful engineer will understand if the feed water be impure that he must blow down two or three inches every day or oftener that the sediment may be removed as it accumulates and then an internal examination once in two weeks or once a month will insure a clean boiler cases of external corrosion 2610 dangerous cases of internal corrosion 175 dangerous cases of internal grooving 2811 dangerous water gages out of order 50 blowout apparatus out of order 157 dangerous safety valves overloaded 4012 dangerous pressure gages out of order 546 dangerous varying from 15 to 8 pounds we have found several gages entirely ruined from being frozen boilers without gages 4 cases of deficiency of water 51 dangerous broken braces and stays 317 dangerous boilers condemned 2both dangerous two engineers were found drunk on duty and promptly discharged there were 9 serious explosions during the month by which 99 persons were killed and 6 wounded eightyseven of the killed were passengers on the illfated steamer hr arthur on the mississippi river many were drowned and some burned but the origin of the calamity was the bad quality of the boilers which a careless management was unable to detect the upper and fore part of the boat was blown away by the exploded boilers and to add to the horror what remained took fire none of these exploded boilers were under the care of this company five oreroasting furnaces are in full blast in nevada improved compound

bending should be soldered brazed or welded they act merely as guides to compel the component springs to expand or contract in vertical lines and need only be strong enough for that purpose the compressing plate is formed with concentric steps or ledges as shown in fig 2 so that with light loads only a portion of the component spirals act with a heavier load a new series of spirals is brought into action and so on till the spring is loaded to its full capacity this feature is novel and as important as novel as it gives the spring a far more easy and flexible carriage with light loads than would be the case if all the spirals were permitted to act in putting the spring together the vertical part of the case is inverted the compressing plate is then placed within the case resting upon the inner flange of the case above described the tubes with their inclosed springs are then arranged in position as shown in the plan view fig 3 the bottom plate of the case is then placed in position and held to its place by lugs and rivets as shown in fig 1 the spring is then ready for use the employment of tubes in the manner described enables springs of the greatest practical length to be used without the sectional or division plates met with in other spiral car springs a greater and easier movement is therefore obtained these springs can it is claimed compete in price

large timber of from two to six feet girth and from small underwood of about the thickness of a mans thumb the timber which is chiefly beech is first sawed into battens of about three feet in length and as many inches in width and from each of these battens two square sticks with square heads are afterwards cut in opposite directions so that the middle portion is waste wood the corners of each are afterwards rounded off by a planing process called trapping and the square head is reduced by a small saw to a curve or rectangular bend so as to form a handle when the sticks are brought in this way to the exact size and pattern they are polished with great care are finely varnished and packed in boxes or bundles for the market many sawn sticks however are supplied with bone and horn handles which are fastened on with glue and then of course there is less wood waste as a larger number of them may be cut from one batten a very different process takes place in the manufacture of sticks from small underwood in which there is no sawing required the rough unfashioned sticks which are generally of hazel ash oak and thorn are cut with a bill in the same way as kidney bean sticks and are brought to the factory in large bavins or bundles piled on a timber tug there must of course be some little care in their selection yet it is evident that the woodmen are not very particular on this score for they have in general an ungainly appearance and many are so crooked and rough that no drover or country boy would think it worth while to polish the like of them with his knife having arrived at this place however their numerous excrescences are soon pruned away and their ugliness converted into elegance when sufficiently seasoned and fit for working they are first laid to soak in wet sand and rendered more tough and pliable a workman then takes them one by one and securing them with an iron stock bends them skillfully this way and that so as to bring out their natural crooks and render them at last all straight even rods if they are not required to be knotted they next go to the trapper who puts them through a kind of circular plane which takes off knots and renders them uniformly smooth and round the most important process of all is that of giving them their elegantly curved handles for which purpose they are passed over to the crooker every child knows that if we bend a tough stick moderately when the pressure is discontinued it will soon fly back more or less to its former position and if we bend it very much it will break now the crooker professes to accomplish the miracle of bending a stick as it might be an iron wire so that it shall neither break nor backen to prevent the breaking the wood is rendered pliant by further soaking in wet sand and a flexible band of metal is clamped down firmly to that portion of the stick that will form the outside of the curve the top end is then fitted into a grooved iron shoulder which determines the size of the crook the other end being brought round so as to point in the opposite direction the metal band during this process binding with increasing tightness against the stretching fibers of the wood so that they cannot snap or give way under the strain the crook having been made the next thing is to fix it or remove from the fibers the reaction of elasticity which would otherwise on the cessation of the bending force cause it to backen more or less and undo the work in the old process of crooking by steam as timber bending is effected the stick was merely left till it was cold to acquire a permanent set but in the new process a more permanent set is given by turning the handle about briskly over a jet of gas the sticks being now fashioned it only remains to polish and stain or varnish them and they are sometimes scorched or burned brown and carved with foliage animal heads and other deviceschambers journal flowering of the victoria regia in the open airjoseph mager esq has succeeded in flowering the victoria lily in his pond in england the pond is perfectly open but the water is heated by hot water pipes coming from a boiler near the pond carefully concealed the seeds of the victoria were planted in may last and the first flower was produced sept 10th afterwards seven other flowers opened the plant has eight leaves of which the largest is five feet two inches in diameter mr mager has also succeeded in flowering a large number of other tropical lilies in his pond jute a material largely used in combination with hemp for making cordage sacking mats and carpets

sent to great britain ventilation of the liverpool tunnel this tunnel which forms an ascending incline of a mile and a quarter length from the terminal station in limestreet london and n w railroad was worked until recently by a rope and stationary engine to avoid fouling the air of the tunnel by the passage of locomotives but the increase of the traffic having necessitated the abandonment of the rope and the substitution of locomotives for bringing the trains up through the tunnel it became requisite to provide some efficient means of ventilation for clearing the tunnel speedily of the smoke and steam after the passage of each train a large exhausting fan has been designed by mr john ramsbottom for this purpose which works in a chamber situated near the middle of the length of the tunnel and draws the air in from the tunnel through a cross drift discharging it up a tapering chimney that extends to a considerable hight above the surface of the ground over the tunnel the fan is about thirty feet diameter and is made with straight radial vanes it revolves on a horizontal shaft at a speed of about fortyfive revolutions per minute within a brick casing built concentric with the fan for the first half of the circumference and afterwards expanding gradually for discharging into the base of the chimney the air from the tunnel being drawn in at the center of the fan at each side and discharged from the circumference of the fan by the revolution of the vanes the engine driving the fan is started by telegraph signal at each departure of a train from the terminal station and the fan is kept running until the discharge from it becomes quite clear showing that no steam or smoke remains in the tunnel this is usually the case in about eight minutes after the time of the train entering the lower end of the tunnel the passage of the train through the tunnel occupying about three minutes the fan draws air in at both ends of the tunnel simultaneously and begins to clear the lower end immediately upon the train entering the clearing of the upper end commences as soon as the train has passed out of the tunnel and as the fan is situated nearer the upper end of the tunnel than the lower the clearing of both lengths is completed almost simultaneously the fan is so constructed as to allow an uninterrupted passage through it for the air whilst the fan is standing still and the natural ventilation thus obtained by means of the large chimney is found sufficient for clearing the tunnel during the night and some portion of the day without the fan being worked at those times this natural ventilation is aided by the engine exhaust and the boiler discharging into the chimney the fan has now been in regular operation for threequarters of a year and has been found completely successful impregnating wood with tar or other preserving material the preservation of wood is a problem which is attracting increased attention as year by year diminishes the material supply of timber and consequently gradually increases its price among other methods employed the impregnation of wood by the vapors of tar creosote petroleum etc has been tried and one of the practical difficulties met with has been the obtaining of suitable apparatus for the purpose illustration the engraving annexed is an invention intended to supply this want the wood is inclosed in a tank kept hot by a steam jacket which surrounds it as shown a boiler at one end is used to heat the substance with which it is desired to impregnate the wood an air pump is also employed to remove the steam generated in the heated timber and the air from the tank the pores of the wood being thus rendered vacuous the hot liquid or vapors from the heating tank readily penetrate the entire substance and thoroughly impregnate it this apparatus is the invention of george pustkuchen of hoboken n j boardmans combined tool this tool of which our engraving is a good representation comprises a screw wrench a pipe wrench a hammer a nail claw a screwdriver and a bit handle or socket wrench the bit handle is the entire tool the square socket or opening being made in the end of the handle in which the shanks of bits may be inserted the screw driver is formed on the end of the screw bar attached to the outer jaw of the wrench and is taken out from the hollow of the handle when required for use the use of the other parts of the tool will be apparent from the engraving the tool is very compact and has this advantage over the ordinary screw wrench that its leverage increases as it is opened to receive nuts of larger size illustration this invention is protected by two patents dated respectively may 30 1865 and july 10 1866 for further information address b boardman co norwich conn belt

editorsi have hesitated about the propriety of replying to the criticisms of your correspondent j e hendricks upon my paper on the action of the reciprocating parts of steam engines it is not to be expected that a truth so opposed to commonly received notionsthe reception of which requires so much to be unlearnedshould at once receive the assent of every one some odd fancies on the subject are likely to be ventilated first but your correspondent touches the root of the matter and perhaps the fact questioned by him should be more clearly placed beyond dispute i will dismiss the introductory part of his letter merely observing that his logical inference is quite gratuitous and unwarranted he says himself that its absurdity is obvious in which i quite agree with him the real question is this what is the figure representing the acceleration of the motion of a piston controlled by a crank which revolves with a uniform velocity i stated it to be a rightangled triangle and indicated as i supposed clearly enough a simple method by which this could be shown your correspondent claims that the calculation according to my own rule gives a figure of a totally different form and one that shows the acceleration as well as the motion to be reduced to zero at the commencement of the stroke let us see let the straight line aj in the following figure represent half the stroke of the piston and let the distances ab ac etc on this line represent the versed sines of 10 20 etc up to 90 or the motion of the piston while the crank is moving through these arcs at the points a b c etc erect the perpendiculars aa bb cc etc and let the length of each of these ordinates represent the acceleration imparted in a given time at that point of the stroke then will aj be to aa as ij is to ii as hj is to hh etc showing that the straight line aj connects the extremities of all the ordinates and that the triangle aja represents the acceleration of the motion of the piston from the commencement to the middle of the stroke illustration the following table will enable any one to make the calculations proving the truth of the above proposition degrees versed sine motion for 10 acceleration during 1 0

acceleration for 1 at any point was fully explained in the paper and compared with the similar method of showing the uniform acceleration of a body acted on by a constant force the ordinary tables in the handbooks going only to five places of decimals are of no use for these computations i would suggest a practical experiment let any one having an engine running at a good speed loosen the crank pin brasses a little so that at starting it will thump heavily let the engine be lightly loaded so that only a small portion of the boiler pressure will need to be admitted to the cylinder as its speed increases the thump will die away and if at its full speed the pressure of the steam admitted is not so great as to overcome the centrifugal strain of the reciprocating parts on the crank as it passes the centers the engine will revolve in silence any one can ascertain by the rule given in the note to the paper just what pressure can be admitted without causing a thump or this can be found by a little experimenting i am running an engine which does not thump with loose crank pin brasses under eighty pounds pressure admitted sharply on the centers charles t porter answer to practical

covers the ground in a very simple manner we think it will be sufficient those forwarding the solutions not published will accept our thanks and assurances that it is not because they lack merit that they are declinededs reciprocating parts of steam engines messrs editorsin one of the late numbers of your journal you publish a paper read by mr porter before some learned society in new york on something about the possibility or practicability of running a steam engine at a high rate of speed and claiming to give a scientific explanation of the why and wherefore now scientifically i know nothing about a steam engine practically i know how to stop and start one therefore you will understand that what i say is not as coming from one who claims to be wise above what is written but as simply being a statement of the case as it appears to one who wants to learn and takes this way to draw out the truth a scientific theory invested with all its sines coefficients and other paraphernalia is a very pretty thing to look at no doubt for those who understand it and when properly applied is invaluable but when as in this case a practical question is to be decided by the aid of a scientific demonstration it will not do to throw aside the main elements of the problem or any in fact of the minor points no matter how trivial they may appear mr porters labors were strictly of a scientific nature he starts out with the proposition that what he is about to explain is very simple and very likely it is but for one i cant see it and i want more light he says that it takes a certain number of pounds to overcome the inertia of the reciprocating parts of a certain weight to give it a certain speed what is inertia he says we will not take into account the friction of parts now my understanding of this point is that friction is practically one of the main elements in the problem how can we hope to obtain a correct solution when he rubs out one of the terms of the equation what is friction doing all the time while he is theoretically having his reciprocating parts storing up power and then giving it out again just at the right time and in the right quantity what an immense amount of iron has been wasted by being cast into fly wheels when a fraction of the amount if only put into cross heads would render fly wheels unnecessary mr porter stops short in his discussion he should have added a table giving the proportionate length of stroke weight of parts and number of revolutions required to produce the effect of an engine running at a high speed without the least fraction of inequality in the strain on the crank and then the sun would have fairly risen in the dawn of a new era for the steam engine but as it is so very simple we can all figure it out for ourselves in the diagram mr porter gives to illustrate the travel of the piston he wets his finger and draws it over another term in the equation a method of elimination not taught by hutton davies and other mathematicians it is a quick way but is it correct he says the distance traveled by the piston is the versed sine of an angle formed by a line from the center of the crank pin in any part of its stroke to the center of the circle described by the crank pin leaving out of the calculation the angular vibration of the connecting rod what he means by the angular vibration i do not know he is wrong in the statement if he will think of it he will see it if he meant to say that the pistons travel was measured by the versed sine of the angle formed by the connecting rod and the line of horizontal centers he is wrong again yet nearer the truth than before just as the proportion between the length of the connecting rod and the half diameter of the circle described by the crank pin this can quickly be seen by supposing the connecting rod to be detached and allowed to fall down on the center line at any part of the stroke if he understood this as no doubt he did he should not ignore the facts what i am aiming at is this when a man attempts to demonstrate a thing mathematically he must take into his calculation everything essentially connected with the problem just exactly as it is and not as he would have it otherwise he cannot by any possibility attain a correct result when he claims as now the practicability of running engines at a high speed i think he is claiming too much build an engine of proper materials make it strong and fit everything as it should be balance crank and fly wheel to a nicety keep everything snugly in its place and the terrors of a quick stroke vanish s w h test for white lead messrs editorsi have read with much interest dr chandlers colorimetric test of the purity of white lead as published in the scientific american sometime ago i enclose another test which though not new is of value to all using white lead on account of its simplicity and effectiveness it has been in use here for nearly two years and has been found reliable having never seen it in print i have tried to put it in as simple words as possible felix mcardle analytical chemist st louis mo take a piece of firm close grained charcoal and near one end of it scoop out a cavity about half an inch in diameter and a quarter of an inch in depth place in the cavity a sample of the lead to be tested about the size of a small pea and apply to it continuously the blue or hottest part of the flame of the blow pipe if the sample be strictly pure it will in a very short time say in two minutes be reduced to metallic lead leaving no residue but if it be adulterated to the extent of ten per cent only with oxide of zinc sulphate of baryta whiting or any other carbonate of lime which substances are now the only adulterations used or if it be composed entirely of these materials as is sometimes the case with cheap lead it cannot be reduced but will remain on the charcoal an infusible mass dry white lead carbonate of lead is composed of metallic lead oxygen and carbonic acid and when ground with linseed oil forms the white lead of commerce when it is subjected to the above treatment the oil is first burned off and then at a certain degree of heat the oxygen and carbonic acid are set free leaving only the metallic lead from which it was manufactured if however there be present in the sample any of the above mentioned adulterations they cannot of course be reduced to metallic lead and cannot be reduced by any heat of the blow pipe flame to their own metallic bases and being intimately incorporated and ground with the carbonate of lead they prevent it from being reduced it is well after blowing upon the sample say for half a minute by which time the oil will be burned off to loosen the sample from the charcoal with a knife blade or spatula in order that the flame may pass under as well as over and against it with proper care the lead will run into one button instead of scattering over the charcoal and this is the reason why the cavity above mentioned is necessary a common star candle or a lard oil lamp furnishes the best flame for use of the blow pipe a coal oil lamp should not be used by the above test after a little practice so small an adulteration as one or two per cent can be detected it is however only a test of the purity or impurity of a lead and if found adulterated the degree or percentage of adulteration cannot be well ascertained by it jewellers usually have all the necessary apparatus for making the test and any one of them can readily make it by observing the above directions and from them can be obtained a blow pipe at small cost if you have no open package of the lead to be tested a sample can most easily be obtained by boring into the side or top of a keg with a gimlet and with it taking out the required quantity care should be used to free it entirely from the borings or particles of wood and it should not be larger than the size mentioned a larger quantity can be reduced but of course more time will be required and the experiment cannot be so neatly performed how to build a chimney messrs editorsi am satisfied that a great many fires originate through poorly constructed chimneys and although not a bricklayer by trade i would offer a few hints how to construct a fireproof chimney let the bed be laid of brick and mortar iron or stone then the workman should take a brick in his left hand and with the trowel draw the mortar upon the end of the brick from the under side and not from the outside edge as is usual then by pressing the brick against the next one the whole space between the two bricks will be filled with mortar and so he should point up the inside as perfectly as the outside as he proceeds by drawing the mortar on the edge of the brick the space between the ends will not always be entirely filled and will make where the inside pointing is not attended to a leaky and unsafe chimney which if not kept clear of soot will in burning out stand a good chance of setting the building on fire the best thing that i know of to put the fire out in a burning chimney is salt but the matter of first importance after having a chimney properly constructed is to keep it clean austin b culver westfield n y crystallized honey messrs editorsplease allow me to say to the querist who through your columns asks what to do with crystalline honey that if he will doctor it with almost any artificial honey of the day it will not become like lard in cold weather which change is a natural proof that it is pure for almost any purpose pure honey is preferable to that which has been adulterated but purity is a minor consideration with many next we shall hear of some fastidious customer who objects to pure lard because it looks white when cold to such we would recommend lard oil as a great improvement especially for cooking purposes a m b louisville ky for the scientific american rambles for relics number ii at a depth of fifteen feet we were about to suspend our labors supposing from the nature and uniformly dark color of the earth that we had reached the surface of the alluvium when a sign of the inevitable wood and bark layer was seen in a crevice an excavation five or six feet into the wall revealed the skeleton of a man laid at length having an extra coverlid of wooden material eighteen large oblong beads an ax of polished green stone eleven arrow points and five implements of bone to be described were deposited on the left side and a few small beads an ornamental shell pin two small hatchets and a sharppointed flint knife or lance eight inches long having a neck or projection at the base suitable for a handle or for insertion in a shaft on the right side the earth behind the skull being removed three enormous conch shells presented their open mouths one of my assistants started back as if the ghost of the departed had come to claim the treasure preserved in accordance with superstitious notions for its journey to the happy lands the alarm seemed to be a warning for at the moment the embankment overloaded on one side caved in nearly burying three workmen myself and a spectator our tools being at the bottom of the heap and the wall on the other side shaken by the falling earth giving tokens of a change of base our prospects of a ready deliverance were not very hopeful the bystanders however went to work with their hands and we were soon relieved not without casualty the spectator having the worst of it struggling to extricate himself instead of abiding his time he dragged one leg out of the pile shorter

the mollusks exist bears upon the question of migration and tribal intercourse and the commercial value of these articles obtained from a distance and regarded as precious commodities they were used in exchange for the material of ornaments and for choice utensils only two or three of these shells have been found in a perfect condition but defective ones are frequent with fragments cuttings and various trinkets made out of themsuch as ornamental pins needles crosses buttons amulets engraved plates and beads from one of the specimens recovered from the mound sepulchre the spire and columella had been removed leaving a hollow utensil it would have been suitable for a water vessel but for a hole in the bottom which had furnished a buttonshaped ornament or piece of money which was found with the relic and exactly corresponded to the orifice the twirled end of the shell however had been improved for a handle by shallow cavities one on the inside slanting from the middle longitudinal line and one crossing that line at right angles on the convex side so as to be fitted to the thumb and fore finger of the left hand suggesting a use of the implement as a shield or a mask held before the

nearly corresponding in dimensions to the one on the west side making the length of the whole excavation including the central cavity thirtytwo feet in the last opening eight skeletons were exhumed the mode of burial was the same throughout the only article of value recovered was a curiously wrought pipe of stone having a figure head representing the human face which i have put down in a list of articles stolen and which the thief can describe better than the writer after filling up all the gaps and levelling the surface to suit the taste of the proprietor we closed our labors on the mound in

from an inch to six inches long with grooves round the head to serve the purpose of eyes and plates of mica the use of mica plates which are found of large size in some of the western mounds has excited some inquiry of a certain thickness they make good mirrors beside their use for ornamental purposes they were probably lookingglasses of the beauties of the stone age there was also found a pipe of soap stone having a stem five inches long and a bowl with a broad brim like a quakers hat of earthenware there was an endless variety of fragments of the usual black grey or red compressed clay mixed with pulverized shells or stones one kind i have never seen described the sherds had a red coating on both sides an eighth of an inch in thickness evidently not a paint or a glaze the red coloring might have come from the pottery being burnt in the open air instead of baked in a furnace were not the layer of uniform thickness and of homogeneous paste unlike the material of the vessel which was a gray mixture of clay and particles of shells i give the above memoranda to the general fund of information touching a subject that invites inquiry on account of its novelty and

50 revolutions per second which is by far the most rapid rate of motion ever imparted to a water wheel this is also beyond comparison the greatest fall applied to the propulsion of a wheel in america the wheel at meriden is of the most diminutive size scarcely exceeding in dimensions the oldfashioned turnip watches which our grandfathers used to carry in their capacious vest pockets the complete success of this wheel has attracted much attention and affords further evidence of the wide range of adaptability of the leffel turbine for the scientific american silk culture by w v andrews a vague notion that silk culture ought to form one of the industrial pursuits of the american people seems to be prevalent enough but it does not take practical hold upon anybody the nearest approach to anything practical which we have seen in late yearsexcepting of course what has been done in californiaoccurred in new york in july last when a number of gentlemen pledged themselves according to a report given in the tribune of july 30 to promote the native silk trade the gentlemen present at the meeting represented the most prominent silk manufacturing and importing houses in this country what these gentlemen have since done towards promoting the native silk trade i do not know but having pledged themselves it is presumed they have done something at the meeting of which the tribune article is a report dags and other things manufactured from california silk were exhibited and the report goes on to say that mr warren also exhibited samples of native and foreign cocoons and of raw and thrown silk together with the common cecropia and bombyx cynthia species of silkworms which feed upon oak leaves also the bombyx yamamai which feeds upon mulberry leaves also the bombyx pernyi of which the cocoons are early as good as the cocoons of worms fed upon mulberry leaves i have given this extract word for word as it stands in the columns of the tribune because it contains more blunders of one kind or another than i remember ever to have seen in so many words cecropia is certainly not very particular as to its food but it is not an oak feeder cynthia will thrive on nothing except ailanthus though it will eat one or two other things but not oak the yamamai on the other hand will eat oak indeed it is its natural food but mr warren errs greatly when he says that it will feed on mulberry the last clause of the sentence which says that cocoons of pernyi are nearly as good as those of worms fed on mulberry leaves must be a sort of entomological joke of which the point is not discoverable by me so i pass it over i do not however notice this report on account of its grammatical and entomological mistakes it is because of the evil effects it may and probably will have on amateur silk culturists that i notice it for most assuredly failure will be the result of all attempts to produce silk cocoons by feeding the caterpillars of the different moths on the food prescribed by mr warren any patriotic money making farmer who believes in the tribune purchasing yamamai eggs and setting his worms to feed upon mulberry which they refuse to eat and consequently all die will probably give up silk culture as being nothing more or less than a humbug and thus the cause is injured for several years past i have made some experiments in the rearing of the silkworms giving the result of my experience in the first year in vol ii page 311 of the american naturalist and of a subsequent year in the entomologist for november 1869 the paper in the naturalist is devoted to my experiments with the ailanthus silkworm samia cynthia g r a naturalized species from the east in that paper i have said all that is necessary to say at present on that species except perhaps that i am further convinced from the inspection of samples of sewing and other silks made from the cocoons of cynthia that one day it will be reared very extensively in the united states it is perfectly hardy is double brooded and may be reared by any one possessed of a few acres of land which may be good enough for growing ailanthus trees but not good enough to grow any thing else the labor of a few old men or women or even children is sufficient for the purpose the cost is therefore trifling the objection to the cultivation of cynthia is that the cocoon cannot be reeled but it can be carded and if the chinese can make excellent silk goods from it why cannot we i suspect too that cynthia silk can be worked in with cotton or perhaps woolen goods adding to their beauty and durability for it is indestructible in wear and thus open up branches of manufacture hitherto unknown for manufacturers of coarse goods i have no doubt that the silk from our native silk moths cecropia and polyphemus may be used indeed i believe that m trouvelot is of opinion that polyphemus may fairly enter into competition with bombyx mori the ordinary mulberry silkworm the worm however is rather difficult to rear in reference however to bombyx mori it is well known that the silk crop in france and italy has been reduced greatly and the price of silk goods consequently enhanced by prevalence of disease among the worms so much is this the case that silk breeders have been obliged to look around for some silkproducing moths whose products may at any rate supplement the deficient crop cynthia as already mentioned as one of these and two others mentioned by warren in the tribune reports above adverted to are at present the subjects of experiment my article mentioned before as appearing in the american entomologist is mainly devoted to my experiments and those of my correspondents with yamamai which as i said before is an oak feeder in japan which is its native country it feeds in its wild state on quercus serrata whether that oak be found in america i do not know but it is of little importance as the worm will feed on almost any species of oak although i think that it prefers white oak the importance of acclimatizing new species of silk moths is of so much prospective importance that i shall devote the remainder of this article to the consideration of whether yamamai and pernyi may not be naturalized here any one who happens to have the number of the entomologist containing the article above alluded to may find it worth while to read it but as many persons may not be able to obtain that number i will here repeat the substance of my remarks adding as much new matter as subsequent experience has afforded the silk from the yamamai being considered superior to that produced by any other of the substitute silk moths great efforts have been made in europe to acclimatize it but it must be confessed hitherto with but slight success there are exceptions however particularly among amateurs in germany sufficient to show that success is possible the baron de bretton raises about 27000 cocoons annually in this country but little has been done or attempted and that little has not been very successful the fact is that yamamai is a difficult moth to rear in a country like this where in early spring the temperature varies so much but that success is possible i am convinced the moth emerges from the cocoon in the latter part of the summer copulates lays its eggs and of course dies and now the trouble commences that is with eggs laid say in japan from whence we mainly get our supplies as soon as the egg is laid the young larva commences its formation which in a short time about one month is perfected it lies in the egg in a quiescent state till early spring if the egg remain in the country where it is laid and is kept at a pretty even temperature and free from damp the caterpillar emerges in a healthy condition but if it be removed some thousands of miles passing in the transit from heat to cold and back to heat again and if in addition it be closely confined in a damp place with little or no circulation of air the egg is attacked by a fungus which sometimes prevents the worm from emerging at all or if it emerge it is in a sickly condition that these conditions obtain in the transit of eggs from japan to europe and thence to america is evident enough and it may therefore require the efforts of many persons continued for a long time to enable us to acclimatize the yamamai but this is all that is required and i feel confident that ultimate success is certain on hatching out the worm is of a brimstone yellow and thinly covered with strong hairs after the second month it is greenish with black longitudinal streaks and the thread a dull coral red color after the third month it becomes of a fine apple green with yellow tubercles on each segment from which issue a few black hairs the head and legs are chocolate brown the prolegs reddish and the first segment edged with pinkish color the greatest care is necessary as the spring advances to prevent the eggs from hatching before the oak buds are ready for them and the temperature must be regulated with the greatest nicety if the eggs can be kept somewhere about 50 deg fah it would be quite safe higher than that the mercury should not be allowed to rise till you are quite ready for the worms and on the other hand the eggs should not be allowed to freeze on emerging from the eggs the worms should be allowed either to crawl to the oak branches or rather to sprigs obtained for that purpose the end of which should be placed in a jar or bottle of water or the worms may be placed on gently with a camelhair brush the leaves should be well sprinkled with clean water that the caterpillars may drink from some cause not well understood the young caterpillars have a tendency to wander and if care be not taken many may be lost to prevent this it is well to cover the branches with a gauze bag tied tightly around the stems and close to the bottle care must also be taken that the caterpillars do not find their way into the water which they assuredly will if they have the opportunity committing suicide in the most reckless manner if the number of caterpillars be few it is a good plan to place them at the outset with their food in a widemouthed bottle covering the mouth with gauze the branches particularly if the weather be warm must still be occasionally sprinkled so that the caterpillars may have the opportunity of drinking it must be remembered that experiment is necessary in rearing yamamai but one thing is ascertained and that is that the worms must not be exposed to direct sunshine at least not after seven or eight in the morning if the spring be warm i am inclined to think that a northeastern exposure is the best and we may sum up by saying that comparatively cool and moist seasons are more favorable to success that hot dry weather in america the worms suffer in the early spring from the rapid changes of temperature 40 at 9 am increasing to 70 in the afternoon and falling off to freezing point during the night the worms cannot stand this they become torpid refuse to eat and consequently die to prevent this if the nights be cold they must be placed where no such change of temperature can occur it is scarcely necessary to say that an ample supply of fresh food must be always supplied but it may not be amiss to say that it is well when supplying fresh branches to remove the worms from the old to the new the best way of doing this is to clip off the branch or leaf on which the worm is resting and tie pin or in some way affix the same to the new branches if this be not done they will continue to eat the old leaf even if it be withered and this induces disease if the worm has fastened itself for the purpose of moulting the best way is to remove the entire branch clipping off all the dried leaves before so removing it these remarks apply in general to the treatment of all silkworms except bombyx mori the results of numerous experiments with yamamai go to show that it is as i said before a difficult worm to rear but it has been reared near new york to the extent of eight hundred cocoons out of sixteen hundred eggs and this although not a remunerative result is encouraging the chinese silk moth aulterea pernyi also an oak feeder has been successfully raised by me and by others for several years eggs have been sold to persons in states widely separated and the results show that this worm is perfectly hardy the moth winters in the cocoon emerges early in may if the weather be warm pairs readily and lays from 150 to 200 eggs these hatch out in about fourteen days and like yamamai always about 5 or 6 oclock in the morning it is necessary to be on the alert to catch them on hatching only and to remember that they are vagabonds even to a greater extent than yamamai consequently similar precautions must be taken the worm on emerging from the egg is large and of a chocolatebrown color after the first month it becomes of a yellowish green head pale brown feet and prolegs of nearly the same color the body has numerous reddish tubercles from which issue a few reddish hairs at the base of some of the tubercles on the anterior segments are silvery patches the pernyi worm is much more easily reared than that of yamamai but still great care is needed fresh food of course is essential and a slight sprinkling of the branches and worms in very warm weather is advisable although it is not so necessary as with yamamai it is remarkable that pernyi worms fed in the open air on oak trees do not at present thrive so well as those fed indoors but this doubtless is a question of acclimation i advise white oak quercus alba as food if it can be readily obtained but failing that pin oak quercus palustris will do and i have no doubt that they will feed on any kind of oak they will indeed feed on birch and on sweet gum liquidambar but oak is the proper food it is worthy of remark that pernyi bears a strong resemblance to our polyphemus but it is more easily reared in confinement and double brooded an important fact for the silk culturist from american reared eggs i obtained cocoons as early as july 4th the perfect insect emerging on july 31 copulation immediately ensued and the resulting eggs hatched only on august 12 ten days only from the time of laying and as the worm feeds up in about four or five weeks this affords plenty of time for rearing the second brood it must be remembered that on the quantity and quality of food much depends not only with pernyi but with all caterpillars by furnishing food sparingly the time of feeding would be much prolonged i have already said that both yamamai and pernyi should be fed under shelter for the reasons given but there is another reason of less importance the young worms are liable to be attacked by spiders and wasps and even after the second month they are not safe from these enemies i have seen a wasp bite a large caterpillar in two carry off the anterior section and return for the posterior which had held on by its prolegs did the wasp anticipate this fact and therefore carry off the anterior part first as to the spiders they form a series of pulleys and hoist the caterpillar off its legs sucking its juices at leisure and now i must devote a few words to the advisability of silk culture from a pecuniary point of view bombyx mori or the ordinary mulberry silkworm is of course the best to rear if you can obtain healthy eggs but this is the difficulty and thence arises the necessity of cultivating other silkproducing species i imagine that silk can be produced in most of the states of the union and manufactured from the cocoon at a large profit but for the present we will leave the manufacture out of the question and consider only whether it will not pay to rear eggs and cocoons for sale it must be remembered that european manufacturers are at this moment largely dependent on foreign countries for the supply of both eggs and cocoons and this because of the general prevalence of disease among all the races of bombyx mori and now to what extent does the reader suppose this dependence exists of cocoons i have no returns at hand but of raw silk european manufacturers purchase annually not less than 160000000 worth and of eggs bombyx mori to the value of 10000000 this then is a business of no trifling amount california seems to be alive to the fact and i am informed raised this last season 3000000 cocoons and for sale about 4000 ounces of eggs worth at least 4 per ounce wholesale now there is no earthly reason why california should monopolize this business why are not companies formed in other states for this purpose or if private individuals lack the enterprise or the means why do not the legislatures of those states most favorably located do something by way of starting the business a few thousand dollars loaned or even donated may prove to be a valuable investment for the people at large and even supposing a failure would not be a very great loss to any body so far as farmers are concerned it may interest them to know that one man in england capt mason clears 50 per acre by rearing silkworms bombyx mori in this case and i much doubt whether any crop raised here pays as well by way of commencement then let everybody that has sufficient leisure set to work and rear as many silkworms of the abovenamed species as he possibly can and if the process be not remunerative in a pecuniary sense it most assuredly will be in the amount of pleasure and knowledge obtained one caution i must give to those who cultivate bombyx mori although yamamai requires sprinkled branches bombyx mori does not nor must the leaves be furnished to them while wet with rain or dew effect of cold upon ironthe article upon this subject

adjunct to a full outfit of woodworking machines the one shown in our engraving is one of the most complete ever brought to our notice and the great variety of work it is capable of performing renders the name chosen for it peculiarly applicable it is called the universal boring machine because the most prominent feature of its construction is its power to bore a hole in any desired angle with the axis of the bit any sized bit required is inserted into the chuck which is adjustable to fit large and small shanks the mandrel which carries the chuck is made to traverse by a foot lever so as to bore any depth up to twelve inches the mandrel is driven by belt from a cone pulley of three faces which gives the proper speeds for different sized bits slots and stops upon the table enable the work to be set at any desired angle on the horizontal plane while the table can be set on an incline to any angle not exceeding fortyfive degrees the table is twentyone inches wide with fifteen inches

state again the fact always unheeded that all the detestable compounds are injurious they are nearly all metallic poisons and if there be any that are innocent of this charge they are in every instance harmful to the health the color and surface of the skin cannot be changed by any application which does not close the pores the pores which are so exquisitely fine that there are millions of them to the square inch and which must be kept open if a healthy and cleanly body is to be preserved there is more breathing done through the pores of a healthy person than through the lungs and we need not remind our readers of a ghastly piece of cruelty once enacted in paris that of gilding the body of a child for a triumphal procession which killed the subject in two hours to show that the stoppage in any degree of the natural functions of so important an organ as the skin is injurious the immediate effect of the use of such compounds is to destroy the vitality of the skin and to render

the scientific american addressed the graduating class and from his remarks we quote the following many writers of our time persist in regarding this above all others as the best period in the history of our race and doubtless it is true in many important respects but i cannot forbear the suggestion at this moment that there was a time in the history of the world when the science of medicine was unknown when people lived to the incredible age of many centuries and even after the span of life had been reduced to threescore and ten sickness was comparatively unknown in ancient times it was looked upon as a calamity that had overtaken a tribe or people when one of its members prematurely sickened and died other arts and sciences flourished in rome long before medicine was thought of and the historian tells us that the first doctor who settled in rome some two hundred years before christ was banished on account of his poor success and the very severe treatment applied to his patients and it was a hundred years before the next one came he rose to great popularity simply because he allowed his patients to drink all the wine they wanted and to eat their favorite dishes some writer on hygiene has made the statement that the whole code of medical ethics presented by moses consisted simply in bathing purification and diet this simplicity of life was not confined to the wandering tribes who settled in the land of canaan but was the universal custom of all nations of which history gives us any account this simple arrangement for health was considered enough in those primitive times when the human system had not been worn out and exhausted by depletive medicines the luxuries of public baths athletic sports and games were deemed ample both to educate the physical perceptions and to prevent disease all this wisdom which had its origin in ancient games and sports of the field led to the erection of extensive bathhouses and the adoption of other healthful luxuries to which all the people could resort to recreate their wasted powers barnes ventilator for mattresses etc many diseases are caused by the use of beds not properly aired and it is difficult if not impossible to properly air or ventilate a mattress made in the usual manner if this could be done more thoroughly than it generally is much sickness would be avoided illustration to secure this object cheaply and efficiently is the design of the invention herewith illustrated by it a complete circulation of air through the mattress is secured which carries off all dampness arising from constant use thus the mattress becomes more healthy for sleeping purposes more durable and better fitted for the sick room the ventilators consist of coiled wire covered with coarse cloth to prevent the stuffing closing up the tube running through the mattress in all directions the ends of the coils are secured to the ticking by means of metal thimbles inside of which are pieces of wire gauze to prevent insects getting in but which admit air freely the cost of the ventilators is small and they will last as long as any mattress they can be applied to any bed at small expense this invention was patented through the

hoosick falls n y the third annual exhibition of the national photographic association takes place at horticultural hall philadelphia june 6 1871 prof morton is to deliver two lectures on light a scientific and technical awakening our english cotemporary engineering appears to have seriously exercised itself in the perusal of our goodnatured article on english and american scientific and mechanical engineering journalism which appeared in the scientific american february 4th at least we so judge from the tenor of an article in response thereto covering a full page of that journal the article in question is a curiosity in literature it deserves a much wider circulation than engineering can give it and we would gladly transfer it to our columns but for its exceeding lengtha serious fault generally not only with engineerings articles but most other technical journals published in england it would scarcely do for them to be brief in their discussions and above all other things spice and piquancy must always be excluded engineering evidently labors under the conviction that the heavier it can make its discussions the more profoundly will it be able to impress its readers hence we are equally astonished and gratified to find a gleam of humor flashing out from the ordinary sobersided composition of our learned contemporary the article came to us just as we were laboring under an attack of dyspepsia and its reading fairly shook our atrabilious corpus we said to ourselves can it be possible that engineering is about to experience the new birth to undergo regeneration and a baptism of fire the article is really worth reading and we begin to indulge the hope that at least one english technical is going to try to make itself not only useful but readable and interesting and what is most perplexingly novel in this new manifestation is the display of a considerable amount of egotism which we had always supposed to be a sinful and naughty thing in technical journalism and as if to magnify this selfcomplaisance it actually alludes to its own extensive and everincreasing circulation in america now to show how small a thing can impart comfort to the soul of our cotemporary we venture to say that the circulation of engineering in this country cannot much exceed three hundred copies per week it evidently amazes our english cotemporary that a journal like the scientific american which according to its own notions is chiefly the work of scissors and paste should circulate so widely and it even belittles our weekly circulation by several thousand copies in order to give point to its very amusing and we will also add generally just criticism the writer in engineering whoever he may be appears to be a sort of literary rip van winkle just waking out of a long sleep and he cannot get the idea through his head that it is possible that a technical journal can become a vehicle of popular information to the mass of mankind instead of being the organ of a small clique of professional engineers or wealthy manufacturers such as seems to hold control of the columns of engineering and who use it either to ventilate their own pet schemes and theories or to advertise by illustration and otherwise in the reading columns a repetition of lathes axleboxes brakes cars and other trade specialities which can lay little or no claim to novelty it is furthermore a crying sin in the estimation of our english critic that american technical journals do not separate their advertisements from the subject matter and he thinks that when yankee editors learn that trade announcements are out of place in the body of a journal they will see how to make their journals pay by making them higher priced now we venture to say without intending to give offence that yankee editors understand their business quite as well as do english editors and it is presumable at least that they know what suits their readers on this side much better than do english editors we venture to suggestmodestly of coursethat journalism in the two countries is not the same and should the editor of engineering undertake to transfer his system of intellectual labor to this side of the atlantic he would not be long in making the discovery that those wandering bohemian engineers who he tells us are in sorrow and heaviness over the shortcomings of american technical journals would turn out after all to be slender props for him to lean upon we think it probable however that with a little more snap a journal like engineering might possibly attain a circulation in this country of 500 or 1000 copies weekly why american engineers have scarcely yet been able to organize themselves into an association for mutual advancement in their profession much less to give the reading public the benefit of their experience and labors this fact alone ought of itself to satisfy engineering that no such journal could profitably exist in this country whenever our american engineers are ready to support such a journal there will be no difficulty in finding a publisher engineering in its casual reference to the various technical journals of america omits to name our leading scientific monthly but introduces with just commendation a venerable cotemporary now upwards of three score years of age now it is no disparagement of this really modest monthly to say that perhaps there are not sixty hundred people in the states who know it even by name and so far as the use of scissors and paste are made available in our technical journals we venture the assertion that the editorial staff expenses of the scientific american are as great if not greater than those of engineering the question however is not so much one of original outlay but which of the two journals gives most for the money in this very essential particular and with no intention to depreciate the value of engineering we assert with becoming modesty that the scientific american occupies a position which engineering will never be able to attain the sherman process when people boast of extraordinary successes in processes the details of which are kept profoundly hidden from public scrutiny and when the evidences of success are presented in the doubtful form of specimens which the public has no means of tracing directly to the process the public is apt to be skeptical and to express skepticism often in not very complimentary terms for a considerable time the public has been treated to highlycolored accounts of a wonderful metallurgic process whereby the best iron and steel were said to be made from the very worst materials almost in the twinkling of an eye this process has been called after its assumed inventor or discoverer the sherman process the details of the process are still withheld but we last week gave an extract from an english contemporary which throws a little light upon the subject the agent relied upon to effect the remarkable transformation claimed is iodine used preferably in the form of iodide of potassium and very little of it is said to produce a most marvellous change in the character of the metal a very feeble attempt at explaining the rationale of this effect has been made in one or two english journals which we opine will not prove very satisfactory to chemists and scientific metallurgists the engineer has published two threecolumn articles upon the subject the first containing very little information and the second a great number of unnecessary paragraphs but which gives the proportion of the iodide used in the extremely scientific and accurate formula expressed in the terms a small quantity assertions of remarkable success have also been given nothing however was said of remarkable failures of which there have doubtless been some a series of continued successes would we should think by this time have sufficed for the parturition of this metallurgic process and the discovery would ere this have been introduced to the world had there not been some drawbacks we are not prepared to deny in toto that the process is all that is claimed for it but the way in which it has been managed is certainly one not likely to encourage faith in it the very name of process implies a system perfected and if it be still so far back in the experimental stage that nothing definite in the way of results can be relied upon it is not yet a process if in the use of iodine in some instances fine grades of iron or steel are produced and in as many other experiments with the same material failures result it is just as fair to attribute the failures to the iodine as the successes a process worthy the name is one that acts with approximate uniformity and when in its use results vary widely from what is usual the variation may be traced to important differences in the conditions of its application on the whole we are inclined to believe mr shermans experiments have not yet developed a definite process and we shall receive with much allowance the glowing statements published in regard to it until such time as it can face the world and defy unbelief the patents obtained by mr sherman seem to cover the use of iodine rather than the manner of using it and throw no light upon the rationale of the process a patent was granted by the united states patent office sept 13 1870 to j c atwood in which the inventor claims the use of iodide of potassium in connection with the carbons and fluxes used in making and refining iron in his specification he states that he uses about fifteen grains of this salt to eighty pounds of the metal this is about 1373 of one per cent he uses in connection with this exceedingly small proportion of iodide of potassium about two ounces of lampblack or charcoal and four ounces of manganese and asserts that steel made with these materials will be superior in quality to that made by the old method these claims we are inclined to discredit certainly we see no chemical reason why this small amount of iodide should produce such an effect and the specification itself throws no light upon our darkness if the experiments in these socalled processes have no better basis than is apparent from such information as at present can be gathered respecting them it is probable we shall wait some time before the promised revolution in iron and steel manufacture is accomplished through their use rubber tires for traction engines when it was first discovered that a smoothfaced driving wheel running on a smoothfaced rail would bite the era of iron railways and locomotive engines may be said to have fairly commenced the correction of a single radical error was in this case the dawn of a new system of travel so extensive in its growth and marvelous in its results that even the wildest dreamer could not at that time have imagined the consequences of so simple a discovery a popular and somewhat similar error regarding the bite of wheels on rough and uneven surfaces has also prevailed we say popular error because engineers have not shared it and it has obtained to any notable extent only among those unfamiliar with mechanical science the error in question is that hardsurfaced wheels will not bite on a moderately rough surface sufficiently to give an efficient tractile power it seems strange that this error should have diffused itself very extensively when it is remembered that a certain degree of roughness is essential to frictional resistance the smoothness of the ordinary railway track is roughness compared to that of an oiled or unctuous metallic surface and it has been amply demonstrated that the resistance of friction of two bearing surfaces depends not upon their extent but upon the pressure with which they are forced together a traction wheel of given weight resting upon two square inches of hard earth or rock would develop the same tractile power as though it had a bearing surface of two square feet of similar material on very rough and stony ways however another element practically of no importance on moderately rough ways like a macadam surface or a concrete road where the prominences are nearly of uniform hight and so near together as to admit between their summits only very small arcs of the circumference of the wheel comes into action this element is the constantly recurring lifting of the superincumbent weight of the machine even this would not result in loss of power could the power developed in falling be wholly applied to useful work in the direction of the advance of the engine the fact is however that it is not so applied and in any method of propulsion at present known to engineering science cannot be so applied above a certain point where friction enough is developed to prevent slip the more uneven the road surface is the greater the power demanded for the propulsion of the locomotive and this will hold good for both hard and softtired wheels what then is the advantage if any of rubbertired wheels the advantages claimed may be enumerated as follows increased tractile power with a given weight secured without damage to roadways ease of carriage to the supported machinery whereby itthe machineryis saved from stress and wear and economy of the power expended in moving the extra weight required by rigidtired wheels to secure the required frictional resistance the lastmentioned claim depends upon the first and must stand or fall with it the saving of roadway ease of carriage and its favorable result upon the machinery are generally conceded a denial of the first claim has been made by those interested in the manufacture of rigidtired traction engines and others in so far as the rubber tires are employed on comparatively smooth surfaces although the increased tractile power on quite rough pavements and roads is acknowledged this denial is based upon results of experiments performed on the streets of rochester england between the 9th october and the 2nd november 1870 by a committee of the royal engineers british army with a view to determine accurately the point in question care was taken to make the circumstances under which the trials took place exactly alike for both the rubber and the iron tires the experiments were performed with an aveling and porter sixhorse power road engine built in the royal engineers establishment the weight of the engine without rubber tires was 11225 pounds with rubber tires it weighed 12025 pounds without rubber tires it drew 2813 times its own weight up a gradient of 1 in 11 with rubber tires it drew up the same incline 2763 times the weight of engine with the weight of rubber tires added showing that although it drew a little over 2200 pounds more than it could do without the rubber tires the increase of traction was only that which might be expected from the additional weight it is claimed moreover that the additional traction power and superior ease of carriage on rough roads secured with rubber tires is dearly bought at the very great increase in cost of an engine fitted with them over one not so fitted this is a point we regard as not fully settled though it will not long remain in doubt there are enough of both types of wheels now in use to soon answer practically any question there may be of durability upon which the point of economy hinges so far as the interest on the increased cost due to rubber tires is offset against the greater wear and tear of iron rimmed wheels it is stated on good authority that a rubber tired engine started at work in aberdeen scotland wore out its tires between april and september inclusive and when it is taken into consideration that the cost of these tires is about half that of other engines made with solid iron rimmed driving wheels it will be seen that unless very much greater durability than this can be shown for the rubber the advantages of such tires are very nearly if not more than balanced by their disadvantages the fact that one set of tires wore out so soon does not prove a rule there may have been causes at work which do not affect such tires generally and it would be we think quite premature to form favorable or unfavorable judgment of relative economy from such data as have been yet furnished the difference in the current expenses of running the two most prominent types of engines with hard and soft tires now in use does not affect the question of rubber tires unless it can be shown that these tires necessitate per se such a form of engine as requires a greater consumption of fuel and greater cost of attendance to perform a given amount of work central shaft of the hoosac tunnel as many of our readers have evinced much interest and ingenuity on the question of the propriety of placing reliance upon the accuracy of dropping a perpendicular from the top to the bottom of a shaft 1030 feet in depth by means of an ordinary plummet we take the earliest opportunity of settling the matter beyond dispute by reporting the results lately obtained through a series of experiments by the engineers in charge for the ultimate purpose of laying down the correct line for the tunnel the perpendicular line has of course been dropped many times and the main result taken the plummet used is made of steel properly balanced and polished in shape something like a pineapple and of about the same size weighing fifteen pounds it was suspended with the large end downwards by a thin copper wire one fortieth of an inch in diameter immersed in water and after careful steadying with the hand occupied about an hour in assuming its final position or motion which contrary to the expectation and theories of many resulted in a circular motion around a fixed point the diameter of the circle being a mean of one quarter of an inch the suspending wire in these operations was not quite the entire length of the shaft being only 900 feet and before the plummet had settled the wire had stretched nearly twenty feet the suspension of the plummet in water was not considered necessary for any other reason than that water was continually trickling down the wire and dropping on the plummet the experiments so far have not been of the perfect character it is determined to attain when the final alignment is made as until the headings east and west of the shaft have advanced to a considerable distance any slight error would be of no account a neat and ingenious instrument has been constructed for determining the variation of the plummet and will be used when great accuracy is desired the plummet will also be suspended in oil the bearing of the tunnel is about s 81 e but independently of its near approach to the line of revolution described by the earth it is not considered necessary to take into account any motion it may derive from this cause in fact the opinion is that the motion of the earth will not practically have any effect on the whole after the still imperfect experiments which have been made enough is established to show there is no difficulty to be encountered other than the accurate and delicate manipulation of the plummet and its attachments the shaft headings are progressing favorably the rock is not so hard or varied as that met with at the west end markings already nearly 300 feet have been taken out and with the proved energy of the contractors this great task will doubtless be prosecuted steadily and surely to completion within the contract time expiring march 1 1874 a museum of art and natural history our recent articles on scientific destitution in new york and the scientific value of the central park have called forth numerous letters from correspondents and have been extensively noticed by the press we now learn that the legislature of the state has taken the matter in hand and there is some prospect with an honest administration of the appropriations of something being done to relieve our city of the opprobrium that rests upon it a bill is pending before the senate authorizing the park commissioners to build equip and furnish on manhattan square or any other public square or park suitable fireproof buildings at a cost not exceeding 500000 for each corporation for the purpose of establishing a museum of art by the metropolitan museum of art and of a museum of natural history by the american museum of natural history two societies recently incorporated by the legislature this is a million dollars to begin with and an ample site without cost to the aforementioned corporations manhattan square extends from seventyseventh to eightyfirst streets and from eighth to ninth avenues and spans about eighteen acres until it was set apart by the state board of commissioners for the purposes of a zoological garden it was proposed by a number of enlightened citizens of new york to devote it to the uses of four of our existing corporations giving to each one a corner and an equal share in the allotment of space the societies were the academy of design for art the historical society for public records and libraries the lyceum of natural history for science and the american institute for technology these have been incorporated for many years and are known to include the leading artists men of letters science and the arts of the city on their lists of members the committee went so far as to have plans of the building drawn by competent architects but like many other wellmeant schemes want of money compelled the originators of the plan to abandon any further attempts in the meantime the legislature chartered the american botanical and zoological society and gave the commissioners of the park authority to set apart a portion of it not exceeding sixty acres for the use of the society for the establishment of a zoological and botanical garden this society was duly organized under the act and mr hamilton fish was made its president and considerable sums of money were subscribed but according to the sixth annual report of the board of commissioners the society never manifested its desire for an allotment of ground it appears to have died and made no sign some of our citizens fearing that the central park would go the way of every other public work in the city made strenuous effort to revive the zoological society for the purpose of obtaining a perpetual lease of a suitable site on which to establish a zoological garden similar to those in london paris amsterdam and cologne their object was to remove this part of the park beyond the reach of political intrigue subsequent events have shown that the fears of these gentlemen were well founded the legislature of the state on the 25th of march 1862 gave ample powers to the new york historical society to establish a museum of antiquity and science and a gallery of art in the central park they have submitted designs for a building but for some reason no decisive steps have been taken towards its construction the lyceum of natural history was also negotiating with the commissioners for the use of the upper rooms of the arsenal for its collections and there is no doubt that an arrangement to this effect would have been made if a fire had not destroyed the entire collections of the lyceum the lyceum made great effort to raise money to purchase a new collection but without avail and although this is the oldest scientific society in new york and has inrolled in its list of members nearly every professional scientist of the city it is probably the poorest in income and resources of any academy of sciences in the world we do not know that the academy of design has ever applied for a home in the central park and we cannot speak for the american institute nor for the geographical society in this particular as we stated in our former article the old board of commissioners appears to have become weary of the unsuccessful attempts on the part of numerous societies to divide up and apportion the central park and they applied to the legislature for authority to conduct matters in their own way an act was duly passed authorizing the board to erect establish conduct and maintain on the central park a meteorological and astronomical observatory a museum of natural history and a gallery of art and the buildings therefor and to provide the necessary instruments furniture and equipments for the same here would seem to be ample power for the establishment of museums of science and art but nothing is said about the manner of raising the money one would suppose however that by means of the central park improvement fund abundant means could have been raised the bill now before the legislature puts matters in a new light if it does not conflict with previous enactments nor destroy vested rights it has the appearance of being a thoroughly practical way of solving the question of art and science for the city the metropolitan museum of art and the american museum of natural history are in the hands of the most respectable citizens of new york it would not be possible to find a body of men of more unimpeachable integrity and greater worth than the gentlemen who have founded these two societies it is impossible that they should lend their names to anything that will not bear the closest scrutiny hence the proposition now before the legislature to put up buildings for them at a cost of a million dollars must attract unusual attention if the state would appropriate the money to these corporations giving them the control of its expenditure we should have considerably more confidence in its honest administration than we are grieved to say we can feel under the present circumstances and if we knew what other institutions are to have the remaining portions of manhattan square it would be a great relief to our minds we fear the greeks bringing gifts but are willing to accept the gifts if the officers of the two organizations are certain that it is all right the need of a museum of natural history and of a gallery of art in new york is so pressing that there is some danger of our accepting the appropriations without a proper regard to consequences the court house is not yet finished and the foundations of the postoffice are scarcely laid report of the judges of group 1 department v of the exhibition of the american institute for 1870 the allen engine the labors of the judges in this department were much lighter in the last exhibition than in the preceding one and we are happy to say were in our opinion so far as the award of premiums is concerned much more fairly performed the award of two first premiums to two competing engines could scarcely be repeated this time as there was in reality no competition the allen engine was the only important one entered and of course received the first premium the engine is however one that evidently could have competed favorably with those previously exhibited we are in receipt of advanced sheets of the judges report pertaining to the critical examination of this engine being a record and account of experiments performed under the supervision of washington lee c e the experiments were very comprehensive and comprised approved tests of each important detail usually made by expert engineers the report is too voluminous for reprint or even for condensation in our columns in looking it through we are satisfied that the experiments were accurately made and that the engine exhibited great working efficiency and economy as the engine has been recently illustrated and described in our columns we deem it unnecessary to dwell upon the details of its construction the water test of the previous exhibition was employed the water being this time measured with indisputable accuracy in a tank instead of by a meter as before the voluminous comparison of this engine with those previously exhibited seems unnecessary and we think not in good taste in such a report however much it may possess of scientific interest moreover the circumstances under which the trials were respectively performed render the comparison difficult if not unfair mr lee concludes his report with a thorough endorsement of the theory of mr porter upon the action of the reciprocating parts of engines as set forth by the last named gentleman in recent articles in this journal he says under the resistance of 128375 horse powers at the brake the motion of the engine was remarkably uniform not the least diminution of speed in passing the centers could be detected illustrating very satisfactorily the value in this respect of the speed employed and of the action of the reciprocating parts of the engine in equalizing the rotative pressure on the crank through the stroke the governor was during the trials and through the exhibition nearly motionless while the load remained constant and instantaneous in its action on changes of resistance maintaining a steadiness of running which left nothing to be desired the judgesprof f a p barnard thos j sloan and robert weirspeak in their report as follows the performance of this engine has exceeded that of the two fine engines which were on trial here last year the results seem to be without precedent in such engines the engine ran from 11 to 12 hours repeatedly without showing a sign of a warm bearing displaying thorough perfection in all its parts in all respects the engine is firstclass and from the fact of its presenting weight with speed as a requisite for perfection in steam engines it has opened a new era in this necessary branchits economy having been clearly demonstrated in the careful trials which ought to be published in full lyceum of natural history there was an unusually large attendance of members at the meeting of the lyceum of natural history on monday evening the 6th inst to listen to an address by professor b waterhouse hawkins on the progress of the work of the restoration of the forms of extinct animals in the central park mr hawkins gave an account of the difficulties he encountered at the outset in finding any skeletons of animals in new york with which to make comparisons and he was finally compelled to go to boston and philadelphia for this purpose after much study and many delays the casts of the hadrosaurus were completed and numerous smaller skeletons prepared at this stage of the proceedings an entire change in the administration of the park took place and the newly appointed commissioners decided to suspend the work upon the palozoic museum and they dismissed mr hawkins from their service the announcement that an end had thus been summarily put to one of the most important educational projects ever started in this country was received by the lyceum with profound surprise for a few minutes after the close of mr hawkins report no one felt disposed to make any comment but as the truth of the great damage became apparent there was considerable disposition manifested to have the society give expression to its sense of the value of mr hawkins services in the cause of education and their regret that so important a work should be suspended at this critical period remarks were made by dr newbery professor joy mr andrew h green professor seely dr walz mr e g squier and others and the following resolutions were unanimously adopted resolved that the lyceum of natural history in the city of new york has learned with deep regret of the temporary suspension of the work of restoration of the forms of extinct animals as hitherto prosecuted in the central park under the able superintendence of professor waterhouse hawkins resolved that the society considers the proposed palozoic museum not only a valuable acquisition to the scientific treasures and resources of the city but also as a most important adjunct and complement to our great system of public education warming and ventilation of railroad cars there has been enough of denunciation against the present general method of warming and ventilating railway cars it produces no effect on the corporations who could if they would adopt appliances that would not burn people to death in cases of accident nor regularly and persistently poison them with bad air there is no lack of ways and means the problem is simple and easily solved naya not very extensive search through the patent office records will show that it has been solved already perhaps not in the most practical and perfect manner but still solved so well as were it not for corporation cupidity would greatly add to the comfort and safety of passengers the real problem is how to compel corporations to recognize the fact that the public has rights they are bound to respect it is the disregard of these rights that fills our cars with smoke dust and exhalations and puts box stoves full of hot coals in the corners ready to cook the human stew whenever a frisky car shall take a notion to turn a somersault the invention needed is a conscience for corporationsan invention by the way scarcely less difficult than the one advertised for in our last issue namely a plan for preventing the sale of intoxicating liquors and tobacco in new jersey the railroad gazette imitating the english ideal of prolixity in discussion for which engineering has recently patted it on the back approvingly treats us in its issue of february 11th to a page article to be continued under the title of warming and ventilation of railroad cars in this article the writer takes the ground that people in general are ignorant of the effects of pure air and not being able to see the foulness they therefore do not believe it exists it is quite possible they may not be able to see the foulness but if in the majority of railroad cars run in this country they are not able to feel it in gritty grimy accumulations on skin and linen and smell it in suffocating stenches which serve with sneezeprovoking dust to stifle anything like comfort their skin must be thicker their linen more neglected and their noses less sensitive than those of the majority of fellow travellers it has been our fortune to be cooped up with for a days railroad journey the railroad gazette makes this wholesale charge of ignorance and insensibility the excuse for an essay on the physiology of respiration mostly extracted from huxleys elementary lessons in physiology and therefore excellent in its way though having a somewhat remote bearing upon the subject as announced in the title of the article we trust that before this journal concludes its series of articles thus commenced it will tell how to breathe into the breasts of the corporations which choke us in their human packing boxes something resembling the soul which they are universally acknowledged to be destitute of when this is done carbonic acid ammoniacal smells organic exhalations smoke and dust will be invited to shun the interiors of railway cars and comparative comfort will descend upon the peregrinating public the mineral resources of missouri the incalculable wealth which lies hid in the bosom of mother earth in our vast possessions of the west is undoubtedly centered in the state of missouri and the development of this fund of riches must add to the national prosperity not only by its immeasurable intrinsic value but by its affording occupation to armies of laborers the latter being the highest and most important consideration in 18523 a geological survey of the state was wisely decided upon and a liberal provision for its execution made two valuable reports by professor swallow have been printed in the year 1855 but the notes of his subsequent investigations have not been made public in the session of 186970 further action in this important public work was taken by the state legislature and arrangements made for a still more accurate and detailed examination under the direction of professor a d hager of vermont the distribution of metals all over the state will be seen in the following figures taken from the st louis journal of commerce which show the number of counties in which the various ores are found iron in 46 counties lead in 43 coal in 36 copper in 24 marble in 11 zinc in 27 fire clay in 16 barytes in 10 nickel in 6 granite in 4 tin in 4 plumbago in 2 gypsum in 2 alum in 1 antimony in 4 there is probably no country in the world so endowed as this of iron alone according to the state geologists report for 1855 there is ore of the best quality sufficient to furnish 200000000 tuns of iron and this quantity lies in a small space in the vicinity of pilot knob and iron mountain and within 100 miles of st louis the quality of the iron is highly spoken of by the manufacturers and the capacity of the smelting appliances has reached to over 150000 tuns per annum the coal is well suited for reduction of ores either by hot or cold blast treatment the scotia iron co commenced operations in january 1870 and although the materials for building blast furnaces had to be carried 80 miles into a desert the first furnace was blown into blast in august 1870 this furnace will run about 24 tuns per day the company procures ore from a hill near the furnace in which there is an apparently inexhaustible supply of red oxide and brown specular this ore yields 60 per cent of pure metal the erection of mills for making wrought iron is contemplated and the high quality and prodigious quantity of the raw material will justify and reward any outlay of capital in this direction the shipment of ore to other states goes on constantly the last years account showing that 246555 tuns were dispersed over indiana ohio and others the furnaces at kingsland south st louis lewis iron cos works carondelet and maramec are all well situated as to coal and limestone the maramec works having a most valuable waterpower these latter works also ship about 40000 tuns red hematite ore yearly scientific intelligence according to petermanns mittheilungen the new german empire

order of population the governments will stand russia germany france austria and england but in military power the first position must henceforth be accorded to germany american institute of mining engineers a circular has been issued by several mining engineers proposing a meeting at wilkesbarre some time in april or may next of all persons interested in the general subjects of mining and metallurgy for the purpose of establishing an association to be called the american institute of mining engineers the institute will hold meetings periodically in the great mining and metallurgical centers when works of interest such as mines machine shops furnaces and other metallurgical works can be inspected and the members exchange their views and consult for mutual advantage upon the difficulties encountered by each there will be the usual publication of transactions and proceedings the idea of forming an association of persons thus mutually interested in each others occupations is an excellent one but it has been suggested by a number of scientific gentlemen that the american association for the advancement of science offers every facility for the accomplishment of the objects set forth in the circular while it affords the very great advantage of an assemblage of men learned in all departments of knowledge whose acquaintance mining engineers would do well to make and from whom they could learn much while at the same time imparting of their own knowledge as a section of the american association the mining engineers would have more influence before the country and it would perhaps be well for them to stop and consider before establishing a separate institute consumption of sugar coffee and tea e behm gives in his geographical year book for 1870 the

in most countries during the last twenty years unpleasant discovery in the patent officelevying black mail the patent office has been during the past week in a high state of excitement occasioned by the discovery of the operations of e w w griffin clerk in charge of the draftsmens division who it appears has been levying black mail on the lady employs of the office for nearly two years during the administration of colonel fisher late commissioner of patents a large number of ladies were employed for the purpose of recopying drawings when ordered by the inventors of patents already on file these ladies were placed under charge of griffin with power to retain them in office so long as their services were satisfactory it has been proved that griffin hired the ladies at regular salaries of 1000 per annum the most of whom he blackmailed to the amount of 400 per year each it is estimated that he has made 1000 per month for the past two years the matter was brought to the notice of commissioner duncan and an investigation ordered which resulted in the dismissal of griffin it is thought that there are other cases of this kind and the commissioner expresses his determination to ferret them all out and make a clean sweep of all parties in his department engaged in swindling operations against the government or against individuals the patent office has for a long time been considered a rich field for operations of this kind and investigations have often been suggested but passed unheeded by the proper authorities it is openly stated that an investigation into the relations existing between certain examiners of patents and certain patent agents would disclose a more fearful state of blackmailing than exists in all the other government departments combined we find the above sensational paragraph among the recent washington items of the evening mail we are in a position to say that the high state of excitement alluded to has existed only in the brain of the newspaper correspondent the facts in brief are these in july 1869 a lady and wife of one of the clerks in the draftsmens room made application to commissioner fisher for a position in the copying division of the same department and upon the urgent solicitation and recommendation of mr e w w griffin chief of the division she was appointed and has held the position from that time until now receiving as salary 1000 per annum which with the full knowledge of her husband she has divided with griffin in consideration of his services in procuring for her the appointment about a month ago one of the ladys friends got hold of the matter and reported it to the court which resulted in an investigation and the subsequent dismissal of griffin this is the only case of the kind that we have heard of and we have no reason to believe that there is any other or that corruption exists in the examining corps as allegededs a method of testing the purity of samples of water by watching the rapidity of its action on soap and similar compounds has been introduced by the french savants mm boutron and boudet the experiment tests at the same time the purity of the soap dissolved in water in which

large number of practical works and industrial treatises issued from the press of mr baird it is intended as a practical manual for the use of coach painters and we must say upon examination of its contents that we think it admirably adapted to meet the wants of that class of artisans for which it has been prepared there is perhaps no department of decorative art in which there is greater room for the display of skill and taste than in coach painting this work however does not deal with the subject of art to any great extent its aim is to give information in regard to colors varnishes etc and their management in carriage painting in the plainest manner and in this way it thoroughly fulfils the intention of the author on the generation of species by st george mivart f r s london macmillan co 1871 the darwinian theory of the origin of species has perhaps aroused more attention excited more dispute and won more converts in a shorter time among scientific and unscientific men than any other of equal importance promulgated in the 19th century it seems to be the rule either to swallow the theory whole or reject it as unworthy of belief and as conflicting with orthodoxy the author of the work before us has however taken a middle ground from which we opine it will be difficult to dislodge him though it is within full range of the batteries of both the contending parties while he admits the truth of darwins views regarding the operation of natural selection as a cause of the origin of species he denies that it is the sole cause yet maintains that if it could be demonstrated to be the sole cause it would in no manner conflict with orthodox belief in the scriptures as the revelation of god to mankind the perfect candor of the author is one of the marked

metalsall the hard gray american charcoal iron of which car wheels and all such work are made requires more heat and a longer time to melt than soft iron especially scotch pig which is the most fluid and the easiest to melt of any iron consequently unless the melter exercises good judgment in charging the scotch pig will melt and run off before the carwheel iron is melted if g h p be particular in the quality and strength of his iron he will make better results by using soft american charcoal pig with old carwheel iron it will make stronger castings mix better and melt more uniformly but he should always recollect in charging his furnace that soft iron will melt before hard in the same position in the cupola i also think he had better use a larger proportion of soft pig as every time cast iron is melted it becomes harder so much so that iron which can be filed and turned with ease when recast will often be found too hard to workj t of n y hardening tallowif e h h will use one pound of alum for every five pounds of tallow his candles will be as hard and white as wax the alum must be dissolved in water then put in the tallow and stirred until they are both melted together and run in moldsf o h l l of n yaccording to ure strass is made as follows 8 ounces of pure rock crystal or flint in powder mixed with 4 ounces of salt of tartar are to be baked and left to cool the mixture is then poured into hot water and treated with dilute nitric acid till it ceases to effervesce and the frit is then washed in water till the water comes off tasteless the frit is then dried and mixed with 12 ounces of white lead and this last mixture reduced to fine powder and washed with distilled water 1 ounce of calcined borax is now added to every 12 ounces of the mixture the whole rubbed together in a porcelain mortar melted in a clean crucible and poured out into pure cold water this melting and pouring into water must be done three times using a clean new crucible each time the third frit is pulverized five drachms of niter added and then melted for the last time when a clean beautiful white crystal mass results c m s of wisthere are no precise proportions observed in making the coaltar and gravel walks of which you speak the aim is to saturate the gravel with the hot tar without surplus the interstices of the gravel are simply to be filled and the amount required to do this depends wholly upon the coarseness or fineness of the gravel employed w p t of ohiotwo teams of horses of equal strength pulling against each other by means of a rope would create the same tension in the rope as one of the teams drawing against an immovable object w h b of vaice can be made by compressing air and after it has radiated its heat allowing it to extract the heat of water with which it is brought into contact the temperature of air at 59 fah would be raised by compressing the air to one fourth its original volume to 317 fah and the air would radiate and absorb again in expanding about 190 units of heat e t h of gathe friable sandstone a specimen of which you send us may we think be rendered firmer by soaking it in a solution of silicate of soda and allowing it to stand till dry j a v of ohiothe use of steam expansively by means of cutoff appliances enables the expansive force of the steam to be utilized which cannot be done when the pressure is maintained at one standard and steam admitted through the fall stroke it takes no more power to do a given amount of work in one case than in the other but more boiler capacity and more fuel as the working power of the steam is more economically applied when the cutoff is used geo f r of ohiotype metal is composed of 3 parts lead and 1 part antimony for smallest hardest and most brittle types 4 of lead and 1 of

boiler means its evaporating power and in that sense is proper if its evaporative power be sufficient to perform a given amount of work it is proper to estimate that work in horse power water can not be pumped out of a pipe from which atmospheric air is excluded a pipe driven into a soil impervious to air can never yield water unless the water is forced up by hydraulic power as in the artesian
