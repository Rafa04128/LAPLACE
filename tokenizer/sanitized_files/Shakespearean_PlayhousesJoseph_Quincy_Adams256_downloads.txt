of shakespeare has long received close study among those who have more recently devoted their energies to the subject may be mentioned wj lawrence ts graves gf reynolds ve albright ah thorndike and b neuendorff each of whom has embodied the results of his investigations in one or more noteworthy volumes but the history of the playhouses themselves a topic equally important has not hitherto been attempted if we omit the brief notices of the theatres in edmond malones the plays and poems of william shakespeare 1790 and john payne colliers the history of english dramatic poetry 1831 the sole book dealing even in part with the topic is tf ordishs the early london theatres in the fields this book however though good for its time was written a quarter of a century ago before most of the documents relating to early theatrical history were discovered and it discusses only six playhouses the present volume takes advantage of all the materials made available by the industry of later scholars and records the history of seventeen regular and five temporary or projected theatres the book is throughout the result of a firsthand examination of original sources and represents an independent interpretation of the historical evidences as a consequence of this as well as of a comparison now for the first time possible of the detailed records of the several playhouses many conclusions long held by scholars have been set aside i have made no systematic attempt to point out the cases in which i depart from previously accepted opinions for the scholar will discover them for himself but i believe i have never thus departed without being aware of it and without having carefully weighed the entire evidence sometimes the evidence has been too voluminous or complex for detailed presentation in these instances i have had to content myself with reference by footnotes to the more significant documents bearing on the point in a task involving so many details i cannot hope to have escaped errorserrors due not only to oversight but also to the limitations of my knowledge or to mistaken interpretation for such i can offer no excuse though i may request from my readers the same degree of tolerance which i have tried to show other laborers in the field in reproducing old documents i have as a rule modernized the spelling and the punctuation for in a work of this character there seems to be no advantage in preserving the accidents and perversities of early scribes and printers i have also consistently altered the dates when the old style conflicted with our present usage i desire especially to record my indebtedness to the researches of professor cw wallace the extent of whose services to the study of the tudorstuart drama has not yet been generally realized and has sometimes been grudgingly acknowledged and to the labors of mr ek chambers and mr ww greg who in the collections of the malone society and elsewhere have rendered accessible a wealth of important material dealing with the early history of the stage finally i desire to express my gratitude to mr hamilton bell and the editor of the architectural record for permission to reproduce the illustration and description of inigo joness plan of the cockpit to the governors of dulwich college for permission to reproduce three portraits from the dulwich picture gallery one of which that of joan alleyn has not previously been reproduced to mr cw redwood formerly technical artist at cornell university for expert assistance in making the large map of london showing the sites of the

except when received into private homes to give their performances in any place that chance provided such as open streetsquares barns townhalls mootcourts schoolhouses churches andmost frequently of all perhapsthe yards of inns these yards especially those of carriers inns were admirably suited to dramatic representations consisting as they did of a large open court surrounded by two or more galleries many examples of such innyards are still to be seen in various parts of england a picture of the famous white hart in southwark is given opposite page 4 by way of illustration in the yard a temporary platforma few boards it may be set on barrelheads1could be erected for a stage in the adjacent stables a dressingroom could be provided for the actors the rabblealways the larger and more enthusiastic part of the audiencecould be accommodated with standingroom about the stage while the more aristocratic members of the audience could be comfortably seated in the galleries overhead thus a readymade and very serviceable theatre was always at the command of the players and it seems to have been frequently made use of from the very beginning of professionalism in acting footnote 1 thou shalt not need to travel with thy pumps full of gravel any more after a blind jade and a hamper and stalk upon boards and barrelheads poetaster iii i one of the earliest extant moralities mankind acted by strollers in the latter half of the fifteenth century gives us an interesting glimpse of an innyard performance the opening speech makes distinct reference to the two classes of the audience described above as occupying the galleries and the yard o ye sovereigns that sit and ye brothers that stand right up the brothers indeed seem to have stood up so closely about the stage that the actors had great difficulty in passing to and from their dressingroom thus nowadays leaves the stage with the request make space sirs let me go out new gyse enters with the threat out of my way sirs for dread of a beating while nought with even less respect shouts avaunt knaves let me go by language such as this would hardly be appropriate if addressed to the sovereigns who sat in the galleries above but as addressed to the brothers it probably served to create a general feeling of good nature and a feeling of good nature was desirable for the actors were facing the difficult problem of inducing the audience to pay for its entertainment this problem they met by taking advantage of the most thrilling moment of the plot the vice and his wicked though jolly companions having wholly failed to overcome the hero mankind decide to call to their assistance no less a person than the great devil himself and accordingly they summon him with a walsingham wystyle immediately he roars in the dressingroom and shouts i come with my legs under me there is a flash of powder and an explosion of fireworks while the eager spectators crane their necks to view the entrance of this abhomynabull personage but nothing appears and in the expectant silence that follows the actors calmly announce a collection of money facetiously making the appearance of the devil dependent on the liberality of the audience new gyse now ghostly to our purpose worshipful sovereigns we intend to gather money if it please your negligence for a man with a head that of great omnipotence nowadays interrupting keep your tale in goodness i pray you good brother addressing the audience and pointing towards the dressingroom where the devil roars again he is a worshipful man sirs saving your reverence he loveth no groats nor pence or twopence give us red royals if ye will see his abominable presence new gyse not so ye that may not pay the one pay the other and with such phrases as god bless you master ye will not say nay let us go by do them all pay well mote ye fare they pass through the audience gathering their groats pence and twopence after which they remount the stage fetch in the devil and continue their play without further interruption illustration an innyard the famous white hart in southwark the groundplan shows the arrangement of a carriers inn with the stabling below the guest rooms were on the upper floors in the smaller towns the itinerant players might through a letter of recommendation from their noble patron or through the goodwill of some local dignitary secure the use of the townhall of the schoolhouse or even of the village church in such buildings of course they could give their performances more advantageously for they could place moneytakers at the doors and exact adequate payment from all who entered in the great city of london however the players were necessarily forced to make use almost entirely of public innyardsan arrangement which we may well believe they found far from satisfactory not being masters of the inns they were merely tolerated they had to content themselves with hastily provided and inadequate stage facilities and worst of all for their recompense they had to trust to a hat collection at best a poor means of securing money often too no doubt they could not get the use of a given innyard when they most needed it as on holidays and festive occasions and at all times they had to leave the public in uncertainty as to where or when plays were to be seen their street parade with the noise of trumpets and drums might gather a motley crowd for the yard but in so large a place as london it was inadequate for advertisement among the better classes and as the troupes of the city increased in wealth and dignity and as the playgoing public grew in size and importance the old makeshift arrangement became more and more unsatisfactory at last the unsatisfactory situation was relieved by the specific dedication of certain large inns to dramatic purposes that is the proprietors of certain inns found it to their advantage to subordinate their ordinary business to the urgent demands of the actors and the playgoing public accordingly they erected in their yards permanent stages adequately equipped for dramatic representations constructed in their galleries wooden benches to accommodate as many spectators as possible and were ready to let the use of their buildings to the actors on an agreement by which the proprietor shared with the troupe in the takings at the door thus there came into existence a number of innplayhouses where the actors as masters of the place could make themselves quite at home and where the public without special notification could be sure of always finding dramatic entertainment richard flecknoe in his discourse of the english stage 1664 goes so far as to dignify these reconstructed inns with the name theatres at first says he the players acted without any certain theatres or set companions till about the beginning of queen elizabeths reign they began here to assemble into companies and set up theatres first in the city as in the innyards of the cross keys and bull in grace and bishops gate street at this day to be seen till that fanatic spirit ie puritanism which then began with the stage and after ended with the throne banished them thence into the suburbsthat is into shoreditch and the bankside where outside the jurisdiction of the puritanical city fathers they erected their first regular playhouses the banishment referred to by flecknoe was the order of the common council issued on december 6 1574 this famous document described public acting as then taking place in great inns having chambers and secret places adjoining to their open stages and galleries and it ordered that henceforth no innkeeper tavernkeeper nor other person whatsoever within the liberties of this city shall openly show or play nor cause or suffer to be openly showed or played within the house yard or any other place within the liberties of this city any play etc how many inns were let on special occasions for dramatic purposes we cannot say but there were five great inns more famous than the rest which were regularly used by the best london troupes thus howes in his continuation of stows annals p 1004 in attempting to give a list of the playhouses which had been erected within london and the suburbs begins with the statement five inns or common osteryes turned to playhouses these five were the bell and the cross keys hard by each other in gracechurch street the bull in bishopsgate street the bell savage on ludgate hill and the boars head in whitechapel street without aldgate2 footnote 2 all historians of the drama have confused this great carriers inn with the boars head in eastcheap made famous by falstaff the error seems to have come from the analytical index of the remembrancia which p 355 incorrectly catalogues the letter of march 31 1602 as referring to the boars head in eastcheap the letter itself however when examined gives no indication whatever of eastcheap and other evidence shows conclusively that the inn was situated in whitechapel just outside of aldgate although flecknoe referred to the order of the common council as a banishment it did not actually drive the players from the city they were able through the intervention of the privy council and on the old excuse of rehearsing plays for the queens entertainment to occupy the inns for a large part of each year3 john stockwood in a sermon preached at pauls cross august 24 1578 bitterly complains of the eight ordinary places used regularly for plays referring it seems to the five inns and the three playhousesthe theatre curtain and blackfriarsrecently opened to the public footnote 3 see especially the acts of the privy council and the remembrancia of the city of london richard reulidge in a monster lately found out and discovered 1628 writes that soon after 1580 the authorities of london received permission from queen elizabeth and her privy council to thrust the players out of the city and to pull down all playhouses and dicinghouses within their liberties which accordingly was effected and the playhouses in gracious street ie the bell and the cross keys bishopsgate street ie the bull that nigh pauls ie pauls singing school that on ludgate hill ie the bell savage and the whitefriars4 were quite put down and suppressed by the care of these religious senators footnote 4 there is some error here the city had no jurisdiction over whitefriars or blackfriars either but there was a playhouse in blackfriars at the time and it was suppressed in 1584 though not by the city authorities possibly reulidge should have written whitechapel illustration map of london showing the innplayhouses 1 the bell savage 2 the cross keys 3 the bell 4 the bull 5 the boars head yet in spite of what reulidge says these five inns continued to be used by the players for many years5 no doubt they were often used surreptitiously in martins months mind 1589 we read that a person for a penie may have farre better entertainment by oddes at the theatre and curtaine and any blind playing house everie day6 but the more important troupes were commonly able through the interference of the privy council to get official permission to use the inns during a large part of each year footnote 5 the remembrancia shows that the innplayhouses remained for many years as sharp thorns in the side of the puritanical city fathers footnote 6 grosart nash i 179 there is not enough material about these early innplayhouses to enable one to write their separate histories below however i have recorded in chronological order the more important references to them which have come under my observation 1557 on september 5 the privy council instructed the lord mayor of london that some of his officers do forthwith repair to the boars head without aldgate where the lords are informed a lewd play called a sackful of news shall be played this day to arrest the players and send their playbook to the council7 footnote 7 dasent acts of the privy council vi 168 1573 during this year there were various fencing contests held at the bull in bishopsgate8 footnote 8 w rendle the inns of old southwark p 235 1577 in february the office of the revels made a payment of 10d ffor the cariadge of the parts of ye well counterfeit from the bell in gracious strete to st johns to be performed for the play of cutwell9 footnote 9 a feuillerat documents relating to the office of the revels in the time of queen elizabeth p 277 1579 on june 23 james burbage was arrested for the sum of 5 13d as he came down gracious street towards the cross keys there to a play the name of the proprietor of this innplayhouse is preserved in one of the interrogatories connected with the case item whether did you john hynde about xiii years past in anno 1579 the xxiii of june about two of the clock in the afternoon send the sheriffs officer unto the cross keys in gratious street being then the dwelling house of richard ibotson citizen and brewer of london etc10 nothing more i believe is known of this person footnote 10 burbage v brayne printed in cw wallace the first london theatre pp 82 90 whether burbage was going to the cross keys as a spectator or as an actor is not indicated but the presumption is that he was then playing at the inn although he was proprietor of the theatre 1579 stephen gosson in the schoole of abuse writes favorably of the two prose books played at the bell savage where you shall find never a word without wit never a line without pith never a letter placed in vain the jew and ptolome shown at the bull neither with amorous gesture wounding the eye nor with slovenly talk hurting the ears of the chast hearers11 footnote 11 arbers english reprints p 40 1582 on july 1 the earl of warwick wrote to the lord mayor requesting the city authorities to give license to my servant john david this bearer to play his profest prizes in his science and profession of defence at the bull in bishopsgate or some other convenient place to be assigned within the liberties of london the lord mayor refused to allow david to give his fencing contest in an inn which was somewhat too close for infection and appointed him to play in an open place of the leaden hall which it may be added was near the bull12 footnote 12 see the malone societys collections i 5557 1583 william rendle in the inns of old southwark p 235 states that in this year tarleton wilson and others note the stay of the plague and ask leave to play at the bull in bishopsgate or the bell in gracechurch street citing as his authority merely city ms the privy council on november 26 1583 addressed to the lord mayor a letter requesting that her majestys players ie tarleton wilson etc may be suffered to play within the liberties as heretofore they have done13 and on november 28 the lord mayor issued to them a license to play at the sign of the bull in bishopsgate street and the sign of the bell in gracious street and nowhere else within this city14 footnote 13 see the remembrancia in the malone societys collections i 66 footnote 14 cw wallace the first london theatre p 11 1587 james cranydge played his masters prize the 21 of november 1587 at the bellsavage without ludgate at iiij sundry kinds of weapons there played with him nine masters15 footnote 15 ms sloane 2530 f 67 quoted by jo halliwell in his edition of tarltons jests p xi the bell savage seems to have been especially patronized by fencers george silver in his paradoxe of defence 1599 tells how he and his brother once challenged two italian fencers to a contest to be played at the bell savage upon the scaffold when he that went in his fight faster back than he ought should be in danger to break his neck off the scaffold before 1588 in tarltons jests16 we find a number of references to that famous actors pleasantries in the london inns used by the queens players it is impossible to date these exactly but tarleton became a member of the queens players in 1583 and he died in 1588 footnote 16 first printed in 1611 reprinted by jo halliwell for the shakespeare society in 1844 at the bull in bishopsgatestreet where the queens players oftentimes played tarleton coming on the stage one from the gallery threw a pippin at him there was one banks in the time of tarleton who served the earl of essex and had a horse of strange qualities and being at the cross keys in gracious street getting money with him as he was mightily resorted to tarleton then with his fellows playing at the bell by came into the cross keys amongst many people to see fashions at the bull at bishopsgate was a play of henry the fifth the several jests which follow these introductory sentences indicate that the innyards differed in no essential way from the early public playhouses 1588 john mathews played his masters prize the 31 day of january 1588 at the bell savage without ludgate17 footnote 17 ms sloane 2530 f 67 quoted by halliwell in his edition of tarltons jests p xi there is some difficulty with the date one of the masters before whom the prize was played was rycharde tarlton whom halliwell takes to be the famous actor of that name but tarleton the actor died on september 3 1588 probably halliwell in transcribing the manuscript silently modernized the date from the old style 1589 in november lord burghley directed the lord mayor to give order for the stay of all plays within the city in reply the lord mayor wrote according to which your lordships good pleasure i presently sent for such players as i could hear of so as there appeared yesterday before me the lord stranges players to whom i specially gave in charge and required them in her majestys name to forbear playing until further order might be given for their allowance in that respect whereupon the lord admirals players very dutifully obeyed but the others in very contemptuous manner departing from me went to the cross keys and played that afternoon18 footnote 18 lansdowne mss 60 quoted by collier history of english dramatic poetry 1879 i 265 1594 on october 8 henry lord hunsdon the lord chamberlain and the patron of shakespeares company wrote to the lord mayor after my hearty commendations where my now company of players have been accustomed for the better exercise of their quality and for the service of her majesty if need so require to play this winter time within the city at the cross keys in gracious street these are to require and pray your lordship the time being such as thanks to god there is now no danger of the sickness to permit and suffer them so to do19 footnote 19 the remembrancia the malone societys collections i 73 by such devices as this the players were usually able to secure permission to act within the city during the disagreeable months of the winter when the large playhouses in the suburbs were difficult of access 1594 anthony bacon the elder brother of francis came to lodge in bishopsgate street this fact very much disturbed his good mother who feared lest his servants might be corrupted by the plays to be seen at the bull near by20 footnote 20 see w rendle the inns of old southwark p 236 1596 william lambarde in his perambulation of kent21 observes that none of those who go to paris garden the bell savage or theatre to behold bearbaiting interludes or fence play can account of any pleasant spectacle unless they first pay one penny at the gate another at the entry of the scaffold and the third for a quiet standing footnote 21 the passage does not appear in the earlier edition of 1576 though it was probably written shortly after the erection of the theatre in the autumn of 1576 1602 on march 31 the privy council wrote to the lord mayor that the players of the earl of oxford and of the earl of worcester had been joined by agreement together in one company to whom upon notice of her majestys pleasure at the suit of the earl of oxford toleration hath been thought meet to be granted the letter concludes and as the other companies that are allowed namely of me the lord admiral and the lord chamberlain be appointed their certain houses and one and no more to each company so we do straightly require that this third company be likewise appointed to one place and because we are informed the house called the boars head is the place they have especially used and do best like of we do pray and require you that the said house namely the boars head may be assigned unto them22 footnote 22 the remembrancia the malone societys collections i 85 that the strong oxfordworcester combination should prefer the boars head to the curtain or the rose playhouse23 indicates that the innyard was not only large but also wellequipped for acting footnote 23 they had to use the rose nevertheless see page 158 1604 in a draft of a license to be issued to queen annes company those players are allowed to act as well within their now usual houses called the curtain and the boars head within our county of middlesex as in any other playhouse not used by others24 footnote 24 the malone societys collections i 265 in 1608 the boars head seems to have been occupied by the newly organized prince charless company in william kellys extracts from the payments of the city of leicester we find the entry itm given to the princes players of whitechapel london xx s in 1664 as flecknoe tells us the cross keys and the bull still gave evidence of their former use as playhouses perhaps even then they were occasionally let for fencing and other contests in 1666 the great fire completely destroyed the bell the cross keys and the bell savage the bull however escaped and enjoyed a prosperous career for many years after samuel pepys was numbered among its patrons and writers of the restoration make frequent reference to it what became of the boars head without aldgate i am unable to learn its memory however is perpetuated today in boars head yard between middlesex street and goulston street whitechapel chapter ii the hostility of the city as the actors rapidly increased in number and importance and as londoners flocked in ever larger crowds to witness plays the animosity of two forces was aroused puritanism and civic governmentforces which opposed the drama for different reasons but with almost equal fervor and when in the course of time the governors of the city themselves became puritans the combined animosity thus produced was sufficient to drive the players out of london into the suburbs the puritans attacked the drama as contrary to holy writ as destructive of religion and as a menace to public morality against plays players and playgoers they waged in pulpit and pamphlet a warfare characterized by the most intense fanaticism the charges they madeof ungodliness idolatrousness lewdness profanity evil practices enormities and abuses of all kindsare far too numerous to be noted here they are interesting chiefly for their unreasonableness and for the violence with which they were urged and after all however much the puritans might rage they were helpless authority to restrain acting was vested in the lord mayor his brethren the aldermen and the common council the attitude of these city officials towards the drama was unmistakable they had no more love for the actors than had the puritans they found that plays and players gave them more trouble than anything else in the entire administration of municipal affairs the dedication of certain great inns to the use of actors and to the entertainment of the pleasureloving element of the city created new and serious problems for those charged with the preservation of civic law and order the presence in these inns of private rooms adjoining the yard and balconies gave opportunity for immorality gambling fleecing and various other evil practicesan opportunity which if we may believe the common council was not wasted moreover the proprietors of these inns made a large share of their profits from the beer ale and other drinks dispensed to the crowds before during and after performances the proprietor of the cross keys it will be recalled was described as citizen and brewer of london and the resultant intemperance among such as frequented the said plays being the ordinary place of meeting for all vagrant persons and masterless men that hang about the city theeves horsestealers whoremongers cozeners conycatching persons practicers of treason and such other like25 led to drunkenness frays bloodshed and often to general disorder sometimes as we know turbulent apprentices and other factions met by appointment at plays for the sole purpose of starting riots or breaking open jails upon whitsunday writes the recorder to lord burghley by reason no plays were the same day all the city was quiet26 footnote 25 so the lord mayor characterized playgoers see the remembrancia in the malone societys collections i 75 footnote 26 the malone societys collections i 164 trouble of an entirely different kind arose when in the hot months of the summer the plague was threatening the meeting together at plays of great multitudes of the basest sort of people served to spread the infection throughout the city more quickly and effectively than could anything else on such occasions it was exceedingly difficult for the municipal authorities to control the actors who were at best a stubborn and unruly lot and often the pestilence had secured a full start before acting could be suppressed these troubles and others which cannot here be mentioned made one of the lord mayors exclaim in despair the politique state and government of this city by no one thing is so greatly annoyed and disquieted as by players and plays and the disorders which follow thereupon27 footnote 27 the remembrancia in the malone societys collections i 69 this annoyance serious enough in itself was aggravated by the fact that most of the troupes were under the patronage of great noblemen and some were even high in favor with the queen as a result the attempts on the part of the lord mayor and his aldermen to regulate the players were often interfered with by other or higher authority sometimes it was a particular nobleman whose request was not to be ignored who intervened in behalf of his troupe most often however it was the privy council representing the queen and the nobility in general which championed the cause of the actors and countermanded the decrees of the lord mayor and his brethren one of the most notable things in the citys remembrancia is this long conflict of authority between the common council and the privy council over actors and acting in 1573 the situation seems to have approached a crisis the lord mayor had become strongly puritanical and in his efforts to suppress stageplays was placing more and more obstacles in the way of the actors the temper of the mayor is revealed in two entries in the records of the privy council on july 13 1573 the lords of the council sent a letter to him requesting him to permit liberty to certain italian players six days later they sent a second letter repeating the request and marveling that he did it not at their first request28 his continued efforts to suppress the drama finally led the troupes to appeal for relief to the privy council on march 22 1574 the lords of the council dispatched a letter to the lord mayor to advertise their lordships what causes he hath to restrain plays his answer has not been preserved but that he persisted in his hostility to the drama is indicated by the fact that in may the queen openly took sides with the players to the earl of leicesters troupe she issued a special royal license authorizing them to act as well within our city of london and liberties of the same as also within the liberties and freedoms of any our cities towns boroughs etc whatsoever and to the mayors and other officers she gave strict orders not to interfere with such performances willing and commanding you and every of you as ye tender our pleasure to permit and suffer them herein without any your lets hindrances or molestation during the term aforesaid any act statute proclamation or commandment heretofore made or hereafter to be made to the contrary notwithstanding footnote 28 dasent acts of the privy council viii 131 132 this license was a direct challenge to the authority of the lord mayor he dared not answer it as directly but on december 6 1574 he secured from the common council the passage of an ordinance which placed such heavy restrictions upon acting as virtually to nullify the license issued by the queen and to regain for the mayor complete control of the drama within the city the preamble of this remarkable ordinance clearly reveals the puritanical character of the city government whereas heretofore sundry great disorders and inconveniences have been found to ensue to this city by the inordinate haunting of great multitudes of people specially youths to plays interludes and shews namely occasion of frays and quarrels evil practises of incontinency in great inns having chambers and secret places adjoining to their open stages and galleries inveigling and alluring of maids specially orphans and good citizens children under age to privy and unmeet contracts the publishing of unchaste uncomly and unshamefaced speeches and doings withdrawing of the queens majestys subjects from divine service on sundays and holy days at which times such plays were chiefly used unthrifty waste of the money of the poor and fond persons sundry robberies by picking and cutting of purses uttering of popular busy and seditious matters and many other corruptions of youth and other enormities besides that also sundry slaughters and maimings of the queens subjects have happened by ruins of scaffolds frames and stages and by engines weapons and powder used in plays and whereas in time of gods visitation by the plague such assemblies of the people in throng and press have been very dangerous for spreading of infection and for that the lord mayor and his brethren the aldermen together with the grave and discreet citizens in the common council assembled do doubt and fear lest upon gods merciful withdrawing his hand of sickness from us which god grant the people specially the meaner and most unruly sort should with sudden forgetting of his visitation without fear of gods wrath and without due respect of the good and politique means that he hath ordained for the preservation of common weals and peoples in health and good order return to the undue use of such enormities to the great offense of god29 footnote 29 for the complete document see wc hazlitt the english drama and stage p 27 the restrictions on playing imposed by the ordinance may be briefly summarized 1 only such plays should be acted as were free from all unchastity seditiousness and uncomely matter 2 before being acted all plays should be first perused and allowed in such order and form and by such persons as by the lord mayor and court of aldermen for the time being shall be appointed 3 inns or other buildings used for acting and their proprietors should both be licensed by the lord mayor and the aldermen 4 the proprietors of such buildings should be bound to the chamberlain of london by a sufficient bond to guarantee the keeping of good order and avoiding of the inconveniences noted in the preamble 5 no plays should be given during the time of sickness or during any inhibition ordered at any time by the city authorities 6 no plays should be given during any usual time of divine service and no persons should be admitted into playing places until after divine services were over 7 the proprietors of such places should pay towards the support of the poor a sum to be agreed upon by the city authorities in order however to avoid trouble with the queen or those noblemen who were accustomed to have plays given in their homes for the private entertainment of themselves and their guests the common council added rather grudgingly the following proviso provided alway that this act otherwise than touching the publishing of unchaste seditious and unmeet matters shall not extend to any plays interludes comedies tragedies or shews to be played or shewed in the private house dwelling or lodging of any nobleman citizen or gentleman which shall or will then have the same there so played or shewed in his presence for the festivity of any marriage assembly of friends or other like cause without public or common collections of money of the auditory or beholders thereof such regulations if strictly enforced would prove very annoying to the players but as the common council itself informs us these orders were not then observed the troupes continued to play in the city protected against any violent action on the part of the municipal authorities by the known favor of the queen and the frequent interference of the privy council this state of affairs was not of course comfortable for the actors but it was by no means desperate and for several years after the passage of the ordinance of 1574 they continued without serious interruption to occupy their innplayhouses the longcontinued hostility of the city authorities however of which the ordinance of 1574 was an ominous expression led more or less directly to the construction of special buildings devoted to plays and situated beyond the jurisdiction of the common council as the reverend john stockwood in a sermon preached at paules crosse 1578 indignantly puts it have we not houses of purpose built with great charges for the maintenance of plays and that without the liberties as who would say there let them say what they will say we will play thus came into existence playhouses and with them dawned a new era in the history of the english drama illustration the site of the first playhouses finsbury field and holywell the man walking from the field towards shoreditch is just entering holywell lane from agass map of london representing the city as it was about 1560 chapter iii the theatre the hostility of the city to the drama was unquestionably the main cause of the erection of the first playhouse yet combined with this were two other important causes usually overlooked the first was the need of a building specially designed to meet the requirements of the players and of the public a need yearly growing more urgent as plays became more complex acting developed into a finer art and audiences increased in dignity as well as in size the second and the more immediate cause was the appearance of a man with business insight enough to see that such a building would pay the first playhouse we should remember was not erected by a troupe of actors but by a moneyseeking individual30 although he was himself an actor and the manager of a troupe he did not it seems take the troupe into his confidence in complete independence of any theatrical organization he proceeded with the erection of his building as a private speculation and we are told he dreamed of the continual great profit and commodity through plays that should be used there every week footnote 30 i emphasize this point because the opposite is the accepted opinion we find it expressed in the cambridge history of english literature vi 431 as follows certain players finding the city obdurate and unwilling to submit to its severe regulations began to look about them for some means of carrying on their business out of reach of the mayors authority etc this man the first builder of playhousesand it might have been added the pioneer in a new field of businesswas james burbage originally as we are told by one who knew him well by occupation a joiner and reaping but a small living by the same gave it over and became a common player in plays31 as an actor he was more successful for as early as 1572 we find him at the head of leicesters excellent troupe footnote 31 deposition by robert myles 1592 printed in wallaces the first london theatre p 141 having in 1575 conceived the notion of erecting a building specially designed for dramatic entertainments he was at once confronted with the problem of a suitable location two conditions narrowed his choice first the site had to be outside the jurisdiction of the common council secondly it had to be as near as possible to the city no doubt he at once thought of the two suburbs that were specially devoted to recreation the bankside to the south and finsbury field to the north of the city the bankside had for many years been associated in the minds of londoners with sports and pastimes thither the citizens were accustomed to go to witness bearbaiting and bullbaiting to practice archery and to engage in various athletic sports thither too for many years the actors had gone to present their plays in 1545 king henry viii had issued a proclamation against vagabonds ruffians idle persons and common players32 in which he referred to their fashions commonly used at the bank the bankside however was associated with the lowest and most vicious pleasures of london for here were situated the stews bordering the rivers edge since the players were at this time subject to the bitterest attacks from the london preachers burbage wisely decided not to erect the first permanent home of the drama in a locality already a common target for puritan invective footnote 32 see page 134 the second locality finsbury field had nearly all the advantages and none of the disadvantages of the bankside since 1315 the field had been in the possession of the city33 and had been used as a public playground where families could hold picnics falconers could fly their hawks archers could exercise their sport and the militia on holidays could drill with all the pomp and circumstance of glorious war in short the field was eminently respectable was accessible to the city and was definitely associated with the idea of entertainment the locality therefore was almost ideal for the purpose burbage had in mind34 footnote 33 see the remembrancia p 274 stow survey the corporation of london held the manor on lease from st pauls cathedral until 1867 footnote 34 doubtless too burbage was influenced in his choice by the fact that he had already made his home in the liberty of shoreditch near finsbury field the new playhouse of course could not be erected in the field itself which was under the control of the city but just to the east of the field certain vacant land part of the dissolved priory of holywell offered a site in every way suitable to the purpose the holywell property at the dissolution of the priory had passed under the jurisdiction of the crown and hence the lord mayor and the aldermen could not enforce municipal ordinances there moreover it was distant from the city wall not much more than half a mile the old conventual church had been demolished the priory buildings had been converted into residences and the land near the shoreditch highway had been built up with numerous houses the land next to the field however was for the most part undeveloped it contained some dilapidated tenements a few old barns formerly belonging to the priory and small garden plots conspicuous objects in the early maps illustration the site of the first playhouses finsbury field lies to the north beyond moor field the small rectangular space next to the city wall and the holywell property lies to the right of finsbury field between the field and the highway holywell lane divides the garden plots the theatre was erected just to the north and the curtain just to the south of this lane facing the field from the map of london by braun and hogenbergius representing the city as it was in 15541558 burbage learned that a large portion of this land lying next to the field was in the possession of a welltodo gentleman named gyles alleyn35 and that alleyn was willing to lease a part of his holding on the conditions of development customary in this section of london these conditions are clearly revealed in a chancery suit of 1591 the ground there was for the most part converted first into garden plots and then leasing the same to diverse tenants caused them to covenant or promise to build upon the same by occasion whereof the buildings which are there were for the most part erected and the rents increased36 footnote 35 for a detailed history of the property from the year 1128 and for the changes in the ownership of alleyns portion after the dissolution see braines holywell priory footnote 36 halliwellphillipps outlines i 365 the suit concerns the curtain property somewhat south of the alleyn property but a part of the priory the part of alleyns property on which burbage had his eye was in sore need of improvement it consisted of five paltry tenements described as old decayed and ruinated for want of reparation and the best of them was but of two stories high and a long barn very ruinous and decayed and ready to have fallen down one half of which was used as a storageroom the other half as a slaughterhouse three of the tenements had small gardens extending back to the field and just north of the barn was a bit of void ground also adjoining the field it was this bit of void ground that burbage had selected as a suitable location for his proposed playhouse the accompanying map of the property37 will make clear the position of this void ground and of the barns and tenements about it moreover it will serve to indicate the exact site of the theatre if one will bear in mind the fact that in the london of today curtain road marks the eastern boundary of finsbury field and new inn yard cuts off the lower half of the great barn he will be able to place burbages structure within a few yards38 footnote 37 i have based this map in large measure on the documents presented by braines in his excellent pamphlet holywell priory footnote 38 for proof see braines op cit illustration a plan of burbages holywell property based on the lease and on the miscellaneous documents printed by halliwellphillipps and by braines the common sewer is now marked by curtain road and the ditch from the horsepond by new inn yard the property is carefully described in the leasequoted belowwhich burbage secured from alleyn but the reader will need to refer to the map in order to follow with ease the several paragraphs of description39 all those two houses or tenements with appurtenances which at the time of the said former demise made were in the several tenures or occupations of joan harrison widow and john dragon and also all that house or tenement with the appurtenances together with the garden ground lying

the occupation of the said robert stoughton together also with all the ground and soil lying and being between the said nether rooms last before expressed and the aforesaid great barn and the aforesaid pond that is to say extending in length from the aforesaid pond unto a ditch beyond the brick wall next the aforesaid fields and also the said gyles alleyn and sara his wife do by these presents demise grant and to farm lett unto the said james burbage all the right title and interest which the said gyles and sara have or ought to have in or to all the grounds and soil lying between the aforesaid great barn and the barn being at the time of the said former demise in the occupation of the earl of rutland or of his assigns extending in length from the aforesaid pond and from the

great stone wall41 which encloseth part of the aforesaid garden being at the time of the making of the said former demise or late before that in the occupation of the said gyles allen unto the aforesaid barn then in the occupation of the aforesaid earl or of his assigns footnote 39 the original lease may be found incorporated in alleyn v street coram rege 15991600 printed in full by wallace the first london theatre pp 16380 and again in alleyn v burbage queens bench 1602 wallace op cit pp 26775 the lease i think was in english not latin and hence is more correctly given in the first document in the second document the scrivener has translated it into latin the lease is also given in part on page 187 footnote 40 this part of the property was claimed by the earl of rutland and was being used by him for a long time it was the subject of dispute ultimately it seems the earl secured the title as he had always had the use of the property this probably explains why burbage did not attempt to erect his playhouse there footnote 41 the document by error reads brick wall but the mistake is obvious and the second version of the lease does not repeat the error this clause merely means that the ditch not the brick wall constituted the western boundary of the property the lease was formally signed on april 13 1576 and burbage entered into the possession of his property since the terms of the lease are important for an understanding of the subsequent history of the playhouse i shall set these forth briefly first the lease was to run for twentyone years from april 13 1576 at an annual rental of 14 secondly burbage was to spend before the expiration of ten years the sum of 200 in rebuilding and improving the decayed tenements thirdly in view of this expenditure of 200 burbage was to have at the end of the ten years the right to renew the lease at the same rental of 14 a year for twentyone years thus making the lease good in all for thirtyone years and the said gyles alleyn and sara his wife did thereby covenant with the said james burbage that they should and would at any time within the ten years next ensuing at or upon the lawful request or demand of the said james burbage make or cause to be made to the said james burbage a new lease or grant like to the same presents for the term of one and twenty years more to begin from the date of making the same lease yielding therefor the rent reserved in the former indenture42 footnote 42 quoted from burbage v alleyn court of requests 1600 wallace op cit p 182 i have stripped the passage of some of its legal verbiage fourthly it was agreed that at any time before the expiration of the lease burbage might take down and carry away to his own use any building that in the mean time he might have erected on the vacant ground for the purpose of a playhouse and farther the said gyles alleyn and sara his wife did covenant and grant to the said james burbage that it should and might be lawful to the said james burbage in consideration of the imploying and bestowing the foresaid two hundred pounds in forme aforesaid at any time or times before the end of the said term of one and twenty years to have take down and carry away to his own proper use for ever all such buildings and other things as should be builded erected or set up in or upon the gardens and void grounds by the said james either for a theatre or playing place or for any other lawful use without any stop claim let trouble or interruption of the said gyles alleyn and sara his wife43 footnote 43 quoted from burbage v alleyn court of requests 1600 wallace op cit p 182 protected by these specific terms burbage proceeded to the erection of his playhouse he must have had faith and abundant courage for he was a poor man quite unequal to the large expenditures called for by his plans a person who had known him for many years deposed in 1592 that james burbage was not at the time of the first beginning of the building of the premises worth above one hundred marks44 in all his substance for he and this deponent were familiarly acquainted long before that time and ever since45 we are not surprised to learn therefore that he was constrained to borrow diverse sums of money and that he actually pawned the lease itself to a moneylender46 even so without assistance we are told he should never be able to build it for it would cost five times as much as he was worth footnote 44 that is about 80 footnote 45 wallace op cit p 134 cf p 153 footnote 46 wallace op cit p 151 cuthbert burbage declared in 1635 the theatre he built with many hundred pounds taken up at interest halliwellphillipps outlines i 317 fortunately he had a wealthy brotherinlaw john brayne47 a london grocer described as worth five hundred pounds at the least and by common fame worth a thousand marks48 in some way brayne became interested in the new venture like burbage he believed that large profits would flow from such a novel undertaking and as a result he readily agreed to share the expense of erecting and maintaining the building years later members of the brayne faction asserted that james burbage induced his brotherinlaw to venture upon the enterprise by unfairly representing the great profits to ensue49 but the evidence i think shows that brayne eagerly sought the partnership burbage himself asserted in 1588 that brayne practiced to obtain some interest therein and presumed that he might easily compass the same by reason that he was natural brother and that he voluntarily offered to bear and pay half the charges of the said building then bestowed and thereafter to be bestowed in order that he might have the moiety50 of the above named theatre51 as a further inducement so the burbages asserted he promised that for that he had no children the moiety at his death should go to the children of james burbage whose advancement he then seemed greatly to tender footnote 47 the name is often spelled braynes footnote 48 wallace op cit p 109 footnote 49 see wallace op cit pp 139 seq footnote 50 that is halfinterest footnote 51 wallace op cit p 40 whatever caused brayne to interest himself in the venture he quickly became fired with such hopes of great gain that he not only spent upon the building all the money he could gather or borrow but sold his stock of groceries for 146 disposed of his house for 100 even pawned his clothes and put his all into the new structure the spirit in which he worked to make the venture a success and the personal sacrifices that he and his wife made fully deserve the quotation here of two legal depositions bearing on the subject this deponent being servant in bucklersbury aforesaid to one robert kenningham grocer in which street the said john brayne dwelled also and of the same trade he the said brayne at the time he joined with the said james burbage in the aforesaid lease was reputed among his neighbors to be worth one thousand pounds at the least and that after he had joined with the said burbage in the matter of the building of the said theatre he began to slack his own trade and gave himself to the building thereof and the chief care thereof he took upon him and hired workmen of all sorts for that purpose bought timber and all other things belonging thereunto and paid all so as in this deponents conscience he bestowed thereupon for his owne part the sum of one thousand marks at the least in so much as his affection was given so greatly to the finishing thereof in hope of great wealth and profit during their lease that at the last he was driven to sell to this deponents father his lease of the house wherein he dwelled for 100 and to this deponent all such wares as he had left and all that belonged thereunto remaining in the same for the sum of 146 and odd money whereof this deponent did pay for him to one kymbre an ironmonger in london for iron work which the said brayne bestowed upon the said theatre the sum of 40 and afterwards the said brayne took the matter of the said building so upon him as he was driven to borrow money to supply the same saying to this deponent that his brother burbage was not able to help the same and that he found not towards it above the value of fifty pounds some part in mony and the rest in stuff52 footnote 52 wallace op cit p 136 in reading the next deposition one should bear in mind the fact that the deponent robert myles was closely identified with the brayne faction and was therefore a bitter enemy to the burbages yet his testimony though prejudiced gives us a vivid picture of braynes activity in the building of the theatre so the said john brayne made a great sum of money of purpose and intent to go to the building of the said playhouse and thereupon did provide timber and other stuff needful for the building thereof and hired carpenters and plasterers for the same purpose and paid the workmen continually so as he for his part laid out of his own purse and what upon credit about the same to the sum of 600 or 700 at the least and in the same time seeing the said james burbage nothing able either of himself or by his credit to contribute any like sum towards the building thereof being then to be finished or else to be lost that had been bestowed upon it already the said brayne was driven to sell his house he dwelled in in bucklersbury and all his stock that was left and give up his trade yea in the end to pawn and sell both his own garments and his wifes and to run in debt to many for money to finish the said playhouse and so to employ himself only upon that matter and all whatsoever he could make to his utter undoing for he saieth that in the latter end of the finishing thereof the said brayne and his wife the now complainants were driven to labor in the said work for saving of some of the charge in place of two laborers whereas the said james burbage went about his own business and at sometimes when he did take upon him to do some thing in the said work he would be and was allowed a workmans hire as other the workman there had53 footnote 53 brayne v burbage 1592 printed in full by wallace op cit p 141 the last fling at burbage is quite gratuitous yet it is probably true that the main costs of erecting the playhouse fell upon the shoulders of brayne the evidence is contradictory some persons assert that burbage paid half the cost of the building54 others that brayne paid nearly all55 and still others content themselves with saying that brayne paid considerably more than half the last statement may be accepted as true the assertion of gyles alleyn in 1601 that the theatre was erected at the costs and charges of one brayne and not of the said james burbage to the value of one thousand marks56 is doubtless incorrect more correct is the assertion of robert myles executor of the widow braynes will in 1597 the said john brayne did join with the said james burbage in the building aforesaid and did expend thereupon greater sums than the said james that is to say at least five or six hundred pounds57 since there is evidence that the playhouse ultimately cost about 70058 we might hazard the guess that of this sum brayne furnished about 50059 and burbage about 200 to equalize the expenditure it was later agreed that the said brayne should take and receive all the rents and profits of the said theatre to his own use until he should be answered such sums of money which he had laid out for and upon the same theatre more than the said burbage had done60 footnote 54 wallace op cit pp 213 217 263 265 et al footnote 55

p 159 cf pp 263 106 152 footnote 58 see wallace op cit p 277 footnote 59 this agrees with the claim of braynes widow footnote 60 wallace op cit p 120 but if burbage at the outset was nothing able to contribute any great sum of ready money towards the building of the first playhouse he did contribute other things equally if not more important in the first place he conceived the idea and he carried it as far towards realization as his means allowed in the second place he planned the buildingits stage as well as its auditoriumto meet the special demands of the actors and the comfort of the audience this called for bold originality and for ingenuity of a high order for it must be remembered he had no model to studyhe was designing the first structure of its kind in england61 for this task he was well prepared in the first place he was an actor of experience in the second place he was the manager of one of the most important troupes in england and in the third place he was by training and early practice a carpenter and builder in other words he had exact knowledge of what was needed and the practical skill to meet those needs footnote 61 mr ek chambers the medival stage i 383 note 2 ii 190 note 4 calls attention to a theatre belonging to the city of essex as early as 1548 possibly the latin document he cites referred to an amphitheatre of some sort near the city which was used for dramatic performances at any rate in theatro does not necessarily imply the existence of a playhouse cf for example op cit i 8182 there is also a reference quoted by chambers op cit ii 191 note 1 from norfolk archology xi 336 to a gamehouse built by the corporation of yarmouth in 1538 for dramatic performances what kind of house this was we do not know but the corporation leased it for other purposes with the proviso that it should be available at all such times as any interludes or plays should be ministered or played howes in his continuation of stows annals 1631 p 1004 declares that before burbages time he neither knew heard nor read of any such theatres set stages or playhouses as have been purposely built within mans memory and cuthbert burbage confidently asserted that his father was the first builder of playhousesan assertion which i think cannot well be denied the building that he designed and erected he namedas by virtue of priority he had a right to dothe theatre of the theatre unfortunately we have no pictorial representation and no formal description so that our knowledge of its size shape and general arrangement must be derived from scattered and miscellaneous sources that the building was large we may feel sure the cost of its erection indicates as much the fortune one of the largest and handsomest of the later playhouses cost only 520 and the hope also very large cost 360 the theatre therefore built at a cost of 700 could not have been small it is commonly referred to even so late as 1601 as the great house called the theatre and the author of skialetheia 1598 applied to it the significant adjective vast burbage no doubt had learned from his experience as manager of a troupe the pecuniary advantage of having an auditorium large enough to receive all who might come exactly how many people his building could accommodate we cannot say the reverend john stockwood in 1578 exclaims bitterly will not a filthy play with the blast of a trumpet sooner call thither a thousand than an hours tolling of the bell bring to the sermon a hundred62 and fleetwood the city recorder in describing a quarrel which took place in 1584 at theatre door states that near a thousand people quickly assembled when the quarrel began footnote 62 the rest of his speech indicates that he had the theatre in mind the passage of course is rhetorical in shape the building was probably polygonal or circular i see no good reason for supposing that it was square johannes de witt referred to it as an amphitheatre and the curtain erected the following year in imitation was probably polygonal63 it was built of timber and its exterior no doubt wasas in the case of subsequent playhousesof lime and plaster the interior consisted of three galleries surrounding an open space called the yard the german traveler samuel kiechel who visited london in the autumn of 1585 described the playhousesie the theatre and the curtainas singular sonderbare houses which are so constructed that they have about three galleries one above the other64 and stephen gosson in plays confuted c 1581 writes in the playhouses at london it is the fashion for youths to go first into the yard and to carry their eye through every gallery then like unto ravens where they spy the carrion thither they fly and press as near to the fairest as they can the yard was unroofed and all persons there had to stand during the entire performance the galleries however were protected by a roof were divided into rooms and were provided for the most part with seats gyles alleyn inserted in the lease he granted to burbage the following condition and further that it shall or may be lawful for the said gyles and for his wife and family upon lawful request therefor made to the said james burbage his executors or assigns to enter or come into the premises and there in some one of the upper rooms to have such convenient place to sit or stand to see such plays as shall be there played freely without anything therefor paying65 footnote 63 one cannot be absolutely sure yet the whole history of early playhouses indicates that the theatre was polygonal or circular in shape the only reason for suspecting that it might have been square doubtfully presented by ts graves in the shape of the first london theatre the south atlantic quarterly july 1914 seems to me to deserve no serious consideration footnote 64 quoted by wb rye england as seen by foreigners p 88 footnote 65 wallace op cit p 177 the stage was a platform projecting into the yard with a tiringhouse at the rear and a balcony overhead the details of the stage no doubt were subject to alteration as experience suggested for its materials were of wood and histrionic and dramatic art were both undergoing rapid development66 the furnishings and decorations as in the case of modern playhouses seem to have been ornate thus thomas white in a sermon preached at pawles crosse on sunday the thirde of november 1577 exclaims behold the sumptuous theatre houses a continual monument of londons prodigality john stockwood in a sermon preached at paules cross 1578 refers to it as the gorgeous playing place erected in the fields and gabriel harvey could think of no more appropriate epithet for it than paintedpainted theatres painted stage footnote 66 there is no reason whatever to suppose with ordish mantzius lawrence and others that the stage of the theatre was removable for although the building was frequently used by fencers tumblers etc it was never so far as i can discover used for animalbaiting the building was doubtless used for dramatic performances in the autumn of 1576 although it was not completed until later john grigges one of the carpenters deposed that burbage and brayne finished the same with the help of the profits that grew by plays used there before it was fully finished67 access to the playhouse was had chiefly by way of finsbury field and a passage made by burbage through the brick wall mentioned in the lease68 footnote 67 wallace op cit p 135 footnote 68 for depositions to this effect see halliwellphillipps outlines i 350 ff the terms under which the owners let it to the actors were simple the actors retained as their share the pennies paid at the outer doors for general admission and the proprietors received as their share the money paid for seats or standings in the galleries69 cuthbert burbage states in 1635 the players that lived in those first times had only the profits arising from the doors but now the players receive all the comings in at the doors to themselves and half the galleries70 footnote 69 i suspect that the same terms were made with the actors by the proprietors of the innplayhouses footnote 70 halliwellphillipps outlines i 317 before the expiration of two years or in the early summer of 1578 burbage and brayne began to quarrel about the division of the money which fell to their share brayne apparently thought that he should at once be indemnified for all the money he had expended on the playhouse in excess of burbage and he accused burbage of indirect dealingthere were even whispers of a secret key to the common box in which the money was kept71 finally they agreed to submit themselves to the order and arbitrament of certain persons for the pacification thereof and together they went to the shop of a notary public to sign a bond agreeing to abide by the decision of the arbitrators there they fell a reasoning together in the course of which brayne asserted that he had disbursed in the theatre three times at the least as much more as the sum then disbursed by the said james burbage in the end brayne unwisely hinted at ill dealing on the part of burbage whereupon burbage did there strike him with his fist and so they went together by the ears in so much says the notary that this deponent could hardly part them after they were parted they signed a bond of 200 to abide by the decision of the arbitrators the arbitrators john hill and richard turnor men of great honesty and credit held their sessions in the temple church whither they summoned witnesses finally on july 12 1578 after having thoroughly heard both sides they awarded that the profits from the theatre should be used first to pay the debts upon the building then to pay brayne the money he had expended in excess of burbage and thereafter to be shared in divident equally between them72 these conditions however were not observed and the failure to observe them led to much subsequent discord footnote 71 wallace op cit pp 142 148 footnote 72 for the history of this quarrel and for other details of the award see wallace op cit pp 102 119 138 142 143 148 152 the arbitrators also decided that if occasion should move them burbage and brayne to borrow any sum of money for the payment of their debts owing for any necessary use and thing concerning the said theatre that then the said james burbage and the said john brayne should join in pawning or mortgageing of their estate and interest of and in the same73 an occasion for borrowing money soon arose so on september 26 1579 the two partners mortgaged the theatre to john hide for the sum of 125 8s 11d at the end of a year by nonpayment they forfeited the mortgage and the legal title to the property passed to hide it seems however that because of some special clause in the mortgage hide was unable to expel burbage and brayne or to dispose of the property to others hence he took no steps to seize the theatre but he constantly annoyed the occupants by arrest and otherwise this unfortunate transference of the title to hide was the cause of serious quarreling between the burbages and the braynes and finally led to much litigation footnote 73 wallace op cit p 103 in 1582 a more immediate disaster threatened the owners of the theatre one edmund peckham laid claim to the land on which the playhouse had been built and brought suit against alleyn for recovery more than that peckham tried to take actual possession of the playhouse so that burbage was fain to find men at his own charge to keep the possession thereof from the said peckham and his servants and was even once in danger of his own life by keeping possession thereof as a result of this state of affairs burbage was much disturbed and troubled in his possession of the theatre and could not quietly and peaceably enjoy the same and therefore the players forsook the said theatre to his great loss74 in order to reimburse himself in some measure for this loss burbage retained 30 of the rental due to alleyn the act led to a bitter quarrel with alleyn and figured conspicuously in the subsequent litigation that came near overwhelming the theatre footnote 74 see wallace op cit pp 201 239 240 242 in 1585 burbage having spent the stipulated 200 in repairing and rebuilding the tenements on the premises sought to renew the lease according to the original agreement for the extended period of twentyone years on november 20 1585 he engaged three skilled workmen to view the buildings and estimate the sum he had disbursed in improvements they signed a formal statement to the effect that in their opinion at least 220 had been thus expended on the premises burbage then tendered unto the said alleyn a new lease devised by his counsel ready written and engrossed with labels and wax thereunto affixed agreeable to the covenant but alleyn refused to sign the document he maintained that the new lease was not a verbatim copy of the old lease that 200 had not been expended on the buildings and that burbage was a bad tenant and owed him rent in reality alleyn wanted to extort a larger rental than 14 for the property which had greatly increased in value on july 18 1586 burbage engaged six men all expert laborers to view the buildings again and estimate the cost of the improvements they expressed the opinion in writing that burbage had expended at least 240 in developing the property75 still alleyn refused to sign an extension of the lease his conduct must have been very exasperating to the owner of the theatre cuthbert burbage tells us that his father did often in gentle manner solicit and require the said gyles alleyn for making a new lease of the said premises according to the purporte and effect of the said covenant but invariably alleyn found some excuse for delay footnote 75 wallace op cit pp 229 234 228 233 the death of brayne in august 1586 led john hide who by reason of the defaulted mortgage was legally the owner of the theatre to redouble his efforts to collect his debt he gave it out in speech that he had set over and assigned the said lease and bonds to one george clough his fatherinlaw but in truth he did not so and the said clough his fatherinlaw did go about to put the said defendant burbage out of the theatre or at least did threaten to put him out as we have seen there was a clause in the mortgage which prevented hide from ejecting burbage76 yet clough was able to make so much trouble divers and sundry times visiting the theatre that at last burbage undertook to settle the debt out of the profits of the playhouse as robert myles deposed in 1592 burbage allowed the widow of brayne for a certain time to take and receive the onehalf of the profits of the galleries of the said theatre then on a sudden he would not suffer her to receive any more of the profits there saying that he must take and receive all till he had paid the debts and then she was constrained as his servant to gather the money and to deliver it unto him77 footnote 76 wallace op cit p 55 footnote 77 ibid p 105 for some reason however the debt was not settled and hide continued his futile demands several times burbage offered to pay the sum in full if the title of the theatre were made over to his son cuthbert burbage and braynes widow made similar offers in an endeavor to gain the entire property for herself but hide who seems to have been an honest man always declared that since burbage and brayne did jointly mortgage it unto him he was honorbound to assign the property back to burbage and the widow of brayne jointly so matters stood for a while at last however in 1589 hide declared that since he had forborne his money so long he could do it no more so as they that came first should have it of him thereupon cuthbert burbage came bringing not only the money in hand but also a letter from his master and patron walter cape gentleman usher to the lord high treasurer requesting hide to make over the theatre to cuthbert and promising in return to assist hide with the lord treasurer when occasion arose under this pressure hide accepted full payment of his mortgage and made over the title of the property to cuthbert burbage thus braynes widow was legally excluded from any share in the ownership of the theatre myles deposed in 1592 that henceforth burbage would not suffer her to meddle in the premises but thrust her out of all this led at once to a suit in which robert myles acted for the widow he received an order from the court of chancery in her favor and armed with this and accompanied by two other persons he came on november 16 1590 to burbages dwelling house near the theatre called to the door cuthbert burbage and in rude and exclamable sort demanded the moiety of the said theatre james burbage being within the house hearing a noise at the door went to the door and there found his son the said cuthbert and the said myles speaking loud together words were bandied until finally burbage dared by the same myles with great threats and words that he would do this and could do that lost his temper and threatened to beat myles off the ground78 footnote 78 wallace op cit pp 57 60 62 next the widow attended by robert myles and others visited the home of the burbages to require them to perform the said award of the court they were met by james burbages wife who charged them to go out of her grounds or else she would make her son break their knaves heads aroused by this noise james burbage her husband looking out a window upon them called the complainant widow brayne murdering whore and the others villaines rascals and knaves and when mistress brayne spoke of the order of the court he cryed unto her go go a cart a cart for you i will obey no such order nor i care not for any such orders and therefore it were best for you and your companions to be packing betimes for if my son cuthbert come he will thump you hence just then cuthbert did come home and in very hot sort bid them get thence or else he would set them forwards saying i care for no such order the chancery shall not give away what i have paid for and so after great and horrible oathes by james burbage and his son the widow and her attendants went their ways79 footnote 79 ibid p 121 receiving thus no satisfaction from these visits to the home of james burbage the widow and robert myles came several times to the theatre bearing the order of the court in their hands but each time they were railed upon and driven out finally the widow with her everfaithful adjutant robert myles his son ralph and his business partner nicholas bishop went to the theatre upon a playday to stand at the door that goeth up to the galleries of the said theatre to take and receive for the use of the said margaret half of the money that should be given to come up into the said gallery in the theatre they were met by richard burbage then about nineteen years old and his mother who fell upon the said robert myles and beat him with a broom staff calling him murdering knave when myless partner bishop ventured to protest at this contemptuous treatment of the order of the court the said richard burbage so bishop deposed scornfully and disdainfully playing with this deponents nose said that if he dealt in the matter he would beat him also and did challenge the field of him at that time one of the actors then coming in john alleynbrother of the immortal edward alleynfound the foresaid richard burbage the youngest son of the said james burbage there with a broom staff in his hand of whom when this deponent alleyn asked what stir was there he answered in laughing phrase how they came for a moiety but quod he holding up the said broom staff i have i think delivered him a moiety with this and sent them packing alleyn thereupon warned the burbages that myles could bring an action of assault and battery against them tush quod the father no i warrant you but where my son hath now beat him hence my sons if they will be ruled by me shall at their next coming provide charged pistols with powder and hempseed to shoot them in the legs80 footnote 80 wallace op cit pp 63 97 100 101 114 but if the burbages could laugh at the efforts of myles and the widow to secure a moiety of the theatre from cuthbert they were seriously troubled by the continued refusal of gyles alleyn to renew the lease james burbage many times urged his landlord to fulfill the original agreement but in vain at last alleyn according to his own will and discretion did cause a draft of a lease to be drawn wherein were inserted many unreasonable covenants the new conditions imposed by alleyn were 1 that burbage should pay a rental of 24 instead of 14 a year 2 that he should use the theatre as a place for acting for only five years after the expiration of the original twentyoneyear lease and should then convert the building to other uses 3 that he should ultimately leave the building in the possession of alleyn81 the first and third conditions though unjust burbage was willing to accept but the second conditionthat he should cease to use the theatre for playshe utterly refused to consider footnote 81 see wallace op cit pp 195 212 216 250 258 et al finally perceiving that it was useless to deal further with alleyn he made plans to secure a new playhouse in the district of blackfriars a district which although within the city walls was not under the jurisdiction of the city authorities he purchased there the old blackfriars refectory for 600 and then at great expense made the refectory into a playhouse but certain influential noblemen and others living near by protested against this and the privy council ordered that the building should not be used as a public playhouse all this belongs mainly to the history of the second blackfriars playhouse and for further details the reader is referred to the chapter dealing with that theatre shortly after the order of the privy council cited above burbage died just two months before the expiration of his lease from alleyn and the theatre with all its troubles passed to his son cuthbert by every means in his power cuthbert sought to induce alleyn to renew the lease your said subject was thereof possessed and being so possessed your said servant did often require the said alleyn and sara his wife to make unto him the said new lease of the premises according to the agreement of the said indenture cuthberts importunity in the matter is clearly set forth in a deposition by henry johnson one of alleyns tenants it was alleyns custom to come to london at each of the four pay terms of the year and stop at the george inn in shoreditch to receive his rents and on such occasions johnson often observed cuthberts entreaties with alleyn in his deposition he says that he knoweth that the said complainant cuthbert burbage hath many times labored and entreated the defendant gyles alleyn to make him a new lease of the premises in question for this deponent sayeth that many times when the defendant hath come up to london to receive his rents he this deponent hath been with him paying him certain rent and then he hath seen the plaintiff with his landlord paying his rent likewise and then finding opportunity the plaintiff would be intreating the defendant to make him a new lease of the premises in question and sayeth that it is at least three years since ie in 1597 he this deponent first heard the plaintiff labor and entreat the defendant for a new lease82 cuthbert tells us that alleyn did not positively refuse to renew the lease but for some causes which he feigned did defer the same from time to time but yet gave hope to your subject and affirmed that he would make him such a lease83 footnote 82 wallace op cit p 246 footnote 83 ibid p 184 cuthberts anxiety in this matter is explained by the fact that the old lease gave him the right to tear down the theatre and carry away the timber and other materials to his own use provided he did so before the expiration of the twentyone years yet relying on alleyns promises to renew the lease he did forbear to pull downe and carry away the timber and stuff employed for the said theatre and playinghouse at the end of the said first term of one and twenty years a failure to renew the lease would mean of course the loss of the building alleyn though deferring to sign a new lease allowed burbage to continue in possession of the property at the old rent of 14 yet the theatre seems not to have been used for plays after the original lease expired84 the lord chamberlains company which had been occupying the theatre and of which richard burbage was the chief actor had moved to the curtain and the author of skialetheia printed in 1598 refers to the old playhouse as empty but see yonder one like the unfrequented theatre walks in dark silence and vast solitude85 footnote 84 the lease expired on april 13 1597 on july 28 the privy council closed all playhouses until november the references to the theatre in the remembrancia see the malone societys collections i 78 do not necessarily imply that the building was then actually used by the players footnote 85 the same fact is revealed in the authors remark if my dispose persuade me to a play ile to the rose or curtain for at this time only the chamberlains men and the admirals men were allowed to play to cuthbert burbage such a state of affairs was intolerable and on september 29 1598 he made a new appeal to alleyn alleyn proffered a lease already drawn up but cuthbert would not accept thereof because of the very unreasonable covenants therein contained86 footnote 86 wallace op cit pp 216 249 shortly after this fruitless interview or late in 1598 gyles alleyn resolved to take advantage of the fact that cuthbert burbage had not removed the theatre before the expiration of the first twentyone years he contended that since cuthbert had suffered the same there to continue till the expiration of the said term the right and interest of the said theatre was both in law and conscience absolutely vested now in himself accordingly he planned to pull down the same and to convert the wood and timber thereof to some better use for the benefit of himself87 footnote 87 ibid pp 277 288 but unfortunately for alleyn cuthbert burbage got intelligence of this purpose and at once set himself to the task of saving his property he and his brother richard the great actor took into their confidence the chief members of the lord chamberlains company then performing at the curtain playhouse namely william shakespeare john heminges augustine phillips thomas pope and william kempe these men agreed to form with the burbages a syndicate to finance the erection of a new playhouse the two burbages agreed to bear onehalf the expense including the timber and other materials of the old theatre and the five actors promised to supply the other half together they leased a suitable plot of land on the bankside near henslowes rose the lease dating from december 25 1598 these details having been arranged it remained only for the burbages to save their building from the covetousness of alleyn on the night of december 28 159888 alleyn being absent in the country cuthbert burbage his brother richard his friend william smith of waltham cross in the county of hartford gentleman peter street cheefe carpenter and twelve others described as laborers such as wrought for wages gathered at the theatre and began to tear down the building we learn that the widow of james burbage was there and did see the doing thereof and liked well of it89 and we may suspect that at some time during the day shakespeare and the other actors were present as interested spectators footnote 88 the date january 20 1599 seems to be an error footnote 89 wallace op cit p 238 the episode is thus vividly described by the indignant gyles allen the said cuthbert burbage having intelligence of your subjects purpose herein and unlawfully combining and confederating himself with the said richard burbage and one peter street william smith and diverse other persons to the number of twelve to your subject unknown did about the eight and twentieth day of december in the one and fortieth year of your highness reign and sithence your highness last and general pardon by the confederacy aforesaid riotously assembled themselves together and then and there armed themselves with diverse and many unlawful and offensive weapons as namely swords daggers bills axes and such like and so armed did then repair unto the said theatre and then and there armed as aforesaid in very riotous outrageous and forceable manner and contrary to the laws of your highness realm attempted to pull down the said theatre whereupon diverse of your subjects servants and farmers then going about in peaceable manner to procure them to desist from that unlawful enterprise they the said riotous persons aforesaid notwithstanding procured then therein with great violence not only then and there forcibly and riotously resisting your subjects servants and farmers but also then and there pulling breaking and throwing down the said theatre in very outrageous violent and riotous sort90 footnote 90 wallace op cit pp 27879 this document was discovered by jo halliwellphillipps who printed extracts in his outlines see also ordish early london theatres pp 7576 the workmen under the expert direction of peter street carried the timber and other materials of the old theatre to the tract of land on the bankside recently leased by the new syndicateas gyles alleyn puts it did then also in most forcible and riotous manner take and carry away from thence all the wood and timber thereof unto the bankside in the parish of st mary overies and there erected a new playhouse with the said timber and wood the playhouse thus erected was of course an entirely new structure nearly a quarter of a century had elapsed since james burbage designed the old theatre during which time a great development had taken place both in histrionic art and in play writing and no doubt many improvements were possible in the stage and in the auditorium to provide better facilities for the actors and greater comfort for the spectators in designing such improvements the architect had the advice and help of the actors including shakespeare and he succeeded in producing a playhouse that was a model of excellence the name selected by the syndicate for their new building was the globe for further details as to its construction and for its subsequent history the reader is referred to the chapter dealing with that building when gyles alleyn learned that the burbages had demolished the theatre and removed the timber to the bankside he was deeply incensed not only at the loss of the building but also no doubt at being completely outwitted at once he instituted suit against cuthbert burbage but he was so intemperate in his language and so reckless in his charges that he weakened his case the suit dragged for a few years was in part referred to francis bacon and finally in the summer of 1601 was dismissed thus the history of the first london playhouse which is chiefly the history of quarrels and litigation came to a close it is not possible now to indicate exactly the stay of the different troupes at the theatre the evidence is scattered and incomplete and the inferences to be drawn are often uncertain when the building was opened in 1576 it was no doubt occupied by the earl of leicesters troupe of which burbage was the manager and for which presumably the structure had been designed yet other troupes of players may also have been allowed to use the buildingwhen leicesters men were touring the provinces or possibly on days when leicesters men did not act this arrangement lasted about six years in 1582 the use of the theatre was interrupted by the interference of peckham for a long time the actors could not enjoy the premises and burbage was forced to keep peckhams servants out of the building with an armed guard night and day as a result of this state of affairs leicesters troupe was dissolved many of the players we are told were driven away and the rest forsook the said theatre the last notice of these famous players is a record of their performance at court on february 10 1583 shortly after this in march 1583 tilney the master of the revels organized under royal patronage a new company called the queens men for this purpose he selected twelve of the best actors of the realm including some of the members of leicesters company91 the two bestknown actors in the new organization were the queens favorite comedian richard tarleton the immortal lord of mirth and john lanham the leader and apparently the manager of the troupe james burbage who may by this time if not before have retired from acting was not included footnote 91 for a list of the queens men see wallace op cit p 11 the newly organized queens men in all probability occupied the theatre which had been left vacant by the dissolution of leicesters company mr wallace denies this mainly on the evidence of a permit issued by the lord mayor november 28 1583 granting the queens men the privilege of acting at the sign of the bull inn in bishopgate street and the sign of the bell inn in gracious street and nowhere else within this city but this permit i think lends scant support to mr wallaces contention the lord mayor had no authority to issue a license for the queens men to play at the theatre for that structure was outside the jurisdiction of the city the privy council itself no doubt had issued such a general license when the company was organized under royal patronage92 and now ten months later on november 26 1583 the council sends to the lord mayor a request that her majestys players may be suffered to play within the city and liberties between this and shrovetide next93in other words during the winter season when access to the theatre was difficult it was customary for troupes to seek permission to act within the city during the winter months94 thus the queens men in a petition written probably in the autumn of the following year 1584 requested the privy council to dispatch favorable letters unto the lord mayor of london to permit us to exercise within the city and the lord mayor refused with the significant remark that if in winter the foulness of season do hinder the passage into the fields to play the remedy is ill conceived to bring them into london95 obviously the queens men were seeking permission to play in the city only during the cold winter months during the balmy spring summer and autumn monthsfor actors the best season of the yearthey occupied their commodious playhouse in the fields footnote 92 such a license would include also permission to act in the provinces this latter was soon needed for shortly after their organization the queens men were driven by the plague to tour the provinces they were in cambridge on july 9 and probably returned to london shortly after see murray english dramatic companies i 8 footnote 93 the malone societys collections i 66 footnote 94 lord hunsdon on october 8 1594 requested the lord mayor to permit the chamberlains men to play this winter time within the city at the cross keys in gracious street see the malone societys collections i 67 footnote 95 the malone societys collections i 170 172 that this playhouse for a time at least was the theatre is indicated by several bits of evidence thus the author of martins months mind 1589 speaks of twittletwattles that i had learned in alehouses and at the theatre of lanham and his fellows again nash in pierce penniless 1592 writes tarleton at the theatre made jests of him harrington in the metamorphosis of ajax 1596 which word was after admitted into the theatre with great applause by the mouth of master tarleton and the author of tarltons newes out of purgatory c 1589 represents tarleton as connected with the theatre now unless lanham tarleton and their fellows usually or sometimes acted at the theatre it is hard to understand these and other similar passages the following episode tends to prove the same thing on june 18 1584 william fleetwood recorder wrote to lord burghley96 right honorable and my very good lord upon whitsunday there was a very good sermon preached at the new churchyard near bethelem whereat my lord mayor was with his brethren and by reason no plays were the same day all the city was quiet upon monday i was at the court that night i returned to london and found all the wards full of watchers the cause thereof was for that very near the theatre or curtain at the time of the plays there lay a prentice sleeping upon the grass and one challes at grostock did turn upon the toe upon the belly of the same prentice whereupon the apprentice start up footnote 96 the letter is printed in full in the malone societys collections i 164 in the altercation that followed challes remarked that prentices were but the scum of the world this led to a general rising of apprentices and much disorder throughout the city fleetwood records the upshot thus upon sunday my lord mayor sent two aldermen to the court for the suppressing and pulling down of the theatre and curtain all the lords of the privy council agreed thereunto saving my lord chamberlain and mr vicechamberlain but we obtained a letter to suppress them all upon the same night i sent for the queens players at the theatre and my lord arundels players at the curtain and they all willingly obeyed the lordss letters the chiefest of her highnesss players advised me to send for the owner of the theatre james burbage97 who was a stubborn fellow and to bind him i did so he sent me word he was my lord of hundsons man and that he would not come at me but he would in the morning ride to my lord footnote 97 this could not have been hide as usually stated hide had nothing to do with the management of the theatre and was not my lord of hunsdons man hides connection with the theatre as sketched in this chapter shows the absurdity of such an interpretation of the document the natural inference from all this is that the queens men and lord arundels men were then playing outside the city where they could be controlled only by the lordss letters that the queens men were occupying the theatre and that james burbage was as we know not a member of that company but merely stood to them in the relation of owner of the theatre what burbage meant by calling himself my lord of hunsdons man is not clear mr wallace contends that when leicesters men were dissolved burbage organized around the remnants of leicesters company a troupe under the patronage of lord hunsdon and that this troupe and not the queens men occupied the theatre thereafter98 but we hear of hunsdons men at ludlow in july 1582 and we find them presenting a play at court on december 27 1582 since leicesters troupe is recorded as acting at court as late as february 10 1583 it seems unlikely that mr wallaces theory as to the origin of hunsdons men is true it may be however that after the dissolution of leicesters men burbage associated himself with hunsdons men and it may be that he allowed that relatively unimportant company to occupy the theatre for a short time hunsdons men seem to have been mainly a traveling troupe mr murray states that notices of them occur frequently in the provinces but we hear almost nothing of them in london indeed at the time of the trouble described by fleetwood hunsdons men were in bath99 if burbage was a member of the troupe he certainly did not accompany them on their extended tours and when they played in london if they used the theatre they must have used it jointly with the queens men footnote 98 wallace op cit p 11 footnote 99 murray english dramatic companies i 321 late in 1585 the theatre was affiliated with the adjacent curtain burbage and brayne made an agreement with the proprietor of that playhouse whereby the curtain might be used as an easore easer to the theatre and the profits of the said two playhouses might for seven years space be in divident between them this agreement we know was carried out but whether it led to an exchange of companies or what effect it had upon the players we cannot say possibly to this period of joint management may be assigned the witticism of dick tarleton recorded as having been uttered at the curtain where the queens men were then playing100 it may even be that as one result of the affiliation of the two houses the queens men were transferred to the curtain footnote 100 tarltons jests ed by jo halliwell p 16 tarleton died in 1588 in 1590 as we learn from the deposition of john alleyn the theatre was being used by the admirals men101 this excellent company had been formed early in 1589 by the separation of certain leading players from worcesters men and it had probably occupied the theatre since its organization its star actor edward alleyn was then at the height of his powers and was producing with great success marlowes splendid plays we may suppose that the following passage refers to the performance of the admirals men at the theatre he had a head of hair like one of my devils in dr faustus when the old theatre crackt and frightened the audience102 footnote 101 wallace op cit pp 101 126 footnote 102 the black booke 1604 late in 1590 the admirals men seem to have been on bad terms with burbage103 and when john alleyn made his deposition february 6 1592 they had certainly left the theatre mr greg from entirely different evidence has concluded that they were dispersed in 1591104 and this conclusion is borne out by the legal document cited above footnote 103 wallace op cit p 101 footnote 104 greg henslowes diary ii 83 the admirals men were reorganized in 1594 and occupied the rose under henslowes management the next company that we can definitely associate with the theatre was the famous lord chamberlains men on april 16 1594 lord strange the earl of derby died and the chief members of his troupewilliam shakespeare richard burbage john heminges william kempe thomas pope george bryan and augustine phillipsorganized a new company under the patronage of the lord chamberlain for ten days in june 1594 they acted at newington butts under the management of philip henslowe then went probably at once to the theatre which they made their home until the burbage lease of the property expired in the spring of 1597 here among other famous plays they produced the original hamlet thus referred to by lodge in wits miserie 1596 he looks as pale as the visard of the ghost which cries so miserably at the theatre like an oysterwife hamlet revenge and here too they presented all of shakespeares early masterpieces their connection with the building ceased in 1597 at the expiration of the burbage lease but their association with the proprietors of the theatre was permanent their subsequent history as also the history of the burbage brothers will be found in the chapters dealing with the globe

to london thus with that i waked and saw such concourse of people through the fields that i knew the play was done107 footnote 106 the site is probably marked by curtain court in chasseraus survey of 1745 reproduced on page 79 footnote 107 ed by jo halliwell for the shakespeare society 1844 p 105 the new playhouse derived its name from the curtain estate on which it was erected108 this estate was formerly the property of the priory of holywell and was described in 1538 as scituata et existentia extra portas ejusdem nuper monasterii prope pasturam dicte nuper priorisse vocatam the curteine109 why it was so called is not clear the name may have been derived from some previous owner of the property it may as collier thought have come from some early association with the walls curtains or defenses of the city or it may have come as tomlins suggests from the medival latin cortina meaning a court a close a farm enclosure110 whatever its originthe last explanation seems the most plausiblethe interesting point is that it had no connection whatever with a stage curtain footnote 108 the rose and the red bull derived their names in a similar way from the estates on which they were erected footnote 109 halliwellphillipps outlines i 364 footnote 110 tomlins origin of the curtain theatre and mistakes regarding it in the shakespeare societys papers 1844 p 29 the building was probably opened to the london public in the summer or autumn of 1577 the first reference to it is found in thomas whites sermon preached at pawles crosse on sunday the thirde of november 1577 behold the sumptuous theatre houses a continual monument of londons prodigality and folly111 and a reference to it by name appears in northbrookes a treatise licensed december 1577 those places also which are made up and builded for such plays and interludes as the theatre and curtain112 footnote 111 jd wilson the cambridge history of english literature vi 435 says that this sermon was delivered at pauls cross on 9 december 1576 and apparently repeated on 3 november in the following year this is incorrect white did preach a sermon at pauls cross on december 9 but not the sermon from which this quotation is drawn footnote 112 ed by jp collier for the shakespeare society 1843 p 85 like the theatre the curtain was a peculiarly shaped building specially designed for acting those playhouses that are erected and built only for such purposes namely the curtain and the theatre113 writes the privy council and the german traveler samuel kiechel who visited london in 1585 describes them as sonderbare structures they are usually mentioned together and in such a way as to suggest similarity of shape as well as of purpose we may i think reasonably suppose that the curtain was in all essential details a copy of burbages theatre114 presumably then it was polygonal or circular in shape115 was constructed of timber and was finished on the outside with lime and plaster the interior as the evidence already cited in the chapter on the theatre shows consisted of three galleries surrounding an open yard there was a platform projecting into the middle of the yard with dressingrooms at the rear heavens overhead and a flagpole rising above the heavens that some sign was displayed in front of the door is likely malone writes the original sign hung out at this playhouse as mr steevens has observed was the painting of a curtain striped116 aubrey records that ben jonson acted and wrote but both ill at the green curtain a kind of nursery or obscure playhouse somewhere in the suburbs i think towards shoreditch or clerkenwell117 by at the green curtain aubrey means of course at the sign of the green curtain but the evidence of steevens and of aubrey is too vague and uncertain to warrant any definite conclusions footnote 113 dasent acts of the privy council xxvii 313 footnote 114 it seems however to have been smaller than the theatre footnote 115 johannes de witt describes the theatre and the curtain along with the swan and the rose as amphitheatra see page 167 it is quite possible that shakespeare refers to the curtain in the prologue to henry v as this wooden o though the reference may be to the globe footnote 116 malone variorum iii 54 cf also ellis the parish of st leonard footnote 117 did steevens base his statement on this passage in aubrey of the early history of the curtain we know little mainly because it was not like certain other playhouses the subject of extensive litigation we do not even know who planned and built it the first evidence of its ownership appears fifteen years after its erection in some legal documents connected with the theatre118 in july 1592 henry lanman described as of london gentleman of the age of 54 years deposed that true it is about 7 years now shall be this next winter they the said burbage and brayne having the profits of plays made at the theatre and this deponent having the profits of the plays done at the house called the curtain near to the same the said burbage and brayne taking the curtain as an esore119 to their playhouse did of their own motion move this deponent that he would agree that the profits of the said two playhouses might for seven years space be in divident between them120 footnote 118 brayne v burbage 1592 printed in full by wallace the first london theatre pp 10952 see especially pp 126 148 footnote 119 easer footnote 120 wallace op cit p 148 cf p 126 illustration the site of the curtain playhouse from an actual survey of the parish of st leonard in shoreditch taken in the year 1745 by peter chasserau surveyor the key to the map gives 93 as curtain court probably the site of the old playhouse 87 as new inn yard and 94 as holywell court both interesting in connection with burbages theatre redrawn from the original for this volume from this statement it is evident that henry lanman was the sole proprietor of the curtain as far back as 1585 and the presumption is that his proprietorship was of still earlier date this presumption is strengthened by the fact that in a sale of the curtain estate early in 1582 he is specifically mentioned as having a tenure of an edifice or building erected in the curtain close that is that section of the estate next to the field on which the playhouse was built121 since lanman is not mentioned as having any other property on the estate the edifice or building referred to was probably the playhouse the document gives no indication as to how long he had held possession of the edifice but the date of sale march 1582 carries us back to within four years of the erection of the curtain and it seems reasonable to suppose though of course we cannot be sure that lanman had been proprietor of the building from the very beginning122 footnote 121 tomlins op cit pp 2931 footnote 122 of this henry lanman we know nothing beyond the facts here revealed possibly he was a brother of the distinguished actor john lanman the name is variously spelled lanman laneman lenmann laneham laynman lanham one of the chief members of leicesters troupe and one of the twelve men selected in 1583 to form the queens men but speculation of this sort is vain it is to be hoped that in the future some student will investigate the life of this obscure theatrical manager and trace his connection with the early history of the drama certain records of the sale of the curtain estate shortly before and shortly after the erection of the playhouse are preserved but these throw very little light upon the playhouse itself we learn that on february 20 1567 lord mountjoy and his wife sold the estate to maurice longe clothworker and his son william longe for the sum of 60 and that on august 23 1571 maurice longe and his wife sold it to the then lord mayor sir william allyn for the sum of 200 in both documents the property is described in the same words all that house tenement or lodge commonly called the curtain and all that parcel of ground and close walled and enclosed with a brick wall on the west and north parts called also the curtain close the lodge here referred to generally known as curtain house was on or very near holywell lane123 the playhouse as already stated was erected in the close near the field124 footnote 123 halliwellphillipps outlines i 365 footnote 124 the privy council on march 10 1601 refers to it as the curtaine in moorefeildes in ancient times says stow moorefields extended to holywell see halliwellphillipps outlines i 364 how long sir william allyn held the property or why it reverted to the longe family we do not know but on march 18 1582 we find william longe the son of maurice longe citizen and clothworker of london deceased selling the same property described in the same words to one thomas harberte citizen and girdler of london in the meantime of course the playhouse had been erected but no clear or direct mention of the building is made in the deed of sale possibly it was included in the conventionally worded phrase and all and singular other messuages tenements edifices and buildings with all and singular their appurtenances erected and builded upon the said close called the curtain125 among the persons named as holding tenures of the abovementioned edifices and buildings in the close was henry lanman it seems not improbable therefore that the curtain like the theatre was erected on leased ground footnote 125 tomlins op cit p 31 it is impossible to give a connected history of the curtain most of the references to it that we now possess are invectives in early puritanical writings or bare mention along with other playhouses in letters or ordinances of the privy council and the lord mayor such references as these do not much help us in determining what companies successively occupied the building or what varying fortunes marked its ownership and management yet a few scattered facts have sifted down to us and these i have arranged in chronological order on the afternoon of april 6 1580 an earthquake especially severe in holywell shook the building during the performance of a play and greatly frightened the audience munday says merely at the playhouses the people came running forth surprised with great astonishment126 but stubbes the puritan who saw in the event a fearful judgment of god writes with fervor the like judgment almost did the lord show unto them a little before being assembled at their theatres to see their bawdy interludes and other trumperies practised for he caused the earth mightily to shake and quaver as though all would have fallen down whereat the people sore amazed some leapt down from the top of the turrets pinnacles and towers where they stood to the ground whereof some had their legs broke some their arms some their backs some hurt one where some another and many score crushed and bruised127 footnote 126 view of sundry examples 1580 footnote 127 the anatomy of abuses ed fj furnivall new shakspere society p 180 for other descriptions of this earthquake see halliwellphillipps outlines i 369 the disturbance at the theatre and the curtain in 1584 when one challes did turn upon the toe upon the belly of an apprentice sleeping upon the grass in the field near by has been mentioned in the preceding chapter if the interpretation of the facts there given is correct lord arundels players were then occupying the curtain in the winter of 1585 lanman entered into his seven years agreement with burbage and brayne by which the theatre and the curtain were placed under one management and the profits shared in divident between them this agreement was faithfully kept by both parties but there is no evidence that after the expiration of the seven years in the winter of 1592 the affiliation was continued what effect the arrangement had upon the companies of players occupying the two theatres we cannot now determine to this period however i would assign the appearance of the queens men at the curtain128 footnote 128 tarltons jests ed by jo halliwell for the shakespeare society 1844 p 16 for a discussion see the preceding chapter on the theatre p 72 on july 28 1597 as a result of the performance of thomas nashes the isle of dogs by pembrokes men at the swan129 the privy council ordered the plucking down of the curtain and the theatre130 the order however was not carried out and in october plays were allowed again as before footnote 129 for details see the chapter on the swan footnote 130 dasent acts of the privy council xxvii 313 at this time the lord chamberlains men were at the curtain having recently moved thither in consequence of the difficulties cuthbert burbage was having with gyles alleyn over the theatre property during the stay of the chamberlains company which numbered among its members william shakespeare richard burbage william kempe who had succeeded tarleton in popular favor as a clown john heminges thomas pope and augustine phillips the playhouse probably attained its greatest distinction both shakespeare and jonson wrote plays for the troupe romeo and juliet we are told won curtain plaudities as no doubt did many other of shakespeares early masterpieces and jonsons every man in his humour created such enthusiasm here on its first performance as to make its author famous131 footnote 131 marston the scourge of villainy 1598 bullen the works of john marston iii 372 in the summer of 1599 the chamberlains men moved into their splendid new home the globe on the bankside and the curtain thus abandoned fell on hard times perhaps it was let occasionally to traveling troupes in jeaffresons middlesex county records under the date of march 11 1600 is a notice of the arrest of one william haukins charged with a purse taken at a play at the curtain but shortly after in april 1600 when henslowe and alleyn began to erect their splendid new fortune playhouse they were able to give the impression to tilney the master of the revels and to the privy council that the curtain was to be torn down thus in the councils warrant for the building of the fortune dated april 8 1600 we read that another house is to be pulled down instead of it132 and when the puritans later made vigorous protests against the erection of the fortune the council defended itself by stating that their lordships have been informed by edmund tilney esquire her majestys servant and master of the revels that the house now in hand to be built by the said edward alleyn is not intended to increase the number of the playhouses but to be instead of another namely the curtain which is either to be ruined and plucked down or to be put to some other good use133 footnote 132 greg henslowe papers p 52 footnote 133 the malone societys collections i 82 all this talk of the curtains being plucked down or devoted to other uses suggests a contemplated change in the ownership or management of the building we do not know when lanman died in 1592 he described himself as fiftyfour years of age134 but we do know that at some date prior to 1603 the curtain had passed into the hands of a syndicate when this syndicate was organized or who constituted its members we cannot say thomas pope in his will dated july 22 1603 mentions his share of in and to all that playhouse with the appurtenances called the curtain135 and john underwood in his will dated october 4 1624 mentions his part or share in the said playhouses called the blackfriars the globe on the bankside and the curtain136 it may be significant that both pope and underwood were sharers also in the globe since however further information is wanting it is useless to speculate we can only say that at some time after the period of lanmans sole proprietorship the curtain passed into the hands of a group of sharers and that after a discussion in 1600 of demolishing the building or devoting it to other uses it entered upon a long and successful career footnote 134 wallace op cit p 148 footnote 135 jp collier lives of the original actors in shakespeares plays p 127 in exactly the same words pope disposed of his share in the globe footnote 136 ibid p 230 on may 10 1601 the actors at the curtain137 gave serious offense by representing on the stage persons of good desert and quality that are yet alive under obscure manner but yet in such sort as all the hearers may take notice both of the matter and the persons that are meant thereby the privy council ordered the justices of the peace to examine into the case and to punish the offenders138 footnote 137 possibly derbys men footnote

to act within their now usual houses called the curtain and the boars head140 on april 9 1604 the privy council authorized the three companies of players that had been taken under royal patronage to exercise their plays in their several and usual houses for that purpose and no other viz the globe scituate in maiden lane on the bankside in the county of surrey the fortune in golding lane and the curtain in holywell141 the kings men the burbageshakespeare troupe occupied the globe prince henrys men the henslowealleyn troupe the fortune and queen annes men the curtain footnote 139 the company was formed by an amalgamation of oxfords and worcesters men in 1602 see the malone societys collections i 85 footnote 140 the malone societys collections i 266 footnote 141 greg henslowe papers p 61 dasent acts of the privy council xxxii 511 but the queens men were probably dissatisfied with the curtain it was small and antiquated and it must have suffered by comparison with the more splendid globe and fortune so the queens players had built for themselves a new and larger playhouse called the red bull this was probably ready for occupancy in 1605 yet it is impossible to say exactly when the queens men left the curtain their patent of april 15 1609 gives them permission to act within their now usual houses called the red bull in clerkenwell and the curtain in holywell142 it may be that they retained control of the curtain in order to prevent competition footnote 142 the malone societys collections i 270 what company occupied the curtain after queen annes men finally surrendered it is not clear mr murray is of the opinion that prince charless men moved into the curtain about december 1609 or early in 1610143 footnote 143 english dramatic companies i 230 in 1613 a company of young men acted the hector of germany at the red bull and at the curtain such plays however written and acted by amateurs were not uncommon and no significance can be attached to the event in 1622 as we learn from the herbert manuscripts the curtain was being occupied by prince charless servants144 in the same year the author of vox graculi or the jack daws prognostication for 1623 refers to it thus if company come current to the bull and curtain there will be more money gathered in one afternoon than will be given to kingsland spittle in a whole month also if at this time about the hours of four and five it wax cloudy and then rain downright they shall sit dryer in the galleries than those who are the understanding men in the yard footnote 144 malone variorum iii 59 cf chalmerss supplemental apology p 213 note y murray gives the date incorrectly as 1623 prince charless men did not remain long at the curtain at some date between june 10 and august 19 1623 they moved to the larger and more handsome red bull145 after this so far as i can discover there is no evidence to connect the playhouse with dramatic performances malone who presumably bases his statements on the now lost records of herbert says that shortly after the accession of king charles i it seems to have been used only by prizefighters146 footnote 145 murray english dramatic companies i 237 note 1 footnote 146 malone variorum iii 54 note 2 the last mention of the curtain is found in the middlesex county records under the date february 21 1627147 it is merely a passing reference to the common shoare near the curtain playhouse yet it is significant as indicating that the building was then still standing what ultimately became of it we do not know for a time however its memory survived in curtain court see page 79 and today its fame is perpetuated in curtain road footnote 147 see jeaffreson middlesex county records iii 164 from which the notice was quoted by ordish early london theatres p 106 chapter v the first blackfriars the choir boys of the chapel royal of windsor and of pauls were all engaged in presenting dramatic entertainments before queen elizabeth each organization expected to be called upon one or more times a yearat christmas new years and other like occasionsto furnish recreation to her majesty and in return for its efforts each received a liberal reward in money richard farrant master of the windsor chapel was especially active in devising plays for the queens entertainment but having a large family he was poor in spite of his regular salary and the occasional rewards he received for the performances of his boys at court and doubtless he often cast about in his mind for some way in which to increase his meagre income in the spring of 1576 james burbage having conceived the idea of a building devoted solely to plays had leased a plot of ground for the purpose and had begun the erection of the theatre by the autumn no doubt the building was nearing completion if indeed it was not actually open to the public and the experiment we may suppose was exciting much interest in the dramatic circles of london it seems to have set farrant to thinking the professional actors he observed had one important advantage over the child actors not only could they present their plays before the queen and receive the usual court reward but in addition they could present their plays before the public and thus reap a second and richer harvest since the child actors had as a rule more excellent plays than the professional troupes and were better equipped with properties and costumes and since they expended just as much energy in devising plays and in memorizing and rehearsing their parts farrant saw no reason why they too should not be allowed to perform before the public this he thought might be done under the guise of rehearsals for the court possibly the queen might even wink at regular performances before the general public when she understood that this would train the boys to be more skilful actors would provide her majesty with more numerous and possibly more excellent plays and would enable the master and his assistants to live in greater comfort without affecting the royal purse illustration blackfriars monastery a plan of the various buildings as they appeared before the dissolution based on the loseley manuscripts and other documents surveys and maps the buttery became farrants the frater burbages playhouse drawn by the author for farrant to build a playhouse specifically for the use of the children was out of the question in the first place it would be too conspicuously a capitalization of the royal choristers for private gain and in the second place it would be far too hazardous a business venture for so poor a man as he to undertake the more sensible thing for him to do was to rent somewhere a large hall which could at small expense be converted into a place suitable for training the children in their plays and for the entertainment of selectpossibly at first invitedaudiences the performances of course were not to be heralded by a trumpetanddrum procession through the street by the flying of a flag and by suchlike vulgar advertising as of a public show instead they were to be quiet presumably private and were to attract only noblemen and those citizens of the better class who were interested in the drama148 footnote 148 from this notion of privacy i take it arose the term private theatre as distinguished from common or public theatre the interpretation of the term suggested by mr wj lawrence and approved by mr william archer namely that it was a legal device to escape the city ordinance of 1574 cannot be accepted the city had no jurisdiction over the precinct of blackfriars nor did farrant live in the building illustration the sites of the two blackfriars playhouses the smaller rectangle at the north represents the buttery later farrants playhouse the larger rectangle represents the frater later burbages playhouse from ogilby and morgans map of london 1677 the sites marked by the author such was farrants scheme in searching for a hall suitable for his purpose his mind at once turned to the precinct of blackfriars where in former years the office of the revels had been kept and where the children had often rehearsed their plays the precinct had once as the name indicates been in the possession of the dominican or black friars the priory buildings had consisted chiefly of a great church two hundred and twenty feet long and sixtysix feet broad with a cloister on the south side of the church forming a square of one hundred and ten feet and a smaller cloister to the south of this at the dissolution of the religious orders the property had passed into the possession of the crown hence though within the city walls it was not under the jurisdiction of the city authorities farrant probably did not anticipate any interference on the part of the common council with the royal choristers practicing their plays in order to yield her majesty recreation and delight yet the absolute certainty of being free from the adverse legislation of the london authorities was not to be ignored moreover the precinct was now the home of many noblemen and wealthy gentlemen and farrant probably thought that as one of the most fashionable residential districts in london it was suitable for private performances to be given by members of her majestys household in furthering his project he sought the counsel and aid of his very friend sir henry neville lieutenant of windsor who it is to be presumed was interested in the windsor boys it happened that neville knew of exactly such rooms as were desired rooms in the old monastery of blackfriars which he himself had once leased as a residence and which he heard were to be let either presently or very shortly these rooms were in the southwestern corner of the monastery on the upper floor of two adjoining buildings formerly used by the monks as a buttery and a frater a history of the rooms up to the time of their use as a theatre may be briefly sketched in 1548 the buttery and frater with certain other buildings were let by king edward to sir thomas cawarden master of the revels and in 1550 they were granted to him outright in 1554 cawarden sold the northern section of the buttery fiftytwo feet in length to lord cobham whose mansion it adjoined the rest of the buttery fortysix feet in length and the frater he converted into lodgings since the frater was of exceptional breadthfiftytwo feet on the outside fortysix feet on the insidehe ran a partition through its length dividing it into two parts the section of the frater on the west of this partition he let to sir richard frith the section on the east with the remainder of the buttery not sold to lord cobham he let to sir john cheeke it is with the cheeke lodgings that we are especially concerned about september 1554 cheeke went to travel abroad and surrendered his rooms in the blackfriars sir thomas cawarden thereupon made use of them for the office of the queens majestys revells thus for a time the cheeke lodgings were intimately connected with dramatic activities but at the death of cawarden in 1559 the queen transferred the office of the revels to st johns and the blackfriars property belonging to cawarden passed into the possession of sir william more illustration a plan of farrants playhouse friths lodging and the four southern rooms of farrants lodging were on the upper floor of the frater the two northern rooms of farrants lodging were on the upper floor of the buttery the playhouse was erected in the two rooms last mentioned in 1560 the new proprietor let the cheeke lodgings to sir henry neville with the addition of a void piece of ground eighteen feet wide extending west to water lane149 during his tenancy neville erected certain partitions built a kitchen in the void piece of ground and a large stairway leading to the rooms overhead in 1568 he surrendered his lease and more let the rooms first to some sylk dyers and then in 1571 to lord cobham in 1576 cobham gave up the rooms and more was seeking a tenant it was at this auspicious moment that farrant planned a private theatre and enlisted the aid of sir henry neville footnote 149 this was enclosed with brick walls and the greater part used as a woodyard this yard was later purchased by james burbage when he secured the frater for his playhouse the kitchen shed and stairs built on the eastern part were sold to cobham on august 27 farrant and neville separately wrote letters to sir william more about the matter farrant respectfully solicited the lease and made the significant request that he might pull down one partition and so make two roomsone neville in a friendly letter beginning with hearty commendations unto you and to mrs more and ending with light gossip urged sir william to let the rooms to farrant and recommended farrant as a desirable tenant i dare answer for him neither letter mentioned the purpose for which the rooms especially the large room referred to by farrant were to be used but more doubtless understood that the windsor children were to practice their plays there with occasional private rehearsals largely as a result of nevilles recommendation more decided to let the rooms to farrant the progress of the negotiations is marked by a letter from farrant to more dated september 17 1576 requesting that there be granted him also a certain little dark room which he found would be useful the lease as finally signed describes the property thus sir william more hath demised granted and to ferm letten and by these presents doth demise grant and to ferm let unto the said richard farrant all those his six upper chambers lofts lodgings or rooms lying together within the precinct of the late dissolved house or priory of the blackfriars otherwise called the friars preachers in london which said six upper chambers lofts lodgings or rooms were lately amongst others in the tenure and occupation of the right honourable sir william brooke knight lord cobham and do contain in length from the north end thereof to the south end of the same one hundred fifty and six foot and a half of assize whereof two of the said six upper chambers lofts lodgings or rooms in the north end of the premises together with the breadth of the little room under granted do contain in length forty150 and six foot and a half and from the east to the west part thereof in breadth twenty and five foot of assize151 and the four other chambers or rooms residue of the said six upper chambers do contain in length one hundred and ten foot and in breadth from the east to the west part thereof twentytwo foot of assize and also the great stairs lately erected and made by the said sir henry neville upon part of the said void ground and way footnote 150 by an error in the manuscript this reads fifty but the rooms are often described and always as fortysix feet in length moreover the error is made obvious by the rest of the lease footnote 151 the breadth is elsewhere given as twentysix and twentyseven feet it was agreed that the lease should run for twentyone years and that the rental should be 14 per annum but sir william more being a most careful and exacting landlord with the interest of his adjacent lodgings to care for inserted in the lease the following important proviso which was destined to make trouble and ultimately to wreck the theatre provided also that the said richard farrant his executors or assigns or any of them shall not in any wise demise let grant assign set over or by any ways or means put away his or their interest or term of years or any part of the same years of or in the said premises before letten or any part parcel or member thereof to any person or persons at any time hereafter during this present lease and term of twentyone years without the special license consent and agreement of the said sir william more his heirs and assigns first had and obtained in writing under his and their hands and seals the penalty affixed to a violation of this provision was the immediate forfeiture of the lease apparently farrant entered into possession of the rooms on september 29152 although the formal lease was not signed until december 20 and we may suppose that he at once set about converting the two upper rooms at the north end of the lodgings into a suitable theatre153 naturally he took for his model the halls at court in which the children had been accustomed to act first we are told he pulled down partitions to make that place apt for that purpose next he spoiled the windowsby which is meant no doubt that he stopped up the windows for the performances were to be by candlelight at one end of the hall he erected a platform to serve as a stage and in the auditorium he placed benches or chairs there was presumably no room for a gallery if such had been erected the indignant more would certainly have mentioned it in his bill of complaints154 chandeliers over the stage and possibly footlights completed the necessary arrangements for these alterations farrant we are told became greatly indebted and he died three or four years later with the debt still unpaid more complained that the alterations had put the rooms into a state of great ruin which meant of course from the point of view of a landlord desiring to let them again for residential purposes just how costly or how extensive the alterations were we cannot now determine but we may reasonably conclude that farrant made the hall not only commodious for his purpose but also attractive to the aristocratic audiences he intended to gather there to see his plays footnote 152 the date from which the lease was made to run footnote 153 it is usually said that he converted the entire seven rooms into his theatre but that seems highly unlikely the northern section was 46 x 26 feet the southern section 110 x 22absurd dimensions for an auditorium moreover that farrant originally planned to use only the northern section is indicated by his request to be allowed to pull down one partition and so make two roomsone the portion not used for the playhouse he rented in 1580 we are told he let two parcels thereof to two several persons footnote 154 m feuillerat i think is wrong in supposing that there was a gallery he deduces no proof for his contention and the evidence is against him to reach the hall playgoers had to come first into water lane thence through a way leading from the said way called water lane to a certain void ground before the building here upon part of the said void ground they found a great stairs which said great stairs do serve and lead into the upper roomsor as we may now say blackfriars playhouse155 footnote 155 there must have been two stairways leading to the upper rooms i have assumed that playgoers used nevilles stairs to reach the theatre having thus provided a playhouse farrant next provided an adequate company of boy actors to do this he combined the children of windsor with the children of the chapel royal of which william hunnis was master what arrangement he made with hunnis we do not know but the court records show that farrant was regarded as the manager of the new organization he is actually referred to in the payments as master of the children of her majestys chapel and hunniss official connection with the children is ignored farrant may have been able to open his playhouse before the close of the year or he may have first begun performances there in the early months of 1577 he would certainly be anxious to make use of the new play he was preparing for presentation at court on twelfth day january 6 1577 for four years 15761580 the playhouse was operated without trouble sir william more however was not pleased at the success with which the actors were meeting he asserted that when he made the lease he was given to understand that the building was to be used only for the teaching of the children of the chapelwith no doubt a few rehearsals to which certain persons would be privately invited but now to his grief he discovered that farrant had made it a continual house for plays he asserted that the playhouse had become offensive to the precinct and doubtless some complaints had been made to him as landlord by the more aristocratic inhabitants156 at any rate he became anxious to regain possession of the building footnote 156 i suspect that the theatre gave greater offense to more himself than it did to any one else for it adjoined his home and the audience made use of the private passage which led from water lane to his mansion unquestionably he suffered worse than any one else both from the noise and the crowds in the autumn of 1580 he saw an opportunity to break the lease and close the playhouse farrant made the mistake of letting two parcels thereof to two severall persons without first gaining the written consent of more and at once more charged him with forfeiture of his lease but before more could take remedy against him farrant died november 30 1580 more however entered upon the house and refused to receive any rent but conditionally by his will proved march 1 1581 farrant left the lease of the blackfriars to his widow anne farrant but she had no authority over the royal choristers nor was she qualified to manage a company of actors even if she had had the time to do so after caring for her ten little ones what use if any was made of the playhouse during the succeeding winter we do not know the widow writes that she being a sole woman unable of herself to use the said rooms to such purpose as her said husband late used them nor having any need or occasion to occupy them to such commodity as would discharge the rents due for the said rooms in the bill alledged nor being able to sustain repair and amend the said rooms etc157 the natural inference from which is that for a time the playhouse stood unused the widow of course was anxious to sublet the building to some one who could make use of it as a playhouse and on december 25 1580 she addressed a letter to sir william more asking his written permission to make such a disposal of the lease the letter has a pathetic interest that justifies its insertion here to the right worshipful sir william more knight at his house near guilford give these with speed right worshipful sir after my humble commendations and my duty also rememberedwhere it hath pleased your worship to grant unto my husband in his life time one lease of your house within the blackfriars for the term of twentyone years with a proviso in the end thereof that he cannot neither let nor set the same without your worships consent under your hand in writing and now for that it hath pleased god to call my said husband unto his mercy having left behind him the charge of ten small children upon my hand and my husband besides greatly indebted not having the revenue of one groat any way coming in but by making the best i may of such things as he hath left behind him to relieve my little ones may it therefore please your worship of your abundant clemency and accustomed goodness to consider a poor widows distressed estate and for gods cause to comfort her with your worships warrant under your hand to let and set the same to my best comodity during the term of years in the said lease contained not doing any waste in all which doing i shall evermore most abundantly pray unto god for the preservation of your worships long continuance from grenwich the twentyfifth of december by a poor and sorrowful widow anne farrant158 footnote 157 wallace the evolution of the english drama p 163 footnote 158 wallace the evolution of the english drama p 153 whether she secured in writing the permission she requested we do not know four years later more said that she did not possibly however she was orally given to understand that she might transfer the lease to her husbands former partner in the enterprise william hunnis159 hunnis naturally was eager to make use of the building in preparation for the christmas plays at court at some date before september 19 he secured the use of the playhouse on a temporary agreement with the widow but in order to avoid any difficulty with more he interviewed the latter and presented a letter of recommendation from the earl of leicester this letter has been preserved among sir williams papers sir william more whereas my friend mr hunnis this bearer informeth me that he hath of late bought of farrants widow her lease of that house in blackfriars which you made to her husband deceased and means there to practice the queens children of the chapel being now in his charge in like sort as his predecessor did for the better training them to do her majestys service he is now a suitor to me to recommend him to your good favourwhich i do very heartily as one that i wish right well unto and will give you thanks for any continuance or friendship you shall show him for the furtherance of this his honest request and thus with my hearty commendations i wish you right heartily well to fare from the court this nineteenth of september 1581 your very friend r leicester160 footnote 159 more had refused to accept any rent but conditionally probably he refused written consent to the sublease for the same reason footnote 160 wallace the evolution of the english drama p 154 the result of this interview we do not know but on december 20 following the widow made a formal lease of the property to william hunnis and john newman at a rental of 20 13s 4d a year an increase of 6 13s 4d over the rental she had to pay more she required of them a bond of 100 to guarantee their performance of all the covenants of the lease thereupon the theatre under hunnis and newman resumed its careerif indeed this had ever been seriously interrupted in the course of time mores anxiety to recover possession of the hall seems to have increased the quarterly payments were not promptly met by the widow and the repairs on the building were not made to his satisfaction probably through fear of the increasing dissatisfaction on the part of more hunnis and newman transferred their lease in 1583 to a young welsh scrivener henry evans who had become interested in dramatic affairs this transfer of the lease without mores written consent was a second clear breach of the original contract and it gave more exactly the opportunity he sought accordingly he declared the original lease to farrant void and made a new lease of the house unto his own man thomas smallpiece to try the said evans his right but evans being a lawyer knew how to take care of himself he demurred in law and kept the same in his hands with long delays the widow alarmed at the prospect of losing her lease brought suit in december 1583 against hunnis and newman separately for the forfeiture of their several bonds of 100 contending that they had not paid promptly according to their agreement and had not kept the building in proper repair hunnis and newman separately brought suit in the court of requests for relief against the widows suits meanwhile more was demanding judgment against evans hunnis it seems carried his troubles to the court and there sought help queen elizabeth could take no direct action because sir william more was a good friend of hers who had entertained her in his home but she might enlist the aid of one of her noblemen who were interested in the drama however this was the young earl of oxford himself a playwright and the patron of a troupe of boyactors came to the rescue of the theatre he bought the lease of the building from evans and undertook to reorganize its affairs to hunniss twelve children of the chapel he added the children of st pauls cathedral making thus a company of adequate size he retained hunnis no doubt as one of the trainers of the boys and he kept evans as manager of the troupe moreover shortly after the purchase probably in june 1583 he made a free gift of the lease to his private secretary john lyly a young man who had recently won fame with the first english novel euphues the object of this like the preceding transfers of title it seems was to put as many legal blocks in the path of sir william more as possible more realized this and complained specifically that the title was posted from one to another yet he had firmly made up his mind to recover the property and in spite of oxfords interference he instructed his learned council to demand judgment meanwhile the dramatic organization at blackfriars continued under the direction of hunnis evans and lyly with the earl of oxford as patron not only was lyly the proprietor of the theatre but he attempted to supply it with the necessary plays he had already shown his power to tell in effective prose a pleasing love romance that power he now turned to the production of his first play written in haste for the christmas festivities the play alexander and campaspe was presented before her majesty on january 1 1584 and at blackfriars with great applause lylys second play sapho and phao was produced at court on march 3 following and also at blackfriars before the general public but at the easter term 1584 sir william more got judgment in his favor the widow begged sir francis walsingham to intercede in her behalf declaring that the loss of the lease might be her utter undoing161 walsingham sent the letter to more and apparently urged a consideration of her case more however refused to yield he banished lyly hunnis evans and the children from the great upper hall and reconverted the building into tenements footnote 161 the letter is printed in full by mr wallace in the evolution of the english drama p 158 mr wallace however misdates it it was not written until after more had recovered it the lease against evans chapter vi st pauls as shown in the preceding chapter not only were the children of the chapel royal and of windsor called upon to entertain the queen with dramatic performances but the children of st pauls were also expected to amuse their sovereign on occasion and following the example of the children of the chapel and of windsor in giving performances before the public in blackfriars the pauls boys soon began to give such performances in a building near the cathedral162 the building so employed was doubtless one of the structures owned by the church burbage and heminges refer to it as the said house near st pauls church163 richard flecknoe in a discourse of the english stage 1664 places it behind the convocationhouse in pauls164 and howes in his continuation of stows annals 1631 says that it was the singingschool of the cathedral165 that the auditorium was small we may well believe so was the stage certain speakers in the induction to what you will acted at pauls in 1600 say lets place ourselves within the curtains for good faith the stage is so very little we shall wrong the general eye else very much both fleay and lawrence166 contend that the building was round like the globe and as evidence they cite the prologue to marstons antonios revenge acted at pauls in 1600 in which the phrases within this round and within this ring are applied to the theatre the phrases however may have reference merely to the circular disposition of the benches about the stage that high prices of admission to the little theatre were charged we learn from a marginal note in pappe with an hatchet 1589 which states that if a tragedy be showed at pauls it will cost you four pence at the theatre two pence167 the children indeed catered to a very select public persons who went thither were gentle by birth and by behavior as well and playwrights we are told could always feel sure there of the calm attention of a choice audience168 lyly in the prologue to midas acted at pauls in 1589 says only this doth encourage us that presenting our studies before gentlemen though they receive an inward dislike we shall not be hissed with an open disgrace things were quite otherwise in the public theatres of shoreditch and the bankside footnote 162 murray english dramatic companies i 325 erroneously says their public place was probably from the first the courtyard of st pauls cathedral footnote 163 wallace shakespeare and his london associates p 95 footnote 164 that is in or near pater noster row footnote 165 annales or a generall chronicle of england

iii 408 higher prices of admission were charged to all the private playhouses footnote 168 john marston antonios revenge acted at pauls in 1600 under the direction of their master sebastian westcott the boys acted before the public at least as early as 1578169 for in december of that year the privy council ordered the lord mayor to permit them to exercise plays within the city170 and stephen gosson in his plays confuted written soon afterwards mentions cupid and psyche as having been recently plaid at paules footnote 169 there is a record of a play by the pauls boys in 1527 before ambassadors from france dealing with the heretic luther but exactly when they began to give public performances for money we do not know footnote 170 malone variorum iii 432 westcott died in 1582 and was succeeded by thomas gyles shortly after this we find the children of pauls acting publicly with the children of the chapel royal at the little theatre in blackfriars for them john lyly wrote his two earliest plays campaspe and sapho and phao as the titlepages clearly state but their stay at blackfriars was short when in 1584 sir william more closed up the theatre there they fell back upon their singingschool as the place for their public performances at the same time the queen became greatly interested in promoting their dramatic activities to their master thomas gyles she issued in april 1585 a special commission to take up apt and meet children wherever he could find them it was customary for the queen to issue such a commission to the masters of her two private chapels but never before or afterwards had this power to impress children been conferred upon a person not directly connected with the royal choristers its issuance to gyles in 1585 clearly indicates the queens interest in the pauls boys as actors and her expectation of being frequently entertained by them and to promote her plans still further she appointed the successful playwright john lyly as their vicemaster with the understanding no doubt that he was to keep themand hersupplied with plays this he did for all his comedies except the two just mentioned were written for the cathedral children and were acted by them at court and in their little theatre behind the convocation house unfortunately under lylys leadership the boys became involved in the bitter martin marprelate controversy for which they were suppressed near the end of 1590 the printer of lylys endimion in 1591 says to the reader since the plays in pauls were dissolved there are certain comedies come to my hands by chance which were presented before her majesty at several times by the children of pauls exactly how long the children were restrained it is hard to determine in 1596 thomas nash in have with you to saffron walden expressed a desire to see the plays at pauls up again mr wallace thinks they may have been allowed up again in 1598171 fleay in 1599 or 1600172 the evidence however points i think to the spring or early summer of 1600 the children began naturally with old plays musty fopperies of antiquity the first or one of the first new plays they presented was marstons jack drums entertainment the date of which can be determined within narrow limits references to kempes morris which was danced in february 1600 as being still a common topic of conversation and the entry of the play in the stationers registers on september 8 1600 point to the spring or early summer of 1600 as the date of composition this makes very significant the following passage in the play referring to the pauls boys as just beginning to act again after their long inhibition sir ed i saw the children of pauls last night and troth they pleasd me pretty pretty well the apes in time will do it handsomely plan sfaith i like the audience that frequenteth there with much applause a man shall not be choakt with the stench of garlic nor be pasted to the barmy jacket of a beerbrewer bra ju tis a good gentle audience and i hope the boys will come one day into the court of requests footnote 171 the children of the chapel p 153 footnote 172 a chronicle history of the london stage p 152 shortly after this the boys were indeed called into the court of requests for on new years day 1601 they were summoned to present a play before her majesty their master now was edward pierce who had succeeded thomas gyles in 1605 the experienced edward kirkham driven from the management of the blackfriars theatre became an assistant to pierce in the management of pauls in this capacity we find him in 1606 receiving the payment for the two performances of the boys at court that year173 footnote 173 cunningham extracts from the accounts of the revels p xxxviii among the playwrights engaged by pierce to write for pauls were marston middleton chapman dekker webster and beaumont and as a result some of the most interesting dramas of the period were first acted on the small stage of the singingschool details in the history of the children however are few we find an occasional notice of their appearance at court but our record of them is mainly secured from the titlepages of their plays the last notice of a performance by them is as follows on the 30th of july 1606 the youths of pauls commonly called the children of pauls played before the two kings of england and of denmark a play called abuses containing both a comedy and a tragedy at which the kings seemed to take great delight and be much pleased174 footnote 174 nichols the progresses of james iv 1073 the reason why the children ceased to act is made clear in the lawsuit of keysar v burbage et al recently discovered and printed by mr wallace175 from this we learn that when rosseter became manager of the children of the queens revels at the private playhouse of whitefriars in 1609 he undertook to increase his profits by securing a monopoly both of childacting and of private theatres blackfriars had been deserted and the only other private theatre then in existence was pauls so rosseter agreed to pay pierce a dead rent of 20 a year to keep the pauls playhouse closed one mr rosseter a partner of the said complainant dealt for and compounded with the said mr pierce to the only benefit of him the said mr rosseter the now complainant the rest of their partners and company at the whitefriars that thereby they might advance their gains and profit to be had and made in their said house in the whitefriars that there might be a cessation of playing and plays to be acted in the said house near st pauls church aforesaid for which the said rosseter compounded with the said pierce to give him the said pierce twenty pounds per annum176 footnote 175 shakespeare and his london associates p 80 footnote 176 ibid p 95 in this attempt to secure a monopoly in private playhouses rosseter was foiled by the coming of shakespeares troupe to the blackfriars but the kings men readily agreed to join in the payment of the dead rent to pierce for it was to their advantage also to eliminate competition the agreement which rosseter secured from pierce was binding for one whole year whether it was renewed we do not know but the children never again acted in their house near st pauls church chapter vii the bankside and the bear garden from time out of mind the suburb of london known as the banksidethe term was loosely applied to all the region south of the river and west of the bridgehad been identified with sports and pastimes on sundays holidays and other festive occasions the citizens their wives and their apprentices were accustomed to seek outdoor entertainment across the river going thither in boats of which there was an incredible number converting the silver sliding thames almost into a venetian grand canal or strolling on foot over old london bridge on the bankside the visitors could find maypoles for dancing butts for the practice of archery and broad fields for athletic games or if so disposed they could visit bullbaitings bearbaitings fairs stageplays shows motions and other amusements of a similar sort not all the attractions of the bankside however were so innocent for here in a long row bordering the rivers edge were situated the famous stews of the city licensed by authority of the bishop of winchester and along with the stews of course such places as thrive in a district devoted to vicehouses for gambling for coneycatching and for evil practices of various sorts the less said of this feature of the bankside the better more needs to be said of the bull and bearbaiting which probably constituted the chief amusement of the crowds from the city and which was later closely associated with the drama and with playhouses this sport now surviving in the bullfights of spain and of certain spanishamerican countries was in former times one of the most popular species of entertainment cultivated by the english even so early as 1174 william fitzstephen in his descriptio nobilissim ciuitatis londoni under the heading de ludis records that the london citizens diverted themselves on holiday occasions with the baiting of beasts when strong horngoring bulls or immense bears contend fiercely with dogs that are pitted against them177 in some towns the law required that bulls intended for the butchershop should first be baited for the amusement of the public before being led to the slaughterhouse erasmus speaks of the many herds of bears which he saw in england maintained for the purpose of baiting the baiting was accomplished by tying the bulls or bears to stakes or when possible releasing them in an amphitheatre and pitting against them bulldogs bred through centuries for strength and ferocity occasionally other animals as ponies and apes were brought into the fight and the sport was varied in miscellaneous ways some of the animals by unusual courage or success endeared themselves to the heart of the sporting public harry hunks george stone and sacarson were famous bears in shakespeares time and the names of many of the game bulls and mastiff dogs became household words throughout london footnote 177 pingues tauri cornupet seu vrsi immanes cum obiectis depugnant canibus illustration the bankside showing the bear and bullbaiting rings from the map of london by braun and hogenbergius representing the city in 15541558 illustration the bankside this was the second district of london used for public playhouses notice the amphitheatres for animalbaiting from william smiths ms of the description of england c 1580 the home of this popular sport was the bankside the earliest extant map of southwark178 drawn about 1542 shows in the very centre of high street just opposite london bridge a circular amphitheatre marked the bull ring and doubtless there were other places along the river devoted to the same purpose the baiting of bears was more closely identified with the manor of paris garden179 that section of the bank lying to the west of the clink over towards the marshes of lambeth the association of bearbaiting with this particular section was probably due to the fact that in early days the butchers of london used a part of the manor of paris garden for the disposal of their offal180 and the entrails and other refuse from the slaughtered beasts furnished cheap and abundant food for the bears and dogs the earl of manchester wrote to the lord mayor and the common council in 1664 that he had been informed by the master of his majestys game of bears and bulls and others that the butchers company had formerly caused all their offal in eastcheap and newgate market to be conveyed by the beadle of the company unto two barrow houses conveniently placed on the river side for the provision and feeding of the kings game of bears footnote 178 the map is reproduced in facsimile by rendle as a frontispiece to old southwark and its people footnote 179 or parish garden possibly the more correct form for the early history of the manor see william bray the history and antiquities of the county of surrey iii 530 wallace in englische studien 1911 xliii 341 note 3 ordish early london theatres p 125 footnote 180 blount in his glossographia 1681 p 473 says of paris garden so called from robert de paris who had a house and garden there in richard iis time who by proclamation ordained that the butchers of london should buy that garden for receipt of their garbage and entrails of beasts to the end the city might not be annoyed thereby illustration the bear and bullbaiting rings these rings later gave place to the bear garden from agass map of london representing the city as it was about 1560 at first apparently the baiting of bears was held in open places181 with the bear tied to a stake and the spectators crowding around or at best standing on temporary scaffolds but later permanent amphitheatres were provided in braun and hogenbergs map of london drawn between 1554 and 1558 and printed in 1572 we find two wellappointed amphitheatres with stables and kennels attached labeled respectively the bear baiting and the bull baiting when these amphitheatres were erected we do not know but probably they do not antedate by much the middle of the century182 footnote 181 see gilpins life of cranmer for a description of a bearbaiting before the king held on or near the rivers edge see also the proclamation of henry viii in 1546 against the stews which implies the nonexistence of regular amphitheatres footnote 182 sir sidney lee shakespeares england ii 428 says that one of the amphitheatres was erected in 1526 i do not know his authority he was apparently misled by one of rendles statements neither of the amphitheatres is shown in wyngaerdes careful map of london made about 15301540 possibly they are referred to in the diary of henry machyn under the date of may 26 1554 the old bull ring in high street had then disappeared and the baiting of bulls was henceforth more or less closely associated as was natural with the baiting of bears it is to be noted that at this time neither the bull baiting nor the bear baiting is in the manor of paris garden but close by in the liberty of the clink yet the name paris garden continued to be used of the animalbaiting place for a century and more possibly the identification of bearbaiting with paris garden was of such long standing that londoners could not readily adjust themselves to the change they at first confused the terms bear garden and paris garden and later extended the term paris garden to include that section of the clink devoted to the baiting of animals the two amphitheatres it seems were used until 1583 when a serious catastrophe put an end to one if not both of them stow in his annals gives the following account of the accident the same thirteenth day of january being sunday about four of the clock in the afternoon the old and underpropped scaffolds round about the bear garden commonly called paris garden on the south side of the river of thamis over against the city of london overcharged with people fell suddenly down whereby to the number of eight persons men and women were slain and many others sore hurt and bruised to the shortening of their lives183 footnote 183 stow annals ed 1631 p 696 stubbes the puritan writes in his more heightened style upon the 13 day of january last being the saboth day anno 1583 the people men women and children both young and old an infinite number flocking to those infamous places where these wicked exercises are usually practised for they have their courts gardens and yards for the same purpose when they were all come together and mounted aloft upon their scaffolds and galleries and in the midst of all their jolity and pastime all the whole building not one stick standing fell down with a most wonderful and fearful confusion so that either two or three hundred men women and children by estimation whereof seven were killed dead some were wounded some lamed and otherwise bruised and crushed almost to death some had their brains dashed out some their heads all tosquashed some their legs broken some their arms some their backs some their shoulders some one hurt some another184 footnote 184 philip stubbes the anatomie of abuses ed furnivall p 179 the building which the reverend john field described as old and rotten185 was a complete ruin not a stick was left so high as the bear was fastened to the puritan preachers loudly denounced the unholy spectacles pointing to the catastrophe as a clear warning from the almighty and the city authorities earnestly besought the privy council to put an end to such performances yet the owners of the building set to work at once and soon had erected a new house stronger and larger and more pretentious than before the lord mayor in some indignation wrote to the privy council on july 3 1583 that the scaffolds are new builded and the multitudes on the saboth day called together in most excessive number186 footnote 185 a godly exhortation by occasion of the late judgement of god shewed at parisgarden london 1583 another account of the disaster may be found in vaughans golden grove 1600 footnote 186 the malone societys collections i 65 the new bear garden octagonal in form was probably modeled after the playhouses in shoreditch and made in all respects superior to the old amphitheatre which it supplanted187 we find that it was reckoned among the sights of the city and was exhibited to distinguished foreign visitors for example when sir walter raleigh undertook to entertain the french ambassador he carried him to view the monuments in westminster abbey and to see the new bear garden footnote 187 what became of the other amphitheatre labeled the bull baiting i do not know stow in his survey 1598 says now to return to the west bank there be two bear gardens the old and new places wherein be kept bears bulls and other beasts to be baited illustration the bear garden from visschers map of london published in 1616 but representing the city as it was several years earlier a picture of the building is to be seen in the hondius view of london 1610 see page 149 and in the small inset views from the titlepages of hollands hergreek ologia 1620 and bakers chronicle 1643 see page 147 all three of which probably go back to a view of london made between 1587 and 1597 and now lost another representation of the structure is to be seen in the delaram portrait of king james along with the rose and the globe see opposite page 246 the best representation of the building however is in visschers view of london see page 127 printed in 1616 but drawn several years earlier188 footnote 188 for a fuller discussion of these various maps and views see pages 146 248 and 328 nordens map of 1594 see page 147 merely indicates the site of the building although we are not directly concerned with the history of the bear garden189 a few descriptions of the royal game of bears bulls and dogs drawn from contemporary sources will be of interest and of specific value for the discussion of the hope playhouseitself both a bear garden and a theatre footnote 189 for such a history the reader is referred to ordish early london theatres greg henslowes diary ii and henslowe papers young the history of dulwich college rendle the bankside and the playhouses at bankside robert laneham in his description of the entertainment at kenilworth 1575 writes thus of a baiting of bears before the queen well syr the bearz wear brought foorth intoo the coourt the dogs set too

in his collection for improvement of husbandry and trade190 gives a vivid account of the baiting of the bull he says the bull takes great care to watch his enemy which is a mastiff dog commonly used to the sport with a short nose that his teeth may take the better hold this dog if right will creep upon his belly that he may if possible get the bull by the nose which the bull as carefully strives to defend by laying it close to the ground where his horns are also ready to do what in them lies to toss the dog and this is the true sport but if more dogs than one come at once or they are cowardly and come under his legs he will if he can stamp their guts out i believe i have seen a dog tossed by a bull thirty if not forty foot high and when they are tossed either higher or lower the men above strive to catch them on their shoulders lest the fall might mischief the dogs they commonly lay sand about that if they fall upon the ground it may be the easier notwithstanding this care a great many dogs are killed more have their limbs broke and some hold so fast that by the bulls swinging them their teeth are often broken out the true courage and art is to hold the bull by the nose till he roars which a courageous bull scorns to do this is a sport the english much delight in and not only the baser sort but the greatest lords and ladies footnote 190 no 108 august 1694 quoted by jp malcolm anecdotes of the manners and customs of london from the roman invasion to the year 1700 london 1811 p 433 an attendant upon the duke of nexara who visited england in 1544 wrote the following account of a bearbaiting witnessed in london in another part of the city we saw seven bears some of them of great size they were led out every day to an enclosure where being tied with a long rope large and intrepid dogs are thrown to them in order that they may bite and make them furious it is no bad sport to see them fight and the assaults they give each other to each of the large bears are matched three or four dogs which sometimes get the better and sometimes are worsted for besides the fierceness and great strength of the bears to defend themselves with their teeth they hug the dogs with their paws so tightly that unless the masters came to assist them they would be strangled by such soft embraces into the same place they brought a pony with an ape fastened on its back and to see the animal kicking amongst the dogs with the screams of the ape beholding the curs hanging from the ears and neck of the pony is very laughable191 footnote 191 the original manuscript of this narrative in spanish is preserved in the british museum i quote the translation by frederick madden in archologia xiii 35455 orazio busino the chaplain of the venetian embassy in london writes in his anglipotrida 1618 the dogs are detached from the bear by inserting between the teeth certain iron spattles with a wooden handle whilst they take them off the bull keeping at a greater distance with certain flat iron hooks which they apply to the thighs or even to the neck of the dog whose tail is simultaneously dexterously seized by another of these rufflers the bull can hardly get at anybody as he wears a collar round his neck with only fifteen feet of rope which is fastened to a stake deeply planted in the middle of the theatre other rufflers are at hand with long poles to put under the dog so as to break his fall after he has been tossed by the bull the tips of these poles are covered with thick leather to prevent them from disembowelling the dogs the most spirited stroke is considered to be that of the dog who seizes the bulls lip clinging to it and pinning the animal for some time the second best hit is to seize the eyebrows the third but far inferior consists in seizing the bulls ear192 footnote 192 the calendar of state papers venetian xv 258 paul hentzner the german traveler who visited london in 1598 wrote thus of the bear garden there is still another place built in the form of a theatre which serves for the baiting of bulls and bears they are fastened behind and then worried by great english bulldogs but not without great risk to the dogs from the horns of the one and the teeth of the other and it sometimes happens they are killed upon the spot fresh ones are immediately supplied in the places of those that are wounded or tired to this entertainment there often follows that of whipping a blinded bear which is performed by five or six men standing circularly with whips which they exercise upon him without any mercy as he cannot escape from them because of his chain he defends himself with all his force and skill throwing down all who come within his reach and are not active enough to get out of it and tearing the whips out of their hands and breaking them the following passage is taken from the diary of the duke of wirtemberg who visited london in 1592 noted down daily in the most concise manner possible at his highnesss gracious command by his private secretary193 on the 1st of september his highness was shown in london the english dogs of which there were about 120 all kept in the same enclosure but each in separate kennel in order to gratify his highness and at his desire two bears and a bull were baited at such times you can perceive the breed and mettle of the dogs for although they receive serious injuries from the bears and are caught by the horns of the bull and tossed into the air so as frequently to fall down again upon the horns they do not give in but fasten on the bull so firmly that one is obliged to pull them back by the tails and force open their jaws four dogs at once were set on the bull they however could not gain any advantage over him for he so artfully contrived to ward off their attacks that they could not well get at him on the contrary the bull served them very scurvily by striking and beating at them footnote 193 the secretary was named jacob rathgeb and the diary was published at tbingen in 1602 with a long title beginning a true and faithful narrative of the bathing excursion which his serene highness etc a translation will be found in rye england as seen by foreigners pp 353 the following is a letter from one william faunte to edward alleyn then proprietor of the bear garden regarding the sale of some game bulls i understood by a man which came with two bears from the garden that you have a desire to buy one of my bulls i have three western bulls at this time but i have had very ill luck with them for one of them hath lost his horn to the quick that i think he will never be able to fight again that is my old star of the west he was a very easy bull and my bull bevis he hath lost one of his eyes but i think if you had him he would do you more hurt than good for i protest i think he would either throw up your dogs into the lofts or else ding out their brains against the grates194 footnote 194 collier the alleyn papers p 31 finally among the alleyn papers of dulwich college is an interesting bill or advertisement of an afternoons performance at the bear garden tomorrow being thursday shall be seen at the bear garden on the bankside a great match played by the gamesters of

reader is referred to the chapter on the hope chapter viii newington butts the bankside as the preceding chapter indicates offered unusual attractions to the actors it had indeed long been associated with the drama in 1545 king henry viii in a proclamation against vagabonds players195 etc noted their fashions commonly used at the bank and such like naughty places where they much haunt and in 1547 the bishop of winchester made complaint that at a time when he intended to have a dirge and mass for the late king the actors in southwark planned to exhibit a solemn play to try who shall have the most resort they in game or i in earnest196 the players therefore were no strangers to the bank and when later in the century the hostility of the common council drove them to seek homes in localities not under the jurisdiction of the city the suburb across the river offered them a suitable refuge for although a large portion of southwark was under the jurisdiction of london certain parts were not notably the liberty of the clink and the manor of paris garden two sections bordering the rivers edge and the district of newington lying farther back to the southwest in these places the actors could erect their houses and entertain the public without fear of the ordinances of the corporation and without danger of interruption by puritanical lord mayors footnote 195 it is just possiblebut i think improbablethat the term common players as used in this proclamation referred to gamblers the term is regularly used in law to designate actors footnote 196 the calendar of state papers domestic 1547 february 5 p 1 cf tytlers edward vi and mary i 20 yet as we have seen the first public playhouses were erected not on the banksidea naughty placebut near finsbury field to the north of the city and the reasons which led to the selection of such a quiet and respectable district have been pointed out197 it was inevitable however that sooner or later a playhouse should make its appearance in the region to the south of the city and at an early datehow early it is impossible to say but probably not long after the erection of the theatre and the curtainthere appeared in southwark a building specially devoted to the use of players whether it was a new structure modeled after the theatres of shoreditch or merely an old building converted into a playhouse we cannot say it seems to have been something more than an innyard fitted up for dramatic purposes and yet something less than the sumptuous theatre houses erected on purpose for plays to the north of the city footnote 197 see page 29 whatever the building was it was situated at newington butts a place so called from the butts for archery anciently erected there and unfortunately at a considerable distance from the river exactly how far playgoers from london had to walk to reach the theatre after crossing over the river we do not know but the privy council speaks of the tediousness of the way thither198 and stow notes that the parish church of newington was distant one mile from london bridge further information about the buildingits exact situation its size its exterior shape its interior arrangement and suchlike detailsis wholly lacking footnote 198 the council again refers to the building in the phrase in any of these remote places dasent acts of the privy council xii 15 nor are we much better off in regard to its ownership management and general history this seems to be due to the fact that it was not intimately associated with any of the more important london troupes and to the fact that after a few unsuccessful years it ceased to exist below i have recorded the few and scattered references which constitute our meagre knowledge of its history the first passage cited may refer to the playhouse at newington butts it is an order of the privy council may 13 1580 thus summarized by the clerk a letter to the justices of peace of the county of surrey that whereas their lordships do understand that notwithstanding their late order given to the lord mayor to forbid all plays within and about the city until michaelmas next for avoiding of infection nevertheless certain players do play sundry days every week at newington butts in that part of surrey without the jurisdiction of the said lord mayor contrary to their lordships order their lordships require the justices not only to inquire who they be that disobey their commandment in that behalf and not only to forbid them expressly for playing in any of these remote places near unto the city until michaelmas but to have regard that within the precinct of surrey none be permitted to play if any do to commit them and to advertise them c199 footnote 199 dasent acts of the privy council xii 15 the next passage clearly refers to the theatre at newington butts on may 11 1586 the privy council dispatched a letter to the lord mayor which the clerk thus summarized a letter to the lord mayor his lordship is desired according to his request made to their lordships by his letters of the vii th of this present to give order for the restraining of plays and interludes within and about the city of london for the avoiding of infection feared to grow and increase this time of summer by the common assemblies of people at those places and that their lordships have taken the like order for the prohibiting of the use of plays at the theatre and the other places about newington out of his charge200 footnote 200 ibid xiv 102 chalmers201 thought the word theatre was used of the newington playhouse and for this he was taken to task by collier202 who says he confounds it with the playhouse emphatically called the theatre in shoreditch and on consulting the register we find that no such playhouse as the newington theatre is there spoken of but chalmers was right for if we consult the registers we find the following letter dispatched to the justices of surrey on the very same day that the letter just quoted was sent to the lord mayor a letter to the justices of surrey that according to such direction as hath been given by their lordships to the lord mayor to restrain and inhibit the use of plays and interludes in public places in and about the city of london in respect of the heat of the year now drawing on for the avoiding of the infection like to grow and increase by the ordinary assemblies of the people to those places they are also required in like sort to take order that the plays and assemblies of the people at the theatre or any other places about newington be forthwith restrained and forborn as aforesaid c203 footnote 201 apology p 403 footnote 202 history of english dramatic poetry 1879 iii 131 footnote 203 dasent acts of the privy council xiv 99 the phrase the theatre or any other places about newington when addressed to the justices of the peace of surrey could refer only to the newington butts playhouse on june 23 1592 because of a riot in southwark the privy council closed all the playhouses in and about london204 shortly after this the lord stranges men who were then occupying the rose petitioned the council to be allowed to resume acting in their playhouse the council granted them instead permission to act three times a week at newington butts but the players not relishing this proposal chose rather to travel in the provinces soon finding that they could not make their expenses in the country they returned to london and again appealed to the privy council to be allowed to perform at the rose205 the warrant issued by the council in reply to this second petition tells us for the first time something definite about the newington butts theatre to the justices bailiffs constables and others to whom it shall appertain whereas not long since upon some considerations we did restrain the lord strange his servants from playing at the rose on the bankside and enjoyned them to play three days a week at newington butts now forasmuch as we are satisfied that by reason of the tediousness of the way and that of long time plays have not there been used on working days and for that a number of poor watermen are thereby relieved you shall permit and suffer them or any other there at the rose to exercise themselves in such sort as they have done heretofore and that the rose may be at liberty without any restraint so long as it shall be free from infection any commandment from us heretofore to the contrary notwithstanding206 footnote 204 greg henslowes diary ii 50 73 footnote 205 greg henslowe papers p 42 footnote 206 ibid pp 4344 from this warrant we learn that so early as 1592 the newington house was almost deserted and that of long time plays had been given there only occasionally two years later on june 3 1594 henslowe sent the admirals and the chamberlains men to play temporarily at the halfdeserted old playhouse probably in order to give opportunity for needed repairs at the rose207 the section of his diary under the heading in the name of god amen begininge at newington my lord admeralle men my lord chamberlen men as followethe 1594 constitutes the fullest and clearestand one may add the most illustriouschapter in the history of this obscure building for although it extends over only ten days it tells us that edward alleyn richard burbage and william shakespeare then trod the newington stage and it records the performance there of such plays as the jew of malta andronicus the taming of a shrew and hamlet footnote 207 there is no evidence that henslowe owned the house at newington he might very well have rented it for this particular occasion we next hear of the building near the end of the century in 1599 says mr wallace it was only a memory as shown by a contemporary record to be published later208 footnote 208 wallace the first london theatre p 2 two other references close the history in a woman is a weathercock iii iii printed in 1612 but written earlier one of the actors exclaims of an insufferable pun o newington conceit the fact that this sneer is the only reference to the newington playhouse found in contemporary literature is a commentary on the low esteem in which the building was held by the elizabethans and its relative unimportance for the history of the drama the last notice is in howes continuation of stows annals 1631209 after enumerating all the theatres built in london and the suburbs within the space of threescore years he adds vaguely besides one in former time at newington butts footnote 209 page 1004 chapter ix the rose doubtless one reason for the obscure rle which the theatre at newington played in the history of the drama was the tediousness of the way thither the rose the second theatre to make its appearance in surrey was much more conveniently situated with respect to the city for it was erected in the liberty of the clink and very near the rivers edge as a result it quickly attained popularity with london playgoers and before the end of the century had caused the centre of dramatic activity to be shifted from finsbury field to the bank the builder of the rose was one philip henslowe then so far as our evidence goes unknown to the dramatic world but destined soon to become the greatest theatrical proprietor and manager of the tudorstuart age we find him living on the bankside and in the liberty of the clink at least as early as 1577 at first so we are told he was but a poor man described as servant unto one mr woodward upon the death of his employer woodward he married the widow agnes woodward and thus came into the possession of considerable property all his wealth came by her swore the charwoman joan horton this however simply means that henslowe obtained his original capital by his marriage for although very illiterate he was shrewd in handling money and he quickly amassed his wealth through innumerable business ventures as one of these ventures no doubt he leased from the parish of st mildred on march 24 1585 a small piece of property on the bankside known as the little rose among the early surveys 1 edward vi says rendle we see that this was not merely a namethe place was a veritable rose garden210 at the time of the lease the property is described as consisting of a dwellinghouse called the rose two gardens adjoining the same consisting of void ground and at least one other small building the dwellinghouse henslowe probably leased as a brothelfor this was the district of the stews and the small building mentioned above situated at the south end of one of the gardens he let to a london grocer named john cholmley who used it to keep victualing in211 footnote 210 w rendle in the antiquarian magazine and bibliographer viii 60 footnote 211 for the earlier history of the rose estate see rendle the bankside p xv and greg henslowes diary ii 43 the plan of the rose estate in the vestry of st mildreds church in london marks the estate exactly but not the precise site of the rose playhouse the estate consisted of three rods and was east of rose alley rendle the bankside p xxx not satisfied however with the income from these two buildings henslowe a year and a half later was planning to utilize a part of the void ground for the erection of a theatre what interested him in the drama we do not know but we may suppose that the same reason which led burbage brayne lanman and others to build playhouses influenced him namely the prospect of great gains to ensue therefrom212 footnote 212 possibly the fact that burbage had just secured control of the curtain and hence had a monopoly of playhouses was one of the reasons for a new playhouse for the site of his proposed playhouse he allotted a small parcel of ground ninetyfour feet square and lying in the corner formed by rose alley and maiden lane see page 245 then he interested in the enterprise his tenant cholmley for it seems he did not wish to undertake so expensive and precarious a venture without sharing the risk with another on january 10 1587 he and cholmley signed a formal deed of partnership according to which the playhouse was to be erected at once and at the sole cost of henslowe cholmley however was to have from the beginning a halfinterest in the building paying for his share by installments of 25 10s a quarter for a period of eight years and three months213 the total sum to be paid by cholmley 816 possibly represents the estimated cost of the building and its full equipment plus rental on the land footnote 213 the deed of partnership is preserved among the henslowe papers at dulwich college for an abstract of the deed see greg henslowe papers p 2 henslowe seems to have driven a good bargain with cholmley the building is referred to in the deed of january 10 as a playhouse now in framing and shortly to be erected and set up doubtless it was ready for occupancy early in the summer that performances were given there before the close of the year is at least indicated by an order of the privy council dated october 29 1587 a letter to the justices of surrey that whereas the inhabitants of southwark had complained unto their lordships declaring that the order by their lordships set down for the restraining of plays and interludes within that county on the sabbath days is not observed and especially within the liberty of the clink and in the parish of st saviours214 footnote 214 dasent acts of the privy council xv 271 the rose was in the liberty of the clink and in the parish of st saviours and so far as we have any evidence it was the only place there devoted to plays moreover a distinct reference to it by name appears in the sewer records in april 1588 at which date the building is described as new215 footnote 215 discovered by mr wallace and printed in the london times april 30 1914 in nordens map of london 1593 the rose and the adjacent bear garden are correctly placed with respect to each other but are crudely drawn see page 147 the representation of both as circularthe bear garden we know was polygonalwas due merely to this crudeness yet the rose seems to have been indeed circular in shape the banksides roundhouse referred to in tom tell troths message the building is so pictured in the hondius map of 1610 see page 149 and in the inset maps on the titlepages of hollands hergreek ologia 1620 and bakers chronicle 1643 see page 147 all three of which apparently go back to an early map of london now lost the building is again pictured as circular with the bear garden at the left and the globe at the right in the delaram portrait of king james opposite page 246216 footnote 216 the circular building pictured in these maps has been widely heralded as the first globe but without reason all the evidence shows that it was the rose for further discussion see the chapters dealing with the bear garden the globe and the hope in the merian view issued in frankfort in 1638 the bear garden and the globe each named are shown conspicuously in the foreground in the background is vaguely represented an unnamed playhouse polygonal in shape this could not possibly be the rose merians view was a compilation from visschers view of 1616 and some other view of london not yet identified it has no independent authority and no value whatever so far as the rose is concerned from henslowes diary we learn that the playhouse was of timber the exterior of lath and plaster the roof of thatch and that it had a yard galleries a stage a tiringhouse heavens and a flagpole thus it differed in no essential way from the playhouses already erected in shoreditch or subsequently erected on the bank217 footnote 217 if we may believe johannes de witt the rose was more magnificent than the theatres in shoreditch see page 167 illustration the bear garden and the rose the upper view from nordens map of london 1593 shows the relative position of the bear garden and rose the lower view an inset from the titlepage of bakers chronicle 1643 also shows the relative position and gives a more detailed picture of the two structures the bear garden is represented as polygonal the rose as circular what troupes of actors used the rose during the first five years of its existence we do not know indeed until 1592 we hear nothing further of the playhouse as a result some scholars have wrongly inferred that the building was not erected until the spring of 1592218 it seems likely as mr greg suggests that henslowe and cholmley let the house to some company of players at a stipulated annual rent and so had nothing to do with the management of its finances this would explain the complete absence of references to the playhouse in henslowes accounts footnote 218 ordish early london theatres p 155 mantzius a history of theatrical art p 58 mr wallaces discovery of a reference to the rose in the sewer records for april 1588 quite overthrows this hypothesis during this obscure period of five years cholmley disappears from the history of the rose it may be that he withdrew from the undertaking at the outset219 it may be that he failed to meet his payments and so forfeited his moiety or it may be that becoming dissatisfied with his bargain he sold out to henslowe whatever the cause his interest in the playhouse passed over to henslowe who appears henceforth as the sole proprietor footnote 219 this seems unlikely at the beginning of henslowes diary we find the scrawl chomley when greg henslowes diary i 217 this was written not earlier than 1592 and it shows that cholmley was at that time in henslowes mind illustration the bear garden and the rose a small inset view of london from the map entitled the kingdome of great britaine and ireland printed in speeds atlas 1611 the map is dated 1610 but the inset view of london was copied like the inset views to bakers chronicle 1643 and to hollands hergreek ologia 1620 from a lost map of london drawn about 15891599 in the spring of 1592 the building was in need of repairs and henslowe spent a large sum of money in thoroughly overhauling it220 the lathing and plastering of the exterior were done over the roof was rethatched new rafters were put in and much heavy timber was used indicating important structural alterations in addition the stage was painted the lords room and the tiringhouse were provided with ceilings a new flagpole was erected and other improvements were introduced clearly an attempt was made to render the building not only stronger but also more attractive in appearance and more modern in equipment footnote 220 greg henslowes diary i 7 the immediate occasion for these extensive alterations and repairs was the engagement of lord stranges men to occupy the playhouse under henslowes management this excellent troupe with edward alleyn at its head was perhaps the best company of actors then in london it later became the lord chamberlains company with which shakespeare was identified even at this early date although documentary proof is lacking he may have been numbered among its obscure members the troupe opened the rose on february 19 1592 with a performance of robert greenes friar bacon and friar bungay and followed this with many famous plays such as the spanish tragedy the jew of malta orlando furioso and henry vi221 footnote 221 for a list of their plays see greg henslowes diary i 13 ff the coming of lord stranges men to the rose led to a close friendship between henslowe and edward alleyn then twentysix years of age and at the height of his fame as an actor a friendship which was cemented in the autumn by alleyns marriage to henslowes stepdaughter and only child joan woodward the two men it seems were thoroughly congenial and their common interests led to the formation of a business partnership which soon became the most important single force in the theatrical life of the time lord stranges men continued to act at the rose from february 19 until june 23 1592 when the privy council because of a serious riot in southwark ordered the closing of all playhouses in and about london until michaelmas following stranges men very soon petitioned the council to be allowed to reopen their playhouse the council in reply compromised by granting them permission to act three days a week at newington butts this however did not please the actors and they started on a tour of the provinces in a short time discovering that they could not pay their expenses on the road they again petitioned for permission to open the rose complaining that our company is great and thereby our charge intolerable in traveling the country and calling attention to the fact that the use of our playhouse on the bankside by reason of the passage to and from the same by water is a great relief to the poor watermen there222 the petition was accompanied by a supporting petition from the watermen asking the council for gods sake and in the way of charity to respect us your poor watermen as a result of these petitions the council gave permission probably late in august 1592 for the reopening of the playhouse223 but before stranges men could take advantage of this permission a severe outbreak of the plague caused a general inhibition of acting and not until december 29 1592 were they able to resume their performances at the rose a month later the plague broke out again with unusual severity and on february 1 1593 playing was again inhibited the year rapidly developed into one of the worst plagueyears in the history of the city between ten and fifteen thousand persons died of the epidemic and most of the london companies including stranges men went on an extended tour of the country footnote 222 greg henslowe papers p 42 footnote 223 see greg henslowe papers p 43 for a general discussion of various problems involved see greg henslowes diary ii 512 near the close of the year and while stranges men were still traveling the plague temporarily subsided and sussexs men who were then in london secured the use of the rose they began to act there on december 27 1593 but on february 6 1594 the plague having again become threatening acting was once more inhibited this brief occupation of the rose by sussexs men was notable only for the first performance of titus andronicus224 footnote 224 greg henslowes diary i 16 illustration joan woodward alleyn the stepdaughter and only child of philip henslowe whose marriage to the great actor edward alleyn led to the henslowealleyn theatrical enterprises the portrait is here reproduced for the first time from the dulwich picture gallery by permission at easter april 1 stranges men being still absent henslowe allowed the rose to be used for eight days by the queens men and my lord of sussexs together this second brief chapter in the long and varied history of the playhouse is interesting only for two performances of the old king leir225 footnote 225 greg henslowes diary i 17 as a result of the severe plague and the long continued inhibition of acting there was a general confusion and subsequent reorganization of the various london troupes the admirals men who had been dispersed in 1591 some joining stranges men some going to travel in germany were brought together again and edward alleyn who had formerly been their leader and who even after he became one of stranges men continued to describe himself as servant to the right honorable the lord admiral226 was induced to rejoin them alleyn thereupon brought them to the rose where they began to perform on may 14 1594 after three days however they ceased probably to allow henslowe to make repairs or improvements on the building footnote 226 he is so described for example in the warrant issued by the privy council on may 6 1593 to stranges men stranges men also had undergone reorganization on april 16 1594 they lost by death their patron the earl of derby shortly afterwards they secured the patronage of the lord chamberlain and before june 3 1594 they had arrived in london and reported to their former manager henslowe at this time apparently the rose was still undergoing repairs so henslowe sent both the admirals and the chamberlains men to act at newington butts where they remained from june 3 to june 13 1594 on june 15 the admirals men moved back to the rose which henceforth they occupied alone and the chamberlains men thus robbed of their playhouse went to the theatre in shoreditch during the period of lent 1595 henslowe took occasion to make further repairs on his playhouse putting in new pales patching the exterior with new lath and plaster repainting the woodwork and otherwise furbishing up the building the total cost of this work was 108 10s and shortly after as a part of these improvements no doubt he paid 7 2s for making the throne in the heavens227 footnote 227 greg henslowes diary i 4 near the close of july 1597 pembrokes men at the swan acted nashes satirical play the isle of dogs containing it seems a burlesque on certain persons high in authority as a result the privy council on july 28 ordered all acting in and about london to cease until november 1 and all public playhouses to be plucked down and ruined228 footnote 228 for the details of this episode see the chapter on the swan the latter part of the order happily was not put into effect and on october 11 the rose was allowed to open again the privy council however punished the swan and pembrokes company by ordering that only the admirals men at the rose and the chamberlains men at the curtain should henceforth be allowed as a consequence of this trouble with the authorities the best actors of pembrokes company joined the admirals men under henslowe this explains the entry in the diary in the name of god amen the xi of october began my lord admirals and my lord pembrokes men to play at my house 1597229 the two companies were very soon amalgamated and the strong troupe thus formed continued to act at the rose under the name of the admirals men footnote 229 greg henslowes diary i 54 the chamberlains men who in 1594 had been forced to surrender the rose to the admirals men and move to the theatre and who in 1597 had been driven from the theatre to the curtain at last in 1599 built for themselves a permanent home the globe situated on the bankside and close to the rose henslowes ancient structure230 was eclipsed by this new and handsome building the glory of the bank and the admirals men no doubt felt themselves placed at a serious disadvantage as a result in the spring of 1600 henslowe and alleyn began the erection of a splendid new playhouse the fortune designed to surpass the globe in magnificence and to furnish a suitable and permanent home for the admirals men the building was situated in the suburb to the north of the city far away from the bankside and the globe footnote 230 in january 1600 the earl of nottingham refers to the dangerous decay of the rose see greg henslowe papers p 45 cf p 52 the erection of this handsome new playhouse led to violent outbursts from the puritans and vigorous protests from the city fathers accordingly the privy council on june 22 1600 issued the following order231 whereas divers complaints have heretofore been made unto the lords and other of her majestys privy council of the manifold abuses and disorders that have grown and do continue by occasion of many houses erected and employed in and about london for common stageplays and now very lately by reason of some complaint exhibited by sundry persons against the building of the like house the fortune in or near golding lane the lords and the rest of her majestys privy council with one and full consent have ordered in manner and form as follows first that there shall be about the city two houses and no more allowed to serve for the use of the common stageplays of the which houses one the globe shall be in surrey in that place which is commonly called the bankside or thereabouts and the other the fortune in middlesex footnote 231 dasent acts of the privy council xxx 395 this sealed the fate of the rose in july the admirals men had a reckoning with henslowe and prepared to abandon the bankside after they had gone but before they had opened the fortune henslowe on october 28 1600 let the rose to pembrokes men for two days232 possibly the troupe had secured special permission to use the playhouse for this limited time possibly henslowe thought that since the fortune was not yet open to the public no objection would be made of course after the admirals men opened the fortunein november or early in december 1600the rose according to the order of the privy council just quoted had to stand empty footnote 232 greg henslowes diary i 131 its career however was not absolutely run in the spring of 1602 worcesters men and oxfords men were joined by agreement together in one company and the queen at the suit of the earl of oxford ordered that this company be allowed accordingly the privy council wrote to the lord mayor on march 31 1602 informing him of the fact and adding and as the other companies that are allowed namely of me the lord admiral and the lord chamberlain be appointed their certain houses and one and no more to each company so we do straightly require that this company be likewise appointed to one place and because we are informed the house called the boars head is the place they have especially used and do best like of we do pray and require you that that said house namely the boars head may be assigned unto them233 but the lord mayor seems to have opposed the use of the boars head and the upshot was that the council gave permission for this third company to open the rose in henslowes diary we read lent unto my lord of worcesters players as followeth beginning the 17 day of august 1602 footnote 233 the remembrancia ii 189 the malone societys collections i 85 this excellent company destined to become the queens company after the accession of king james included such important actors as william kempe john lowin christopher beeston john duke robert pallant and richard perkins and it employed such wellknown playwrights as thomas heywood the prose shakespeare who was also one of the troupe henry chettle thomas dekker john day wentworth smith richard hathway and john webster the company continued to act at the rose until march 16 1603 when it had a reckoning with henslowe and left the playhouse234 in may however after the coming of king james it returned to the rose and we find henslowe opening a new account in the name of god amen beginning to play again by the kings license and laid out since for my lord of worcesters men as followeth 1603 9 of may235 since only one entry follows it is probable that the company did not remain long at the rose no doubt the outbreak of the plague quickly drove them into the country and on their return to london in the spring of 1604 they occupied the boars head and the curtain footnote 234 on march 19 the privy council formally ordered the suppression of all plays this was five days before the death of queen elizabeth footnote 235 greg henslowes diary i 190 after this there is no evidence to connect the playhouse with dramatic performances henslowes lease of the little rose property on which his playhouse stood expired in 1605 and the parish of st mildreds demanded an increase in rental the following note in the diary refers to a renewal of the lease memorandum that the 25 of june 1603 i talked with mr pope at the scriveners shop where he lies236 concerning the taking of the lease anew of the little rose and he shewed me a writing betwixt the parish and himself which was to pay twenty pound a year rent237 and to bestow a hundred marks upon building which i said i would rather pull down the playhouse than i would do so and he bad me do and said he gave me leave and would bear me out for it was in him to do it238 footnote 236 some scholars have supposed that this was morgan pope a part owner of the bear garden but he is last heard of in 1585 and by 1605 was probably dead mr greg is of the opinion that thomas pope the wellknown member of the kings men at the globe is referred to from this has been developed the theory that pope acting for the globe players had rented the rose and closed it in order to prevent competition with the globe on the bankside i believe however that the mr pope here referred to was neither of these men but merely the agent of the parish of st mildred it is said that he lived at a scriveners shop this could not apply to the actor thomas pope for we learn from his will made less than a month later that he lived in a house of his own furnished with plate and household goods and cared for by a housekeeper and with him lived susan gasquine whom he had brought up ever since she was born footnote 237 the old rental was 7 a year footnote 238 greg henslowes diary i 178 henslowe did not renew his lease of the property on october 4 1605 the commissioners of the sewers amerced him for the rose but return was made that it was then out of his hands239 from a later entry in the sewer records february 14 1606 we learn that the new owner of the rose was one edward box of bread street london box it seems either tore down the building or converted it into tenements the last reference to it in the sewer records is on april 25 1606 when it is referred to as the late playhouse240 footnote 239 wallace in the london times april 30 1914 p 10 in view of these records it seems unnecessary to refute those persons who assert that the rose was standing so late as 1622 i may add however that before mr wallace published the sewer records i had successfully disposed of all the evidence which has been collected to show the existence of the rose after 1605 the chief source of this error is a footnote by malone in variorum iii 56 the source of malones error is probably to be seen in his footnote ibid p 66 footnote 240 for the tourist the memory of the old playhouse today lingers about rose alley on the bank chapter x the swan the manor of paris garden241 situated on the bankside just to the west of the liberty of the clink and to the east of the lambeth marshes had once been in the possession of the monastery of bermondsey at the dissolution of the monasteries by henry viii the property passed into the possession of the crown hence it was free from the jurisdiction of the lord mayor and aldermen of london and was on this account suitable for the erection of a playhouse from the crown the property passed through several hands until finally in 1589 the entire lordship and manor of paris garden was sold for 850 to francis langley goldsmith and citizen of london242 footnote 241 or parish garden see the note on page 121 footnote 242 the sale took the form of a lease for one thousand years langley had purchased the manor as an investment and was ready to make thereon such improvements as seemed to offer profitable returns burbage and henslowe were reputed to be growing wealthy from their playhouses and langley was tempted to erect a similar building on his newly acquired property accordingly at some date before november 1594 he secured a license to erect a theatre in paris garden the license was promptly opposed by the lord mayor of london who addressed to the lord high treasurer on november 3 1594 the following letter i understand that one francis langley intendeth to erect a new stage or theatre as they call it for the exercising of plays upon the bankside and forasmuch as we find by daily experience the great inconvenience that groweth to this city and the government thereof by the said plays i have emboldened myself to be an humble suitor to your good lordship to be a means for us rather to suppress all such places built for that kind of exercise than to erect any more of the same sort243 footnote 243 the malone societys collections i 7476 the protest of the lord mayor however went unheeded and langley proceeded with the erection of his building presumably it was finished and ready for the actors in the earlier half of 1595 illustration the manor of paris garden and the swan a survey executed in 1627 by royal command printed from rendles the bankside the name given to the new playhouse was the swan what caused langley to adopt this name we do not know244 but we may suppose that it was suggested to him by the large number of swans which beautified the thames foreigners on their first visit to london were usually very much impressed by the number and the beauty of these birds hentzner in 1598 stated that the river abounds in swans swimming in flocks the sight of them and their noise is vastly agreeable to the boats that meet them in their course and the italian francesco ferretti observed that the broad river of thames was most charming and quite full of swans white as the very snow245 footnote 244 the swan was not uncommon as a sign especially along the river for example it was the sign of one of the famous brothels on the bankside as stow informs us footnote 245 quoted in rye england as seen by foreigners p 183 from a map of the manor of paris garden carefully surveyed by order of the king in 1627246 see page 163 we learn the exact situation of the building it was set twentysix poles or four hundred and twentysix feet from the bank of the river in that corner of the estate nearest london bridge most of the playgoers from london however came not over the bridge but by water landing at the paris garden stairs or at the nearby falcon stairs and then walking the short distance to the theatre footnote 246 reproduced by rendle the bankside southwark and the globe playhouse illustration the swan playhouse from visschers view of london 1616 an excellent picture of the exterior of the swan is furnished by visschers view of london 1616 see page 165 from this as well as from the survey of 1627 just mentioned we discover that the building was duodecahedralat least on the outside for the interior probably was circular at the time of its erection it was so we are told the largest and the most magnificent playhouse in london it contained three galleries surrounding an open pit with a stage projecting into the pit and probably it differed in no essential respect from the playhouses already built in one point however it may have differedalthough of this i cannot feel sure it may have been provided with a stage that could be removed so as to allow the building to be used on occasions for animalbaiting the de witt drawing shows such a stage and possibly stow in his survey 1598 gives evidence that the swan was in early times employed for bearbaiting and to begin at the west bank as afore thus it followeth on this bank is the bear gardens in number twain to wit the old bear garden ie the one built in 1583 and the new ie the swan places wherein be kept bears bulls and other beasts to be baited at stakes for pleasure also mastiffs to bait them in several kennels are there nourished247 footnote 247 stows original manuscript harl mss 544 quoted by collier history of english dramatic poetry 1879 iii 96 note 3 the text of the edition of 1598 differs very slightly moreover in 1613 henslowe used the swan as the model for the hope a building designed for both acting and animalbaiting it should be noted however that in all documents the swan is invariably referred to as a playhouse and there is no evidencebeyond that cited aboveto indicate that the building was ever employed for the baiting of bears and bulls in the summer of 1596 a dutch traveler named johannes de witt a priest of st marys in utrecht visited london and saw as one of the most interesting sights of the city a dramatic performance at the swan later he communicated a description of the building to his friend arend van buchell248 who recorded the description in his commonplacebook along with a crude and inexact drawing of the interior see page 169 showing the stage the three galleries and the pit249 the description is headed ex observationibus londinensibus johannis de witt after a brief notice of st pauls and a briefer reference to westminster cathedral the traveler begins to describe what obviously interested him far more i give below a translation of that portion relating to the playhouses there are four amphitheatres in london the theatre curtain rose and swan of notable beauty which from their diverse signs bear diverse names in each of them a different play is daily exhibited to the populace the two more magnificent of these are situated to the southward beyond the thames and from the signs suspended before them are called the rose and the swan the two others are outside the city towards the north on the highway which issues through the episcopal gate called in the vernacular bishopgate250 there is also a fifth the bear garden but of dissimilar structure devoted to the baiting of beasts where are maintained in separate cages and enclosures many bears and dogs of stupendous size which are kept for fighting furnishing thereby a most delightful spectacle to men of all the theatres251 however the largest and the most magnificent is that one of which the sign is a swan called in the vernacular the swan theatre252 for it accommodates in its seats three thousand persons and is built of a mass of flint stones of which there is a prodigious supply in britain253 and supported by wooden columns painted in such excellent imitation of marble that it is able to deceive even the most cunning since its form resembles that of a roman work i have made a sketch of it above footnote 248 apparently he allowed van buchell to transcribe the description and the rough pensketch from his notebook or travelers diary footnote 249 this interesting document was discovered by dr karl t gaedertz and published in full in zur kenntnis der altenglischen bhne bremen 1888 footnote 250 vi qu itur per episcopalem portam vulgariter biscopgate nuncupatam footnote 251 theatrorum footnote 252 id cuius intersignium est cygnus vulgo te theatre off te cijn mr wallace proposes to emend the last clause to read te theatre off te cijn off te swan thus making cijn mean sign but is not this flemish and does not cijn mean swan footnote 253 it is commonly thought that de witt was wrong in stating that the swan was built of flint stones possibly the plaster exterior deceived him or possibly in his memory he confused this detail of the building with the exterior of the church of st mary overies which was indeed built of a mass of flint stones on the other hand the long life of the building after it had ceased to be of use might indicate that it was built of stones exactly when the swan was opened to the public or what troupes of actors first made use of it we do not know the visit of johannes de witt however shows that the playhouse was occupied in 1596 and this fact is confirmed by a statement in the lawsuit of shaw v langley254 we may reasonably suppose that not only in 1596 but also in 1595 the building was used by the players footnote 254 discovered by mr wallace and printed in englische studien 1911 xliii 34095 these documents have done much to clear up the history of the swan and the rose in the year 1597 illustration the interior of the swan playhouse sketched by johannes de witt in 1596 our definite history of the swan however begins with 1597 in february of that year eight distinguished actors among whom were robert shaw richard jones gabriel spencer william bird and thomas downton servants to the right honorable the earl of pembroke entered into negotiations with langley or as the legal document puts it fell into conference with the said langley for and about the hireing and taking a playhouse of the said langley situate in the old paris garden in the parish of st saviours in the county of surrey commonly called and known by the name of the sign of the swan the result of this conference was that the members of pembrokes company255 became each severally bound for the sum of 100 to play at the swan for one year beginning on february 21 1597 footnote 255 i cannot agree with mr wallace that langley induced these players to desert henslowe secured for them the patronage of pembroke and thus was himself responsible for the organization of the pembroke company this troupe contained some of the best actors in london and langley in anticipation of a successful year disbursed and laid out for making of the said house ready and providing of apparel fit and necessary for their playing the sum of 300 and upwards since he was at very little cost in making the swan ready for the said house was then lately afore used to have plays in it most of this sum went for the purchase of sundry sort of rich attire and apparel for them to play withall everything seems to have gone well until near the end of july when the company presented the isle of dogs a satirical play written in part by the young juvenal of the age thomas nashe and in part by certain inferior players chief of whom seems to have been ben jonson256 the play apparently attacked under a thin disguise some persons high in authority the exact nature of the offense cannot now be determined but nashe himself informs us that the troublesome stir which happened about it is a general rumour that hath filled all england257 and the queen herself seems to have been greatly angered on july 28 1597 the privy council sent a letter to the justices of middlesex and of surrey informing them that her majesty hath given direction that not only no plays shall be used within london or about the city or in any public place during this time of summer but that also those playhouses that are erected and built only for such purposes shall be plucked down accordingly the council ordered the justices to see to it that there be no more plays used in any public place within three miles of the city until allhallows ie november 1 next and furthermore to send for the owners of the various playhouses and enjoin them by vertue hereof forthwith to pluck down quite the stages galleries and rooms that are made for people to stand in and so to deface the same as they may not be employed again to such use258 footnote 256 for an account of the isle of dogs see ek chambers modern language review 1909

153 footnote 258 dasent acts of the privy council xxvii 313 possibly the other public playhouses were suppressed along with the swan in response to the petition presented to the council on july 28 ie on the same day by the lord mayor and aldermen requesting the final suppressing of the said stage plays as well at the theatre curtain and bankside as in all other places in and about the city see the malone societys collections i 78 the council however did not stop with this it ordered the arrest of the authors of the play and also of the chief actors who took part in its performance nashe saved himself by precipitate flight but his lodgings were searched and his private papers were turned over to the authorities robert shaw and gabriel spencer as leaders of the troupe and ben jonson as one of the inferior players who had a part in writing the play259 were thrown into prison the rest of the company hurried into the country their speed being indicated by the fact that we find them acting in bristol before the end of july footnote 259 in a marginal gloss to nashes lenten stuffe 1599 ed mckerrow iii 154 nashe says i having begun but the induction and first act of it the other four acts without my consent or the best guess of my drift or scope by the players were supplied which bred both their trouble and mine too some of these events are referred to in the following letter addressed by the privy council to richard topclyfe thomas fowler and richard skevington esquires doctor fletcher and mr wilbraham upon information given us of a lewd play that was played in one of the playhouses on the bankside containing very seditious and slanderous matter we caused some of the players robert shaw gabriel spencer and ben jonson260 to be apprehended and committed to prison whereof one of them ben jonson was not only an actor but a maker of part of the said play forasmuch as it is thought meet that the rest of the players or actors in that matter shall be apprehended to receive such punishment as their lewd and mutinous behaviour doth deserve these shall be therefore to require you to examine those of the players that are committed whose names are known to you mr topclyfe what is become of the rest of their fellows that either had their parts in the devising of that seditious matter or that were actors or players in the same what copies they have given forth261 of the said play and to whom and such other points as you shall think meet to be demanded of them wherein you shall require them to deal truly as they will look to receive any favour we pray you also to peruse such papers as were found in nashe his lodgings which ferrys a messenger of the chamber shall deliver unto you and to certify us the examinations you take262 footnote 260 the identity of the three players is revealed in an order of the privy council dated october 8 1597 a warrant to the keeper of the marshalsea to release gabriel spencer and robert shaw stageplayers out of prison who were of late committed to his custody the like warrant for the releasing of benjamin jonson dasent acts of the privy council xxviii 33 footnote 261 such a copy was formerly preserved in a volume of miscellaneous manuscripts at alnwick castle but has not come down to modern times see fj burgoyne northumberland manuscripts london 1904 footnote 262 dasent acts of the privy council xxvii 338 this unfortunate occurrence destroyed langleys dream of a successful year it also destroyed the splendid pembroke organization for several of its chief members even before the inhibition was raised joined the admirals men on august 6 richard jones went to henslowe and bound himself to play for two years at the rose and at the same time he bound his friend robert shaw who was still in prison on august 10 william bird came and made a similar agreement on october 6 thomas downton did likewise their leader gabriel spencer also probably had an understanding with henslowe although he signed no bond and upon his release from the marshalsea he joined his friends at the rose263 footnote 263 langley sued these actors on their bond to him of 100 to play only at the swan see the documents printed by mr wallace ben jonson also joined henslowes forces at the rose as did anthony and humphrey jeffes who were doubtless members of the pembroke company in the meantime the queens anger was abating and the trouble was blowing over the order to pluck down all the public playhouses was not taken seriously by the officers of the law and henslowe actually secured permission to reopen the rose on october 11 the inhibition itself expired on november 1 but the swan was singled out for further punishment the privy council ordered that henceforth license should be granted to two companies only namely the admirals at the rose and the chamberlains at the curtain this meant of course the closing of the swan in spite of this order however the members of pembrokes company remaining after the chief actors had joined henslowe taking on recruits and organizing themselves into a company began to act at the swan without a license for some time they continued unmolested but at last the two licensed companies called the attention of the privy council to the fact and on february 19 1598 the council issued the following order to the master of the revels and the justices of both middlesex and surrey whereas license hath been granted unto two companies of stage players retayned unto us the lord admiral and lord chamberlain and whereas there is also a third company who of late as we are informed have by way of intrusion used likewise to play we have therefore thought good to require you upon receipt hereof to take order that the aforesaid third company may be suppressed and none suffered hereafter to play but those two formerly named belonging to us the lord admiral and lord chamberlain264 footnote 264 dasent acts of the privy council xxviii 327 thus after february 19 1598 the swan stood empty so far as plays were concerned and we hear very little of it during the next few years indeed it never again assumed an important part in the history of the drama in the summer of 1598265 it was used by robert wilson for a contest in extempore versification francis meres in his palladis tamia writes and so is now our witty wilson who for learning and extemporall wit in this faculty is without compare or compeere as to his great and eternal commendations he manifested in his challenge at the swan on the bankside footnote 265 after the order of february 19 when the intruding company was driven out and before september 7 when meress palladis tamia was entered in the stationers registers on may 15 1600 peter bromvill was licensed to use the swan to show his feats of activity at convenient times in that place without let or interruption266 the privy council in issuing the license observed that bromvill hath been recommended unto her majesty from her good brother the french king and hath shewed some feats of great activity before her highness footnote 266 dasent acts of the privy council xxx 327 on june 22 1600 the privy council with one and full consent ordered that there shall be about the city two houses and no more allowed to serve for the use of the common stage plays of the which houses one the globe shall be in surrey and the other the fortune in middlesex267 this order in effect merely confirmed the order of 1598 which limited the companies to two the admirals and the chamberlains footnote 267 ibid 395 early in 1601 langley died and in january 1602 his widow as administratrix sold the manor of paris garden including the swan playhouse to hugh browker a prothonotary of the court of common pleas the property remained in the possession of the browker family until 1655268 footnote 268 for this and other details as to the subsequent history of the property see wallace englische studien xliii 342 rendle the antiquarian magazine vii 207 and cf the map on page 163 on november 6 1602 the building was the scene of the famous hoax known as englands joy perpetrated upon the patriotic citizens of london by one richard vennar269 vennar scattered handbills over the city announcing that at the swan playhouse on saturday november 6 a company of gentlemen and gentlewomen of account would present with unusual magnificence a play entitled englands joy celebrating queen elizabeth it was proposed to show the coronation of elizabeth the victory of the armada and various other events in the life of englands joy with the following conclusion and so with music both with voice and instruments she is taken up into heaven when presently appears a throne of blessed souls and beneath under the stage set forth with strange fireworks diverse black and damned souls wonderfully described in their several torments270 the price of admission to the performance was to be two shillings or eighteen pence at least in spite of this unusually high price an enormous audience including a great store of good company and many noblemen passed into the building whereupon vennar seized the money paid for admission and showed his victims a fair pair of heels the members of the audience when they found themselves thus duped revenged themselves upon the hangings curtains chairs stools walls and whatsoever came in their way very outrageously and made great spoil271 footnote 269 many writers including mr wallace have confused this richard vennar with william fennor who later challenged kendall to a contest of wit at the fortune for a correct account see ts graves tricks of elizabethan showmen in the south atlantic quarterly april 1915 xiv and a note on the swan theatre in modern philology january 1912 ix 431 footnote

fencers playd their prizes this day at the bankside but turner at last run dun so far in the brain at the eye that he fell down presently stone dead a goodly sport in a christian state to see one man kill another the place where the contest was held is not specifically mentioned but in all probability it was the swan272 footnote 272 this seems to be the source of the statement by mr wallace englische studien xliii 388 quoting rendle the antiquarian magazine vii 210 in 1604 a man named turner in a contest for a prize at the swan was killed by a thrust in the eye rendle cites no authority for his statement for the next eight years all is silence but we may suppose that the building was occasionally let for special entertainments such as those just enumerated in 1611 henslowe undertook to manage the lady elizabeths men promising among other things to furnish them with a suitable playhouse having disposed of the rose in 1605 he rented the swan and established his company there in 1613 however he built the hope and transferred the lady elizabeths men thither the swan seems thereafter to have been occupied for a time by prince charless men but the history of this company and its intimate connection with the lady elizabeths company is too vague to admit of definite conclusions so far as we can judge the princes men continued at the swan until 1615 when henslowe transferred them to the hope273 footnote 273 these dates are in a measure verified by the records of the overseers of the poor for the liberty of paris garden printed by mr wallace englische studien xliii 390 note 1 mr wallace seems to labor under the impression that this chapter in the history of the swan 16111615 was unknown before but it was adequately treated by fleay and later by mr greg after 1615 the swan was deserted for five years so far as any records show but in 1621 the old playhouse seems to have been again used by the actors the overseers of the poor in the liberty of paris garden record in their account book monday april the 9th 1621 received of the players 5 3s 6d274 from this it is evident that in the spring of 1621 some company of players the name of which has not yet been discovered was occupying the swan apparently however the company did not remain there long for the account book records no payment the following year nor although it extends to the year 1671 does it again record any payments from actors at the swan there is indeed no evidence to connect the playhouse with dramatic performances after 1621275 in the map of 1627 it is represented as still standing but is labeled the old playhouse and is not even named footnote 274 wallace op cit p 390 note 1 footnote 275 rendle quotes a license of 1623 for tb and three assistants to make shows of italian motions at the princes arms or the swan the antiquarian magazine 1885 vii 211 but this may be a reference to an inn rather than to the large playhouse five years later it is referred to in nicolas goodmans hollands leaguer 1632 a pamphlet celebrating one of the most notorious houses of ill fame on the bankside276 dona britannica hollandia the proprietress of this house is represented as having been much pleased with its situation especially and above all the rest she was most taken with the report of three famous amphitheatres which stood so near situated that her eye might take view of them from the lowest turret one was the continent of the world ie the globe because half the year a world of beauties and brave spirits resorted unto it the other was a building of excellent hope and though wild beasts and gladiators did most possess it yet the gallants that came to behold those combats though they were of a mixt society yet were many noble worthies amongst them the last which stood and as it were shakd hands with this fortress being in times past as famous as any of the other was now fallen to decay and like a dying swanne hanging down her head seemed to sing her own dirge footnote 276 what seems to be a picture of this famous house may be seen in merians view of london 1638 see opposite page 256 with a turret and standing just to the right of the swan this is the last that we hear of the playhouse that was in times past as famous as any of the other what finally became of the building we do not know it is not shown in hollars view of london in 1647 and probably it had ceased to exist before the outbreak of the civil war chapter xi the second blackfriars in 1596 burbages lease of the plot of ground on which he had erected the theatre was drawing to a close and all his efforts at a renewal had failed the owner of the land gyles alleyn having in spite of the terms of the original contract refused to extend the lease until 1606 was craftily plotting for a substantial increase in the rental moreover having become puritanical in his attitude towards the drama he was insisting that if the lease were renewed the theatre should be used as a playhouse for five years only and then should either be torn down or be converted into tenements burbage tentatively agreed to pay the increased rental but of course he could not possibly agree to the second demand and when all negotiations on this point proved futile he realized that he must do something at once to meet the awkward situation in the twenty years that had elapsed since the erection of the theatre and the curtain in holywell the bankside had been developed as a theatrical district and the rose and the swan not to mention the bear garden had made the south side of the river the popular place for entertainments naturally therefore any one contemplating the erection of a playhouse would immediately think of this locality burbage however was a man of ideas he believed that he could improve on the bankside as a site for his theatre he remembered how at the outset of his career as a theatrical manager he had had to face competition with richard farrant who had opened a small private playhouse in blackfriars although that building had not been used as a public playhouse and had been closed up after a few years of sore tribulation it had revealed to burbage the possibilities of the blackfriars precinct for theatrical purposes in the first place the precinct was not under the jurisdiction of the city so that actors would not there be subject to the interference of the lord mayor and his aldermen as stevens writes in his history of ancient abbeys monasteries etc all the inhabitants within it were subject to none but the king neither the mayor nor the sheriffs nor any other officers of the city of london had the least jurisdiction or authority therein blackfriars therefore in this fundamental respect was just as desirable a location for theatres as was holywell to the north of the city or the bankside to the south in the second place blackfriars had a decided advantage over those two suburban localities in that it was scituated in the bosome of the cittie277 near st pauls cathedral the centre of london life and hence was readily accessible to playgoers even during the disagreeable winter season in the third place the locality was distinctly fashionable to give some notion of the character of its inhabitants i record below the names of a few of those who lived in or near the conventual buildings at various times after the dissolution george brooke lord cobham william brooke lord cobham lord chamberlain of the queens household henry brooke lord cobham lord warden of the cinque ports sir thomas cheney treasurer of the queens household and lord warden

cheeke sir george harper sir philip hoby lady anne gray sir robert kyrkham lady perrin sir christopher more sir henry neville sir thomas saunders sir jerome bowes and lady jane guildford278 obviously the locality was free from the odium which the public always associated with shoreditch and the bankside the recognized homes of the london stews279 footnote 277 the petition of 1619 in the malone societys collections i 93 footnote 278 it is true that poor people also featherdealers and suchlike lived in certain parts of blackfriars but this of course did not affect the reputation of the precinct as the residence of noblemen footnote 279 in samuel rowlandss humors looking glass 1608 a rich country gull is represented as filling his pockets with money and coming to london here a servant of the newgate variety shows him the sights of the city brought him to the bankside where bears do dwell and unto shoreditch where the whores keep hell thus a playhouse erected in the precinct of blackfriars would escape all the grave disadvantages of situation which attached to the existing playhouses in the suburbs and on the other hand would gain several very important advantages burbages originality however did not stop with the choice of blackfriars as the site of his new theatre he determined to improve on the form of building as well the openair structure which he had designed in 1576 and which had since been copied in all public theatres had serious disadvantages in that it offered no protection from the weather burbage now resolved to provide a large public playhouse fully roofed in with the entire audience and the actors protected against the inclemency of the sky and the cold of winter in short his dream was of a theatre centrally located comfortably heated and for its age luxuriously appointed with characteristic energy and courage he at once set about the task of realizing this dream he found in the blackfriars precinct a large building which he thought would admirably serve his purpose this building was none other than the old frater of the monastery a structure one hundred and ten feet long and fiftytwo feet wide with stone walls three feet thick and a flat roof covered with lead from the loseley documents which m feuillerat has placed at the disposal of scholars280 we are now able to reconstruct the old frater building and to point out exactly that portion which was made into a playhouse281 footnote 280 blackfriars records in the malone societys collections 1913 footnote 281 for a reconstruction of the priory buildings and grounds and for specific evidence of statements made in the following paragraphs the reader is referred to jq adams the conventual buildings of blackfriars london in the university of north carolina studies in philology xiv 64 at the time of the dissolution the top story consisted of a single large room known as the upper frater and also as the parliament chamber from the fact that the english parliament met here on several occasions here also was held the trial before cardinals campeggio and wolsey for the divorce of the unhappy queen catherine and henry viiia scene destined to be renacted in the same building by shakespeare and his fellows many years later in 1550 the room was granted with various other properties in blackfriars to sir thomas cawarden282 footnote 282 feuillerat blackfriars records pp 7 12 illustration plan illustrating the second blackfriars playhouse the playhouse was made by combining the hall and the parlor the space below the parliament chamber was divided into three units at the northern end was a hall extending the width of the building it is mentioned in the survey283 of 1548 as a hall under the said frater and again in the sidenote memorandum my lorde warden claimeth the said hall just to the south of the hall was a parlor or diningchamber where commonly the friars did use to break their fast it is described in the survey as being under the said frater of the same length and breadth the room could not have been of the same length and breadth as the great parliament chamber for not only would such dimensions be absurd for an informal diningroom but as we are clearly told the infirmary was also under the parliament chamber and was approximately onethird the size of the latter284 accordingly i have interpreted the phrase of the same length and breadth to mean that the parlor was square when the room was sold to burbage it was said to be fiftytwo feet in length from north to south which is exactly the breadth of the building from east to west the parlor as well as the hall was claimed by the lord warden and both were granted to sir thomas cawarden in 1550 footnote 283 feuillerat blackfriars records p 7 footnote 284 feuillerat blackfriars records pp 10506 south of the parlor was the infirmary described as being at the western corner of the inner cloister of which the frater building constituted the western side as being under the parliament chamber and as being approximately onethird the size of the parliament chamber the infirmary seems to have been structurally distinct from the hall and parlor285 it was three stories high consisting of a room beneath the fermary the infirmary itself a room above the same286 while the parliament chamber extending itself over the room above the fermary constituted a fourth story furthermore not only was the infirmary a structural unit distinct from the hall and the parlor at the north but it never belonged to cawarden or more and hence was not included in the sale to burbage it was granted in 1545 to lady mary kingston287 from whom it passed to her son sir henry jerningham then to anthony kempe who later sold it to lord hunsdon288 and at the time the playhouse was built the infirmary was still in the occupation of hunsdon footnote 285 in all probability it was separated from the hall and parlor by a passage leading through the infirmary into the inner cloister yard footnote 286 one reason for the greater height may have been the slope of the ground towards the river a second reason was the unusual height of the parlor footnote 287 feuillerat blackfriars records p 105 footnote 288 ibid p 124 at the northern end of the frater building and extending westward was a narrow structure fifty feet in length sixteen feet in breadth and three stories in height regarded as a part of the frater parcel the middle story which was on the same level with the parliament chamber was known as the duchy chamber possibly because of its use in connection with the sittings of parliament or with the meetings of the privy council there the building was granted to cawarden in 1550289 footnote 289 feuillerat blackfriars records p 8 upon the death of cawarden all his blackfriars holdings passed into the possession of sir william more from more in 1596 james burbage purchased those sections of the frater building which had originally been granted to cawarden290that is all the frater building except the infirmaryfor the sum of 600 in modern valuation about 25000291 evidently he had profited by farrants experience with more and by his own experience with gyles alleyn and had determined to risk no more leases but in the future to be his own landlord cost what it might footnote 290 for the deed of sale see ibid p 60 footnote 291 it should be observed however that burbage paid only 100 down and that he immediately mortgaged the property for more than 200 the playhouse was not free from debt until 1605 see wallace the first london theatre p 23 the properties which he thus secured were 1 the parliament chamber extending over the hall parlor and infirmary this great chamber it will be recalled had previously been divided by cawarden into the frith and cheeke lodgings292 but now it was arranged as a single tenement of seven rooms and was occupied by the eminent physician william de lawne293 all those seven great upper rooms as they are now divided being all upon one floor and sometime being one great and entire room with the roof over the same covered with lead up into this tenement led a special pair of stairs which made it wholly independent of the rest of the building footnote 292 the northern section of the cheeke lodging a portion of the old buttery which had constituted farrants private theatre and which was no real part of the frater building had been converted by more into the pipe office footnote 293 a prosperous physician his son was one of the illustrious founders of the society of apothecaries and one of its chief benefactors his portrait may be seen today in apothecaries hall see crb barrett the history of the society of apothecaries of london 2 the friars parlor now made into a tenement occupied by thomas bruskett and called the middle rooms or middle storiespossibly from the fact that it was the middle of three tenements possibly from the fact that having two cellars under its northern end it was the middle of three stories it is described as being fiftytwo feet in length north and south and thirtyseven feet in width why a strip of nine feet should have been detached on the eastern side is not clear but that this strip was also included in the sale to burbage is shown by later documents 3 the ancient hall adjoining the parlor on the north and now made into two rooms these rooms were combined with the ground floor of the duchy chamber building to constitute a tenement occupied by peter johnson all those two lower rooms now in the occupation of the said peter johnson lying directly under part of the said seven great upper rooms the dimensions are not given but doubtless the two rooms together extended the entire width of the building and were approximately as broad as the duchy chamber building with which they were united 4 the duchy chamber building at the north end of the said seven great upper rooms and at the west side thereof at the time of the sale the ground floor of this building was occupied by peter johnson who had also the hall adjoining it on the west the middle story was occupied by charles bradshaw and the top story by edward merry294 footnote 294 mr wallaces description of the building and the way in which it was converted into a playhouse the children of the chapel at blackfriars pp 3741 is incorrect for the various details cited above see the deed of sale to burbage out of this heterogeneous property burbage was confronted with the problem of making a playhouse apparently he regarded the parliament chamber as too low or too inaccessible for the purposes of a theatre this part of his property therefore he kept as a lodging and for many years it served as a dormitory for the childactors the duchy chamber building being small and detached from the frater building he reserved also as a lodging295 in the hall and the parlor however he saw the possibility of a satisfactory auditorium let us therefore examine this section of the frater building more in detail and trace its history up to the time of the purchase footnote 295 this may have contained the two rooms in which evans lived and the schoolhouse and the chamber over the same which are described see the documents in fleays a chronicle history of the london stage p 210 ff as being severed from the said great hall in another document this schoolhouse is described as schola anglice schoolhouse ad borealem finem aul prdict wallace the children of the chapel at blackfriars p 40 the parlor was described as a great room paved and was said to have been used and occupied by the friars themselves to their own proper use as a parlor to dine and sup in296 sir john portynary whose house adjoined the duchy chamber tells us that in 1550 when king edward granted the blackfriars property to cawarden sir thomas cawarden knight entered into the same house in the name of all that which the king had given him within the said friars and made his lodging there and about that time did invite this examinant and his wife to supper there together with diverse other gentlemen and they all supped together with the said sir thomas cawarden in the same room the parlor where the said school of fence is now kept and did there see a play297 footnote 296 feuillerat blackfriars records pp 43 47 48 footnote 297 ibid p 52 later cawarden leased the parlor to a keeper of an ordinary one woodman did hold the said house where the said school of fence is kept and another house thereby of sir thomas cawarden and in the other room kept an ordinary table and had his way to the same through the said house where the said school of fence is kept298 footnote 298 ibid p 51 in 1563 william joyner established in the rooms the school of fence mentioned above which was still flourishing in 1576299 footnote 299 feuillerat blackfriars records p 121 when in 1583 john lyly became interested in the first blackfriars playhouse he obtained a lease of the rooms but it is not clear for what purpose later he sold the lease to rocho bonetti the italian fencingmaster who established there his famous school of fence300 in george silvers paradoxes of defence 1599 is a description of bonettis school which will i think help us to reconstruct in our imagination the great room paved which was destined to become shakespeares playhouse he caused to be fairely drawne and set round about the schoole all the noblemens and gentlemens armes that were his schollers and hanging right under their armes their rapiers daggers gloves of male and gantlets also he had benches and stooles the roome being verie large for gentlemen to sit about his schoole to behold his teaching he taught none commonly under twentie fortie fifty or an hundred

had perfectly taught them their rules he was verie much loved in the court footnote 300 ibid p 122 we are further told by silver that bonetti took it upon himself to hit anie englishman with a thrust

occupation of rocco bonetti and now being in the tenure or occupation of thomas bruskett gentleman to make his playhouse burbage removed all the partitions in the middle rooms and restored the parlor to its original forma great room covering the entire breadth of the building and extending fiftytwo feet in length from north to south to this he added the hall at the north which then existed as two rooms in the occupation of peter johnson the hall and parlor when combined made an auditorium described as per estimacionem in longitudine ab australe ad borealem partem eiusdem sexaginta et sex pedes assiss sit plus sive minus et in latitudine ab occidentale ad orientalem partem eiusdem quadraginto et sex pedes assiss sit plus sive minus301 the fortysix feet of width corresponds to the interior width of the frater building for although it was fiftytwo feet wide in outside measurement the stone walls were three feet thick the sixtysix feet of length probably represents the fiftytwo feet of the parlor plus the breadth of the hall footnote 301 wallace the children of the chapel at blackfriars p 39 note 1 the ceiling of these two rooms must have been of unusual height the infirmary which was below the parliament chamber at the south was three stories high and the windows of the parlor if we may believe pierce the ploughman were wrought as a chirche an halle for an heygh kinge an

the monastery the windows of the frater according to pierce the ploughman were wrought as a chirche from a painting in the guildhall museum as a result burbage was able to construct within the auditorium at least two galleries302 after the manner of the public theatres the parliament chamber above was kept as i have stated for residential purposes this is why the various legal documents almost invariably refer to the playhouse as that great hall or room with the rooms over the same303 footnote 302 mr wallace the children of the chapel at blackfriars p 42 quotes from the epilogue to marstons the dutch courtesan acted at blackfriars and now my fine heliconian gallants and you my worshipful friends in the middle region and adds that the reference to the middle region makes it clear there were three galleries does it not however indicate that there were only two galleries footnote 303 see the documents printed in fleays a chronicle history of the london stage pp 211 215 240 etc mr wallace however the children of the chapel at blackfriars p 40 ff would have us believe that an additional story was added the roof was changed and rooms probably of the usual dormer sort were built above i am quite sure he is mistaken the main entrance to the playhouse was at the north over the great yard which extended from the pipe office to water lane304 the stage was opposite this entrance or at the southern end of the hall as is shown by one of the documents printed by mr wallace305 since the building was not like the other playhouses of london open to the sky the illumination was supplied by candles hung in branches over the stage as gerschow noted after visiting blackfriars alle bey lichte agiret welches ein gross ansehen macht306 the obvious advantage of artificial light for producing beautiful stage effects must have added not a little to the popularity of the blackfriars playhouse footnote 304 cf playhouse yard in the london of today footnote 305 the children of the chapel at blackfriars p 43 note 3 footnote 306 the diary of the duke of stettinpomerania in transactions of the royal historical society 1892 vi 26 the cost of all the alterations and the equipment could hardly have been less than 300 so that the total cost of the property was at least 900 or in modern valuation approximately 35000 burbages sons in referring to the building years later declared that their father had made it into a playhouse with great charge and they added significantly with great trouble the aristocratic inhabitants of the blackfriars precinct did not welcome the appearance in their midst of a public or as some more scornfully designated it a common playhouse and when they discovered the intentions of burbage they wrote a strong petition to the privy council against the undertaking this petition presented to the council in november 1596 i quote below in part to the right honorable the lords and others of her majestys most honorable privy councilhumbly shewing and beseeching your honors the inhabitants of the precinct of the blackfriars london that whereas one burbage hath lately bought certain rooms in the same precinct near adjoining unto the dwelling houses of the right honorable the lord chamberlaine lord cobham and the lord of hunsdon which rooms the said burbage is now altering and meaneth very shortly to convert and turn the same into a common playhouse which will grow to be a very great annoyance and trouble not only to all the noblemen and gentlemen thereabout inhabiting but also a general inconvenience to all the inhabitants of the same precinct both by reason of the great resort and gathering together of all manner of vagrant and lewd persons as also for that there hath not at any time heretofore been used any common playhouse within the same precinct but that now all players being banished by the lord mayor from playing within the city they now think to plant themselves in liberties etc307 footnote 307 for the full document see halliwellphillipps outlines i 304 for the date see the malone societys collections i 91 the first person to sign the petition was the dowager lady elizabeth russell the second was none other than george cary lord hunsdon at the time the patron of burbages company of actors308 it is not surprising therefore that as a result of this petition the lords of the privy council of which lord cobham was a conspicuous member issued an order in which they forbad the use of the said house for plays309 this order wrecked the plans of burbage quite as effectively as did the stubbornness of gyles alleyn footnote 308 shortly after this he was appointed lord chamberlain under which name his troupe was subsequently known footnote 309 petition of 1619 the malone societys collections i 91 possibly the mental distress burbage suffered at the hands of the privy council and of gyles alleyn affected his health at least he did not long survive this last sling of fortune in february 1597 just before the expiration of the alleyn lease he died leaving the theatre to his son cuthbert the bookseller blackfriars to his actorson richard the star of shakespeares troupe and his troubles to both with good reason cuthbert declared many years later that the ultimate success of london theatres had been purchased by the infinite cost and pains of the family of burbages when later in 1597 the lord chamberlains players were forced to leave cuthberts theatre richard burbage was not able to establish them in his comfortable blackfriars house instead they first went to the old curtain in shoreditch and then under the leadership of the burbage sons erected for themselves a brandnew home on the bankside called the globe the order of the privy council had summarily forbidden the use of blackfriars as a public playhouse its proprietor however richard burbage might take advantage of the precedent established in the days of farrant and let the building for use as a private theatre310 exactly when he was first able to lease the building as a private house we do not know for the history of the building between 1597 when it was completed and 1600 when it was certainly occupied by the children of the chapel is very indistinct we have no definite evidence to connect the chapel children or indeed any specific troupe with blackfriars during these years yet prior to 1600 the building seems to have been used for acting richard burbage himself seems to say so in leasing the building to evans in 1600 he says that he considered with himself that evans could not pay the rent except the said evans could erect and keep a company of playingboys or others to play plays and interludes in the said playhouse in such sort as before time had been there used311 now unless this refers to farrants management of the chapel boys in blackfriarsnearly a quarter of a century earlierit means that before 1600 some actors presumably playingboys had used burbages theatre moreover there seems to be evidence to show that the troupe thus vaguely referred to was under the management of evans for in referring to his lease of blackfriars in 1600 evans describes the playhouse as then or late in the tenure or occupation of your said oratour312 what these vague references mean we cannot now with our limited knowledge determine but there is not sufficient evidence to warrant the usual assumption that evans and giles had opened the blackfriars with the children of the chapel in 1597313 footnote 310 the constables and other officers in the petition of 1619 say the owner of the said playhouse doth under the name of a private house convert the said house to a public playhouse the malone societys collections i 91 footnote 311 fleay a chronicle history of the london stage p 234 footnote 312 ibid p 211 footnote 313 this theory has been urged by fleay by mr wallace in the children of the chapel at blackfriars and by others the known history of blackfriars as a regular theatre may be said to begin in the autumn of 1600 on september 2 of that year henry evans signed a lease of the playhouse for a period of twentyone years at an annual rental of 40 this interesting step on the part of evans calls for a word of explanation as to his plans the children of the chapel royal who had attained such glory at blackfriars during the farranthunnisevansoxfordlyly rgime had thereafter sunk into dramatic insignificance since 1584 when lyly was forced to give up his playhouse they had not presented a play at court probably they did not entirely cease to act for they can be vaguely traced in the provinces during a part of this period but their dramatic glory was almost wholly eclipsed evans who had managed the boys under hunnis oxford and lyly hoped now to restablish the children of the chapel at blackfriars as they had been in his younger days like james burbage he was a man of ideas his plan was to interest in his undertaking the master of the chapel nathaniel giles who had succeeded to the office at the death of hunnis in 1597 and then to make practical use of the patent granted to the masters of the children to take up boys for her majestys service such a patent in the normal course of events had been granted to giles as it had been to his predecessors it read in part as follows elizabeth by the grace of god c to all mayors sheriffs bailiffs constables and all other our officers greeting for that it is meet that our chapel royal should be furnished with wellsinging children from time to time we have and by these presents do authorize our wellbeloved servant nathaniel giles master of our children of our said chapel or his deputy being by his bill subscribed and sealed so authorized and having this our present commission with him to take such and so many children as he or his sufficient deputy shall think meet in all cathedral collegiate parish churches chapels or any other place or places as well within liberty as without within this our realm of england whatsoever they be314 footnote 314 the full commission is printed in wallace the children of the chapel at blackfriars p 61 in such a commission evans saw wonderful possibilities he reasoned that since the queen had forced upon the chapel children the twofold service of singing at royal worship and of acting plays for royal entertainment this twofold service should be met by a twofold organization the one part designed mainly to furnish sacred music the other designed mainly to furnish plays such a dual organization it seemed to him was now more or less necessary since the number of boy choristers in the chapel royal was limited to twelve whereas the acting of plays demanded at least twice as many once the principle that the chapel royal should supply the queen with plays was granted the commission could be used to furnish the necessary actors and the old fiction established by farrant and hunnis of using a private playhouse as a means of exercising or training the boys for court service would enable the promoters to give public performances and thus handsomely reimburse themselves for their trouble such was evanss scheme based upon his former experience with the children at farrants blackfriars and suggested perhaps by the existence of burbages blackfriars now forbidden to the common players he presented his scheme to giles the master of the children and giles no doubt presented it at court for he would hardly dare thus abuse the queens commission or thus make a public spectacle of the royal choristers without in some way first consulting her majesty and securing at least her tacit consent that giles and evans did secure royal permission to put their scheme into operation is certain although the exact nature of this permission is not clear later for misdemeanors on the part of the management the star chamber ordered that all assurances made to the said evans concerning the said house or plays or interludes should be utterly void and to be delivered up to be cancelled315 footnote 315 fleay a chronicle history of the london stage p 248 armed with these written assurances and with the royal commission to take up children evans and giles began to form their company this explains the language used by heminges and burbage let the said playhouse unto henry evans who intended then presently to erect or set up a company of boys316 their method of recruiting players may best be told by henry clifton in his complaint to the queen but so it is most excellent sovereign that the said nathaniel giles confederating himself with one james robinson henry evans and others317 yet unto your majestys said subject unknown how many by color of your majestys said letters patents and the trust by your highness thereby to him the said nathaniel

supplemented the children of the chapel proper with actors in a short time they brought together at blackfriars a remarkable troupe of boyplayers who with jonson and chapman as their poets began to astonish london for in spite of certain limitations the children could act with a charm and a grace that often made them more attractive than their grownup rivals middleton advises the london gallant to call in at the blackfriars where he should see a nest of boys able to ravish a man321 jonson gives eloquent testimony to the power of little salathiel pavy to portray the character of old age years

if the nuns at milan did not excel him we had not heard his equal in our travels324 in addition the children were provided with splendid apparelthough not at the cost of the queen as mr wallace contends325 naturally they became popular on january 6 1601 they were summoned to court to entertain her majestythe first recorded performance of the children of the chapel at court since the year

ibid p 248 kirkham and his partners spent 600 on apparel etc according to kirkhams statement perhaps the most interesting testimony to the success of the chapel children in their new playhouse is that uttered by shakespeare in hamlet 1601 in which he speaks of the performances by the little eyases as a late innovation the success of the innovation had driven shakespeare and his troupe of grownup actors to close the globe and travel in the country even though they had hamlet as an attraction the goodnatured way in which shakespeare treats the situation is worthy of special observation ham what players are they ros even those you were wont to take delight in the tragedians of the city326 ham how chances it they travel their residence both in reputation and profit was better both ways327 ros

on the sign of the globe playhouse ay that they do my lord hercules and his load too shortly after the great dramatist had penned these words the management of blackfriars met with disaster the cause however went back to december 13 1600 when giles and evans were gathering their players in their overweening confidence they made a stupid blunder in taking up for their troupe the only son and heir of henry clifton a welltodo gentleman of norfolk who had come to london for the purpose of educating the boy clifton says in his complaint that giles evans and their confederates well knowing that your subjects said son had no manner of sight in song nor skill in music on the 13th day of december 1600 did waylay the said thomas clifton as he was walking quietly from your subjects said house towards the said school and with great force and violence did seize and surprise and him with like force and violence did to the great terror and hurt of him the said thomas clifton haul pull drag and carry away to the said playhouse as soon as the father learned of this he hurried to the playhouse and made request to have his said son released but giles and evans utterly and scornfully refused to do this whereupon clifton threatened to complain to the privy council but evans and giles in very scornful manner willed your said subject to complain to whom he would clifton suggested that it was not fit that a gentleman of his sort should have his son and heir and that his only son to be so basely used giles and evans most arrogantly then and there answered that they had authority sufficient so to take any noblemans son in this land and further to irritate the father they immediately put into young thomass hand a scroll of paper containing part of one of their said plays or interludes and him the said thomas clifton commanded to learn the same by heart with the admonition that if he did not obey the said evans he should be surely whipped329 footnote 329 the full complaint is printed by fleay op cit p 127 clifton at once appealed to his friend sir john fortescue a member of the privy council at whose order young thomas was released and sent back to his studies apparently this ended the episode but clifton nourishing his animosity began to investigate the management of blackfriars and to collect evidence of similar abuses of the queens commission with the object of making complaint to the star chamber in october 1601 evans it seems learned of cliftons purpose for on the 21st of that month he deeded all his property to his soninlaw alexander hawkins330 clifton finally presented his complaint to the star chamber on december 15 1601331 but his complaint was probably not acted on until early in 1602 for during the christmas holidays the children were summoned as usual to present their play before the queen332 footnote 330 ibid pp 24445 footnote 331 wallace the children of the chapel at blackfriars p 84 note 4 footnote 332 on december 29 1601 sir dudley carleton wrote to his friend john chamberlain the queen dined this day privately at my lord chamberlains i came even now from the blackfriars where i saw her at the play with all her candid auditrices from this it has been generally assumed that elizabeth visited the playhouse in blackfriars to see the children act there and mr wallace in his the children of the chapel at blackfriars pp 26 87 9597 lays great emphasis upon it to show that the queen was directly responsible for establishing and managing the children at blackfriars but the assumption that the queen attended a performance at the blackfriars playhouse is i think unwarranted the lord chamberlain at this time was lord hunsdon who lived in the blackfriars no doubt on this christmas occasion he entertained the queen with a great dinner and after the dinner with a play given not in a playhouse but in his mansion lord cobham who was formerly lord chamberlain and who also lived in blackfriars had similarly entertained the queen with plays in blackfriars cf also the malone societys collections ii 52 furthermore the actors on this occasion were probably not the children of the chapel as mr wallace thinks but lord hunsdons own troupe possibly one of shakespeares new plays hamlet was then presented before the queen for the first time shortly after this however the star chamber passed on cliftons complaint the decree itself is lost but the following reference to it is made in a subsequent lawsuit the said evans was censured by the right honorable court of star chamber for his unorderly carriage and behaviour in taking up of gentlemens children against their wills and to employ them for players and for other misdemeanors in the said decree contained and further that all assurances made to the said evans concerning the said house or plays or interludes should be utterly void and to be delivered up to be canceled333 doubtless the decree fell with equal force upon giles and the others connected with the enterprise for after the star chamber decree giles and robinson disappear from the management of the playhouse evans was forbidden to have any connection with plays there and for a time no doubt the building was closed footnote 333 fleay op cit p 248 evans however still held the lease and was under the necessity of paying the rent as before then came forward edward kirkham who in his official capacity as yeoman of the revels had become acquainted with the dramatic activities of the children of the chapel he saw an opportunity to take over the blackfriars venture now that evans and probably giles had been forbidden by the star chamber to have any connection with plays in that building having associated with him william rastell a merchant and thomas kendall334 a haberdasher he made overtures to evans the owner of the lease evans however was determined to retain a halfinterest in the playhouse and to evade the order of the star chamber by using his soninlaw alexander hawkins as his agent accordingly on april 20 1602 articles of agreement were signed between evans and hawkins on the one part and kirkham rastell and kendall on the other part whereby the latter were admitted to a halfinterest in the playhouse and in the troupe of childactors kirkham rastell and kendall agreed to pay onehalf of the annual rent of 40335 to pay onehalf of the repairs on the building and in addition to spend 400 on apparel and furnishings for the troupe under this reorganizationwith evans as a secret partnerthe children continued to act with their customary success footnote 334 we find in henslowes diary a player named william kendall but we do not know that he was related to thomas footnote 335 the agreements remind one of the organization of the globe it seems clear that kirkham rastell and kendall held their moiety in joint tenancy about a month later however lord hunsdon the lord chamberlain whose house adjoined blackfriars seems to have inquired into the affairs of the new organization336 what kirkham told him led him to order evans off the premises evans informs us that he was commanded by his lordship to avoid and leave the same for fear of whose displeasure the complainant evans was forced to leave the country337 he felt it prudent to remain away from london for a long space and time yet he lost nothing for he left the said alexander hawkins to deal for him and to take such benefit of the said house as should belong unto him in his absence338 footnote 336 fleay op cit pp 21113 216 220 footnote 337 ibid p 220 footnote 338 ibid p 217 if we may judge from the enthusiastic account given by the duke of stettinpomerania who visited blackfriars in the september following the children were just as effective under kirkhams management as they had been under the management of giles and evans it is to be noted however that elizabeth did not again invite the blackfriars troupe to the court the death of the queen in 1603 led to the closing of all playhouses this was followed by a long attack of the plague so that for many months blackfriars was closed and by reason thereof no such profit and commodity was raised and made of and by the said playhouse as was hoped for339 evans actually treated with richard burbage about the surrendering and giving up the said lease but burbage declined to consider the matter footnote 339 fleay op cit p 235 shortly after this the plague ceased and acting stimulated by king jamess patronage was resumed with fervor the blackfriars company was reorganized under edward kirkham alexander hawkins acting for evans thomas kendall and robert payne and on february 4 1604 it secured a royal patent to play under the title the children of the queens revels340 according to this patent the poet samuel daniel was specially appointed to license their plays provided always that no such plays or shows shall be presented before the said queen our wife by the said children or by them anywhere publicly acted but by the approbation and allowance of samuel daniel whom her pleasure is to appoint for that purpose at this time too or not long after john marston was allowed a share in the organization and thus was retained as one of its regular playwrights footnote 340 for the patent commonly misdated january 30 see the malone societys collections i 267 mr wallace in the century magazine september 1910 p 747 says that the company secured its patent through the intercessions of the poet samuel daniel it is true that the children of her majestys royal chamber of bristol secured their patent in 1615 at the intercession of daniel but i know of no evidence that he intervened in behalf of the blackfriars troupe the success of the new company is indicated by the fact that it was summoned to present a play at court in february 1604 and again two plays in january 1605 evanss activity in the management of the troupe in spite of the order of the star chamber is evident from the fact that the payment for the last two court performances was made directly to him in the spring of 1604 the company gave serious offense by acting samuel daniels philotas which was supposed to relate to the unfortunate earl of essex but the blame must have fallen largely on daniel who not only wrote the play but also licensed its performance he was summoned before the privy council to explain and seems to have fully proved his innocence shortly after this he published the play with an apology affixed341 footnote 341 a letter from daniel to the earl of devonshire vindicating the play is printed in grosarts daniel i xxii the following year the children gave much more serious offense by acting eastward hoe a comedy in which marston chapman and jonson collaborated not only did the play ridicule the scots in general and king jamess creation of innumerable knights in particular but one of the little actors was actually made it seems to mimic the royal brogue i ken the man weel he is one of my thirty pound knights marston escaped by timely flight but jonson and chapman were arrested and lodged in jail and were for a time in some danger of having their nostrils slit and their ears cropped both chapman and jonson asserted that they were wholly innocent and chapman openly put the blame of the offensive passages on marston342 marston however was beyond the reach of the kings wrath so his majesty punished instead the men in control of blackfriars it was discovered that the manager kirkham had presented the play without securing the lord chamberlains allowance as a result he and the others in charge of the children were prohibited from any further connection with the playhouse this doubtless explains the fact that kirkham shortly after appears as one of the managers of pauls boys343 it explains also the following statement made by evans in the course of one of the later legal documents after the kings most excellent majesty upon some misdemeanors committed in or about the plays there and specially upon the defendants kirkhams acts and doings there had prohibited that no plays should be more used there etc344 not only was kirkham driven from the management of the troupe and the playhouse closed for a time but the children were denied the queens patronage no longer were they allowed to use the highsounding title the children of the queens majestys revels instead we find them described merely as the children of the revels or as the children of blackfriars345 footnote 342 see dobell newly discovered documents in the athenum march 30 1901 footnote 343 cunningham revels p xxxviii footnote 344 fleay op cit p 221 footnote 345 except carelessly as when sometimes called the children of the chapel for a time no doubt affairs at the playhouse were at a standstill evans again sought to surrender his lease to burbage but without success346 marston having escaped the wrath of the king by flight decided to end his career as a playwright and turn country parson it was shortly after this in all probability that he sold his share in the blackfriars organization to one robert keysar a goldsmith of london for the sum of 100347 footnote 346 wallace shakespeare and his london associates p 82 footnote 347 ibid pp 81 86 89 93 keysar it seems undertook to reopen the playhouse and to continue the children there at his own expense348 from the proprietors he rented the playhouse the stock of apparel the furnishings and playbooks this i take it explains the puzzling statement made by kirkham some years later this repliant kirkham and his said partners rastell and kendall have had and received the sum of one hundred pounds per annum for their part and moiety in the premises without any manner of charges whatsoever ie during kirkhams management of the troupe prior to 1605349 and after that this replyant and his said partners had received the foresaid profits ie after kirkham and his partners had to give up the management of the children in 1605 the said children which the said evans in his answer affirmeth to be the queens children ie they are no longer the queens children for after 1605 they had been deprived of the queens patronage but kirkham was in error for evans with legal precision had referred to the company as the queens majestys children of the revels for so it was often called were masters themselves ie their own managers and this complainant and his said partners received of them and of one keysar who was interest with them above the sum of one hundred and fifty pounds per annum only for the use of the said great hall without all manner of charges as this replyant will make it manifest to this honorable court350 footnote 348 wallace shakespeare and his london associates p 80 ff footnote 349 that is 33 more or less a share we have documentary evidence to show that a share in the red bull produced 30 and a share in the globe 30 to 40 per annum footnote 350 fleay op cit p 249 the yearly rental must have included not only the playhouse and its equipment but the playbooks apparel properties etc belonging to the children these were on july 26 1608 divided up among the sharers kirkham rastell kendall and evans under keysars management the blackfriars troupe continued to act as the children of the revels but unfortunately they had not learned wisdom from their recent experience and in the very following year we find them again in serious trouble john days isle of guls acted in february 1606 gave great offense to the court sir edward hoby in a letter to sir thomas edwards351 writes at this time was much speech of a play in the blackfriars where in the isle of guls from the highest to the lowest all mens parts were acted of two diverse nations as i understand sundry were committed to bridewell352 footnote 351 birch court and times of james the first i 60 quoted by ek chambers in modern language review iv 158 footnote 352 possibly an aftermath of the kings displeasure is to be found in the cancellation of giless longstanding commission to take up boys for the chapel and the issuance of a new commission to him november 7 1606 with the distinct proviso that none of the said choristers or children of the chapel so to be taken by force of this commission shall be used or employed as commedians or stage players the malone societys collections i 357 the children however were soon allowed to resume playing and they continued for a time without mishap but in the early spring of 1608 they committed the most serious offense of all by acting chapmans conspiracy and tragedy of charles duke of byron the french ambassador took umbrage at the uncomplimentary representation of the contemporary french court and had an order made forbidding them to act the play but the children voyant toute la cour dehors ne laisserent de la faire et non seulement cela mais y introduiserent la reine et madame de verneuil traitant celleci fort mal de paroles et lui donnant un soufflet whereupon the french ambassador made special complaint to salisbury who ordered the arrest of the author and the actors toutefois il ne sen trouva que trois qui aussitt furent mens la prison o ils sont encore mais le principal qui est le compositeur chapa353 the ambassador observes also that a few days before the children of the revels had given offense by a play on king james un jour ou deux avant ils avoient dpch leur roi sa mine decosse et tous ses favoris dune trange sorte car aprs lui avoir fait dpiter le ciel sur le vol dun oisseau et fait battre un gentilhomme pour avoir rompu ses chiens ils le dpeignoient ivre pour le moins une fois le jour354 as a result of these two offenses coming as a climax to a long series of such offenses the king was extrmement irrit contre ces maraudsl and gave order for their immediate suppression this marked the end of the childactors at blackfriars footnote 353 from the report of the french ambassador m de la boderie to m de puisieux at paris ambassades de monsieur de la boderie en angleterre 1750 iii 196 quoted by ek chambers in modern language review iv 158 footnote 354 the name of this play is not known probably the king was satirized in a comic scene foisted upon an otherwise innocent piece mr wallace in the century magazine september 1910 p 747 says from a document i have found in france the blackfriars boys now satirized the kings efforts to raise money made local jokes on the recent discovery of his silver mine in scotland brought him on the stage as drunk and showed such to be his condition at least three times a day caricatured him in his favorite pastime of hawking and represented him as swearing and cursing at a gentleman for losing a bird i do not know what document mr wallace has found the french document quoted above has been known for a long time naturally kirkham rastell and kendall since there was no profit made of the said house but a continual rent of forty pounds to be paid for the same became sick of their bargain with evans an additional reason for their wishing to withdraw finally from the enterprise was the rapid increase of the plague which about july 25 closed all playhouses so kirkham at or about the 26 of july 1608 caused the apparrels properties and goods belonging to the copartners sharers and masters to be divided kirkham and his associates took away their portions and quit the place the onetime manager using to evans some unkind words said he would deal no more with it for quod he it is a base thing or used words to such or very like effect355 evans thus deserted by kirkham rastell and kendall regarded the organization of the blackfriars as dissolved he delivered up their commission which he had under the great seal authorizing them to play and discharged diverse of the partners and poets footnote 355 fleay op cit pp 22122 robert keysar however the old manager laid plans to keep the children together and continue them as a troupe after the cessation of the plague for a while we are told he maintained them at his own expense in hope to have enjoyed his said bargain upon the ceasing of the general sickness356 and he expected by virtue of the share he had purchased from john marston to be able to use the blackfriars playhouse for his purpose footnote 356 wallace shakespeare and his london associates pp 83 97 in the meanwhile evans began negotiations with burbage for the surrender of the lease by reason the said premises lay then and had long lyen void and without use for plays whereby the same became not only burthensome and unprofitable unto the said evans but also ran far into decay for want of reparations the said evans began to treat with the said richard burbage about a surrender of the said evans his said lease357 this time burbage listened to the proposal for he and his fellowactors at the globe considered that the house would be fit for themselves so in august 1608 he agreed to take over the building for the use of the kings men footnote 357 ibid p 87 even after evanss surrender of the lease keysar it seems made an effort to keep the children together on the following christmas 160809 we find a record of payment to him for performances at court by the children of blackfriars but soon after this the troupe must have been disbanded keysar says that they were enforced to be dispersed and turned away to the abundant hurt of the said young men358 and the burbages and heminges declare that the children were dispersed and driven each of them to provide for himself by reason that the plays ceasing in the city of london either through sickness or for some other cause he the said complainant keysar was no longer able to maintain them together359 in the autumn of 1609 however keysar assembled the children again reorganized them with the assistance of philip rosseter and placed them in whitefriars playhouse recently left vacant by the disruption of the children of his majestys revels their subsequent history will be found related in the chapter dealing with that theatre footnote 358 ibid p 90 footnote 359 wallace shakespeare and his london associates p 97 when in august 1608 richard burbage secured from evans the surrender of the blackfriars lease he at once proceeded to organize from the globe company a syndicate to operate the building as a playhouse he admitted to partnership in the new enterprise all of the then sharers in the globe except witter and nichols outsiders who had secured their interest through marriage with the heirs of pope and phillips and who therefore were not entitled to any consideration in addition he admitted henry evans doubtless in fulfillment of a condition in the surrender of the lease the syndicate thus formed was made up of seven equal sharers as follows richard burbage cuthbert burbage henry evans william shakespeare john heminges henry condell and william slye these sharers leased the building from richard burbage for a period of twentyone years360 at the old rental of 40 per annum each binding himself to pay annually the sum of 5 14s 4d361 the method of distributing the profits between the sharers known as housekeepers and the actors known as the company was to be the same as that practiced at the globe362 footnote 360 twentyone years was a very common term for a lease to run but in this case no doubt it was intended that the lease of blackfriars should last as long as the lease of the globe which then had exactly twentyone years to run footnote 361 shortly after this agreement had been made william slye died and his executrix delivered up his share to richard burbage to be cancelled and made void see the hemingesosteler documents printed by mr wallace in the london times october 4 1909 in 1611 burbage let william osteler have this share footnote 362 the method is clearly explained in the documents of 1635 printed by halliwellphillipps in outlines i 312 soon after this organization was completed the kings men moved from the globe to the blackfriars they did not of course intend to abandon the globe their plan was to use the blackfriars as a winter home and the globe as a summer house363 malone observed from the herbert manuscript that the kings company usually began to play at the globe in the month of may364 although he failed to state at what time in the autumn they usually moved to the blackfriars the evidence points to the first of november footnote 363 see wright historia histrionica hazlitts dodsley xv 406 footnote 364 malone variorum iii 71 such a plan had many advantages for one thing it would prevent the pecuniary losses often caused by a severe winter in the poetaster 1601 jonson makes histrio representing the globe players say o it will get us a huge deal of money and we have need ont for this winter has made us all poorer than so many starved snakes nobody comes at us365 this could not be said of the kings men after they moved to the blackfriars edward kirkham a man experienced in theatrical finances offered to prove to the court in 1612 that the kings men got and as yet doth more in one winter in the said great hall by a thousand pounds than they were used to get on the bankside366 footnote 365 act iii scene iv cf also websters preface to the white devil acted at the red bull about 1610 footnote 366 fleay a chronicle history of the london stage p 248 kirkhams testimony as to the popularity of the kings men in their winter home is borne out by a petition to the city authorities made by the constables and other officers and inhabitants of blackfriars in january 1619 they declared that to the playhouse there is daily such resort of people and such multitudes of coaches whereof many are hackneycoaches bringing people of all sorts that sometimes all our streets cannot contain them but that they clog up ludgate also in such sort that both they endanger the one the other break down stalls throw down mens goods from their shops and the inhabitants there cannot come to their houses nor bring in their necessary provisions of beer wood coal or hay nor the tradesmen or shopkeepers utter their wares nor the passenger go to the common water stairs without danger of their lives and limbs these inconveniences were said to last every day in the winter time from one or two of the clock till six at night367 footnote 367 the malone societys collections i 91 as a result of this petition the london common council ordered january 21 1619 that the said playhouses be suppressed and that the players shall from thenceforth forbear and desist from playing in that house368 but the players had at court many influential friends and these apparently came to their rescue the order of the common council was not put into effect and so far as we know the only result of this agitation was that king james on march 27 issued to his actors a new patent specifically giving themdescribed as his wellbeloved servantsthe right henceforth to play unmolested in blackfriars the new clause in the patent runs as well within their two their now usual houses called the globe within our county of surrey and their private house situate in the precinct of the blackfriars within our city of london369 at the accession of king charles i the patent was renewed june 24 1625 with the same clause regarding the use of blackfriars370 footnote 368 halliwellphillipps outlines i 311 footnote 369 the malone societys collections i 281 footnote 370 ibid i 282 in 1631 however the agitation was renewed this time in the form of a petition from the churchwardens and constables of the precinct of blackfriars to william laud then bishop of london the document gives such eloquent testimony to the popularity of the playhouse that i have inserted it below in full to the right honorable and right reverend father in god william lord bishop of london one of his majestys honorable privy council the humble petition of the churchwardens and constables of blackfriars on the behalf of the whole parish showing that by reason of a playhouse exceedingly frequented in the precinct of the said blackfriars the inhabitants there suffer many grievances upon the inconveniences hereunto annexed and many other may it therefore please your lordship to take the said grievances into your honorable consideration for the redressing thereof and for the reviving the order which hath been heretofore made by the lords of the council and the lord mayor and the court of aldermen for the removal of them and they shall according to their duties ever pray for your lordship reasons and inconveniences inducing the inhabitants of blackfriars london to become humble suitors to your lordship for removing the playhouse in the said blackfriars 1 the shopkeepers in divers places suffer much being hindered by the great recourse to the plays especially of coaches from selling their commodities and having their wares many times broken and beaten off their stalls 2 the recourse of coaches is many times so great that the inhabitants cannot in an afternoon take in any provision of beer coals wood or hay the streets being known to be so exceeding straight and narrow 3 the passage through ludgate to the water ie water lane is many times stopped up people in their ordinary going much endangered quarrels and bloodshed many times occasioned and many disorderly people towards night gathered thither under pretense of attending and waiting for those at the plays 4 if there should happen any misfortune of fire there is not likely any present order could possibly be taken for the disorder and number of the coaches since there could be no speedy passage made for quenching the fire to the endangering of the parish and city 5 christenings and burials which usually are in the afternoon are many times disturbed and persons endangered in that part which is the greatest part of the parish 6 persons of honor and quality that dwell in the parish are restrained by the number of coaches from going out or coming home in seasonable time to the prejudice of their occasions and some persons of honor have left and others have refused houses for this very inconvenience to the prejudice and loss of the parish 7 the lords of the council in former times have by order directed that there shall be but two playhouses tolerated and those without the city the one at the bankside the other near golding lane which these players still have and use all summer which the lords did signify by their letters to the lord mayor and in performance thereof the lord mayor and the court of aldermen did give order that they should forbear to play any longer there which the players promised to the lord chief justice of the common pleas while he was recorder of london to observe entreating only a little time to provide themselves elsewhere371 footnote 371 collier history of english dramatic poetry 1879 i 455 bishop laud endorsed the petition with his own hand to the coun table and in all probability he submitted it to the consideration of the privy council if so the council took no action but in 1633 as a result of further complaints about the crowding of coaches the privy council appointed a committee to estimate the value of the blackfriars theatre and the buildings thereunto belonging with the idea of removing the playhouse and paying the owners therefor the committee reported that the players demanded 21000 the commissioners sir henry spiller sir william beecher and laurence whitaker valued it at near 3000 the parishioners offered towards the removing of them 100372 obviously the plan of removal was not feasible if indeed the privy council seriously contemplated such action the only result of this second agitation was the issuance on november 20 of special instructions to coachmen if any persons men or women of what condition soever repair to the aforesaid playhouse in coach as soon as they are gone out of their coaches the coachmen shall depart thence and not return till the end of the play373 garrard in a letter to the lord deputy dated january 9 1633 says here hath been an order of the lords of the council hung up in a table near pauls and the blackfriars to command all that resort to the playhouse there to send away their coaches and to disperse abroad in pauls churchyard carter lane the conduit in fleet street and other places and not to return to fetch their company but they must trot afoot to find their coaches twas kept very strictly for two or three weeks but now i think it is disordered again374 the truth is that certain distinguished patrons of the theatre did not care to trot afoot to find their coaches and so made complaint at court as a result it was ordered at a sitting of the council december 29 1633 the king being present upon information this day given to the board of the discommodity that diverse persons of great quality especially ladies and gentlewomen did receive in going to the playhouse of blackfriars by reason that no coaches may stand the board think fit to explain the said order in such manner that as many coaches as may stand within the blackfriars gate may enter and stay there375 footnote 372 the calendar of state papers domestic 1633 p 293 the report of the commissioners in full as printed by collier in new facts 1835 p 27 and again in history of english dramatic poetry 1879 i 477 is not above suspicion although mr ek chambers is inclined to think it genuine according to this document the actors estimated the property to be worth 21990 but the committee thought that the actors might be persuaded to accept 2900 13s 4d footnote 373 the malone societys collections i 99 387 footnote 374 the earl of straffordes letters dublin 1740 i 175 footnote 375 the malone societys collections i 388 all this agitation about coaches implies a fashionable and wealthy patronage of the blackfriars an interesting glimpse of high society at the theatre is given in a letter written by garrard january 25 1636 a little pique happened betwixt the duke of lenox and the lord chamberlain about a box at a new play in the blackfriars of which the duke had got the key which if it had come to be debated betwixt them as it was once intended some heat or perhaps other inconvenience might have happened376 the queen herself also sometimes went thither herbert records without any comment her presence there on the 13 of may 1634377 it has been generally assumed that she attended a regular afternoon performance but this i am sure was not the case the queen engaged the entire building for the private entertainment of herself and her specially invited guests and the performance was at night in a bill presented by the kings men for plays acted before the members of the royal family during the year 1636 occurs the entry the 5th of may at the blackfryers for the queene and the prince elector alfonso again in a similar bill for the year 1638 see the bill on page 404 is the entry at the blackfryers the 23 of aprill for the queene the unfortunate lovers the fact that the actors did not record the loss of their day at their house and made their charge accordingly shows that the plays were given at night and did not interfere with the usual afternoon performances before the public footnote 376 the earl of straffordes letters dublin 1740 i 511 footnote 377 the herbert ms malone variorum iii 167 the kings men continued to occupy the blackfriars as their winter home until the closing of the theatres in 1642 thereafter the building must have stood empty for a number of years in 1653 sir aston cokaine in a poem prefixed to richard bromes plays looked forward prophetically to the happy day when black and white friars too shall flourish again but the prophecy was not to be fulfilled for although whitefriars ie salisbury court did flourish as a restoration playhouse the more famous blackfriars had ceased to exist before acting was allowed again the manuscript note in the phillipps copy of stows annals 1631 informs us that the blackfriars players playhouse in blackfriars london which had stood many years was pulled down to the ground on monday the 6 day of august 1655 and tenements built in the room378 footnote 378 see the academy 1882 xxii 314 exactly the same fate had overtaken the globe ten years earlier chapter xii the globe as related more fully in the chapter on the theatre when cuthbert and richard burbage discovered that gyles alleyn not only refused to renew the lease for the land on which their playhouse stood but was actually planning to seize the building and devote it to his private uses they took immediate steps to thwart him and in doing so they evolved a new and admirable scheme of theatrical management they planned to bring together into a syndicate or stockcompany some of the best actors of the day and allow these actors to share in the ownership of the building hitherto playhouses had been erected merely as pecuniary investments by profitseeking business menburbage379 brayne lanman henslowe cholmley langleyand had been conducted in the interests of the proprietors rather than of the actors380 as a result these proprietors had long reaped an unduly rich harvest from the efforts of the players taking all or a large share of the income from the galleries the new scheme was designed to remedy these faults footnote 379 that even james burbage is to be put in this class cannot be disputed footnote 380 cuthbert burbage in 1635 says the players that lived in those first times had only the profits arising from the doors but now the players receive all the comingsin at the doors to themselves and half the galleries from the housekeepers halliwellphillipps outlines i 317 illustration richard burbage reproduced by permission from a painting in the dulwich picture gallery photograph by emery walker ltd for participation in this scheme the burbages selected the following men william shakespeare not only a successful actor but a poet who had already made his reputation as a writer of plays and who gave promise of greater attainments john heminges a good actor and an exceptionally shrewd man of business who until his death managed the pecuniary affairs of the company with distinguished success augustine phillips and thomas pope both ranked with the best actors of the day381 and william kempe the greatest comedian since tarleton described in 1600 as a player in interludes and partly the queens majestys jester when to this group we add richard burbage himself the roscius of his age we have an organization of business histrionic and poetic ability that could not be surpassed it was carefully planned and it deserved the remarkable success which it attained the superiority of the globe company over all others was acknowledged in the days of james and charles and today stands out as one of the most impressive facts in the history of the early drama footnote 381 see for example thomas heywoods apology for actors 1612 in enumerating the greatest actors of england he says gabriel singer pope phillips slyall the right i can do them is but this that though they be dead their deserts yet live in the remembrance of many according to the original plan there were to be ten shares in the new enterprise the burbage brothers holding between them onehalf the stock or two and a half shares each and the five actors holding the other half or one share each all the expenses of leasing a site erecting a building and subsequently operating the building as a playhouse and likewise all the profits to accrue therefrom were to be divided among the sharers according to their several holdings this organization it should be understood merely concerned the ownership of the building its members stood in the relation of landlords to the players and were known by the technical name of housekeepers wholly distinct was the organization of the players known as the company the company too was divided into shares for the purpose of distributing its profits the housekeepers in return for providing the building received onehalf of the income from the galleries the company for entertaining the public received the other half of the income from the galleries plus the takings at the doors those actors who were also housekeepers shared twice in the profits of the playhouse and it was a part of the plan of the housekeepers to admit actors to be sharers in the building as soon as they attained eminence or otherwise made their permanent connection with the playhouse desirable thus the two organizations though entirely distinct were interlocking such a scheme had many advantages in the first place it prevented the company from shifting from one playhouse to another as was frequently the case with other troupes in the second place it guaranteed both the excellence and the permanency of the company too often good companies were dissolved by the desertion of a few important members as every student of the drama knows the constant reorganization of troupes is one of the most exasperating features of elizabethan theatrical history in the third place the plan like all profitsharing schemes tended to elicit from each member of the organization his best powers the opportunity offered to a young actor ultimately to be admitted as a sharer in the ownership of the building was a constant source of inspiration382 and the power to admit at any time a new sharer enabled the company to recruit from other troupes brilliant actors when such appeared as for example william osteler and nathaniel field who had attained fame with the children at blackfriars and elsewhere finally the plan brought the actors together in a close bond of friendship that lasted for life heminges was loved and trusted by them all shakespeare was admired and revered three members of the troupe seem to have named their sons for him indeed there is nothing more inspiring in a close study of all the documents relating to the globe than the mutual loyalty and devotion of the original sharers the publication of shakespeares plays by heminges and condell is merely one out of many expressions of this splendid comradeship footnote 382 the petitioners have a long time with much patience expected to be admitted sharers in the playhouses of the globe and the blackfriars whereby they might reap some better fruit of their labour than hitherto they have done and be encouraged to proceed therein with cheerfulness the young players petition 1635 printed by halliwellphillipps outlines i 312 the plan of organization having been evolved and the original members having been selected the first question presenting itself was where should the new playhouse be erected burbage heminges and the restincluding shakespeareprobably gave the question much thought their experience in holywell had not been pleasant the precinct of blackfriars they now well realized was out of the question so they turned their eyes to the bankside that section had recently become the theatrical centre of london there were situated the rose the swan and the bear garden and thither each day thousands of persons flocked in search of entertainment clearly the bankside was best suited to their purpose near the fine old church of st mary overies and not far from the rose and the bear garden they found a plot of land that met their approval its owner sir nicholas brend was willing to lease it for a long term of years and at a very reasonable rate they made a verbal contract with brend according to which the lease was to begin on december 25 1598 illustration william shakespeare shakespeare seems to have been equally with burbage a leader in erecting the globe in 1599 the building is officially described as vna domo de novo edificata in occupacione willielmi shakespeare et aliorum three days later on december 28 richard and cuthbert burbage having secured the services of the carpenter peter street and his workmen tore down the old theatre and transported the timber and other materials to this new site across the river and shortly after the globe began to lift itself above the houses of the banksidea handsome theatre surpassing anything then known to london playgoers in the meantime the lawyers had drawn up the lease and this was formally signed on february 21 1599 the company had arranged a tripartite lease the three parties being sir nicholas brend the burbage brothers and the five actors383 to the burbages sir nicholas leased onehalf of the property at a yearly rental of 7 5s and to the five actors he leased the other half at the same rate thus the total rent paid for the land was 14 10s the lease was to run for a period of thirtyone years footnote 383 exact information about the lease and the organization of the company is derived from the hemingesosteler and the witterheminges documents both discovered and printed by mr wallace and with these one should compare the article by the same author in the london times april 30 may 1 1914 the five actors not satisfied with tying up the property in the tripartite lease proceeded at once to arrange their holdings in the form of a joint tenancy this they accomplished by the following device william shakespeare augustine phillips thomas pope john heminges and william kempe did shortly after grant and assign all the said moiety of and in the said gardens and grounds unto william levison and thomas savage who regranted and reassigned to every one of them severally a fifth part of the said moiety of the said gardens and grounds384 footnote 384 wallace shakespeare and his london associates p 53 shakespeares leadership in the erection of the globe is indicated in several documents for example the postmortem inquisition of the estate of sir thomas brend may 16 1599 the object of the joint tenancy was to prevent any member of the organization from disposing of his share to an outsider legally at the death of a member his share passed into the possession of the other members so that the last survivor would receive the whole in reality however the members used the joint tenancy merely to control the disposition of the shares and they always allowed the heirsatlaw to receive the share of a deceased member the wisdom of this arrangement was quickly shown for about the time of the building of said playhouse and galleries or shortly after william kempe decided to withdraw from the enterprise he had to dispose of his share to the other parties in the joint tenancy shakespeare heminges phillips and pope who at once divided it equally among themselves and again went through the process necessary to place that share in joint tenancy after the retirement of kempe the organization it will be observed consisted of six men and the shares were eight in number owned as follows richard burbage and cuthbert burbage each two shares shakespeare heminges phillips and pope each one share illustration a plan of the globe property based on the lease and on other documents and references to the property the tract of land on which the new playhouse was to be erected is minutely described in the lease385 as follows all that parcel of ground just recently before enclosed and made into four separate garden plots recently in the tenure and occupation of thomas burt and isbrand morris diers and lactantius roper salter citizen of london containing in length from east to west two hundred and twenty feet in assize or thereabouts lying and adjoining upon a way or lane there on one the south side and abutting upon a piece of land called the park386 upon the north and upon a garden then or recently in the tenure or occupation of one john cornishe toward the west and upon another garden plot then or recently in the tenure or occupation of one john knowles toward the east with all the houses buildings structures ways easements commodities and appurtenances thereunto belonging and also all that parcel of land just recently before enclosed and made into three separate garden plots whereof two of the same were recently in the tenure or occupation of john roberts carpenter and another recently in the occupation of one thomas ditcher citizen and merchant tailor of london containing in length from east to west by estimation one hundred fifty and six feet of assize or thereabouts and in breadth from the north to the south one hundred feet of assize by estimation or thereabouts lying and adjoining upon the other side of the way or lane aforesaid and abutting upon a garden plot there then or recently just before in the occupation of william sellers toward the east and upon one other garden plot there then or recently just before in the tenure of john burgram sadler toward the west and upon a lane there called maiden lane towards the south with all the houses footnote 385 the lease is incorporated in the hemingesosteler documents which mr wallace has translated from the anglicized latin the original latin text may be found in martin the site of the globe playhouse of shakespeare pp 16162 since however that text is faultily reproduced i quote mr wallaces translation footnote 386 what is meant by the park is a matter of dispute some contend that the park of the bishop of winchester is meant it may be however that some small estate is referred to in support of the latter contention one might cite colliers memoirs of edward alleyn p 91 part of the document printed by collier may have been tampered with but there is no reason to suspect the two references to the parke this document clearly states that the globe property was situated to the north of maiden lane and consequently near the river virtually all the contemporary maps of london show the globe as so situated mr wallace has produced some very specific evidence to support the document cited above and he claims to have additional evidence as yet unpublished on the other hand there is at least some evidence to indicate that the globe was situated to the south of maiden lane387 footnote 387 for the discussions of the subject see the bibliography for the purposes of this book it is sufficient to know that the globe was situate in maiden lane whether on the north side or the south side is of less importance more important is the nature of the site strype in his edition of stows survey gives this description maiden lane a long straggling place with ditches on each side the passage to the houses being over little bridges with little garden plots before them especially on the north side which is best both for houses and inhabitants in maiden lane near one of these ditches or sewers the globe was erected and like the other houses there situated it was approached over a bridge388 in february 1606 the sewer commission ordered that the owners of the playhouse called the globe in maid lane shall before the 20 day of april next pull up and take clean out of the sewer the props or posts which stand under their bridge on the north side of maid lane389 the ground on which the building was erected was marshy and the foundations were made by driving piles deep into the soil ben jonson tersely writes390 the globe the glory of the bank flanked with a ditch and forced out of a marish footnote 388 this was probably not the only means of approach footnote 389 wallace in the london times april 30 1914 p 10 notes and queries xi series xi 448 footnote 390 an execration upon vulcan into the construction of the new playhouse went the timber and other materials secured from the old theatre but much new material of course had to be added it is a mistake to believe that the globe was merely the old theatre newly set up on the bankside and perhaps strengthened here and there when it was completed it was regarded as the last word in theatrical architecture dekker seems to have had the globe in mind in the following passage how wonderfully is the world altered and no marvel for it has lyein sick almost five thousand years so that it is no more like the old theater du munde than old paris garden is like the kings garden at paris what an excellent workman therefore were he that could cast the globe of it into a new mould391 in 1600 henslowe and alleyn used the globe as the model of their new and splendid fortune they sought indeed to show some originality by making their playhouse square instead of round but this the one instance in which they departed from the globe was a mistake and when the fortune was rebuilt in 1623 it was made circular in shape footnote 391 the guls hornbook published in 1609 but written earlier illustration the sites of the bear garden the rose and the globe marked by the author on a plan of the bankside printed in strypes survey of london 1720 illustration the bear garden the rose and the first globe compare this view of the bankside with the preceding map from an equestrian portrait of king james i by delaram the city is represented as it was when james came to the throne in 1603 a few quotations from the fortune contract will throw some light upon the globe with suchlike stairs conveyances and divisions to the galleries without and within as are made and contrived in and to the lateerected playhouse called the globe and the said stage to be in all other proportions contrived and fashioned like unto the stage of the said playhouse called the globe and the said house and other things before mentioned to be made and done to be in all other contrivations conveyances fashions thing and things effected finished and done according to the manner and fashion of the said house called the globe saving only that all the principal and main posts shall be square and wrought pilasterwise with carved proportions called satyrs to be placed and set on the top of every of the said posts what kind of columns were used in the globe and how they were ornamented we do not know but presumably they were round jonson in every man out of his humour presented on the occasion of or shortly after the opening of the globe in 1599 says of one of his characters a welltimbered fellow he would have made a good column an he had been thought on when the house was abuilding392 that jonson thought well of the new playhouse is revealed in several places he speaks with some enthusiasm of this fairfitted globe393 and in the passage already quoted he calls it the glory of the bank footnote 392 jonsons works ed cunningham i 71 footnote 393 in the first quarto edition of every man out of his humour in shape the building was unquestionably polygonal or circular most probably polygonal on the outside and circular within mr ek chambers thinks it possible that it was square394 but there is abundant evidence to show that it was not the very name globe would hardly be suitable to a square building jonson describes the interior as a round395 the ballad on the burning of the house refers to the roof as being round as a tailors clew and the new globe which certainly was not square was erected on the old foundation396 the frame we know was of timber and the roof of thatch in front of the main door was suspended a sign of hercules bearing the globe upon his shoulders397 under which was written says malone the old motto totus mundus agit histrionem398 footnote 394 the stage of the globe p 356 footnote 395 induction to every man out of his humour ed cunningham i 66 footnote 396 i have not space to discuss the question further the foreign traveler who visited a bankside theatre probably the globe on july 3 1600 described it as theatrum ad morem antiquorum romanorum constructum ex lignis london times april 11 1914 thomas heywood in his apology for actors 1612 describing the roman playhouses says after these they composed others but differing in form from the theatre or amphitheatre and every such was called circus the frame globelike and merely round the evidence is cumulative and almost inexhaustible footnote 397 see hamlet ii ii 378 footnote 398 malone variorum iii 67 the earliest representation of the building is probably to be found in the delaram view of london opposite page 246 set in the background of an engraving of king james on horseback this view which presents the city as it was in 1603 when james came to the throne shows the bear garden at the left polygonal in shape the rose in the centre circular in shape and the globe at the right polygonal in shape it is again represented in visschers magnificent view of london which though printed in 1616 presents the city as it was several years earlier see page 253 the merian view of 1638 opposite page 256 is copied from visscher and the view in howells londinopolis 1657 is merely a slavish copy of merian these two views therefore so far as the globe is concerned have no special value399 footnote 399 the circular playhouse in delarams view is commonly accepted as a representation of the first globe but without reason the evidence which establishes the identity of the several playhouses pictured in the various maps of the bankside comes from a careful study of the bear garden the hope the rose the first globe the second globe and their sites together with a study of all the maps and views of london considered separately and in relation to one another such evidence is too complicated to be given here in full but it is quite conclusive illustration the first globe from an old drawing in an extraillustrated copy of pennants london now in the british museum apparently the drawing is based on visschers view the cost of the finished building is not exactly known mr wallace observes that it was erected at an original cost according to a later statement of 600 but upon better evidence approximately 400400 i am not aware of the better evidence to which mr wallace refers401 nor do i know whether the estimate of 400 includes the timber and materials of the old theatre furnished by the burbages if the theatre of 1576 cost nearly 700 and the second globe cost 1400 the sum of 400 seems too small footnote 400 the london times october 2 1909 footnote 401 possibly he gives this evidence in his the children of the chapel at blackfriars p 29 note 4 nor do we know exactly when the globe was finished and opened to the public on may 16 1599 a postmortem inquisition of the estate of sir thomas brend father of sir nicholas was taken among his other properties in southwark was listed the globe playhouse described as vna domo de novo edificata in occupacione willielmi shakespeare et aliorum402 from this statement mr wallace infers that the globe was finished and opened before may 16 1599 though this is possible the words used seem hardly to warrant the conclusion however we may feel sure that the actors the lord chamberlains men had moved into the building before the end of the summer footnote 402 wallace in the london times may 1 1914 almost at once they rose to the position of leadership in the drama for both shakespeare and burbage were now at the height of their powers it is true that in 1601 the popularity of the children at blackfriars and the subsequent war of the theatres interfered somewhat with their success but the interference was temporary and from this time on until the closing of the playhouses in 1642 the supremacy of the globe players was never really challenged when james came to the throne he recognized this supremacy by taking them under his royal patronage on may 19 1603 he issued to them a patent to play as the kings men403an honor that was as well deserved as it was signal footnote 403 printed in the malone society collections i 264 in the autumn of 1608 the proprietors of the globe acquired the blackfriars theatre for the use of their company during the severe winter months this splendid building situated in the very heart of the city was entirely roofed in and could be comfortably heated in cold weather henceforth the openair globe was used only during the pleasant season of the year that is according to the evidence of the herbert manuscript from about the first of may until the first of november on june 29 1613 the globe caught fire during the performance of a play and was burned to the groundthe first disaster of the sort recorded in english theatrical history the event aroused great interest in london and as a result we have numerous accounts of the catastrophe supplying us with full details we learn that on a warm sunneshine afternoon the large building was filled with peopleamong whom were ben jonson john taylor the waterpoet and sir henry wottonto witness a new play by william shakespeare and john fletcher called all is true or as we now know it henry viii produced with unusual magnificence upon the entrance of the king in the fourth scene of the first act two cannon were discharged in a royal salute one of the cannon hurled a bit of its wadding upon the roof and set fire to the thatch but persons in the audience were so interested in the play that for a time they paid no attention to the fire overhead as a result they were soon fleeing for their lives and within one short hour nothing was left of the stately globe i quote below some of the more interesting contemporary accounts of this notable event howes the chronicler thus records the fact in his continuation of stows annals upon st peters day last the playhouse or theatre called the globe upon the bankside near london by negligent discharge of a peal of ordnance close to the south side thereof the thatch took fire and the wind suddenly dispersed the flames round about and in a very short space the whole building was quite consumed and no man hurt the house being filled with people to behold the play viz of henry the eight404 footnote 404 howess continuation of stows annals 1631 p 1003 sir henry wotton in a letter to a friend gives the following gossipy account now to let matters of state sleep i will entertain you at the present with what happened this week at the bankside the kings players had a new play called all is true representing some principal pieces of the reign of henry the eighth which was set forth with many extraordinary circumstances of pomp and majesty even to the matting of the stage the knights of the order with their georges and garter the guards with their embroidered coats and the likesufficient in truth within awhile to make greatness very familiar if not ridiculous now king henry making a masque at the cardinal wolseys house and certain cannons being shot off at his entry some of the paper or other stuff wherewith one of them was stopped did light on the thatch where being thought at first but an idle smoke and their eyes more attentive to the show it kindled inwardly and ran round like a train consuming within less than an hour the whole house to the very ground this was the fatal period of that virtuous fabrick wherein yet nothing did perish but wood and straw and a few forsaken cloaks only one man had his breeches set on fire that would perhaps have broiled him if he had not by the benefit of a provident wit put it out with bottle ale405 footnote 405 reliqui wottonian ed 1672 p 425 john chamberlain writing to sir ralph winwood july 8 1613 refers to the accident thus the burning of the globe or playhouse on the bankside on st peters day cannot escape you which fell out by a peal of chambers that i know not upon what occasion were to be used in the play the tampin or stopple of one of them lighting in the thatch that coverd the house burnd it down to the ground in less than two hours with a dwelling house adjoining and it was a great marvel and fair grace of god that the people had so little harm having but two narrow doors to get out406 footnote 406 ralph winwood memorials of affairs of state ed 1725 iii 469 illustration the first globe from visschers view of london published in 1616 but representing the city as it was several years earlier the reverend thomas lorkin writes from london to sir thomas puckering under the date of june 30 1613 no longer since than yesterday while burbages company were acting at the globe the play of henry viii and there shooting off certain chambers in way of triumph the fire catched and fastened upon the thatch of the house and there burned so furiously as it consumed the whole house all

tiles410 footnote 410 an execration upon vulcan the players were not seriously inconvenienced for they could shift to their other house the blackfriars in the city the owners of the building however suffered a not inconsiderable pecuniary loss for a time they hesitated about rebuilding one cause of their hesitation being the short term that their lease of the ground had to run possibly a second cause was a doubt as to the ownership of the ground arising from certain transactions recorded below in october 1600 sir nicholas brend had been forced to transfer the globe estate with other adjacent property to sir matthew brown and john collett as security for a debt of 2500 and a few days after he died since the son and heir matthew brend was a child less than two years old an uncle sir john bodley was appointed trustee in 1608 bodley by unfair means it seems purchased from collett the globe property and thus became the landlord of the actors but young matthew brend was still under age and bodleys title to the property was not regarded as above suspicion411 footnote 411 these interesting facts were revealed by mr wallace in the london times april 30 and may 1 1914 illustration merians view of london a section from merians view showing the bankside playhouses this view printed in ludvig gottfrieds neuwe archontologia cosmica frankfurt am mayn 1638 represents london as it was about the year 1612 and was mainly based on visschers view with some additions from other sources four months after the burning of the globe on october 26 1613 sir john bodley granted the proprietors of the building a renewal of the lease with an extension of the term until december 25 1635412 but a lease from bodley alone in view of the facts just indicated was not deemed sufficient so on february 14 1614 heminges the two burbages and condell visited the countryseat of the brends and secured the signature of the young matthew brend and of his mother as guardian to a lease of the globe site with a term ending on december 25 1644 footnote 412 did he increase the amount of the rental to 25 per annum the rent paid for the blackfriars was 40 per annum in 1635 the young actors state that the housekeepers paid for both playhouses not above 65 protected by these two leases the globe sharers felt secure and they went forward apace with the erection of their new playhouse they made an assessment of 50 or 60 upon each share413 since at this time there were fourteen shares the amount thus raised was 700 or 840 this would probably be enough to erect a building as large and as well equipped as the old globe but the proprietors determined upon a larger and a very much handsomer building as howes the continuer of stows annals writes it was new builded in far fairer manner than before or as john taylor the waterpoet puts it as gold is better thats in fire tried so is the bankside globe that late was burnd414 footnote 413 wallace shakespeare and his london associates p 60 footnote 414 works 1630 p 31 the spenser society reprint p 515 naturally the cost of rebuilding exceeded the original estimate heminges tells us that on one share or onefourteenth he was required to pay for the reedifying about the sum of 120415 this would indicate a total cost of about 1680 heminges should know for he was the business manager of the organization and his truthfulness cannot be questioned since however the adjective about especially when multiplied by fourteen leaves a generous margin of uncertainty it is gratifying to have a specific statement from one of the sharers in 1635 that the owners had been at the charge of 1400 in building of the said house upon the burning down of the former416 heminges tells us that he found that the reedifying of the said playhouse would be a very great charge and that he so doubted what benefit would arise thereby that he actually gave away half of one share to henry condell gratis417 but his fears were unfounded we learn from witter that after the rebuilding of the globe the yearly value of a share was greater by much than it had been before418 footnote 415 wallace shakespeare and his london associates p 61 footnote 416 halliwellphillipps outlines i 316 this evidence seems to me unimpeachable i should add however that mr wallace considers the estimate excessive and says that he has other contemporary documents showing the cost was far less than 1400 the london times october 2 1909 footnote 417 wallace shakespeare and his london associates p 61 there is i think no truth in the statement made by the inaccurate annotator of the phillipps copy of stows annals that the globe was built at the great charge of king james and many noblemen and others see the academy october 28 1882 p 314 the witterheminges documents sufficiently disprove that we may well believe however that the king and his noblemen were interested in the new building and encouraged the actors in many ways footnote 418 wallace shakespeare and his london associates p 70 the new globe like its predecessor was built of timber419 and on the same siteindeed the carpenters made use of the old foundation which seems not to have been seriously injured in a return of 1634 preserved at st saviours we read the globe playhouse near maid lane built by the company of players with a dwelling house thereto adjoining built with timber about 20 years past upon an old foundation420 in spite of the use made of the old foundation the new structure was unquestionably larger than the first globe marmion in the prologue to hollands leaguer acted at salisbury court in 1634 speaks of the vastness of the globe and shirley in the prologue to rosania applies the adjective vast to the building moreover the builders had the wit as jonson tells us to cover it with tiles john taylor the waterpoet writes for where before it had a thatched hide now to a stately theatre is turnd footnote 419 i see no reason to accept mr wallaces suggestion the children of the chapel at blackfriars p 34 note 7 that it seems questionable but not unlikely that the timber framework was brickveneered and plastered over mr wallace mistakenly accepts wilkinsons view of the second fortune as genuine footnote 420 rendle bankside p xvii the second globe is represented but unsatisfactorily in hollars view of london dated 1647 opposite page 260 it should be noted that the artist was in banishment from 1643 at which time the globe was still standing until 1652 and hence in drawing certain buildings especially those not reproduced in earlier views of london he may have had to rely upon his memory this would explain the general vagueness of his representation of the globe the construction was not hurried for the players had blackfriars as a home under normal conditions they did not move from the city to the bankside until some time in may and shortly after that date in the early summer of 1614 the new globe was ready for them john chamberlain writes to mrs alice carleton on june 30 1614 i have not seen your sister williams since i came to town though i have been there twice the first time she was at a neighbors house at cards and the next she was gone to the new globe to a play indeed i hear much speech of this new playhouse which is said to be the fairest that ever was in england421 footnote 421 birch the court and times of james the first i 329 quoted by wallace the children of the chapel at blackfriars p 35 illustration the second globe from hollars view of london 1647 with this new globe shakespeare had little to do for his career as a playwright had been run and probably he had already retired from acting time indeed was beginning to thin out the little band of friends who had initiated and made famous the globe organization thomas pope had died in 1603 augustine phillips in 1605 william slye in 1608 and just a few months after the opening of the new playhouse william osteler who had been admitted to the partnership in 1611 he had begun his career as a childactor at blackfriars had later joined the kings men and had married hemingess daughter thomasine a more serious blow to the company however fell in april 1616 when shakespeare himself died to the world he had been the applause delight the wonder of the stage but to the members of the globe company he had been for many years a friend and fellow only burbage and heminges described in 1614 as old heminges now remained of the original venturers and burbage passed away on march 13 1619 hes gone and with him what a world are dead which he revivdto be revived so no more young hamlet old hieronimo kind lear the grieved moor and more beside that lived in him have now for ever died422 footnote 422 from a folio ms in the huth library printed by jp collier in the history of english dramatic poetry 1879 i 411 and by various others many elegies in a similar vein were written celebrating his wonderful powers as an actor yet the tribute that perhaps affects us most deals with him merely as a man the earl of pembroke writing to the ambassador to germany gives the court news about the mighty ones of the kingdom my lord of lenox made a great supper to the french ambassador this night here and even now all the company are at a play which i being tenderhearted could not endure to see so soon after the loss of my old acquaintance burbage423 footnote 423 printed by mrs stopes burbage and shakespeares stage p 117 with many other interesting references to the great actor illustration the traditional site of the globe from wilkinsons theatrum illustrata 1825 this site is still advocated by some scholars compare page 245 in 1623 heminges and condell with great care and paine collected and published the plays of shakespeare onely to keep the memory of so worthy a friend and fellow alive and shortly after they too died condell in 1627 and heminges in 1630 after the passing of this group of men whose names are so familiar to us the history of the playhouse seems less important and may be chronicled briefly when young matthew brend came of age he recovered possession of the globe property by a decree of the court of wards apparently he accepted the lease executed by his uncle and guardian bodley by which the actors were to remain in possession of the globe until december 25 1635 but in 1633 he sought to cancel the lease he himself had executed as a minor by which the actors were to remain in possession until 1644 his purpose in thus seeking to gain possession of the globe was to lease it to other actors at a material increase in his profits424 naturally the owners of the globe were alarmed and they brought suit in the court of requests in 1635 one of the sharers john shanks declares that he is without any hope to renew the lease and he refers thus to the suit against brend when your suppliant purchased his parts in 1634 he had no certainty thereof more than for one year in the globe and there was a chargeable suit then pending in the court of requests between sir mathew brend knight and the lessees of the globe and their assigns for the adding of nine years to their lease in consideration that their predecessors had formerly been at the charge of 1400 in building of the said house425 the lessees ultimately won their contention and thus secured the right to occupy the globe until december 25 1644a term which as it happened was quite long enough for the puritans closed all playhouses in 1642 footnote 424 wallace shakespeare and the globe in the london times april 30 and may 1 1914 footnote 425 the petition of the young actors printed by halliwellphillipps outlines i 312 mrs stopes in burbage and shakespeares stage p 129 refers to a record of the suit mentioned by shanks dated february 6 1634 what disposition if any the sharers made of the globe between 1642 and 1644 we do not know but before the lease expired it seems brend demolished the playhouse and erected tenements on its site in the manuscript notes to the phillipps copy of stows annals we find the statement that the globe was pulled down to the ground by sir mathew brend on monday the 15 of april 1644 to make tenements in the room of it426 and the statement is verified by a mortgage executed in 1706 between elizabeth the surviving daughter and heir of thomas brend and one william james citizen of london the mortgage concerns all those messuages or tenements most of which were erected and built where the late playhouse called the globe stood and upon the ground thereunto belonging427 footnote 426 printed in the academy october 28 1882 p 314 should we read the date as 16445 footnote 427 william martin the site of the globe p 171 after this the history of the property becomes obscure mrs thrale later mrs piozzi the friend of samuel johnson whose residence was near by in deadmans place thought that she saw certain remains of the globe discovered by workmen in the employ of her husband428 for a long time thenor i thought it suchmy fate was bound up with the old globe theatre upon the bankside southwark the alley it had occupied having been purchased and the tenements thrown down by mr thrale to make an opening before the windows of our dwellinghouse when it lay desolate in a black heap of rubbish my mother one day in a joke called it the ruins of palmyra and after that they had laid it down in a grassplot palmyra was the name it went by but there were really curious remains of the old globe playhouse which though hexagonal in form without was round within in spite of serious difficulties in this narrative it is possible that the workmen in digging the ground preparatory to laying out the garden uncovered the foundation of the globe which it will be recalled was formed of piles driven deep into the soil and so well made that it resisted the fire of 1613429 footnote 428 printed in the builder march 26 1910 from the conway mss in mrs thrales handwriting footnote 429 for later discoveries of supposed globe relics all very doubtful see the london times october 8 1909 george hubbard the site of the globe theatre and william martin the site of the globe p 201 at the present time the site of the globe is covered by the extensive brewery of messrs barclay perkins and company upon one of the walls of the brewery on the south side of park street which was formerly maiden lane has been placed a bronze memorial tablet430 showing in relief the bankside with what is intended to be the globe playhouse conspicuously displayed in the foreground this is a circular building designed after the circular playhouse in the speedhondius view of london and represents as i have tried to show not the globe but the rose at the left side of the tablet is a bust of the poet modeled after the droeshout portrait at the right is the simple inscription here stood the globe playhouse of shakespeare footnote 430 the tablet was designed by dr william martin and executed by professor lanteri for photographs of it and of the place in which it is erected see the london illustrated news october 9 1909 cxxxv 500 yet it is very doubtful whether the globe really stood there mr wallace has produced good evidence to show that the building was on the north side of park street near the river and in the course of the present study i have found that site generally confirmed chapter xiii the fortune the erection of the globe on the bankside within a few hundred yards of the rose was hardly gratifying to the admirals men not only did it put them in close competition with the excellent burbageshakespeare organization but it caused their playhouse now nearly a quarter of a century old and said to be in a state of dangerous decay to suffer in comparison with the new and far handsomer globe the glory of the bank accordingly before the globe had been in operation much more than half a year henslowe and alleyn decided to move to another section of london and to erect there a playhouse that should surpass the globe both in size and in magnificence to the authorities however they gave as reasons for abandoning the rose first the dangerous decay of the building and secondly for that the same standeth very noisome for resort of people in the winter time the new playhouse was undertaken by henslowe and alleyn jointly although the exact arrangement between them is not now clear alleyn seems to have advanced the money and to have held the titles of ownership but on april 4 1601 he leased to henslowe a moiety or onehalf interest in the playhouse and other properties connected with it for a period of twentyfour years at an annual rental of 8a sum far below the real value of the moiety431 footnote 431 greg henslowe papers p 25 wallace three london theatres p 53 later alleyn rented to the actors the playhouse alone for 200 per annum in the document alleyn v william henslowe published by mr wallace in three london theatres p 52 it is revealed that this annual rental of 8 was canceled by alleyns rental of a house from henslowe on the bankside hence no actual payments by henslowe appear in the henslowealleyn papers whatever the details of the arrangement between the two partners the main outlines of their procedure are clear on december 22 1599 alleyn purchased for 240 a thirtythreeyear lease432 of a plot of ground situated to the north of the city in the parish of st giles without cripplegate this plot of ground we are told stood very tolerable near unto the fields and so far distant and remote from any person or place of account as that none can be annoyed thereby433 and yet as the earl of nottingham wrote it was very convenient for the ease of people434 footnote 432 later by a series of negotiations ending in 1610 alleyn secured the freehold of the property the total cost to him was 800 see greg henslowe papers pp 14 17 108 footnote 433 ibid p 50 footnote 434 ibid p 49 cf p 51 the property thus acquired lay between golding lane and whitecross street two parallel thoroughfares running north and south there were tenements on the edge of the property facing whitecross street tenements on the edge facing golding lane and an open space between alleyn and henslowe planned to erect their new playhouse in this open space between whitecross street and golding lane and to make a way leading to it from golding lane the ground set aside for the playhouse is described as containing in length from east to west one hundred twenty and seven feet and a half a little more or less and in breadth from north to south one hundred twenty and nine feet a little more or less435 footnote 435 collier the alleyn papers p 98 for a slightly different measurement of the plot see collier memoirs of edward alleyn p 167 the lease of this property having been consummated on december 22 1599 on january 8 1600 henslowe and alleyn signed a contract with the carpenter peter street who had recently gained valuable experience in building the globe to erect the new playhouse the contract called for the completion of the building by july 25 1600 provided however the workmen were not by any authority restrained the latter clause may indicate that peter street anticipated difficulties if so he was not mistaken for when early in january his workmen began to assemble material for the erection of the building the authorities especially those of the parish of st giles promptly interfered alleyn thereupon appealed to the patron of the troupe the earl of nottingham the lord admiral on january 12 1600 nottingham issued a warrant to the officers of the county to permit and suffer my said servant edward alleyn to proceed in the effecting and furnishing of the said new house without any your let or molestation toward him or any of his workmen436 this warrant however seems not to have prevented the authorities of st giles from continuing their restraint alleyn was then forced to play his trump cardthrough his great patron to secure from the privy council itself a warrant for the construction of the building first however by offering to give a very liberal portion of money weekly towards the relief of the poor in the parish of st giles he persuaded many of the inhabitants to sign a document addressed to the privy council in which they not only gave their full consent to the erection of the playhouse but actually urged that the same might proceed437 this document he placed in the hands of nottingham to use in influencing the council the effort was successful on april 8 the council issued a warrant to the justices of the peace of the county of middlesex especially of st giles without cripplegate and to all others whom it shall concern that they should permit henslowe and alleyn to proceed in the effecting and finishing of the same new house438 footnote 436 greg henslowe papers p 49 footnote 437 ibid p 50 footnote 438 ibid p 51 illustration the site of the fortune playhouse the site of the fortune is marked by playhouse yard connecting golden lane and whitecross street from ogilby and morgans map of london 1677 this warrant of course put an end to all interference by local authorities but as the playhouse reared itself high above the walls of the city to the north the puritans were aroused to action they made this the occasion for a most violent attack on actors and theatres in general and on the fortune in particular with this attack the city authorities for reasons of their own heartily sympathized but they had no jurisdiction over the parish of st giles or over the other localities in which playhouses were situated since the privy council had specially authorized the erection of the fortune the lord mayor shifted the attack to that body and himself dispatched an urgent request to the lords for reformation in response to all this agitation the lords of the privy council on june 22 1600 issued the following order whereas divers complaints have heretofore been made unto the lords and other of her majestys privy council of the manifold abuses and disorders that have grown and do continue by occasion of many houses erected and employed in and about london for common stageplays and now very lately by reason of some complaint exhibited by sundry persons against the building of the like house in or near golding lane the lords and the rest of her majestys privy council with one and full consent have ordered in manner and form as follows first that there shall be about the city two houses and no more allowed to serve for the use of the common stageplays of the which houses one the globe shall be in surrey in that place which is commonly called the bankside or thereabouts and the other the fortune in middlesex secondly it is likewise ordered that the two several companies of players assigned unto the two houses allowed may play each of them in their several houses twice a week and no oftener and especially that they shall refrain to play on the sabbath day and that they shall forbear altogether in the time of lent the first part of this order limiting the playhouses and companies to two was merely a repetition of the order of 1598439 it meant that the lords of the privy council formally licensed the admirals and the lord chamberlains companies to play in london of course the lords might when they saw fit license other companies for specific periods the second part of the order limiting the number of performances was more serious for no troupe could afford to act only twice a week the order if carried out would mean the ruin of the fortune and the globe companies but it was not carried out the actors as we learn from henslowes diary did not restrict themselves to two plays a week why then did the lords issue this order and why was it not put into effect a study of the clever way in which alleyn nottingham and the privy council overcame the opposition of the puritanical officers of st giles who were interfering with the erection of the fortune will suggest the explanation the lords were making a shrewd move to quiet the noisy enemies of the drama they did not intend that the admirals and the chamberlains men should be driven out of existence they were merely meeting fanaticism with craft footnote 439 see page 174 alleyn and henslowe must have understood thispossibly they learned it directly from their patron nottinghamfor they proceeded with the erection of their expensive building the work however had been so seriously delayed by the restraints of the local authorities that the foundations were not completed until may 8440 on that day carpenters were brought from windsor and set to the task of erecting the frame since the materials had been accumulating on the site since january 17 the work of erection must have proceeded rapidly the daily progress of this work is marked in henslowes diary by the dinners of henslowe with the contractor peter street on august 8 these dinners ceased so that on that date or shortly after we may assume the building proper was finished441 footnote 440 greg henslowe papers p 10 footnote 441 greg henslowes diary i 15859 for erecting the building street received 440 but this did not include the painting of the woodwork which if we may judge from de witts description of the swan must have been costly or the equipment of the stage we learn from alleyns memoranda that the final cost of the playhouse was 520442 hence after streets work of erection was finished in august the entire building had to be painted and the stage properly equipped with curtains hangings machines etc this must have occupied at least two months from henslowes diary it appears that the playhouse was first used about the end of november or the early part of december 1600443 footnote 442 greg henslowe papers p 108 footnote 443 greg henslowes diary i 124 the original contract of henslowe and alleyn with peter street for the erection of the fortune preserved among the papers at dulwich college supplies us with some very exact details of the size and shape of the building although the document is long and is couched in the legal verbiage of the

unfortunate for us that the building was to be in so many respects a copy of the globe for that deprives us of further detailed specifications and it is unfortunate too that the plan or drawing showing the arrangement of the stage was not preserved with the rest of the document yet we are able to derive much exact information from the contract and with this information at least two modern architects have made reconstructions of the building445 footnote 445 see the bibliography a model of the fortune by mr wh godfrey is preserved in the dramatic museum of columbia university in new york city and a duplicate is in the museum of european culture at the university of illinois for a description of the model see the architect and builders journal london august 16 1911 no representation of the exterior of the fortune has come down to us in the socalled ryther map of london there is to be sure what seems to be a crude representation of the playhouse see page 278 but if this is really intended for the fortune it does little more than mark the location yet one can readily picture in his imagination the playhousea plastered structure eighty feet square and approximately forty feet high446 with small windows marking the galleries a turret and flagpole surmounting the redtiled roof and over the main entrance a sign representing dame fortune ile rather stand here like a statue in the forefront of your house for ever like the picture of dame fortune before the fortune playhouse447 footnote 446 the three galleries twelve eleven and nine feet respectively were thirtytwo feet in height but to this must be added the elevation of the first gallery above the yard the space occupied by the ceiling and flooring of the several galleries and finally the roof footnote 447 thomas heywood the english traveller 1633 ed pearson iv 84 we do not know when the play was written but the reference is probably to the new fortune built in 1623 heywood generally uses picture in the sense

theatres where plays are performed and we saw a tragedy which diverted me very little especially as i cannot understand a word of english though some little amusement may be derived from gazing at the very costly dresses of the actors and from the various interludes of instrumental music and dancing and singing but the best treat was to see such a crowd of nobility so very well arrayed that they looked like so many princes listening as silently and soberly as possible these theatres are frequented by a number of respectable and handsome ladies who come freely and seat themselves among the men without the slightest hesitation on the evening in question his excellency the venetian ambassador and the secretary were pleased to play me a trick by placing me amongst a bevy of young women scarcely was i seated ere a very elegant dame but in a mask came and placed herself beside me she asked me for my address both in french and english and on my turning a deaf ear she determined to honour me by showing me some fine diamonds on her fingers repeatedly taking off no fewer than three gloves which were worn one over the other this ladys bodice was of yellow satin richly embroidered

the fortune but the writer in the quarterly review who had before him the entire manuscript states positively that the fortune was the playhouse visited i have not been able to examine the manuscript itself which is preserved in venice that the players were prepared to entertain distinguished visitors both during the performance and after is shown by a letter from john chamberlain july 21 1621 to sir dudley carleton the spanish ambassador he writes is grown so affable and familiar that on monday with his whole train he went to a common play at the fortune in golding lane and the players not to be overcome with courtesy made him a banquet when the play was done in the garden adjoining450 footnote 450 nichols the progresses of king james iv 67 upon its completion the new building was occupied by the admirals men for whom it had been erected this troupe of players long famous under the leadership of edward alleyn was now one of the two companies authorized by the privy council and the chief rival of the chamberlains men at the globe henslowe was managing their affairs and numerous poets were writing plays for them they continued to act at the fortune under the name the admirals men until may 5 1603 when as henslowe put it they left off play now at the kings coming451 footnote 451 greg henslowes diary i 174 after a short interruption on account of the plague during a part of which time they traveled in the provinces the admirals men were taken under the patronage of the youthful henry prince of wales and in the early spring of 1604 they resumed playing at the fortune under their new name the princes servants illustration edward alleyn reproduced by permission from a painting in the dulwich picture gallery photograph by emery walker ltd for a time all went well but from july 1607 until december 1609 the plague was severe in london and acting was seriously interrupted during this long period of hardship for the players henslowe and alleyn seem to have made an attempt to hold the troupe together by admitting its chief members to a partnership in the building just as the burbages had formerly admitted their chief players to a partnership in the globe at this time there were in the troupe eight sharers or chief actors452 henslowe and alleyn it seems proposed to allot to these eight actors onefourth of the fortune property in other words according to this scheme there were to be thirtytwo sharers in the new fortune organization alleyn and henslowe together holding threefourths of the stock or twelve shares each and the eight actors together holding onefourth of the stock or one share each a document was actually drawn up by henslowe and alleyn with the name of the leader of the fortune troupe thomas downton inserted453 but since the document was not executed the scheme it is to be presumed was unsuccessfulat least we hear nothing further about it454 footnote 452 see the companys patent of 1606 in the malone societys collections i 268 footnote 453 greg henslowe papers p 13 footnote 454 for an ordinance concerning lewd jiggs at the fortune in 1612 see middlesex county records ii 83 on november 6 1612 the death of the young prince of wales left the company without a service on january 4 1613 however a new patent was issued to the players placing them under the protection of the palsgrave or elector palatine after which date they are known as the palsgraves men on january 9 1616 henslowe so long associated with the company and the fortune died and a year later his widow agnes followed him as a result the entire fortune property passed into the hands of alleyn but alleyn apparently did not care to be worried with the management of the playhouse so on october 31 1618 he leased it to the palsgraves men for a period of thirtyone years at an annual rental of 200 and two rundlets of wine at christmas455 footnote 455 greg henslowe papers p 27 young the history of dulwich college ii 260 on april 24 1620 alleyn executed a deed of grant of lands by which he transferred the fortune along with various other properties to dulwich college456 but he retained during his lifetime the whole of the revenues therefrom and he specifically reserved to himself the right to grant leases for any length of years the transference of the title therefore in no way affected the playhouse and alleyn continued to manage the property as he had been accustomed to do in the past footnote 456 the deed is printed by young op cit i 50 the fortune property i believe is still a part of the endowment of the college his services in this capacity were soon needed for on december 9 1621 the fortune was burned to the ground alleyn records the event in his diary thus memorandum this night at 12 of the clock the fortune was burnt in a less laconic fashion john chamberlain writes to sir dudley carleton on sunday night here was a great fire at the fortune in goldinglane the fairest playhouse in this town it was quite burnt down in two hours and all their apparel and playbooks lost whereby those poor companions are quite undone457 footnote 457 birch the court and times of james the first ii 280 howes in his continuation of stows annals 1631 p 1004 attributes the fire to negligence of a candle but gives no details the poor companions thus referred to were of course the players who lost not only their stock of apparel playbooks and stage furniture but also their lease which assured them of a home alleyn however was quite able and ready to reconstruct the building for them and we find him on may 20 1621 already organizing a syndicate to finance a new playhouse which there is intended to be erected and set up the stock of the new enterprise he divided into twelve equal shares which he disposed of as the custom was in the form of whole and half shares reserving for himself only one share458 the plot of ground on which the old playhouse stood he leased to the several sharers for a period of fiftyone years at an annual rental of 10 13s 10d a share with the express condition that the building to be erected thereon should never be used for any purpose other than the acting of stageplays the sharers then proceeded to the task of constructing their playhouse it was proposed to make the new building larger459 and handsomer than the old one and to build it of brick460 with a tiled roofpossibly an attempt at fireproof construction it was decided also to abandon the square shape in favor of the older and more logical circular shape wright in his historia histrionica describes the new fortune as a large round brick building461 and howes assures us that it was farre fairer than the old playhouse462 we do not know how much the building cost at the outset each sharer was assessed 83 6s 8d towards the cost of construction463 which would produce exactly 1000 but the first assessment was not necessarily all that the sharers were called upon to pay for example when the globe was rebuilt each sharer was at first assessed 50 or 60 but before the building was finished each had paid more than 100 so the fortune may well have cost more than the original estimate of 1000 in 1656 two expert assessors appointed by the authorities of dulwich college to examine the playhouse declared that the said building did in our opinions cost building about two thousand pound464 this estimate is probably not far wrong the playhouse was completed in june or july of 1623 and was again occupied by the palsgraves men465 footnote 458 greg henslowe papers pp 2830 112 the names of the sharers are not inspiring

of erection footnote 465 for an account of a dangerous and great riot committed in whitecross street at the fortune playhouse in may 1626 see jeaffreson middlesex county records iii 16163 on november 25 1626 edward alleyn died and the fortune property came into the full possession of dulwich college this however did not in any way affect the syndicate of the fortune housekeepers who held from alleyn a lease of the property until 1672 according to the terms of this lease each of the twelve sharers had to pay a yearly rental of 10 13s 10d this rental now merely went to the college instead of to alleyn in 1631 the palsgraves men seem to have fallen on hard times at any rate they had to give up the fortune and the playhouse was taken over about december by the kings revels who had been playing at the small private playhouse of salisbury court466 the palsgraves men were reorganized taken under the patronage of the infant prince charles and placed in the salisbury court playhouse just vacated by the kings revels footnote 466 for details of this move see the chapter on the salisbury court playhouse in 1635 there was a general shifting of houses on the part of the london companies the kings revels left the fortune and returned to their old quarters at salisbury court the prince charless men who had been at salisbury court moved to the red bull and the red bull company transferred itself to the fortune the stay of the red bull company at the fortune was not happy towards the end of 1635 the plague was seriously interfering with their performance of plays467 and on may 10 1636 the privy council closed all theatres and kept them closed except for a few days until october 2 1637468 this long inhibition not only impoverished the actors and drove them into the country but came near ruining the lessees of the fortune who having no revenue from the playhouse could not make their quarterly payments to the college on september 4 1637 the court of assistants at dulwich noted that the lessees were behind in their rent to the extent of 132 12s 11d and the court adds there will be a quarters rent more at michaelmas next ie in twentyfive days which is doubted will be also unpaid amounting to 33 1s 4d469 the excuse of the lessees for their failure to pay was the restraint from playing470 footnote 467 young the history of dulwich college i 114 footnote 468 the malone societys collections i 391 392 malone variorum iii 239 footnote 469 young the history of dulwich college i 114 footnote 470 the college appealed to the lord keeper who on january 26 ordered the payment of the sum but two years later february 1640 we find the college again petitioning the lord keeper to order the lessees of the fortune property to pay an arrearage of 104 14s 5d see collier the alleyn papers pp 9598 this restraint was removed on october 2 1637 and the players resumed their performances at the fortune but in the early summer of 1639 they fell victims to another bit of ill luck even more serious than their long inhibition in a letter of edmond rossingham dated may 8 1639 we read thursday last the players of the fortune were fined 1000 for setting up an altar a bason and two candlesticks and bowing down before it upon the stage and although they allege it was an old play revived and an altar to the heathen gods yet it was apparent that this play was revived on purpose in contempt of the ceremonies of the church471 footnote 471 printed in the calendar of state papers domestic 1639 p 140 during the easter period 1640 the players returned to their old quarters at the red bull after their unhappy experiences at the fortune they were apparently glad to occupy again their former home the event is celebrated in a prologue entitled upon the removing of the late fortune players to the bull written by john tatham and printed in fancies theatre 1640472 here gentlemen our anchors fixt and we disdaining fortunes mutability expect your kind acceptance footnote 472 the prologue is printed in full by malone variorum iii 79 the writer then hurls some uncomplimentary remarks at the fortune observing complacently we have neer an actor here has mouth enough to tear language by the ears it is true that during these later years the fortune had fallen into ill repute with persons of good taste but so had the red bull and the actors there had no right to throw stones apparently the large numbers that could be accommodated in the great public theatres and the quality of the audience attracted by the low price of admission made noise and rant inevitable473 as chief sinners in this respect the fortune and the red bull are usually mentioned together footnote 473 not even the globe was entirely free from this see the prologue to the doubtful heir upon the departure of the red bull company the prince charless men originally the admirals and later the palsgraves men who had been occupying the red bull came to the fortune474 thus after an absence of nearly nine years the old company though sadly altered in personnel for which the fortune had been built returned to its home to remain there until the end footnote 474 malone variorum iii 79 on september 2 1642 the long parliament passed an ordinance suppressing all stageplays but for a time the actors at the fortune seem to have continued their performances in the fifth number of the weekly account september 27october 4 1643 we find among other entries the players misfortune at the fortune in golding lane their players clothes being seized upon in the time of a play by authority from the parliament475 this doubtless led to the closing of the playhouse footnote 475 the calendar of state papers domestic 1643 p 564 after the fortune was thus closed the lessees were in a predicament by a specific clause in their lease they were prevented from using the building for any purpose other than the acting of stageplays and now parliament by a specific ordinance had forbidden the acting of stageplays hence the lessees some of whom were poor persons being unable to make any profit from the building refused to pay any rent the college entered suit against them and exhausted all legal means to make them pay but without success476 footnote 476 for an interesting comment on the situation especially in the year 1649 see notes and queries series x i 85 when the ordinance prohibiting plays expired in january 1648 the actors promptly reopened the fortune and we learn from the kingdoms weekly intelligencer that on january 27 no fewer than one hundred and twenty coaches were crowded about the building but on february 9 parliament passed a new and even more stringent ordinance against dramatic performances placing penalties not only upon the players but also upon the spectators this for ever put an end to acting at the fortune in 1649 the arrears of the lessees having reached the sum of 974 5s 8d the authorities of the college took formal possession of the playhouse from certain manuscript notes477 entered in the phillipps copy of stows annals 1631 we learn that a company of soldiers set on by the sectaries of these sad times on saturday the 24 day of march 1649 sacked the salisbury court playhouse the phoenix and the fortune the note states that the fortune was pulled down on the inside by the soldiers that is the stage and the seats were dismantled478 so as to render the building unusable for dramatic purposes footnote 477 printed in the academy october 28 1882 p 314 footnote 478 see the journals of the house of commons july 26 1648 in the following year 1650 the inhabitants of the parish of st giles represent that they are poor and unable to build a place of worship for themselves but think it would be convenient if that large building commonly known by the name of the fortune playhouse might be allotted and set apart for that purpose the request was not granted479 footnote 479 warner catalogue xxxi greg henslowes diary ii 65 by july 1656 the condition of the old playhouse was such that the masters and wardens of the college appointed two experts to view the building and make recommendations they reported that by reason the lead hath been taken from the said building the tiling not secured and the foundation of the said playhouse not kept in good repair great part of the said playhouse is fallen to the ground the timber thereof much decayed and rotten and the brick walls so rent and torn that the whole structure is in no condition capable of repair but in great danger of falling to the hazard of passengers lives and they add the charge for demolishing the same will be chargeable and dangerous upon these considerations our opinion is that the said materials may not be more worth than eighty pound480 footnote 480 the entire report is printed in greg henslowe papers p 95 the authorities of dulwich took no action on this report however on march 5 1660 they ordered that the property be leased making a casual reference to the playhouse as at present so ruinous that part thereof is already fallen down and the rest will suddenly follow accordingly they inserted in the mercurius politicus of february 1421 1661 the following advertisement the fortune playhouse situate between whitecross street and golding lane in the parish of st giles cripplegate with the ground thereto belonging is to be let to be built upon481 footnote 481 discovered by stevens and printed in malone variorum iii 55 note 5 mr wj lawrence archiv fr das studium der neueren sprachen und literaturen 1914 p 314 says that the date of this advertisement is 1660 but the same advertisement is reprinted by hr plomer in notes and queries series x vi 107 from the kingdoms intelligencer of march 18 1661 no one seems to have cared to lease the property so on march 16 following the materials of the building were sold to one william beaven for the sum of 75482 and in the records of the college march 4 1662 we read that the said playhouse is since totally demolished483 footnote 482 young the history of dulwich college ii 265 footnote 483 collier the alleyn papers p 101 i am aware of the fact that there are references to later incidents at the fortune for example the statement that it was visited by officers in november 1682 in an attempt to suppress secret conventicles that had long been held there but in view of the unimpeachable documentary evidence cited above in 1662 the college authorities again refer to it as the late ruinous and now demolished fortune playhouse we must regard these later references either as inaccurate or as referring to another building later erected in the same neighborhood the socalled picture of the fortune printed in wilkinsons londina illustrata and often reproduced by modern scholars cannot possibly be that of the playhouse erected by alleyn for an interesting surmise as to the history of this later building see wj lawrence restoration stage nurseries in archiv fr das studium der neueren sprachen und literaturen 1914 p 301 chapter xiv the red bull the builder of the red bull playhouse484 was one aaron holland yeoman of whom we know little more than that he was utterly unlearned and illiterate not being able to read485 he had leased for many years from anne beddingfield wife and administratrix of the goods and chattles of christopher beddingfield deceased a small plot of land known by the name of the red bull this plot of land which contained one house was situated at the upper end of st johns street in the parish of st james clerkenwell the exact location being marked by red bull yard in ogilby and morgans map of london printed in 1677 the property was not much more distant from the heart of the city than the fortune property and since it could be easily reached through st johns gate it was quite as well situated for dramatic purposes as was the fortune footnote 484 this playhouse is not to be confused with the famous bull tavern in bishopsgate street for many years used as a theatre footnote 485 these statements are based upon the woodford v holland documents first discovered by collier later by greenstreet and finally printed in full by wallace three london theatres illustration the site of the red bull playhouse the site is indicated by red bull yard from ogilby and morgans map of london 1677 in or before 1605486 holland erected on this plot of ground a playhouse for acting and setting forth plays comedies and tragedies we may suspect that he did this at the instigation of the earl of worcesters men who had just been taken under the patronage of the queen and had been selected by the privy council as one of three companies to be allowed the warrant of the privy council april 9 1604 orders the lord mayor to permit and suffer the three companies of players to the king queen and prince publickly to exercise their plays in their several and usual houses for that purpose and no other viz the globe situate in maiden lane on the bankside in the county of surrey the fortune in golding lane and the curtain in holywell487 among these three companies as dekker tells us there was much rivalry488 no doubt the queens men forced to occupy the old curtain playhouse suffered by comparison with the kings men at the handsome globe and the princes men at the new and magnificent fortune and this i suspect furnished the immediate cause for the erection of the red bull in a draft of a license to the queens men made late in 1603 or early in 1604 the fact is disclosed that the actors of whom thomas greene was the leader were contemplating a new playhouse the company was licensed to use any playhouse not used by others by the said thomas greene elected or by him hereafter to be built489 whether or no greene and his fellows had some understanding with holland we cannot say but in 1605 we find holland disposing of one share in the new playhouse to thomas swynnerton a member of queen annes troupe and he may at the same time have disposed of other shares to other members for his transaction with swynnerton comes to our notice only through a subsequent lawsuit the words used in the documents connected with the suit clearly suggest that the playhouse was completed at the time of the purchase from the fact that holland granted a seventh part of the said playhouse and galleries with a gatherers place thereto belonging or appertaining unto the said thomas swynnerton for diverse years490 it appears that the ownership of the playhouse had been divided into seven shares some of which according to custom may have been subdivided into halfshares footnote 486 sir sidney lee a life of william shakespeare p 60 says that the red bull was built about 1600 he gives no evidence and the statement seems to be merely a repetition from earlier and unauthoritative writers footnote 487 the original warrant is preserved at dulwich and printed by greg henslowe papers p 61 cf also dasent acts of the privy council xxxii 511 footnote 488 ravens almanack 1609 dekkers works ed grosart iv 210 footnote 489 the malone societys collections i 265 footnote 490 wallace three london theatres p 18 the name of the playhouse as in the case of the rose and the curtain was taken from the name of the estate on which it was erected of the building we have no pictorial representation the picture in kirkmans the wits 1672 so often reproduced by scholars as the interior of the red bull has nothing whatever to do with that building the kirkman picture shows a small enclosed room with a narrow stage illuminated by chandeliers and footlights the red bull on the contrary was a large openair building with its stage illuminated by the sun it is thus described in wrights historia histrionica 1699 the globe fortune and bull were large houses and lay partly open to the weather491 before its door was displayed a sign on which was painted a red bull hence the playhouse is sometimes referred to simply as at the sign of the red bull footnote 491 hazlitts dodsley xv 408 if the kirkham picture represents the interior of any playhouse it more likely represents the cockpit which was standing at the time of the restoration the building as i have indicated seems to have been completed in or before 1605 but exactly when the queens men moved thither from the curtain is not clear the patent issued to the company on april 15 1609 gives them license to play within their now usual houses called the red bull in clerkenwell and the curtain in holywell492 since they would hardly make use of two big public playhouses at the same time we might suspect that they were then arranging for the transfer moreover heath in his epigrams printed in 1610 but probably written a year or two earlier refers to the three important public playhouses of the day as the globe the fortune and the curtain yet that the queens men were playing regularly at the red bull in 1609 is clear from dekkers ravens almanack493 and they may have been playing there at intervals after 1605 footnote 492 the malone societys collections i 270 footnote 493 dekkers works ed grosart iv 21011 i cannot understand why murray english dramatic companies i 15253 and others say that dekker refers to the fortune the globe and the curtain his puns are clear fortune must favour some the whole world must stick to others and a third faction must fight like bulls dekker in the pamphlet just mentioned predicted a deadly war between the globe the fortune and the red bull and he had good reasons for believing that the queens men could successfully compete with the two other companies for it numbered among its players some of the best actors of the day the leader of the troupe was thomas greene now chiefly known for the amusing comedy named after him greenes tu quoque but then known to all londoners as the cleverest comedian since tarleton and kempe scat yes faith brother if it please you lets go see a play at the globe but i care not any whither so the clown have a part for i faith i am nobody without a fool gera why then well go to the red bull they say greens a good clown494 footnote 494 greenes tu quoque hazlitts dodsley xi 240 in may 1610 there was a notable outrage at the playhouse called the red bull see middlesex county records ii 6465 the chief playwright for the troupe was the learned and industrious thomas heywood who like shakespeare was also an actor and full sharer in his company charles lamb who was an ardent admirer of heywoods plays enthusiastically styled him a prose shakespeare and wordsworth with hardly less enthusiasm declared him to have been a great man in 1612 thomas greene died and the leadership of the troupe was taken over by christopher beeston a man well known in the theatrical life of the time late in february 1617 beeston transferred the queens men to his new playhouse in drury lane the cockpit in little more than a week the sacking of the cockpit drove them back to their old quarters where they remained until the following june but even after this they seem not to have abandoned the red bull entirely edward alleyn in his account book writes oct 1 1617 i came to london in the coach and went to the red bull and again under the date of october 3 i went to the red bull and received for the younger brother but 3 6s 4d495 what these two passages mean it is hard to say for they constitute the only references to the red bull in all the alleyn papers but they do not necessarily imply as some have thought that alleyn was part owner of the playhouse possibly he was merely selling to the red bull company the manuscript of an old play496 footnote 495 malone variorum iii 223 young the history of dulwich college ii 51 warner catalogue p 165 collier memoirs of edward alleyn p 107 footnote 496 the play is not otherwise known a play with this title however was entered on the stationers register in 1653 at the death of queen anne march 2 1619 the company was deprived of its service and after attending her funeral on may 13 was dissolved christopher beeston joined prince charless men and established that troupe at the cockpit497 the other leading members of queen annes men seem to have continued at the red bull under the simple title the red bull company footnote 497 for details of this change and of the quarrels that followed see the chapter on the cockpit in april 1622 a feltmakers apprentice named john gill498 while seated on the red bull stage was accidentally injured by a sword in the hands of one of the actors richard baxter a few days later gill called upon his fellowapprentices to help him secure damages in the forenoon he sent the following letter now somewhat defaced by time to baxter mr blackster sic so it is that upon monday last it to be upon your stage intending no hurt to any one where i was grievously wounded in the head as may appear and in the surgeons hands who is to have xs for the cure and in the

middlesex hence its preservation who took steps to guard the playhouse and actors the only result was that prentices to the number of one hundred persons on the said day riotously assembled at clerkenwell to the terror and disquiet of persons dwelling there on july 8 1622 the red bull company secured a license to bring up children in the quality and exercise of playing comedies histories interludes morals pastorals stageplays and such like to be called by the name of the children of the revels500 the children of the revels occupied the red bull until the summer of the following year

footnote 501 chalmers supplemental apology p 213 in august 1623 we find the red bull occupied by prince charless men502 who after the dissolution of the revels company had moved thither from the less desirable curtain footnote 502 ibid pp 21314 two years later in 1625 prince charles became king and took under his patronage his fathers troupe the kings men some of the members of the prince charles troupe were transferred to the kings men and the rest constituted a nucleus about which a new company was organized known simply as the red bull company about this time it seems the playhouse was rebuilt and enlarged the fortune had been destroyed by fire in 1621 and had just been rebuilt in a larger and handsomer form in 1625 one wc in londons lamentation for her sins writes yet even then oh lord were the theatres magnified and enlarged503 this doubtless refers to the rebuilding of the fortune and the red bull prynne specifically states in his histriomastix 1633 that the fortune and red bull had been lately reedified and enlarged but nothing further is known of the reedification and enlargement of the red bull footnote 503 quoted by collier the history of english dramatic poetry 1879 iii 121 after its enlargement the playhouse seems to have acquired a reputation for noise and vulgarity carew in 1630 speaks of it as a place where noise prevails and a drowth of wit and yet as always crowded with people while the better playhouses stood empty in the careless shepherdess acted at salisbury court we read and i will hasten to the moneybox and take my shilling out again ill go to the bull or fortune and there see a play for twopence and a jig to boot504 footnote 504 malone variorum iii 70 in 1638 a writer of verses prefixed to randolphs poems speaks of the base plots acted with great applause at the red bull505 james wright informs us in his historia histrionica that the red bull and the fortune were mostly frequented by citizens and the meaner sort of people506 and edmund gayton in his pleasant notes wittily remarks i have heard that the poets of the fortune and red bull had always a mouthmeasure for their actors who were terrible tearthroats and made their lines proportionable to their compass which were sesquipedales a foot and a half507 probably the ill repute of the large public playhouses at this time was chiefly due to the rise of private playhouses in the city footnote 505 randolphs works ed hazlitt p 504 footnote 506 hazlitts dodsley xv 407 footnote 507 pleasant notes on don quixote p 24 in 1635 the red bull company moved to the fortune and prince

the event508 the members of the company declared here gentlemen our anchors fixt footnote 508 j tatham fancies theatre for a fuller discussion of the shifting of companies in 1635 and 1640 see the chapter on the fortune this proved true for the company remained at the red bull until parliament passed the ordinance of 1642 closing the playhouses and forbidding all dramatic performances the ordinance which was to hold good during the continuance of the civil war was renewed in 1647 with january 1 1648 set as the date of its expiration through some oversight a new ordinance was not immediately passed and the actors were prompt to take advantage of the fact they threw open the playhouses and the londoners flocked in great crowds to hear plays again at the red bull so we learn from the newspaper called perfect occurrences was given a performance of beaumont and fletchers wit without money but on february 9 1648 parliament made up for its oversight by passing an exceptionally severe ordinance against dramatic exhibitions directing that actors be publicly flogged and that each spectator be fined the sum of five shillings during the dark years that followed the red bull in spite of this ordinance was occasionally used by venturous actors james wright in his historia histrionica tells us that upon the outbreak of the war the various london actors had gone into the kings army and like good men and true served their old master though in a different yet more honourable capacity robinson was killed at the taking of a place i think basing house by harrison mohun was a captain hart was cornet of the same troop and shatterel quartermaster allen of the cockpit was a major the rest either lost or exposed their lives for their king509 he concludes the narrative by saying that when the wars were over those actors who were left alive gathered to london and for a subsistence endeavoured to revive their old trade privately they organized themselves into a company in 1648 and attempted to act some plays with as much caution and privacy as could be at the cockpit but after three or four days they were stopped by soldiers thereafter on special occasions they used to bribe the officer who commanded the guard at whitehall and were thereupon connived at to act for a few days at the red bull but were sometimes notwithstanding disturbed by soldiers510 to such clandestine performances kirkman refers in his preface to the wits or sport upon sport 1672 i have seen the red bull playhouse which was a large one so full that as many went back for want of room as had entered and as meanly as you may now think of these drolls they were then acted by the best comedians then and now in being not however without occasional trouble in whitelockes memorials p 435 we read 20 dec 1649 some stageplayers in st johns street were apprehended by troopers their clothes taken away and themselves carried to prison again in the perfect account december 27january 3 16541655 dec 30 1654this day the players at the red bull being gotten into all their borrowed gallantry and ready to act were by some of the soldiery despoiled of all their bravery but the soldiery carried themselves very civilly towards the audience511 in the weekly intelligencer september 1118 1655 we find recorded still another sad experience for the actors friday september 11 1655this day proved tragicall to the players at the red bull their acting being against the act of parliament the soldiers secured the persons of some of them who were upon the stage and in the tiringhouse they seized also upon their clothes in which they acted a great part whereof was very rich512 footnote 509 hazlitts dodsley xv 409 footnote 510 ibid 40910 footnote 511 cited by ch firth in notes and queries august 18 1888 series vii vol vi p 122 footnote 512 ibid on this occasion however the soldiers instead of carrying themselves very civilly towards the audience undertook to exact from each of the spectators the fine of five shillings the ordinance of parliament passed february 9 1648 read and it is hereby further ordered and ordained that every person or persons which shall be present and a spectator at such stageplay or interlude hereby prohibited shall for every time he shall be present forfeit and pay the sum of five shillings to the use of the poor of the parish513 but the spectators did not submit to this fine without a struggle jeremiah banks wrote to williamson on september 16 1655 at the playhouse this week many were put to rout by the soldiers and had broken crowns the corporal would have been entrapped had he not been vigilant514 and in the weekly intelligencer september 1118 we read it never fared worse with the spectators than at this present for those who had monies paid their five shillings apiece those who had none to satisfy their forfeits did leave their cloaks behind them the tragedy of the spectators was the comedy of the soldiers there was abundance of the female sex who not able to pay five shillings did leave some gage or other behind them insomuch that although the next day after the fair was expected to be a new fair of hoods of aprons and of scarfs all which their poverty being made known and after some check for their trespass were civilly again restored to the owners515 footnote 513 hazlitt the english

general history of the actors at the red bull during this period see the herbert records in halliwellphillipps a collection of ancient documents later it seems they secured a license from the authorities and thenceforth acted without interruption samuel pepys made plans to go to the red bull playhouse with mrs pierce and her husband on august 3 1660 but was prevented by business an account of his visit there on march 23 1661 is thus given in his diary all the morning at home putting papers in order dined at home and then out to the red bull where i had not been since plays came up again but coming too soon i went out again and walked up and down the charterhouse yard and aldersgate street at last came back again and went in where i was led by a seaman that knew me but is here as a servant up to the tiringroom where strange the confusion and disorder that there is among them in fitting themselves especially here where the clothes are very poor and the actors but common fellows at last into the pit where i think there was not above ten more than myself and not one hundred in the whole house and the play which is called alls lost by lust poorly done and with so much disorder among others that in the musiqueroom the boy that was to sing a song not singing it right his master fell about his ears and beat him so that it put the whole house in an uproar the actors however did not remain long at the red bull they built for themselves a new theatre in drury lane whither they moved on april 8 1663517 and after this the old playhouse was deserted in davenants the playhouse to be let 1663 i i we read tell em the red bull stands empty for fencers518 there are no tenants in it but old spiders footnote 517 after november 8 1660 they acted also in gibbons tennis court in clare market which they had fitted up as a theatre see halliwellphillipps a collection of ancient documents p 34 footnote 518 see pepys diary april 25 1664 chapter xv whitefriars the district of whitefriars lying just outside the city wall to the west and extending from fleet street to the thames was once in the possession of the order of white friars and the site of an important monastery but in elizabeths time the church had disappeared most of the ancient buildings had been dismantled and in their place as stow tells us were many fair houses builded lodgings for noblemen and others since at the dissolution of the monasteries the property had come into the possession of the crown it was not under the jurisdiction of the london common councila fact which made whitefriars like blackfriars a desirable refuge for players seeking to escape the hostility of the city authorities519 one might naturally expect the appearance of playing here at an early date but the evidence is slight520 footnote 519 whitefriars passed under city control in 1608 by grant of king james i but certain rights remained notably that of sanctuary this has been celebrated in shadwells play the squire of alsatia and in scotts romance the fortunes of nigel footnote 520 prynne in histriomastix 1633 p 491 quotes a passage from richard reulidges monster lately found out and discovered 1628 in which there is a reference to a playhouse as existing in whitefriars not long after 1580 by playhouse reulidge possibly meant an inn used for acting but the whole passage written by a puritan after the lapse of nearly half a century is open to grave suspicion especially in its details again richard flecknoe in a short discourse of the english stage 1664 states that the children of the chapel royal acted in whitefriars but that he confused the word whitefriars with blackfriars is shown by the rest of his statement the first appearance of a regular playhouse in whitefriars dates from the early years of king jamess reign with our present knowledge we cannot fix the date exactly yet we can feel reasonably certain that it was not long before 1607probably about 1605 the chief spirit in the organization of the new playhouse seems to have been the poet michael drayton who had secured a patent from king james to erect a company of child actors to be known as the children of his majestys revels521 obviously his hope was to make the children of his majestys revels at whitefriars rival the successful children of her majestys revels at blackfriars in this ambitious enterprise he associated with himself a wealthy london merchant thomas woodford whom we know as having been interested in various theatrical investments522 these two men leased from lord buckhurst for a short period of time a building described as a mansion house formerly a part of the whitefriars monastery the rooms of which are thirteen in number three below and ten above that is to say the great hall the kitchen by the yard and a cellar with all the rooms from the master of the revells office as the same are now severed and divided523 the great hall here mentioned once the refectory of the monks was made into the playhouse its great size may be inferred from the fact that there were ten rooms above and its general excellence may be inferred from the fact that it was leased at 50 per annum whereas blackfriars in a more desirable location and fully equipped as a theatre was rented for only 40 footnote 521 fleay murray and others are wrong in assuming that this troupe was merely a continuation of the pauls boys so far as i can discover there is no official record of the patent issued to drayton but that such a patent was issued is clear from the lawsuits of 1609 printed by greenstreet in the new shakspere societys transactions 188790 p 269 footnote 522 he was part proprietor of the red bull in the case of witter v heminges and condell he was examined as a witness see wallace shakespeare and his london associates p 74 but what connection if any he had with the globe does not appear footnote 523 greenstreet the new shakspere societys transactions 188790 p 275 from an early seventeenthcentury survey of the whitefriars property see the opposite page we are able to place the building very exactly the part of the monastery used as a playhousethe fraterwas the southern cloister marked in the plan my lords cloyster the kitchen by the yard mentioned in the document just quoted is clearly represented in the survey by the scullere the size of the playhouse is hard to ascertain but it was approximately thirtyfive feet in width and eightyfive feet in length524 in the london of today it extended roughly from bouverie street to ashentree court and lay just north of george yard footnote 524 the stipple walls in the original survey colored gray were of stone the thinner walls of the adjoining tenements in the original colored red were of brick illustration a plan of whitefriars a portion of an early seventeenthcentury survey of the whitefriars property the playhouse adjoined the scullere on the south this survey was discovered in the print room of the british museum by mr aw clapham and reproduced in the journal of the british archological association 1910 of the career of the children under the joint management of drayton and woodford we know almost nothing but in march 1608 a new management assumed charge of the troupe and from this point on the history of the playhouse is reasonably clear the original lease of the building it seems expired on march 5 1608 but before the expirationin the latter part of 1607 or in the early part of 1608drayton and woodford secured a new lease on the property for six years eight months and twenty days or until december 25 one of the four regular feasts of the year 1614 in february 1608 after having secured this renewal of the lease thomas woodford suddenly determined to retire from the enterprise and he sold his moiety to one david lording barry525 author of the play ram alley barry and drayton at once made plans to divide the property into six shares so as to distribute the expenses and the risks as well as the hopedfor profits barry induced his friend george androwes to purchase one share and hence the lawsuit from which we derive most of our knowledge of the playhouse from this suit i quote below the more significant part relating to the new organization humbly complaining sheweth unto your honorable lordship your daily orator george androwes of london silkweaver that whereas one lordinge barry about february which was in the year of our lord 1607 ie 1608 pretending himself to be lawfully possessed of one moiety of a messuage or mansion house parcel of the late dissolved monastery called the whitefriars in fleet street in the suburbs of london by and under a lease made thereof about march then next following from the right honorable robert lord buckhurst unto one michael drayton and thomas woodford for the term of six years eight months and twenty days then following for and under the yearly rent of fifty pounds reserved thereupon the moiety of which said lease and premisses by mean assignment from the said thomas woodford was lawfully settled in the said lordinge barry as he did pretend together with the moiety of diverse playbooks apparel and other furnitures and necessaries used and employed in and about the said messuage and the children of the revels526 there being in making and setting forth plays shows and interludes and such like and the said lordinge barry being desirous to join others with him in the interest of the same who might be contributory to such future charges as should arise in setting forth of plays and shows there did thereupon solicit and persuade your orator to take from the said barry an assignment of a sixth part of the messuage premisses and profits aforesaid footnote 525 by a stupid error often called lodowick barry for an explanation of the error see an article by the present writer in modern philology april 1912 ix 567 mr wj lawrence has recently shown studies in philology university of north carolina april 1917 that david barry was the eldest son of the ninth viscount buttevant and was called lording by courtesy at the time he became interested in the whitefriars playhouse he was twentytwo years old he died in 1610 footnote 526 at this time the children of blackfriars had lost their patent so that the children at whitefriars were the only revels troupe illustration michael drayton from a painting in the national portrait gallery london photograph copyrighted by emery walker ltd this passage gives us an interesting glimpse of drayton and barry in their efforts to organize a syndicate for exploiting the children of his majestys revels they induced several other persons to buy halfshares and then they engaged as manager of the children martin slaiter527 a wellknown and thoroughly experienced actor for his services as manager slaiter was to receive one whole share in the organization and lodgings for himself and his family of ten in the building the syndicate thus formed was made up of four wholesharers michael drayton lordinge barry george androwes and martin slaiter and four halfsharers william trevell william cooke edward sibthorpe and john mason528 footnote 527 also spelled slater slaughter slather slawghter henslowe often refers to him as martin footnote 528 mr wallace the century magazine 1910 lxxx 511 incorrectly says that whitefriars was held by six equal sharers the great hall had of course already been fitted up for the acting of plays and the new lessees did not at first contemplate any expenditure on the building later howeverif we can believe androwesthey spent a not inconsiderable sum for improvements the children already had certain plays and to these were added some new ones among the plays in their repertoire were days humour out of breath middletons family of love armins the two maids of moreclacke sharphams cupids whirligig markham and machins the dumb knight barrys ram alley and masons the turk the last two writers were sharers and it seems likely that drayton also a sharer and experienced as a dramatist contributed some plays towards the stock of the company the new organization with bright prospects for success was launched in march 1608 almost at once however it began to suffer from ill luck in april the children at blackfriars by their performance of byron caused king james to close all playhouses in london how long he kept them closed we do not know but we find the lessees of whitefriars joining with the three other london companies in seeking to have the inhibition raised as the french ambassador informed his government pour lever cette dfense quatres autres compagnies qui y sont encore offrent dj cent mille francs lesquels pourront bien leur en ordonner la permission529 footnote 529 letter of m de la boderie the french ambassador to england quoted by ek chambers modern language review iv 159 even if this inhibition was shortly raised the whitefriars organization was not much better off for in july the plague set in with unusual violence and acting was seriously if not wholly interrupted for the next twelve months and more as a result the profits from the theatre did not come up to the fair and false flattering speeches which at the outset barry had made to prospective investors and this led to bad feeling among the sharers the company at blackfriars of course was suffering in a similar way on august 8 1608 their playhouse was surrendered to the owner richard burbage and the children being thus left without a home were dispersed early in 1609 probably in february robert keysar the manager of the blackfriars troupe philip rosseter and others secured the lease of the whitefriars playhouse from drayton and the rest of the discontented sharers and reassembled there the children of blackfriars what became of the whitefriars troupe we do not know but it is highly likely that the new organization took over the better actors from draytons company at any rate we do not hear again of the children of his majestys revels when keysar and this new troupe of childactors moved into whitefriars slaiter and his family of ten were expelled from the building this led to a lawsuit and explains much in the legal documents printed by greenstreet slaiter complained with no little feeling that he had been riotously willfully violently and unlawfully contrary to the said articles and pretended agreement by which he had been not only engaged as a manager but also guaranteed a home for the period of all the term of years in the lease put and kept out of his said rooms of habitation for him this defendant and his family and all other his means of livelihood thereby leaving this defendant and his whole family being ten in number to the world to seek for bread and other means to live by530 footnote 530 greenstreet the new shakspere societys transactions 188790 p 283 the new whitefriars troupe acted five plays at court during the winter of 160910 payments therefor were made to robert keysar and the company was referred to merely as the children of the whitefriars but on january 4 1610 the company secured a royal patent authorizing the use of the title the children of the queens revels531 the patent was granted to robert daborne philip rosseter john tarbock richard jones and robert browne but keysar though not named in the grant was still one of the important sharers532 footnote 531 printed in the malone societys collections i 271 footnote 532 see keysar v burbage et al printed by mr wallace in his shakespeare and his london associates pp 80 ff the troupe well deserved the patronage of the queen keysar described the blackfriars children whom he had reorganized as a company of the most expert and skillful actors within the realm of england to the number of eighteen or twenty persons all or most of them trained up in that service in the reign of the late queen elizabeth for ten years together533 and to these as i have pointed out it seems likely that the best members of the bankrupt children of his majestys revels had been added the chief actor of the new organization was nathaniel field whose histrionic ability placed him beside edward alleyn and richard burbage one of the first plays he was called upon to act in his new theatre was jonsons brilliant comedy epicoene in which he took the leading rle footnote 533 ibid p 90 illustration the sites of the whitefriars and the salisbury court playhouses the whitefriars playhouse was just north of k 46 the salisbury court playhouse was just south of the court of that name from ogilby and morgans map of london 1677 the idea then occurred to rosseter to secure a monopoly on childacting and on private playhouses the children of his majestys revels had ceased to exist the blackfriars playhouse had been closed by royal command and its lease had been surrendered to its owner richard burbage the only rival to the children at whitefriars was the troupe of pauls boys acting in their singingschool behind the cathedral how rosseter attempted to buy them off is thus recorded by richard burbage and john heminges there being as these defendants verily think but only three private playhouses in the city of london the one of which being in the blackfriars and in the hands of these defendants or of their assigns one other being in the whitefriars in the hands or occupation of the said complainant himself keysar his partners rosseter et al or assigns and the third near st pauls church then being in the hands of one mr pierce but then unused for a playhouse one mr rosseter a partner of the said complainant keysar dealt for and compounded with the said mr pierce master of the pauls boys to the only benefit of him the said rosseter the now complainant keysar the rest of their partners and company and without the privity knowledge or consent of these defendants the kings company or any of them and that thereby they the said complainant keysar and the said rosseter and their partners and company might advance their gains and profit to be had and made in their said house in whitefriars that there might be a cessation of playing and plays to be acted in the said house near st pauls church aforesaid for which the said rosseter compounded with the said pierce to give him the said pierce twenty pounds per annum534 footnote 534 wallace shakespeare and his london associates p 95 by this means rosseter disposed of the competition of the pauls boys but although he secured a monopoly on childacting he failed to secure a monopoly on private playhouses for shortly after he had sealed this bargain with pierce the powerful kings men opened up at blackfriars rosseter promptly requested them to pay half the dead rent to pierce which they goodnaturedly agreed to do in 1613 whitefriars was rented by certain london apprentices for the performance at night of robert taylors the hog hath lost his pearl the episode is narrated by sir henry wotton in a letter to sir edmund bacon on sunday last at night and no longer some sixteen apprentices of what sort you shall guess by the rest of the story having secretly learnt a new play without book535 entitled the hog hath lost his pearl took up the whitefriars for their theatre and having invited thither as it should seem rather their mistresses than their masters who were all to enter per buletini for a note of distinction from ordinary comedians towards the end of the play the sheriffs who by chance had heard of it came in as they say and carried some six or seven of them to perform the last act at bridewell the rest are fled now it is strange to hear how sharpwitted the city is for they will needs have sir john swinerton the lord mayor be meant by the hog and the late lord treasurer by the pearl536 footnote 535 miss gildersleeve in her valuable government regulation of the elizabethan drama p 112 says just what is the meaning of a new play without book no one seems to have conjectured and she develops the theory that it refers to the absence of a licensed playbook etc the phrase to learn without book meant simply to memorize footnote 536 reliqui wottonian ed 1672 p 402 the letter is dated merely 161213 in connection with the play one should study the hector of germany 1615 apparently the children of the queens revels continued successfully at whitefriars until march 1613 on that date rosseter agreed with henslowe to join the revels with the lady elizabeths men then acting at the swan the new organization following the example of the kings men used whitefriars as a winter and the swan as a summer house thus for a time at least whitefriars came under the management of henslowe rosseters lease of the building was to expire in the following year he seems to have made planspossibly with the assistance of hensloweto erect in whitefriars a more suitable playhouse for the newly organized company at least that is a plausible interpretation of the following curious entry in sir george bucs office book july 13 1613 for a license to erect a new playhouse in whitefriars c 20537 but the new playhouse thus projected never was built doubtless because of strong local opposition instead henslowe erected for the company a public playhouse on the bankside known as the hope footnote 537 malone variorum iii 52 in march 1614 at the expiration of one year rosseter withdrew from his partnership with henslowe on december 25 1614 his lease of the whitefriars expired and he was apparently unable to renew it thereupon he attempted to fit up a private playhouse in the district of blackfriars and on june 3 1615 he actually secured a royal license to do so but in this effort too he was foiled538 footnote 538 see the chapter on rosseters blackfriars the documents concerned in this venture are printed in the malone societys collections i 277 after this we hear little or nothing of the whitefriars playhouse yet the building may occasionally have been used for dramatic purposes cunningham says the case of trevill v woodford in the court of requests informs us that plays were performed at the whitefriars theatre as late as 1621 sir anthony ashley the then landlord of the house entering the theatre in that year and turning the players out of doors on pretense that half a years rent was yet unpaid to him539 i have not been able to examine this document neither fleay nor murray has found any trace of a company at whitefriars after rosseters departure hence for all practical purposes we may regard the whitefriars playhouse as having come to the end of its career in 1614 footnote 539 the shakespeare societys papers iv 90 the document printed by collier in new facts regarding the life of shakespeare 1835 p 44 as from a manuscript in his possession is i think an obvious forgery chapter xvi the hope on august 29 1611 henslowe became manager of the lady elizabeths men having agreed among other things to furnish them with a playhouse540 and no longer being in possession of the rose he rented the old swan and maintained them there throughout the year 1612 footnote 540 the agreement has been lost but for a probably similar agreement made with the actor nathaniel field see greg henslowe papers p 23 in march of the following year 1613 he entered into a partnership with philip rosseter the manager of the private playhouse of whitefriars and joined the lady elizabeths men with rosseters excellent troupe of the queens revels apparently the intention of henslowe and rosseter was to form a company strong enough to compete on equal terms with the kings men in imitation of the kings men who used the globe as a summer and the blackfriars as a winter home the newly amalgamated company was to use the swan and the whitefriars541 and the chief actor of the troupe corresponding to richard burbage of the kings men was to be nathaniel field then at the height of his powers cokes which is your burbage now leatherhead what mean you by that sir cokes your best actor your field littlewit good i faith you are even with me sir542 footnote 541 daborne writes to henslowe on june 5 1613 the company told me you were expected there yesterday to conclude about their coming over my own play which shall be ready before they come over this i suspect refers to the moving of the company to the swan for the summer see greg henslowe papers p 72 that henslowe was manager of a private house in 1613 is revealed by another letter from daborne dated december 9 1613 see greg ibid p 79 footnote 542 bartholomew fair v iii the part of littlewit was presumably taken by field himself among their playwrights were ben jonson philip massinger john fletcher and robert daborne not to mention field who in addition to acting wrote excellent plays if it was the purpose of henslowe and rosseter to compete with the globe company in a winter as well as in a summer house that purpose was endangered by the fact that rosseters lease of his private theatre expired within a year and a half and could not be renewed rosseter and henslowe as pointed out in the preceding chapter seem to have attempted to erect in whitefriars a winter home for their troupe so at least i have interpreted the curious entry in sir george bucs office book july 13 1613 for a license to erect a new playhouse in the whitefriars c 20543 the attempt however was foiled probably by the strong opposition of the inhabitants of the district footnote 543 malone variorum iii 52 shortly after this henslowe made plans to provide the company with a new and better public playhouse on the bankside more conveniently situated than the swan the old bear garden was beginning to show signs of decay and doubtless would soon have to be rebuilt this suggested to henslowe the idea of tearing down that ancient structure and erecting in its place a larger and handsomer building to serve both for the performance of plays and for the baiting of animals to this plan jacob meade henslowes partner in the ownership of the bear garden agreed illustration the hope playhouse or second bear garden from hollars view of london 1647 accordingly on august 29 1613 henslowe and meade signed a contract with a carpenter named katherens to pull down the bear garden and erect in its place a new structure the original contract preserved among the henslowe papers is one of the most valuable documents we have relating to the early theatres it is too long and verbose for insertion here but i give below a summary of its contents544 katherens agreed 1 to pull down the bear garden and the stable wherein the bulls and horses had been kept and near or upon the said place where the said gameplace did heretofore stand to newly erect build and set up a playhouse fit and convenient in all things both for players to play in and for the game of bears and bulls to be baited in 2 to build the same of such large compass form wideness and height as the playhouse called the swan 3 to provide for the building a good sure and sufficient foundation of bricks thirteen inches at the least above the ground 4 to make three galleries the inner principal posts of the first story to be twelve feet in height and ten inches square in the middle story eight inches square in the upper story seven inches square545 5 to make two boxes in the lowermost story fit and decent for gentlemen to sit in and in the rest of the galleries partitions between the rooms as they are in the said playhouse called the swan 6 to construct a stage to be carried and taken away and to stand upon tressels good substantial and sufficient for the carrying and bearing of such a stage 7 to build the heavens all over the said stage to be borne or carried without any posts or supporters to be fixed or set upon the said stage 8 to equip the stage with a fit and convenient tyrehouse 9 to build two staircases without and adjoining to the said playhouse of such largeness and height as the staircases of the said playhouse called the swan 10 to new build erect and set up the said bullhouse and stable of that largeness and fitness as shall be sufficient to keep and hold six bulls and three horses 11 to new tyle with english tyles all the upper roof of the said playhouse and stable 12 to have the playhouse finished upon or before the last day of november 1613 footnote 544 the contract is printed in full in greg henslowe papers p 19 footnote 545 the height is given for the first story only we may assume that the middle and uppermost stories were of diminishing heights as in the case of the fortune playhouse in which the galleries were respectively twelve eleven and nine feet in height for all this katherens was to receive the sum of 360 but since henslowe and meade supplied a large share of the lumber and other materials the total cost of the building may be estimated as not less than 600 when completed the new playhouse was appropriately christened the hope it has been generally assumed that a picture of the hope is given in visschers view of london published in 1616 but this i think is exceedingly doubtful in drawing the bankside visscher rather slavishly copied the agas map of 1560 inserting a few new buildingsnotably the playhousesand it is virtually certain that he represented the bear garden so he distinctly calls it and the globe as they were before their reconstruction546 the first representation of the hope is to be found in hollars splendid view of london published in 1647 see page 326 at this time the building which had for many years been devoted wholly to the royal sports of bull and bearbaiting was still standing it is hard to believe that an artist who so carefully represented the famous edifices of the city should have greatly erred in drawing the bear baiting housea structure more curious than they and quite as famous footnote 546 the merian view of london published in 1638 at frankfortammain is merely a copy of the visscher view with the addition of certain details from another and earlier view not yet identified it has no independent value the view of london printed in howells londinopolis 1657 is merely a slavish copy of the merian view visschers representation of the bear garden does not differ in any essential way from the representation in hondiuss view of 1610 for a fuller discussion see pages 126 146 248 hollar represents the hope as circular according to the contract katherens was to build the same of such large compass form wideness and height as the playhouse called the swan whether the word form was intended to apply to the exterior of the building we do not know the swan was decahedral visscher represents the bear garden as octagonal which is correct for the bear garden that preceded the hope but since the exterior was of lime and plaster and a decahedral form had no advantage katherens may well have constructed a circular building as hollar indicates perhaps it is significant in this connection that john taylor the waterpoet in his bull bear and horse refers to the hope as a sweet rotuntious college significant also perhaps is the clause in the contract by which katherens was required to build the heavens all over the stage for this exactly describes the heavens as drawn by hollar i see no reason to doubt that in the view of 1647 we have a reasonably faithful representation of the hope illustration the hope playhouse or second bear garden the upper view is from hollars postconflagration map in the crace collection of the british museum the lower view is from faithornes map of london 1658 the hope was probably opened shortly after november 30 1613 the date at which katherens had bound himself to have the building fully finished and it was occupied of course by the henslowe and rosseter troupe of actors the arrangement of the movable stage enabled henslowe and meade to use the building also for animalbaiting according to the contract with the actors the latter were to lie still one day in fourteen for the baiting547 this may not have been a serious interruption for the players but the presence of the stable the bear dens and the kennels for the dogs must have rendered the playhouse far from pleasant to the audiences ben jonson in the induction to his bartholomew fair acted at the hope in october 1614 remarks and though the fair be not kept in the same region that some here perhaps would have it yet think that therein the author hath observed a special decorum the place being as dirty as smithfield and as stinking every whit548 footnote 547 greg henslowe papers p 88 cf p 125 where animalbaiting is said to be used one day of every four daysa possible error for fourteen days in the manuscript notes to the phillipps copy of stows survey 1631 we are told that baiting was used at the hope on tuesdays and thursdays but the anonymous commentator is very inaccurate footnote 548 the rose playhouse was likewise affected dekker in satiromastix iii iv says thast a breath as sweet as the rose that grows by the bear garden in march 1614that is at the completion of one full year under the joint management of henslowe and rosseterthe amalgamated company was broken and rosseter withdrew selling his interest in the companys apparel to henslowe and meade for 63 the latter at once reorganized the actors under the patent of the lady elizabeths men and continued them at the hope549 the general excellence of the troupe thus formed is referred to by john taylor the waterpoet in the lines and such a company ill boldly say that better nor the like eer playd a play550 footnote 549 greg henslowe papers p 87 the articles of agreement between henslowe and meade and the company are printed by greg on page 23 footnote 550 works folio of 1630 the spenser societys reprint p 307 but this encomium may have been in large measure due to gratitude for the company had just saved the waterpoet from a very embarrassing situation the amusing episode which gave occasion to this deserves to be chronicled in some detail with a thousand bills posted over the city taylor had advertised to the public that at the hope playhouse on october 7 1614 he would engage in a contest of wit with one william fennor who proudly styled himself the kings majestys riming poet551 on the appointed day the house was filld with a great audience that had paid extra money to hear the contest between two such wellknown extemporal wits but fennor did not appear the result may best be told by taylor himself i then stept out their angers to appease but they all raging like tempestuous seas cryd out their expectations were defeated and how they all were conycatchd and cheated some laught some swore some stard and stampd and curst and in confusd humors all out burst i as i could did stand the desprate shock and bid the brunt of many dangrous knock for now the stinkards in their ireful wraths bepelted me with lome with stones with laths one madly sits like bottleale and hisses another throws a stone and cause he misses he yawnes and bawles some run to th door to get again their coin one valiantly stepped upon the stage and would tear down the hangings in his rage what i endurd upon that earthly hell my tongue or pen cannot describe it well552 footnote 551 fennor is not to be confused as is commonly done with vennar see p 177 such witcontests were popular fennor had recently challenged kendall on the fortune stage footnote 552 john taylors works folio of 1630 p 142 the spenser societys reprint p 304 at this point the actors came to his rescue and presented a play that mollified the audience taylor had to content himself with a printed justification the bitter invective of taylor against fennor fennors reply and taylors several answers are to be found in the folio edition of the waterpoets works the episode doubtless furnished much amusement to the city some three weeks after this event on october 31 1614 the lady elizabeths men produced with great success jonsons bartholomew fair and on november 1 they were called upon to give the play at court but the career of the company was in the main unhappy henslowe managed their affairs on the theory that should these fellows come out of my debt i should have no rule with them553 accordingly in three years he broke and again reorganized them no fewer than five times footnote 553 greg henslowe papers p 89 at last in february 1615 he not only broke the company but severed his connection with them for ever he turned the hired men over to other troupes and sold the stock of apparel to strangers for 400 the indignant actors in june 1615 drew up articles of grievance in which they charged henslowe with having extorted from the company by unjust means the sum of 567 and also articles of oppression in which they accused him of various dishonorable practices in his dealings with them554 footnote 554 ibid pp 86 89 shortly after severing his connection with the lady elizabeths men henslowe in march 1615 seems to have taken over prince charless men who it appears had been acting at the swan to this new companythe strangers referred to i thinkhe had already transferred some of the hirelings and had sold the hope stock of apparel for 400 henslowe died early in january of the following year 1616 and his interest in the theatre passed to edward alleyn on march 20 1616 alleyn and meade engaged prince charless men to continue at the hope according to the former articles of agreement had and made with the said philip henslowe and jacob meade555 the actors acknowledged themselves indebted to henslowe for a stock of apparel used for playing apparel to the value of 400 heretofore delivered unto them by the said philip556the stock formerly used by the lady elizabeths men and alleyn and meade agreed to accept 200 in full discharge of that debt557 footnote 555 collier memoirs of edward alleyn p

explanation to edward alleyn i hope you mistake not our removal from the bankside we stood the intemperate weather till more intemperate mr meade thrust us over taking the day from us which by course was ours558 footnote 558 greg henslowe papers p 93 cf also the chapter on rosseters blackfriars after the company quarreled with meade and deserted the hope there is no evidence that the building was again used for plays it became associated almost entirely with animalbaiting fencing feats of activity and suchlike performances and gradually the very name hope which was identified with acting gave way to the earlier designation bear garden in 1632 the author of hollands leaguer remarks that wild beasts and gladiators did most possess it and such must have been the chief use of the building down to 1642 when animalbaiting was prohibited by parliament559 footnote 559 collier the history of english dramatic poetry 1879 iii 102 ordish early london theatres p 237 on january 14 1647 at the

this note are obvious yet the latter part is so circumstantial that we cannot well doubt its general accuracy the building however was not pulled down to the ground though its interior may have been converted into tenements at the restoration when the royal sport of bearbaiting was revived the hope was again fitted up as an amphitheatre and opened to the public the earl of manchester on september 29 1664 wrote to the city authorities requesting that the butchers be required as of old to provide food for the dogs and bears he had been informed by the master of his majestys game of bears and bulls and others that the butchers company had formerly caused all their offal in eastcheap and newgate market to be conveyed by the beadle of that company unto two barrow houses conveniently placed on the river side for the provision and feeding of the kings game of bears which custom had been interrupted in the late troubles when the bears were killed his majestys game being now removed to the usual place on the bankside by order of the council he recommended the court of aldermen to direct the master and wardens of the butchers company to have their offal conveyed as formerly for the feeding of the bears c562 footnote 562 the remembrancia p 478 quoted by ordish early london theatres p 241 for some years the bear garden flourished as it had in the days of elizabeth and james it was frequently visited by samuel pepys who has left vivid accounts of several performances there in his diary august 14 1666 he writes after dinner with my wife and mercer to the beargarden where i have not been i think of many years and saw some good sport of the bulls tossing of the dogs one into the very boxes but it is a very rude and nasty pleasure we had a great many hectors in the same box with us and one very fine went into the pit and played his dog for a wager which was a strange sport for a gentleman where they drank wine and drank mercers health first which i pledged with my hat off john evelyn likewise in his diary june 16 1670 records a visit to the bear garden i went with some friends to the bear garden where was cockfighting dogfighting bear and bullbaiting it being a famous day for all these butcherly sports or rather barbarous cruelties the bulls did exceeding well but the irish wolfdog exceeded which was a tall greyhound a stately creature indeed who beat a cruel mastiff one of the bulls tossed a dog full into a ladys lap as she sat in one of the boxes at a considerable height from the arena two poor dogs were killed and so all ended with the ape on horseback and i most heartily weary of the rude and dirty pastime which i had not seen i think in twenty years before on january 7 1676 the spanish ambassador was entertained at the bear garden as we learn from a warrant dated march 28 1676 for the payment of 10 to james davies esq master of his majestys bears bulls and dogs for making ready the rooms at the bear garden and baiting of the bears before the spanish ambassador the 7 january last 1675 6563 footnote 563 british museum additional mss 5750 quoted by cunningham handbook of london 1849 i 67 rendle564 quotes from the loyal protestant an advertisement of an entertainment to be given so late as 1682 at the hope on the bankside being his majestys bear garden and malcolm writes the following account of the baiting of a horse there in april of the same year notice was given in the papers that on the twelfth of april a horse of uncommon strength and between 18 and 19 hands high would be baited to death at his majestys beargarden at the hope on the bankside for the amusement of the morocco ambassador many of the nobility who knew the horse and any others who would pay the price of admission it seems this animal originally belonged to the earl of rochester and being of a ferocious disposition had killed several of his brethren for which misdeed he was sold to the earl of dorchester in whose service committing several similar offenses he was transferred to the worse than savages who kept the beargarden on the day appointed several dogs were set upon the vindictive steed which he destroyed or drove from the arena at this instant his owners determined to preserve him for a future days sport and directed a person to lead him away but before the horse had reached london bridge the spectators demanded the fulfilment of the promise of baiting him to death and began to destroy the building to conclude the poor beast was brought back and other dogs set upon him without effect when he was stabbed to death with a sword565 footnote 564 the antiquarian magazine and bibliographer viii 59 footnote 565 james peller malcolm anecdotes of the manners and customs of london from the roman invasion to the year 1700 london 1811 p 425 this is the last reference to the hope that i have been able to discover soon after this date the royal sport of bulls bears and dogs was moved to hockleyinthehole clerkenwell where as the advertisements inform us at his majestys bear garden the baiting of animals was to be frequently seen566 strype in his survey of london thus describes bear garden alley on the bankside bear alley runs into maiden lane here is a glass house and about the middle is a newbuilt court well inhabited called bear garden square so called as built in the place where the bear garden formerly stood until removed to the other side of the water which is more convenient for the butchers and such like who are taken with such rustic sports as the baiting of bears and bulls567 footnote 566 the earliest advertisement of the bear garden at hockleyinthehole that i have come upon is dated 1700 for a discussion of the sports there see jp malcolm anecdotes of the manners and customs of london during the eighteenth century 1808 p 321 cunningham handbook of london under hockley wb boulton amusements of old london vol i chap i footnote 567 ordish early london theatres p 242 is mistaken in thinking that the old building was converted into a glass house he says the last reference to the hope shows that it had declined to the point of extinction and he quotes an advertisement from the gazette june 18 1681 as follows there is now made at the bear garden glasshouse on the bankside crown windowglass much exceeding french glass in all its qualifications which may be squared into all sizes of sashes for windows and other uses and may be had at most glaziers in london from strypes survey it is evident that the glass house was in bear garden alley but not on the site of the old bear garden in the map which he gives of this region reproduced on page 245 the position of the hope is clearly marked by the square near the middle of bear alley chapter xvii rosseters blackfriars or porters hall philip rosseter the poet and musician first appears as a theatrical manager in 1610 when he secured a royal patent for the children of the queens revels to act at whitefriars this company performed there successfully under his management until march 1613 when for some unknown reason he formed a partnership with philip henslowe who was managing the lady elizabeths men at the swan the two companies were combined and the new organization under the name of the lady elizabeths men made use of both playhouses the swan as a summer and the whitefriars as a winter home as already explained in the preceding chapters rosseters lease on the whitefriars playhouse was to expire in 1614 and apparently he was unable to renew the lease568 naturally he and his partner henslowe were anxious to secure a private playhouse in the city to serve as a winter home for their troupe especially since the swan was poorly situated for winter patronage this may explain the following entry in sir george bucs officebook july 13 1613 for a license to erect a new playhouse in whitefriars c 20569 the new playhouse however was not built probably the opposition of the inhabitants of the district led to its prohibition footnote 568 nathaniel field the leading actor at whitefriars published a woman is a weathercock in 1612 with the statement to the reader if thou hast anything to say to me thou knowst where to hear of me for a year or two and no more i assure thee possibly this reflects the failure of the managers to renew the lease after 1614 field did not know where he would be acting but editors have generally regarded it as meaning that field intended to withdraw from acting footnote 569 malone variorum iii 52 at the expiration of one year in march 1614 rosseter withdrew from his partnership with henslowe and on the old patent of the children of the queens revels which he had retained organized a new company to travel in the country in the following year 1615 he and certain others philip kingman robert jones and ralph reeve secured a lease of diverse buildings cellars sollars chambers and yards for the building of a playhouse thereupon for the better practising and exercise of the said children of the revels all which premises are situate and being within the precinct of the blackfriars near puddlewharf in the suburbs of london called by the name of the lady saunderss house or otherwise porters hall570 it was their purpose to convert this hall into a playhouse to rival the nearby blackfriars and in accordance with this purpose on june 3 1615 rosseter secured a royal license under the great seal of england to erect build and set up in and upon the said premises before mentioned one convenient playhouse for the said children of the revels the same playhouse to be used by the children of the revels for the time being of the queenes majesty and for the princes players and for the lady elizabeths players571 footnote 570 the malone societys collections i 277 for the location of puddlewharf see the map of the blackfriars precinct on page 94 footnote 571 the malone societys collections i 277 the work of converting porters hall into a playhouse seems to have begun at once on september 26 1615 the privy council records that one rosseter and others having obtained license under the great seal of england for the building of a playhouse have pulled down ie stripped the interior of a great messuage in puddlewharf which was sometimes the house of the lady saunders within the precinct of the blackfriars and are now erecting a new playhouse in that place572 footnote 572 ibid p 373 the city authorities always hostile to the actors and jealous of any new theatres made so vigorous a complaint to the privy council that the lords of the council thought fit to send for rosseter he came bringing his royal license this document was carefully perused by the lord chief justice of england who succeeded in discovering in the wording of one of its clauses a trivial flaw that would enable the privy council on a technicality to prohibit the building the lord chief justice did deliver to their lordships that the license granted to the said rosseter did extend to the building of a playhouse without the liberties of london and not within the city573 now in 1608 the liberty of blackfriars had by a special royal grant been placed within the jurisdiction of the city rosseters license unluckily had described the lady saunderss house as being in the suburbs though of course the description was otherwise specific enough all which premises are situate and being within the precinct of the blackfriars near puddlewharf in the suburbs of london called by the name of the lady saunderss house or otherwise porters hall footnote 573 the malone societys collections i 373 since the inconveniences urged by the lord mayor and aldermen were many the lords of the privy council decided to take advantage of the flaw discovered by the lord chief justice and prohibit the erection of the playhouse their order issued september 26 1615 reads as follows it was this day ordered by their lordships that there shall be no playhouse erected in that place and that the lord mayor of london shall straightly prohibit the said rosseter and the rest of the patentees and their workmen to proceed in the making and converting the said building into a playhouse and if any of the patentees or their workmen shall proceed in their intended building contrary to this their lordships inhibition that then the lord mayor shall commit him or them so offending unto prison and certify their lordships of their contempt in that behalf574 footnote 574 ibid this order for the time being halted work on the new playhouse the children of the revels were forced to spend the next year traveling in the provinces and the lady elizabeths men and prince charless men had to remain on the bankside and endure the oppressions of henslowe and later of meade possibly their sufferings at the hands of meade led them to urge rosseter to complete at once the much desired house in the city at any rate in the winter of 1616 rosseter believing himself strongly enough entrenched behind his royal patent resumed work on converting porters hall into a theatre the city authorities issued diverse commandments and prohibitions but he paid no attention to these and pushed the work to completion the building seems to have been ready for the actors about the first of january 1617 thereupon the company which had been occupying the hope deserted that playhouse and came over to rosseters blackfriars575 in the new playhouse they presented nathaniel fields comedy amends for ladies which was printed the following year as it was acted at the blackfriars both by the princes servants and the lady elizabeths footnote 575 see the chapter on the hope the actors however were not allowed to enjoy their new home very long on january 27 1617 the privy council dispatched the following letter to the lord mayor whereas his majesty is informed that notwithstanding diverse commandments and prohibitions to the contrary there be certain persons that go about to set up a playhouse in the blackfriars near unto his majestys wardrobe and for that purpose have lately erected and made fit a building which is almost if not fully finished you shall understand that his majesty hath this day expressly signified his pleasure that the same shall be pulled down so as it be made unfit for any such use whereof we require your lordship to take notice and to cause it to be performed accordingly with all speed and thereupon to certify us of your proceeding there can be no doubt that an order so peremptory carrying the authority both of the privy council and of the king and requiring an immediate report was performed with all speed after this we hear nothing more of the playhouse in puddlewharf576 footnote 576 i can find no further reference to the puddlewharf theatre either in the records of the privy council or in the remembrancia of the city collier however in his history of english dramatic poetry 1879 i 384 says the city authorities proceeded immediately to the work and before three days had elapsed the privy council was duly and formally made acquainted with the fact that rosseters theatre had been made unfit for any such use as that for which it had been constructed collier fails to cite his authority for the statement the passage he quotes may be found in the order of the privy council printed above chapter xviii the phoenix or cockpit in drury lane the private playhouse opened in drury lane577 in 1617 seems to have been officially named the phoenix but to the players and the public alike it was more commonly known as the cockpit this implies some earlier connection of the site or of the building with cockfighting from time out of mind a favorite sport in england stowe writes in his survey cocks of the game are yet cherished by diverse men for their pleasures much money being laid on their heads when they fight in pits whereof some be costly made for that purpose these pits it seems were circular in shape and if large enough might well be used for dramatic purposes shakespeare in henry v 1599 likens his playhouse to a cockpit can this cockpit hold the vasty fields of france or may we cram within this wooden o the very casques that did affright the air at agincourt footnote 577 its exact position in drury lane is indicated by an order of the privy council june 8 1623 concerning the paving of a street at the rear of the theatre whereas the highway leading along the backside of the cockpit playhouse near lincolns inn fields and the street called queens street adjoining to the same are become very foul etc see the malone society collections i 383 queens street may be readily found in faithornes map of london malone variorum iii 53 states that it was situated opposite the castle tavern the site is said to be marked by pit court it is possible then that the building was an old cockpit made into a playhouse howes578 in enumerating the london theatres says five inns or common hostelries turned into playhouses one cockpit st pauls singingschool etc and thomas randolph in verses prefixed to james shirleys grateful servant printed in 1630 as it was acted in the private house in drury lane suggests the same metamorphosis when thy intelligence on the cockpit stage gives it a soul from her immortal rage i hear the muses birds with full delight sing where the birds of mars were wont to fight footnote 578 stows annals 1631 p 1004 but in this fantastic conceit randolph may have been thinking simply of the name of the theatre possibly he knew nothing of its early history on the whole it seems more likely that the playhouse was newly erected in 1617 upon the site of an old cockpit the name phoenix suggests that possibly the old cockpit had been destroyed by fire and that from its ashes had arisen a new building579 howes describes the phoenix as being in 1617 a new playhouse580 and camden who is usually accurate in such matters refers to it in the same year as nuper erectum581 footnote 579 some scholars have supposed that the playhouse when attacked by the apprentices in 1617 was burned and that the name phoenix was given to the building after its reconstruction but the building was not burned it was merely wrecked on the inside by apprentices footnote 580 continuation of stows annals 1631 p 1026 footnote 581 william camden annals under the date of march 4 1617 yet sir sidney lee a life of william shakespeare p 60 says built about 1610 of its size and shape all our information comes from james wright who in his historia histrionica582 tells us that the cockpit differed in no essential feature from blackfriars and salisbury court for they were all three built almost exactly alike for form and bigness since we know that blackfriars and salisbury court were small rectangular theatres the former constructed in a hall fortysix feet broad and sixtysix feet long the latter erected on a plot of ground fortytwo feet broad and one hundred and forty feet long we are not left entirely ignorant of the shape and the approximate size of the cockpit583 and from middletons inner temple masque 1618 we learn that it was constructed of brick its sign presumably was that of a phoenix rising out of flames footnote 582 hazlitts dodsley xv 408 footnote 583 fleay and lawrence are wrong in supposing that the cockpit was circular illustration the site of the cockpit in drury lane the site is marked by cockpit court from rocques map of london 1746 the playhouse was erected and managed by christopher beeston584 one of the most important actors and theatrical managers of the elizabethan period we first hear of him as a member of shakespeares troupe in 1602 he joined worcesters company in 1612 he became the manager of queen annes company at the red bull he is described at that time as a thriving man and one that was of ability and means585 he continued as manager of the queen annes men at the red bull until 1617 when he transferred them to his new playhouse in drury lane footnote 584 alias christopher hutchinson several actors of the day employed aliases nicholas wilkinson alias tooley theophilus bourne alias bird james dunstan alias tunstall etc whether beeston admitted other persons to a share in the building i cannot learn in a passage quoted by malone variorum iii 121 from the herbert manuscript dated february 20 1635 there is a reference to housekeepers indicating that beeston had then admitted sharers in the proprietorship of the building and in an order of the privy council may 12 1637 the malone societys collections i 392 we read command the keepers of the playhouse called the cockpit in drury lane who either live in it or have relation to it not to permit plays to be acted there till further order footnote 585 wallace three london theatres p 35 the playhouse seems to have been ready to receive the players about the end of february 1617 we know that they were still performing at the red bull as late as february 23586 but by march 4 they had certainly moved to the cockpit footnote 586 wallace ibid pp 32 46 john smith was delivering silk and other clothes to the queen annes men at the red bull from 1612 until february 23 1617 on the latter date during the performance of a play the cockpit was entered by a mob of disorderly persons who proceeded to demolish the interior the occasion for the wrecking of the new playhouse was the shrove tuesday saturnalia of the london apprentices who from time immemorial had employed this holiday to pull down houses of illfame in the suburbs that the cockpit was situated in the neighborhood of such houses cannot be doubted we may suppose that the mob fresh from sacking buildings had crowded into the playhouse in the afternoon and before the play was over had wrecked that building too the event created a great stir at the time william camden in his annals wrote under the date of march 4 1617 theatrum ludiorum nuper erectum in drury lane a furente multitudine diruitur et apparatus dilaceratur howes in his continuation of stows annals writes shrovetuesday the fourth of march many disordered persons of sundry kinds amongst whom were very many young boys and lads that assembled themselves in lincolnes inn field finsbury field in ratcliffe and stepney field where in riotous manner they did beat down the walls and windows of many victualing houses and of all other houses which they suspected to be bawdy houses and that afternoon they spoiled a new playhouse and did likewise more hurt in diverse other places587 footnote 587 annals 1631 p 1026 that several persons were killed and many injured is disclosed by a letter from the privy council to the lord mayor dated march 5 1617 it is not unknown unto you what tumultuous outrages were yesterday committed near unto the city of london in diverse places by a rowt of lewd and loose persons apprentices and others especially in lincolns inn fields and drury lane where in attempting to pull down a playhouse belonging to the queens majestys servants there were diverse persons slain and others hurt and wounded the multitude there assembled being to the number of many thousands as we are credibly informed588 footnote 588 the malone societys collections i 374 collier in the history of english dramatic poetry 1879 i 386 prints a long ballad on the event but he does not give its source and its genuineness has been questioned the following year threats to pull down the fortune the red bull and the cockpit led to the setting of special watches see the malone societys collections i 377 the queens men returned to the red bull and acted there until their ruined playhouse could be repaired three months later on june 3 they again occupied the cockpit589 and continued there until the death of queen anne on march 2 1619590 footnote 589 greenstreet documents the new shakspere societys transactions 188086 p 504 footnote 590 mr wallace three london theatres p 29 says that the documents he prints make it as certain as circumstances unsupported by contemporary declaration can make it that queen annes company occupied the red bull continuously from the time of its erection till their dissolution 1619 his documents make it certain only that queen annes men occupied the red bull until february 23 1617 other documents prove that they occupied the cockpit from 1617 until 1619 note the letter of the privy council quoted above the documents printed by greenstreet show that queen annes men moved to the cockpit on june 3 1617 and continued there this event led to the dissolution of the company for a year or more its members had been falling at variance and strife amongst themselves and when the death of the queen deprived them of a service they separated and divided themselves into other companies591 as a result of the quarrels certain members of the company made charges against their former manager beeston the said beeston having from the beginning a greater care for his own private gain and not respecting the good of these defendants and the rest of his fellows and companions hath in the place and trust aforesaid much enriched himself and hath of late given over his coat and condition592 and separated and divided himself from these defendants carrying away not only all the furniture and apparel etc593 the charges against beestons honesty may be dismissed but it seems clear that he had withdrawn from his former companions and was preparing to entertain a new troupe of actors at his playhouse and beeston himself tells us on november 23 1619 that after her majestys decease he entered into the service of the most noble prince charles594 thus prince charless men after their unfortunate experiences at the hope and at rosseters blackfriars came to beestons playhouse where they remained until 1622 in the spring of that year however they moved to the curtain and the princess elizabeths men occupied the cockpit595 under their tenancy the playhouse seems to have attained an enviable reputation heminges and condell in the epistle to the readers prefixed to the folio of shakespeare 1623 bear testimony to this in the following terms and though you be a magistrate of wit and sit on the stage at blackfriars or the cockpit to arraign plays daily a further indication of their prosperity is to be found in the records of st giless church for when in 1623 the parish undertook the erection of a new church building the players of the cockpit we are informed contributed the large sum of 20 and the proprietors represented by christopher beeston gave 19 1s 5d596 footnote 591 wallace three london theatres p 33 footnote 592 he had joined prince charless men footnote 593 wallace three london theatres p 38 footnote 594 ibid p 40 fleay murray and others have contended that the princess elizabeths men came to the cockpit in 1619 and have denied the accuracy of the titlepage of the witch of edmonton 1658 which declares that play to have been acted by the princes servants at the cockpit often see fleay a chronicle history of the london stage p 299 footnote 595 malone variorum iii 59 footnote 596 john parton some account of the hospital and parish of st giles in the fields p 235 from a parish entry in 1660 we learn that the players had to contribute 2d to the parish poor for each day that there was acting at the cockpit see ibid p 236 the princess elizabeths men continued to act at the cockpit until may 1625 when all theatres were closed on account of the plague beeston made this the occasion to organize a new company called queen henriettas men and when the theatres were allowed to reopen about december 1625597 this new company was in possession of the cockpit but the reputation of the playhouse seems not to have been enhanced by the performances of this troupe in 1629 lenton in the young gallants whirligig writes sneeringly the cockpit heretofore would serve his wit but now upon the friars stage hell sit footnote 597 in the middlesex county records iii 6 we find that on december 6 1625 because the drawing of people together to places was a great means of spreading and continuing the infection this court doth prohibit the players of the house at the cockpit being next to his majestys court at whitehall commanding them to surcease all such their proceedings until his majestys pleasure be further signified apparently the playhouses in general had been allowed to resume performances and since by december 24 there had been no deaths from the plague for a week the special inhibition of the cockpit playhouse was soon lifted and in the following year 1630 thomas carew in verses prefixed to davenports just italian attacks the red bull and the cockpit as adulterate stages where noise prevails and not a tongue of th untund kennel can a line repeat of serious sense queen henriettas men probably continued to occupy the building until may 12 1636 when the theatres were again closed on account of a serious outbreak of the plague the plague continued for nearly a year and a half and during this time the company was dissolved598 footnote 598 when her majestys servants were at the cockpit being all at liberty they dispersed themselves to several companies hetons patent 1639 the shakespeare society papers iv 96 before the plague had ceased early in 1637 mr

the place of governor of the new company of the kings and queens boys600 the first recorded performance by this new company was at court on february 7 1637601 on february 23 the number of deaths from

perform their service and besought that they might have leave to practise it was ordered that beeston should be at liberty to practise his actors at michaelmas next september 29 if there be no considerable increase of the sickness nor that there die more than died last week605 footnote 605 ibid 1637 p 420 on october 2 1637 the plague having abated all playhouses were opened and the kings and queens boys herbert tells us began to play at the cockpit the same day606 here under the popular name of beestons boys they enjoyed a long and successful career which ended only with the prohibition of acting in 1642 footnote 606 malone variorum iii 240 in 1639 christopher beeston died and the position of governor of the boys was conferred upon his son william beeston who had long been associated in the management of the company607 and who if we may believe francis kirkman was admirably qualified for the position in dedicating to him the loves and adventures of clerico and lozia kirkman says divers times in my hearing to the admiration of the whole company you have most judiciously discoursed of poesie which is the cause i presume to choose you for my patron and protector who are the happiest interpreter and judge of our english stageplays this nation ever produced which the poets and actors of these times cannot without ingratitude deny for i have heard the chief and most ingenious acknowledge their fames and profits essentially sprung from your instruction judgment and fancy footnote 607 he is referred to as their governor on august 10 1639 see malone variorum iii 159 but in spite of all this william beestons career as governor was of short duration about the first of may 1640 he allowed the boys to act without license a play that gave great offense to the king herbert the master of the revels writes of this play that it had relation to the passages of the kings journey into the north and was complained of by his majesty to me with command to punish the offenders608 in the officebook of the lord chamberlain under the date of may 3 1640 we read whereas william beeston and the company of the players of the cockpit in drury lane have lately acted a new play without any license from the master of his majestys revels and being commanded to forbear playing or acting of the same play by the said master of the revels and commanded likewise to forbear all manner of playing have notwithstanding in contempt of the authority of the said master of the revels and the power granted unto him under the great seal of england acted the said play and others to the prejudice of his majestys service and in contempt of the office of the revels whereby he and they and all other companies ever have been and ought to be governed and regulated these are therefore in his majestys name and signification of his royal pleasure to command the said william beeston and the rest of that company of the cockpit players from henceforth and upon sight hereof to forbear to act any plays whatsoever until they shall be restored by the said master of the revels unto their former liberty whereof all parties concernable are to take notice and conform accordingly as they and every one of them will answer it at their peril609 footnote 608 malone variorum iii 241 footnote 609 collier the history of english dramatic poetry 1879 ii 32 stopes op cit p 102 herbert records in his officebook on monday the 4 may 1640 william beeston was taken by a messenger and committed to the marshalsea by my lord chamberlains warrant for playing a play without license the same day the company at the cockpit was commanded by my lord chamberlains warrant to forbear playing for playing when they were forbidden by me and for other disobedience and lay still monday tuesday and wednesday on thursday at my lord chamberlains entreaty i gave them their liberty and upon their petition of submission subscribed by the players i restored them to their liberty on thursday610 footnote 610 malone variorum iii 241 herbert did not forget beestons insubordination and in 1660 in issuing to beeston a license to use the salisbury court playhouse he inserted clauses to prevent further difficulty of this kind see variorum iii 243 to this period of beestons imprisonment i should refer the puzzling epilogue of bromes the court beggar theres wit in that now but this small poet vents none but his own and his by whose care and directions this stage is governd who has for many years both in his fathers days and since directed poets to write and players to speak till he trained up these youths here to what they are now aye some of em from before they were able to say a grace of two lines long to have more parts in their pates than would fill so many dryvats and to be serious with you if after all this by the venomous practice of some who study nothing more than his destruction he should fail us both poets and players would be at loss in reputation his destruction was wrought nevertheless for as a result of his indiscretion he was deposed from his position as governor of the kings and queens company and william davenant was appointed in his place in the officebook of the lord chamberlain under the date of june 27 1640611 appears the following entry with the heading mr davenant governor of the cockpit players whereas in the playhouse or theatre commonly called the cockpit in drury lane there are a company of players authorized by me as lord chamberlain to his majesty to play or act under the title of the kings and queens servants and that by reason of some disorders lately amongst them committed they are disabled in their service and quality these are therefore to signify that by the same authority i do authorize and appoint william davenant gent one of her majestys servants for me and in my name to take into his government and care the said company of players to govern order and dispose of them for action and presentments and all their affairs in the said house as in his discretion shall seem best to conduce to his majestys service in that quality and i do hereby enjoin and command them all and every of them that are so authorized to play in the said house under the privilege of his or her majestys servants and every one belonging as prentices or servants to those actors to play under the same privilege that they obey the said mr davenant and follow his orders and directions as they will answer the contrary which power and privilege he is to continue and enjoy during that lease which mrs elizabeth beeston alias hucheson hath or doth hold in the said playhouse provided he be still accountable to me for his care and well ordering the said company612 footnote 611 stopes op cit dates this june 5 but collier malone and chalmers all give june 27 and mrs stopes is not always quite accurate in such matters footnote 612 collier the history of english dramatic poetry 1879 ii 32 note 1 under the direction of davenant the company acted at the cockpit until the closing of the theatres two years later the history of the playhouse during the troubled years that followed is varied in the churchwardens account of st giless parish is found the entry 1646 paid and given to the teacher at the cockpit of the children 6d613 apparently the old playhouse was then being temporarily used as a school footnote 613 john parton some account of the hospital and parish of st giles in the fields p 235 wright in his historia histrionica tells us that at the outbreak of the civil war most of the actors had joined the royal army and served his majesty though in a different yet more honorable capacity some were killed many won distinction and when the wars were over and the royalists totally subdued most of em who were left alive gathered to london and for a subsistence endeavored to revive their old trade privately they made up one company out of all the scattered members of several and in the winter before the kings murder 1648 they ventured to act some plays with as much caution and privacy as could be at the cockpit john evelyn records in his diary under the date of february 5 1648 saw a tragicomedy acted in the cockpit after there had been none of these diversions for many years during the war trouble however was brewing for these daring actors as wright records they continued undisturbed for three or four days but at last as they were presenting the tragedy of the bloody brother in which lowin acted aubery taylor rollo pollard the cook burt latorch and i think hart otto a party of footsoldiers beset the house surprised em about the middle of the play and carried em away in their habits not admitting them to shift to hatton house then a prison where having detained them some time they plundered them of their clothes and let em loose again614 footnote 614 hazlitts dodsley xv 409 in 1649 the interior of the building was sacked if we may trust the manuscript note entered in the phillipps copy of stows annals 1631 the playhouse in salisbury court in fleet street was pulled down by a company of soldiers set on by the sectaries of these sad times on saturday the 24 day of march 1649 the phoenix in drury lane was pulled down also this day being saturday the 24 day of march 1649 by the same soldiers615 in the passage quoted pulleddown merely means that the stage and its equipment and possibly a part of the galleries and the seats were wrecked not that the walls of the building itself were thrown down footnote 615 see the academy october 28 1882 p 314 the soldiers here mentioned also pulled down on the inside the fortune playhouse in 1656 sir william davenant undertook to create a form of dramatic entertainment which would be tolerated by the authorities the lord protector was known to be a lover of music sir william therefore applied for permission to give operatic entertainments after the manner of the antients the story sung in recitative music and the representation made by the art of perspective in scenes to such entertainments he thought no one could object he was wise enough to give his first performances at rutland house but in 1658 he moved to the cockpit where says aubrey were acted very well stylo recitativo sir francis drake and the siege of rhodes 1st and 2d parts it did affect the eye and ear extremely this first brought scenes in fashion in england before at plays was only a hanging thus the cockpit had the distinction of being the first english playhouse in which scenery was employed and one should add the first english home of the opera616 footnote 616 for a discussion of davenants attempts to introduce the opera into england see wj lawrence the elizabethan playhouse second series pp 129 ff later in the same year 1658 davenant exhibited at the cockpit the cruelty of the spaniards in peru but this performance excited the suspicion of the authorities who on december 23 sent for the poet and the actors to explain by what authority the same is exposed to public view617 footnote 617 malone variorum iii 93 collier the history of english dramatic poetry 1879 ii 48 in the year 1659 writes john downes in his roscius anglicanus general monk marching then his army out of scotland to london mr rhodes a bookseller being wardrobekeeper formerly as i am informed to king charles the firsts company of commedians in blackfriars getting a license from the then governing state618 fitted up a house then for acting called the cockpit in drury lane and in a short time completed his company if this statement is correct the time must have been early in the year 165960 and the company must have attempted at first to play without a proper license from the middlesex county records iii 282 we learn that one of their important actors thomas lilleston was held under bond for having performed a public stageplay this present 4th of february 165960 in the cockpit in drury lane in the parish of st gilesinthefields contrary to the law in that case made and in the parish book619 of st giles we find the entry 1659 received of isack smith which he received at the cockpit playhouse of several offenders by order of the justices 3 8s 6d shortly after this it is to be presumed the company under rhodess management secured the license of the then governing state mentioned by downes and continued thereafter without interruption the star of this company was betterton whose splendid acting at once captivated london pepys went often to the theatre and has left us some interesting notes of his experiences there on august 18 1660 he writes captain ferrers my lords cornet comes to us who after dinner took me and creed to the cockpit play the first that i have had time to see since my coming from sea the loyall subject where one kinaston a boy acted the dukes sister but made the loveliest lady that ever i saw in my life only her voice not very good footnote 618 for his troubles with the master of the revels see halliwellphillipps a collection of ancient documents p 26 footnote 619 parton op cit p 236 again on october 11 1660 he writes here in the park we met with mr salisbury who took mr creed and me to the cockpit to see the moor of venice which was well done burt acted the moor by the same token a very pretty lady that sat by me called out to see desdemona smothered the subsequent history of the cockpit falls outside the scope of the present treatise the reader who desires to trace the part the building played in the restoration would do well to consult the numerous documents printed by malone from the herbert manuscript620 footnote 620 malone variorum iii 244 ff chapter xix salisbury court the salisbury court playhouse621 was projected and built by two men whose very names are unfamiliar to most students of the dramarichard gunnell and william blagrove yet gunnell was a distinguished actor and was associated with the ownership and management of at least two theatres even so early as 1613 his reputation as a player was sufficient to warrant his inclusion as a full sharer in the palsgraves company then acting at the fortune when the fortune was rebuilt after its destruction by fire in 1621 he purchased one of the twelve shares in the new building and rose to be manager of the company622 in addition to managing the company he also as we learn from the herbert manuscript supplied the actors with plays in 1623 he composed the hungarian lion obviously a comedy and in the following year the way to content all women or how a man may please his wife623 of william blagrove i can learn little more than that he was deputy to the master of the revels in this capacity he signed the license for glapthornes lady mother october 15 1635 and his name appears several times in the herbert manuscript in connection with the payments of various companies624 possibly he was related to thomas blagrove who during the reign of elizabeth was an important member of the revels office and who for a time served as master of the revels footnote 621 the playhouse discussed in this chapter was officially known as the salisbury court playhouse and it should always be referred to by that name unfortunately owing to its situation near the district of whitefriars it was sometimes loosely though incorrectly called whitefriars since it had no relation whatever to the theatre formerly in the manorhouse of whitefriars a perpetuation of this false nomenclature is highly undesirable footnote 622 malone variorum iii 66 footnote 623 chalmerss supplemental apology pp 21617 he may also have been the author of a play called the masque which herbert in 1624 licensed for the palsgraves company a new play called the masque in the list of manuscript plays collected by warburton we find the title a mask and the authorship ascribed to r govell since r govell is not otherwise heard of we may reasonably suppose that this was warburtons reading of r gunell gunnell also prefixed a poem to the works of captain john smith 1626 footnote 624 malone variorum iii 66 122 176 177 what threw these two men together in a theatrical partnership we do not know but in the summer of 1629 they decided to build a private playhouse to compete with the successful blackfriars and cockpit and for this purpose they leased from the earl of dorset a plot of ground situated to the east of the precinct of whitefriars the ground thus leased opened on salisbury court hence the name the salisbury court playhouse in the words of the legal document the earl of dorset in consideration that richard gunnell and william blagrove should at their costs and charges erect a playhouse and other buildings at the lower end of salisbury court in the parish of st bridges in the ward of farringdon without did demise to the said gunnell and blagrove a piece of ground at the same lower end of salisbury court containing one hundred and forty foot in length and fortytwo in breadth for fortyone years and a half the lease was signed on july 6 1629 nine days later on july 15 the earl of dorset in consideration of nine hundred and fifty pounds paid to the said late earl by john herne of lincolns inn esquire did demise to hire the said piece of ground and the building ie the playhouse thereupon to be erected and the rent reserved upon the said lease made to gunnell and blagrove hernes lease was for a term of sixtyone years the effect of this second lease was merely to make herne instead of the earl of dorset the landlord of the players illustration a plan of the salisbury court property to illustrate the lease drawn by the author the plot of ground selected for the playhouse is described with exactness in the lease printed below the letters inserted in brackets refer to the accompanying diagram see page 371 all that soil and ground whereupon the barn a at the lower end of the great back court or yard of salisbury court now stands and so much of the soil whereupon the whole south end of the great stable in the said court or yard stands or contains from that end of that stable towards the north end thereof sixteen foot of assize and the whole breadth of the said stable b and all the ground and soil on the east and west side of that stable lying directly against the said sixteen foot of ground at the south end thereof between the wall of the great garden belonging to the mansion called dorset house and the wall that severs the said court from the lane called water lane c and d and all the ground and soil being between the said walls on the east and west part thereof and the said barn stable and ground on both side the same on the south and north parts thereof e which said several parcells of soil and ground contain in the whole length one hundred and forty foot of assize and in breadth forty and two foot of assize and lies together at the lower end of the said court this plot one hundred and forty feet in length by fortytwo in breadth was small for its purpose and the playhouse must have covered all the breadth and most of the length of the leased ground625 there was no actual need of leaving any part of the plot vacant for the theatre adjoined the court and free ingress egress and regress to the building were stipulated in the lease by through and on any part of the court called salisbury court footnote 625 the blackfriars auditorium was sixtysix feet in length and fortysix feet in breadth at once gunnell and blagrove set about the erection of their playhouse they may have utilized in some way the great barn which occupied most of their property one of the legal documents printed by cunningham contains the phrase and the great barn which was afterwards the playhouse626 if this be truei think it very doubtfulthe reconstruction must have been thorough for howes in his continuation of stows annals 1631 speaks of salisbury court as a new fair playhouse627 and in all respects it seems to have ranked with the best footnote 626 cunningham the shakespeare societys papers iv 104 in his handbook for london cunningham says that the salisbury court playhouse was originally the barn footnote 627 annals 1631 p 1004 in 1633 prynne histriomastix refers to it as a new theatre erected we know very little of the building but wright in his historia histrionica informs us that it was almost exactly like the two other private houses the blackfriars and the cockpit true the blackfriars cockpit and salisbury court were called private houses and were very small to what we see now the cockpit was standing since the restoration and rhodes company acted there for some time love i have seen that true then you have seen the other two in effect for they were all three built almost exactly alike for form and bigness628 footnote 628 collier the history of english dramatic literature 1879 iii 106 thought that salisbury court was a round playhouse basing his opinion on a line in sharpes noble stranger acted at the private house in salisbury court thy stranger to the globelike theatre in spite of what wright says however there is some reason for believing that salisbury court was smaller than the other two private houses the epilogue to totenham court refers to it as my little house and the epistle affixed to the second edition of sir giles goosecappe is said to convey the same impression of smallness629 footnote 629 i have not been able to examine this in the only copy of the second edition accessible to me the epistle is missing according to malone sir henry herbert the master of the revels was one of the proprietors of the house and held a ninth share in the profits630 this however is not strictly accurate sir henry by virtue of his power to license playhouses demanded from each organization of players an annual fee the kings men gave him two benefit performances a year christopher beeston on behalf of the cockpit in drury lane paid him 60 a year as for the rest herbert tells us that he had a share paid by the fortune players and a share by the bull players and a share by the salisbury court players631 it seems therefore that the salisbury court organization was divided into eight shares and that of the profits an extra or ninth share was set aside as a fee for the master of the revels footnote 630 malone variorum iii 178 footnote 631 halliwellphillipps a collection of ancient documents p 27 the playhouse was ready for use in all probability in the autumn of 1629 and to occupy it a new company of actors was organized known as the kings revels the chief members of this company were george stutville john young william cartwright william wilbraham and christopher goad gunnell and blagrove probably acted as managers in the books of the lord chamberlain we find a warrant for the payment of 30 to william blagrove and the rest of his company for three plays acted by the children of the revels at whitehall 1631632 the children continued at salisbury court until about december 1631 when they abandoned the playhouse in favor of the much larger fortune surrendered by the palsgraves men footnote 632 see mrs stopess extracts from the lord chamberlains books in the shakespeare jahrbuch 1910 xlvi 97 this entry probably led cunningham to say the shakespeare societys papers iv 92 that blagrove was master of the children of the revels in the reign of charles i the palsgraves men who for many years had occupied the fortune seem to have fallen on bad times and to have disbanded they were reorganized however possibly by their old manager richard gunnell and established in salisbury court the earl of dorset who took a special interest in salisbury court obtained for the troupe a patent to play under the name of the infant prince charles then little more than a year old633 the patent bears the date of december 7 1631 and the servants of the high and mighty prince charles opened at salisbury court very soon after634 with a play by marmion entitled hollands leaguer the prologue refers to the going of the kings revels to the fortune and the coming of the new troupe to salisbury court gentle spectators that with graceful eye come to behold the muses colony new planted in this soil forsook of late by the inhabitants since made fortunate footnote 633 for dorsets interest in the matter see cunningham the shakespeare societys papers iv 96 footnote 634 in december 1631 see malone variorum iii 178 the prologue closes thus that on our branches now new poets sing and when with joy he shall see this resort phoebus shall not disdain to stylt his court but the audiences at salisbury court were not large for six performances of the play says malone sir henry herbert received but one pound nineteen shillings in virtue of the ninth share which he possessed as one of the proprietors of the house635 footnote 635 malone variorum iii 178 of the new poets referred to by the prologue one of course was marmion himself another i venture to say was james shirley who as i think had been engaged to write the companys second play this was the changes brought out at salisbury court on january 10 the prologue is full of allusions to the company its recent misfortunes and its present attempt to establish itself in its new quarters that muse whose song within another sphere636 hath pleased some and of the best whose ear is able to distinguish strains that are clear and phoebean from the popular and sinful dregs of the adulterate brain by me salutes your candour once again and begs this noble

writing footnote 637 cf new poets of marmions prologue footnote 638 an allusion to the smallness of the salisbury court playhouse the similarity of this to the prologue of hollands leaguer is striking and the epilogue is written in the same vein opinion comes hither but on crutches yet the sun hath lent no beam to warm us if this play proceed more fortunate we shall bless the day and love that brought you hither t is in you to make a little sprig of laurel grow and spread into a grove all scholars who have written on the subjectcollier fleay greg murray etchave contended that the kings revels company did not leave salisbury court until after january 10 1632 because herbert licensed shirleys the changes on that date639 and the titlepage of the only edition of the changes states that it was acted at salisbury court by his majestys revels but herbert records payments for six representations of marmions leaguer by prince charless men at salisbury court in december 1631640 this latter date must be correct for on january 26 hollands leaguer was entered on the stationers register as it hath been lately and often acted with great applause at the private house in salisbury court according to the generally accepted theory however the kings men were still at salisbury court and actually bringing out a new play there so late as january 10 this error has led to much confusion and to no little difficulty for historians of the stage for example mr murray is forced to suppose that two royal patents were granted to prince charless company641 it seems to me likely that the titlepage of the changes is incorrect in stating that the play was acted by the kings revels the play must have been acted by the new and as yet unpopular prince charless men who had occupied salisbury court as early as december and as herbert tells us with poor success the various dates cited clearly indicate this and the prologue and the epilogue are both wholly unsuited for utterance by the successful revels company which had just been made fortunate but are quite in keeping with the condition of the newly organized and struggling prince charless men who might naturally ask the public to encourage our beginning footnote 639 malone variorum iii 232 but malone was a careless transcriber and herbert himself sometimes made errors possibly the correct date is january 10 1631 footnote 640 ibid iii 178 footnote 641 english dramatic companies i 221 whether prince charless men ultimately succeeded in winning the favor of the public we do not know presumably they did for at some date before 1635 they moved to the large red bull playhouse richard heton wrote and whereas my lord of dorset had gotten for a former company at salisbury court the princes service they being left at liberty took their opportunity of another house and left the house in salisbury court destitute both of a service and company642 footnote 642 richard heton instructions for my pattent the shakespeare societys papers iv 96 this person richard heton who describes himself as one of the sewers of her majestys chamber extraordinary had now obtained control of salisbury court and had become manager of its affairs643 he apparently induced the company of his majestys revels to leave the fortune and return to salisbury court for in 1635 they acted there richard bromes the sparagus garden but their career at salisbury court was short on may 12 of the following year all playhouses were closed by the plague and acting was not allowed again for nearly a year and a half during this long period of inactivity the company of his majestys revels was largely dispersed footnote 643 we find a payment to richard heton for himself and the rest of the company of the players at salisbury court for performing a play before his majesty at court october 1635 chalmerss apology p 509 exactly when he took charge of salisbury court i am unable to learn when at last on october 2 1637 the playhouses were allowed to open heton found himself with a crippled troupe of actors again the earl of dorset interested himself in the theatre queen henriettas company which had been at the cockpit since 1625 having disperst themselves dorset took care to make up a new company for the queen644 and he placed this new company under heton at salisbury court heton writes how much i have done for the upbuilding of this company i gave you some particulars of in a petition to my lord of dorset this reorganization of the queens men explains perhaps the puzzling entry in herberts officebook october 2 1637 i disposed of perkins sumner sherlock and turner to salisbury court and joyned them with the best of that company645 doubtless herbert like dorset was anxious for the queen to have a good troupe of players this new organization of the queens men continued at salisbury court without interruption it seems until the closing of the playhouses in 1642646 footnote 644 cunningham the shakespeare societys papers iv 96 footnote 645 malone variorum iii 240 footnote 646 for certain troubles at salisbury court in 1644 and 1648 see collier the history of english dramatic poetry 1879 ii 37 40 47 in 1649 john herne son of the john herne who in 1629 had secured a lease on the property for sixtyone years made out a deed of sale of the playhouse to william beeston647 for the sum of 600 but the document was not signed the reason for this is probably revealed in the following passage the playhouse in salisbury court in fleet street was pulled down648 by a company of soldiers set on by the sectaries of these sad times on saturday the 24 day of march 1649649 footnote 647 william beeston was the son of the famous actor christopher beeston who was once a member of the lord chamberlains men

stagehangings and other appliances for dramatic performances footnote 649 the manuscript entry in stows annals see the academy october 28 1882 p 314 on the same date the soldiers pulled down on the inside also the phoenix and the fortune three years later however beeston through his agent theophilus bird secured the property from herne at the reduced price of 408 john herne by indenture dated the five and twentieth day of may 1652 for 408 to him paid by theophilus bird did assign the premises and all his estate therein in trust for the said william beeston650 footnote 650 cunningham the shakespeare societys papers iv 103 early in 1660 beeston anticipating the return of king charles and the restablishment of the drama decided to put his building back into condition to serve as a playhouse and he secured from herbert the master of the revels a license to do so651 on april 5 1660 he contracted with two carpenters fisher and silver for the rebuilding the premises and to secure them he mortgaged the property the carpenters later swore that they expended in the same work 329 9s 4d652 footnote 651 printed in malone variorum iii 243 and halliwellphillipps a collection of ancient documents p 85 the language clearly indicates that beeston was to reconvert the building into a theatre footnote 652 cunningham the shakespeare societys papers iv 103 the reconstructed playhouse was opened in 1660 probably as early as june with a performance of the rump by tatham it was engaged by sir william davenant for his company of actors until his new theatre with scenes could be erected in lincolns inn fields653 the ubiquitous pepys often went thither and in his diary gives us some interesting accounts of the performances he saw there on march 2 1661 he witnessed a revival of thomas heywoods loves mistress or the queens masque before a large audience after dinner i went to the theatre ie killigrews playhouse where i found so few people which is strange and the reason i did not know that i went out again and so to salisbury court where the house as full as could be and it seems it was a new play the queens masque wherein are some good humours among others a good jeer to the old story of the siege of troy making it to be a common country tale but above all it was strange to see so little a boy as that was to act cupid which is one of the greatest parts in it footnote 653 malone variorum iii 257 halliwellphillipps a collection of ancient documents p 27 again on march 26 he found salisbury court crowded after dinner mrs pierce and her husband and i and my

to admiration footnote 654 by philip massinger the history of the playhouse during these years falls outside the scope of this volume suffice it to say that before beeston finished paying the carpenters for their work of reconstruction the great fire of 1666 swept the building out of existence as fisher and silver declared the mortgaged premises by the late dreadful fire in london were totally burned down and consumed655 footnote 655 the subsequent history of salisbury court is traced in the legal documents printed by cunningham beeston lost the property and fisher and silver erected nearer the river a handsome new playhouse known as the dukes theatre at an estimated cost of 1000 chapter xx the cockpitincourt or theatre royal at whitehall on birthdays holidays and festive occasions in general the sovereigns of england and the members of the royal family were wont to summon the professional actors to present plays at court for the accommodation of the players and of the audience the larger halls at hampton windsor greenwich st james whitehall or wherever the sovereign happened to be at the time were specially fitted up often at great expense at one end of the hall was erected a temporary stage equipped with a musicroom players houses of canvas painted properties and such other things as were necessary to the actors in the centre of the hall on an elevated dais were provided seats for the royal family and around and behind the dais stools for the more distinguished guests a large part of the audience was allowed to stand on platforms raised in tiers at the rear of the room since the plays were almost invariably given at night the stage was illuminated by special branches hung on wires overhead and carrying many lights in the accounts of the office of the revels one may find interesting records of plays presented in this manner with the miscellaneous items of expense for making the halls ready usually the court performances like the masques were important almost official occasions and many guests including the members of the diplomatic corps were invited to provide accommodation for so numerous an audience a large room was needed hampton court possessed a splendid room for the purpose in the great banqueting hall one hundred and six feet in length and forty feet in breadth but the palace at whitehall for many years had no room of a similar character for the performance of a masque there in 1559 the queen erected a temporary banqueting house again in 1572 to entertain the duke of montmorency ambassador from france she had a large banketting house made at whitehall covered with canvas and decorated with ivy and flowers gathered fresh from the fields an account of the structure may be found in the records of the office of the revels perhaps however the most elaborate and substantial of these banqueting houses was that erected in 1581 to entertain the ambassadors from france who came to treat of a marriage between elizabeth and the duc danjou the structure is thus described by holinshed in his chronicle656 this year against the coming of certain commissioners out of france into england by her majestys appointment on the sixth and twentieth day of march in the morning being easter day a banqueting house was begun at westminster on the southwest side of her majestys palace of whitehall made in manner and form of a long square three hundred thirty and two foot in measure about thirty principals made of great masts being forty foot in length apiece standing upright between every one of these masts ten foot asunder and more the walls of this house were closed with canvas and painted all the outsides of the same most artificially with a work called rustic much like stone this house had two hundred ninety and two lights of glass the sides within the same house was made with ten heights of degrees for people to stand upon and in the top of this house was wrought most cunningly upon canvas works of ivy and holly with pendants made of wicker rods garnished with bay rue and all manner of strange flowers garnished with spangles of gold as also beautified with hanging toseans made of holly and ivy with all manner of strange fruits as pomegranates oranges pompions cucumbers grapes carrots with such other like spangled with gold and most richly hanged betwixt these works of bays and ivy were great spaces of canvas which was most cunningly painted the clouds with stars the sun and sunbeams with diverse other coats of sundry sorts belonging to the queens majesty most richly garnished with gold there were of all manner of persons working on this house to the number of three hundred seventy and five two men had mischances the one broke his leg and so did the other this house was made in three weeks and three days and was ended the eighteenth day of april and cost one thousand seven hundred forty and four pounds nineteen shillings and od mony as i was credibly informed by the worshipful master thomas grave surveyor unto her majestys works who served and gave order for the same footnote 656 edition of 1808 iv 434 see also stows chronicle under the year 1581 although built in such a short time and of such flimsy material this expensive banqueting house seems to have been allowed to stand and to have been used thereafter for masques and plays thus when king james came to the throne he ordered plays to be given there in november 1604 we find the following entry in the treasurers accounts for making ready the banqueting house at whitehall for the kings majesty against the plays by the space of four days 78s 7d and the accounts of the revels office inform us hallomas day being the first of november a play in the banqueting house at whitehall called the moor of venice apparently however the king was not pleased with the banqueting house as a place for dramatic performances for he promptly ordered the great hall of the palacea room approximately ninety feet in length and forty feet in breadth657to be made ready for the next play for making ready the great chamber at whitehall for the kings majesty to see the play by the space of two days 39s 4d footnote 657 this had once already on shrove tuesday 1604 been used for a play the situation and groundplan of the great hall are clearly shown in fishers survey of the palace made about 1670 and engraved by vertue 1747 the work was completed with dispatch for on the sunday following the performance of othello in the banqueting house the merry wives of windsor was acted in the great hall the next play to be given at court was also presented in the same room on st stephens night in the hall a play called measure for measure and from this time on the great hall was the usual place for court performances the abandonment of the banqueting house was probably due to the facts that the hall was smaller in size could be more easily heated in the winter and was in general better adapted to dramatic performances possibly the change was due also to the decayed condition of the old structure and to preparations for its removal stow in his annals under the date of 1607 writes the last year the king pulled down the old rotten slightbuilded banqueting house at whitehall and newbuilded the same this year very strong and stately being every way larger than the first658 footnote 658 stows annals continued by edmund howes 1631 p 891 this new banqueting house was completed in the early part of 1608 john chamberlain writes to sir dudley carleton on january 5 1608 the masque goes forward at court for twelfth day tho i doubt the new room will be scant ready659 thereafter the banqueting house every way larger than the first was regularly used for the presentation of masques but it was rarely if ever used for plays throughout the reign of james the ordinary place for dramatic performances as has been observed was the great hall footnote 659 john nichols the progresses of james ii 162 on january 12 1619 as a result of negligence during the preparations for a masque the banqueting house caught fire and was burned to the ground the reverend thomas lorkin writes to sir thomas puckering on january 19 1619 the unhappy accident that chanced at whitehall last week by fire you cannot but have heard of but haply not the manner how which was this a joiner was appointed to mend some things that were out of order in the device of the masque which the king meant to have repeated at shrovetide who having kindled a fire upon a false hearth to heat his gluepot the force thereof pierced soon it seems the single brick and in a short time that he absented himself upon some occasion fastened upon the basis which was of dry deal board underneath which suddenly conceiving flame gave fire to the device of the masque all of oiled paper and dry fir etc and so in a moment disposed itself among the rest of that combustible matter that it was past any mans approach before it was almost discovered two hours begun and ended that woful sight illustration the cockpit probably as built by henry viii from faithornes map of london 1658 the whitehall district is represented as it was many years earlier compare agass map 1560 inigo jones who had dreamed of a magnificent palace at whitehall and who had drawn elaborate plans for a royal residence which should surpass anything in europe now took charge of building a new banqueting house as a first step in the realization of his scheme the noble structure which he erected is today one of his chief monuments and the sole relic of the once famous royal palace it was completed in the spring of 1622 but as in the case of its predecessor it was not commonly used for dramatic entertainments though masques might be given there the regular place for plays continued to be the great hall in the meanwhile however there had been developed at court the custom of having small private performances in the cockpit in addition to the more elaborate performances in the great hall since this ultimately led to the establishment of a theatre royal known as the cockpitincourt it will be necessary to trace in some detail the history of that structure the palace of whitehall anciently called york house and the home of thirty successive archbishops of york was seized by king henry viii at the fall of wolsey and converted into a royal residence660 the new proprietor at once made improvements after his own taste among which were tenniscourts bowlingalleys and an amphitheatre for the royal sport of cockfighting in stows description of the palace we read on the right hand be diverse fair tennis courts bowling alleys and a cockpit all built by king henry the eight footnote 660 shakespeare writes henry viii iv i 9497 sir you must no more call it yorkplace that is past for since the cardinal fell that titles lost tis now the kings and called whitehall strype in his edition of stows survey 1720 adds the information that the cockpit was made out of certain old tenements661 it is pictured in agass map of london 1570 and more clearly in faithornes map see page 390 printed in 1658 but apparently representing the city at an earlier date footnote 661 book vi page 6 during the reign of elizabeth the cockpit so far as i can ascertain was never used for plays in the voluminous documents relating to the office of the revels there is only one reference to the building in 1572 flowers were temporarily stored there that were to be used for decking the banketting house it was during the reign of king james that the cockpit began to be used for dramatic representations john chamberlain writes from london to sir ralph winwood december 18 1604 here is great provision for cockpit to entertain him the king at home and of masques and revels against the marriage of sir herbert and lady susan vere662 since however king james was very fond of cockfighting it may be that chamberlain was referring to that royal entertainment rather than to plays the small cockpit was certainly a very unusual place for the formal presentation of plays before his majesty and the court footnote 662 winwood state papers 1725 ii 41 but the young prince henry whose official residence was in st jamess palace often had private or semiprivate performances of plays in the cockpit in the rolls of the expenses of the prince we find the following records663 for making ready the cockpit four several times for plays by the space of four days in the month of december 1610 2 10s 8d for making ready the cockpit for plays two several times by the space of four days in the months of january and february 1611 70s 8d for making ready the cockpit for a play by the space of two days in the month of december 1611 30s 4d footnote 663 see cunningham extracts from the accounts of the revels pp xiiixiv the building obviously was devoted for the most part to other purposes and had to be made ready for plays at a considerable expense nor was the prince the only one who took advantage of its small amphitheatre john chamberlain in a letter to sir dudley carleton on september 22 1612 describing the reception accorded to the count palatine by the lady elizabeth writes on tuesday she sent to invite him as he sat at supper to a play of her own servants in the cockpit664 footnote 664 john nichols the progresses of james ii 466 it is clear then that at times throughout the reign of james dramatic performances were given in the cockpit but the auditorium was small and the performances must have been of a semiprivate nature the important court performances to which many guests were invited were held in the great hall in the reign of the next sovereign however a change came about in the year 1632 or 1633 as well as i am able to judge with the evidence at command king charles reconstructed the old cockpit into a new theatre at whitehall which from henceforth was almost exclusively used for court performances the opening of this new theatre royal is celebrated by a speech from the pen of thomas heywood a speech spoken to their two excellent majesties at the first play playd by the queens servants in the new theatre at whitehall when greece the chief priority might claim for arts and arms and held the eminent name of monarchy they erected divers places some to the muses others to the graces where actors strove and poets did devise with tongue and pen to please the ears and eyes of princely auditors the time was when to hear the rapture of one poets pen a theatre hath been built by the fates doom when th empire was removed from thence to rome the potent csars had their circi and large amphitheatres in which might stand and sit full fourscore thousand all in view and touch of voice this great augustus knew nay rome its wealth and potency enjoyed till by the barbarous goths these were destroyd but may this structure last and you be seen here a spectator with your princely queen in your old age as in your flourishing prime to outstrip augustus both in fame and time the exact date of this speech is not given but it was printed665 in 1637 along with the prologue to the famous tragedy of the rich jew of malta as it was played before the king and queen in his majestys theatre at whitehall and this prologue heywood had already published with the play itself in 1633 he dedicated the play to mr thomas hammon saying i had no better a newyears gift to present you with apparently then the play had been acted at court shortly before new years 1633 and this sets a forward date to heywoods speech other evidence combines with this to show that his majestys theatre at whitehall was new at the christmas season of 163233 footnote 665 see the dramatic works of thomas heywood 1874 vi 339 in erecting this the first theatre royal king charles would naturally call for the aid of the great court architect inigo jones666 and by good luck we have preserved for us joness original sketches for the little playhouse see page 396 these were discovered a few years ago by mr hamilton bell in the library of worcester college where many valuable relics of the great architect are stored and printed in the architectural record of new york march 1913 mr bell accompanied the plans with a valuable discussion but he was unable to discover their purpose he writes we have still no clue as to what purpose this curiously anomalous and most interesting structure was to servewhether the plan was ever carried out or whether it remained part of a lordly pleasurehouse which its prolific designer planned for the delectation of his own soul footnote 666 whether he merely made over the old cockpit which henry viii had constructed out of certain old tenements or erected an entirely new building i have not been able to ascertain heywoods speech indicates a new and lasting structure that the plan actually was carried out at least in part is shown by a sketch of the whitehall buildings made by john fisher at some date before 1670 and engraved by vertue in 1747 see page 398667 here in the northeast corner of the palace we find a little theatre labeled the cockpit its identity with the building sketched by inigo jones is obvious at a glance even the exterior measurements which are ascertainable from the scales of feet given on the two plans are the same footnote 667 vertue conservatively dates the survey about 1680 but the names of the occupants of the various parts of the palace show that it was drawn before 1670 and nearer 1660 than 1680 illustration inigo joness plans for the cockpitincourt now preserved in the worcester college library at oxford discovered by mr hamilton bell and reproduced in the architectural record of new york 1913 illustration fishers survey of whitehall showing the cockpitincourt a section from vertues engraving 1747 of a survey of whitehall made by john fisher 16601670 compare the cockpit with inigo joness plans illustration the theatro olympico at vicenza which probably inspired inigo joness plans for the cockpitincourt mr bell describes the plan he discovered as follows668 it represents within a square building windowed on three sides and on one seemingly attached to another building an auditorium occupying five sides of an octagon on the floor of which are shown the benches of a pit or the steps five in number on which they could be set these are curiously arranged at an angle of fortyfive degrees on either side of a central aisle so that the spectators occupying them could never have directly faced the stage surrounding this pit on five sides is a balcony ten feet deep with it would seem two rows of benches on four of its sides the fifth side in the centre directly opposite the stage being partitioned off into a room or box in the middle of which is indicated a platform about five feet by seven presumably for the royal state three steps descend from this box to the centre aisle of the pit to the left of and behind this royal box appears another enclosure or box partitioned off from the rest of the balcony the staircases of access to this auditorium are clearly indicated one small door at the rear of the salle with its own private stairway communicating with the adjoining building opens directly into the royal box as in the royal opera house in berlin today there is another door with a triangular lobby into the rear of the lefthand balcony two windows are shown on each side of the house opening directly into the theatre from the outer air the stage runs clear across the width of the pit about thirtyfive feet projecting in an apron or avant scne five feet beyond the proscenium wall and is surrounded on the three outward sides by a low railing of classic design about eighteen inches in height just as in many elizabethan playhouses if one may trust an elevation of the stage drawn on the same sheet to twice the scale of the general plan the stage was four feet six inches above the floor of the pit this elevation exhibits the surprising feature of a classic faade palladian in treatment on the stage of what so far we have regarded as a late modification of a playhouse of shakespeares day evidently inigo jones contemplated the erection of a permanent architectural proscenium as the ancients called it of the type though far more modest both in scale and ornamentation of palladios theatro olimpico at vicenza which we know he visited in about 1600 some twenty years after its erection this proscenium given in plan and elevation shows a semicircular structure with a radius of fifteen feet two stories in height of the corinthian or composite order in the lower story are five doorways the centre of which is a large archway flanked by pedestals on which are inscribed in greek characters melpomenethalia over these and over the smaller doors are tablets the second story contains between its lighter engaged columns over the four side doors niches with corbels below destined to carry statues as their inscribed bases indicate so far as these inscriptions are legiblethe clearest reading phocles probably sophoclesthese were to represent greek dramatists most likely schylus euripides sophocles and aristophanes the curved pediment of the central archway runs up into this story and is broken in the middle by a tablet bearing the inscription prodesse et delectare which is flanked by two reclining genii holding garlands above these are two busts on brackets thespis and epicurus or possibly epicharmus the space directly above this pediment is occupied by a windowlike opening five by four feet the traditional elizabethan musicroom in all probability which mr wj lawrence has shown us occupied this position both in shakespeares day and for some time after the restoration an arrangement which was revived by mr steele mackaye in the madison square theatre and originally in the first little lyceum new york both now pulled down the pyramidal pediment above this opening projects above the upper cornice into a coved ceiling which would appear from the rendering of the drawing to form an apse above the semicircular stage behind the proscenium is a large space with staircases of approach two windows at the rear and apparently a fireplace for the comfort of the waiting players communication with the front of the house is provided by a door in the proscenium wall opening into the stage door lobby whence the outside of the building may be reached there is no indication of galleries unless some marks on the angles of the front wall of the balcony may be interpreted without too much license into the footings of piers or posts to carry one the total interior height shown in the elevation from what i have assumed to be the floor of the pit to the ceiling being only twentyeight feet there would hardly have been room for more than one the only staircases which could have served it are at the rear of the building in the corners behind the stage wall the general dimensions would appear to be total width of the auditorium 58 ft total width of the pit 36 ft total width of the front stage or apron 35 ft total depth of the stage from the railing to the centre of the proscenium 16 ft the entire building is 58 feet square inside cut to an octagon of 28 feet each side height from floor to ceiling 28 ft height from stage to ceiling about 23 ft 6 in the lower order of the proscenium 10 ft 6 in the upper order of the proscenium 9 ft 6 in the scale on the drawing may not be absolutely correct as measured by it the side doors of the proscenium are only five feet high and two feet nine inches wide this however may be an error in the drawing since we have it on very good authority that inigo jones designed without the use of a scale proportioning his various members by his exquisitely critical eye alone subsequently adding the dimensions in writing footnote 668 reprinted here by the kind permission of mr bell and the editors of the architectural record i record below some of the references to the cockpit which i have gathered from the herbert manuscript and the officebooks of the lord chamberlain the earliest payment for plays there it will be observed is dated march 16 1633 abundant evidence shows that the actors gave their performance in the cockpit at night without interfering with their regular afternoon performance at their playhouses and for their pains received the sum of 10 if however for any reason they lost their day at their house they were paid 20 1633 march 16 warrant to pay 270 to john lowen

iii 238 other similar allusions to performance in the cockpit might be cited from the court records one more will sufficethe most interesting of all since it shows how frequently the little theatre was employed for the entertainment of the royal family it is a bill presented by the blackfriars company the kings men for court performances during the year 1637 this bill was discovered and reproduced in facsimile by george r wright fsa in the journal of the british archological association for 1860 but it was wholly misunderstood by its discoverer who regarded it as drawn up by the company of players that performed at the cockpit in drury lane he was indeed somewhat puzzled by the reference to the blackfriars playhouse but met the difficulty by saying there can be little doubt that the lastnamed theatre was lent for the occasion to the cockpit company although he suggests no reason for this strange borrowing of a theatre by a troupe that possessed a house of its own and much nearer the court too it did not even occur to him it seems to inquire how the cockpit company secured the plays which we know belonged to shakespeares old company because of these obvious difficulties scholars have looked upon the document with suspicion and apparently have treated it as a forgery675 but that it is genuine is indicated by the history of the cockpitincourt as sketched above and is proved beyond any question by the fact that the officebook of the lord chamberlain shows that the bill was paid 12th march 1638 9forasmuch as his majestys servants the company at the blackfriars have by special command at divers times within the space of this present year 1638 acted 24 plays before his majesty six whereof have been performed at hamptoncourt and richmond by means whereof they were not only at the loss of their day at home but at extraordinary charges by traveling and carriage of their goods in consideration whereof they are to have 20 apiece for those plays and 10 apiece for the other 18 acted at whitehall which in the whole amounted to the sum of 300these are therefore to pray and require you out of his majestys treasure in your charge to pay676 footnote 675 fleay in his elaborate studies of performances at court ignores it entirely as do subsequent scholars footnote 676 chalmers apology p 510 a photographic facsimile of this interesting

eclipse sir henry herbert writes on twelfth night 1642 the prince had a play called the scornful lady at the cockpit but the king and queen were not there and it was the only play acted at court in the whole christmas677 during the dark days that followed we hear nothing of plays in the cockpit later cromwell himself occupied this section of the palace and naturally saw to it that no dramatic exhibitions were held there but at the restoration the prince now become the king could have his plays again and he did not wait long on november 20 1660 edward gower wrote to sir richard leveson

about the kings behavior on this occasion samuel pepys as he rose in the world became a frequent visitor there679 in the absence of other descriptions of the building i subjoin a few of the entries from his diary under the date of october 2 1662 he writes at night by coach towards whitehall took up mr moore and set him at my lords and myself hearing that there was a play at the cockpit and my lord sandwich who came to town last night at it i do go thither and by very great fortune did follow four or five gentlemen who were carried to a little private door in a wall and so crept through a narrow place and come into one of the boxes next the kings but so as i could not see the king or queen but many of the fine ladies who yet are really not so handsome generally as i used to take them to be but that they are finely dressed here we saw the cardinal680 a tragedy i had never seen before nor is there any great matter in it the company that came in with me into the box were all frenchmen that could speak no english but lord what sport they made to ask a pretty lady that they got among them that understood both french and english to make her tell them what the actors said footnote 679 he first got in on april 20 1661 by the favour of one mr bowman john evelyn also visited the cockpit see his diary january 16 and february 11 1662 footnote 680 by james shirley licensed 1641 the next time he went to the cockpit on november 17 1662 he did not have to creep in by stealth he writes at whitehall by appointment mr crew carried my wife and i to the cockpit and we had excellent places and saw the king queen duke of monmouth his son and my lady castlemaine and all the fine ladies and the scornful lady well performed they had done by eleven oclock the fine ladies as usual made a deep impression on him as did the greatness and gallantry of the audience on december 1 1662 he writes this done we broke up and i to the cockpit with much crowding and waiting where i saw the valiant cid681 acted a play i have read with great delight but is a most dull thing acted which i never understood before there being no pleasure in it though done by betterton and by ianthe682 and another fine wench that is come in the room of roxalana nor did the king or queen once smile all the whole play nor any of the company seem to take any pleasure but what was in the greatness and gallantry of the company thence home and got thither by 12 oclock knocked up my boy and put myself to bed footnote 681 by corneille footnote 682 mrs betterton illustration the cockpitincourt from an engraving by mazell in pennants london mr wl spiers who reproduces this engraving in the london topographical record 1903 says that it is undated but probably copied from a contemporary drawing of the seventeenth century two entries from an entirely different source must suffice for this history of the cockpit in the paperoffice chalmers discovered a record of the following payments made in 1667 to the keeper of the theatre at whitehall 30 to the same for keeping clean that place p ann 6683 footnote 683 chalmers apology p 530 cunningham says in his handbook of london i find in the records of the audit office a payment of 30 per annum to the keeper of our playhouse called the cockpit in st james park but he does not state the year in which the payment was made and in the lord chamberlains accounts is preserved the following warrant 1674 march 27 warrant to deliver to monsieur grabu or to such as he shall appoint such of the scenes remaining in the theatre at whitehall as shall be useful for the french opera at the theatre in bridges street and the said monsieur to return them again safely after 14 days time to the theatre at whitehall684 footnote 684 i quote from wj lawrence the elizabethan playhouse first series p 144 what became of the theatre at whitehall i have not been able to ascertain685 presumably after the fire of january 1698 which destroyed the greater part of the palace and drove the royal family to seek quarters elsewhere the building along with the rest of the cockpit section was made over into the privy council offices footnote 685 the reasons why the cockpit at whitehall has remained so long in obscurity its history is here attempted for the first time are obvious some scholars have confused it with the public playhouse of the same name a confusion which persons in the days of charles avoided by invariably saying the cockpit in drury lane other scholars have confused it with the residential section of whitehall which bore the same name during the reign of james several large buildings which had been erected either on the site of the old cockpit of henry viii or around it were converted into lodgings for members of the royal family or favorites of the king and were commonly referred to as the cockpit other scholars have assumed that all plays during the reigns of elizabeth james and charles were given either in the banqueting house or in the great hall finally still other scholars eg sir sidney lee in shakespeares england 1916 have confused the cockpit at whitehall with the royal cockpit in st jamess park exactly when the latter was built i have not been able to discover but it was probably erected near the close of the seventeenth century it stood at the end of dartmouth street adjacent to birdcage walk but not in the park itself john strype in his edition of stows survey 1720 bk vi p 64 says of dartmouth street and here is a very fine cockpit called the kings cockpit well resorted unto a picture of the building is given by strype on page 62 and a still better picture may be found in jt smiths the antiquities of westminster the royal cockpit in dartmouth street survived until 1816 when it was torn down hogarth in his famous representation of a cockfight shows its interior as circular and as embellished with the royal coat of arms another interesting picture of the interior will be found in ackermanns the microcosm of london 1808 it is needless to add that this building had nothing whatever to do with the theatre royal of the days of king charles chapter

taken before sir john peyton knt lieutenant of the tower of london and thomas fowler tobias woode edward vaghan and henry thoresby esqs justices of the peace of john wolf of eastsmithfield co midd stationer in the sum of forty pounds the condition of the recognizance being that whereas the abovebounden john wolf hath begun to erect and build a playhouse in nightingale lane near east smithfield aforesaid contrary to her majestys proclamation and orders set down in her highnesss court of starchamber if therefore the said john wolf do not proceed any further in building or erecting of the same playhouse unless he shall procure sufficient warrant from the rt honourable the lords of her majestys most honourable privy council for further then this recognizance to be void or else to remain in full force the only stationer in london named john wolf was the printer and publisher who at this time had his shop in popes head alley lombard street for several reasons he is well known to bibliographers and his strong personality and tireless energy might easily have led him into the field of the theatre for many years he was a member of the fishmongers company to which also in all probability his father had belonged after a ten years apprenticeship with the eminent printer john day he spent several years abroad gadding from country to country but learning the printing trade from the best establishments on the continent his longest stay was in italy where he was connected with the printingoffice of the giunti and also it seems of gabriel giolito in 1576 he printed two rappresentazioni ad instanzia di giovanni vuolfio inglese about the year 1579 he established himself in london where he was dubbed by his fellows machiavel and began an energetic warfare on the monopolies secured by certain favored printers the fact that he was for a time committed to the clink failed to deter him we are told that he affirmed openly in the stationers hall that it was lawful for all men to print all lawful books what commandment soever her majesty gave to the contrary and being admonished that he being but one so mean a man should not presume to contrary her highness government tush said he luther was but one man and reformed all the world for religion and i am that one man that must and will reform the government in this trade the courage and energy here revealed characterized his entire life in 1583 he was admitted a freeman of the company of stationers in 1593 he was elected printer to the city in the spring of 1600 he was in serious difficulties with the authorities over the printing of john haywards life and raigne of king henrie iv and was forced to spend two weeks in jail he died in 1601686 footnote 686 for the life of john wolf see the following

do not know more about the causes which led him into the undertaking ii the projected amphitheatre in 1620 john cotton john williams and thomas dixon687 secured from king james a license to build an amphitheatre688 intended principally for martiall exercises and extraordinary shows and solemnities for ambassadors and persons of honor and quality with the power granted to the owners to order a cessation from other shows and sports for one day in a month only upon fourteen days warning footnote 687 of these men nothing is known something however may be inferred from the following entries in sir henry herberts officebook on the 20th august 1623 a license gratis to john williams and four others to make show of an elephant for a year on the 5th of september to make show of a live beaver on the 9th of june 1638 to make show of an outlandish creature called a possum george chalmers supplemental apology p 208 footnote 688 the place is not indicated but it was probably outside the city but for some reason the king suddenly changed his mind and on september 29 1620 he addressed a letter to the privy council directing them to cancel the license689 right trusty and right wellbeloved cousins and councellors and right trusty and wellbeloved councellors we greet you well whereas at the humble suit of our servants john cotton john williams and thomas dixon and in recompence of their services we have been pleased to license them to build an amphitheatre which hath passed our signet and is stayed at our privy seal and finding therein contained some such words and clauses as may in some constructions seem to give them greater liberty both in point of building and using of exercises than is any way to be permitted or was ever by us intended we have thought fit to command and give authority unto you or any four of you to cause that already passed to be cancelled and to give order unto our solicitor general for the drawing up of a new warrant for our signature to the same parties according to such directions and reservations as herewith we send you wherein we are more particular both in the affirmative and the negative to the end that as on one side we would have nothing pass us to remain upon record which either for the form might not become us or for the substance might cross our many proclamations pursued with good success for buildings or on the other side might give them cause to importune us after they had been at charges to which end we wish that you call them before you and let them know our pleasure and resolution therein footnote 689 see state papers domestic 16191623 p 181 i have quoted the letter from collier the history of english dramatic poetry 1879 i 408 accordingly the license was canceled and no new license was issued in 1626 however john williams and thomas dixon what had become of john cotton we do not know made an attempt to secure a license from king charles then newly come to the throne to erect an amphitheatre in lincolns inn fields apparently they so worded the proposed grant as to authorize them to present in their amphitheatre not only spectacles but dramatic performances and animalbaitings as well with the power to restrain all other places of amusement for one day in each week on giving two days warning a bill to this effect was drawn up and submitted to thomas coventry the lord keeper who examined it hastily and dispatched it to lord conway with the following letter690 my very good lordi have perused this bill and do call to mind that about three or four years past when i was attorney general a patent for an amphitheatre was in hand to have passed but upon this sudden without search of my papers i cannot give your lordship any account of the true cause wherefore it did not pass nor whether that and this do vary in substance neither am i apt upon a sudden to take impertinent exceptions to anything that is to pass much less to a thing that is recommended by so good a friend but if upon perusal of my papers which i had while i was attorney or upon more serious thoughts i shall observe anything worthy to be represented to his majesty or to the council i shall then acquaint your lordship and in the meantime i would be loath to be the author of a motion to his majesty to stay it but if you find his majesty at fitting leisure to move him that he will give leave to think of it in this sort as i have written it may do well and i assure your lordship unless i find matter of more consequence than i observe on this sudden it is not like to be stayed and so i rest your lordships very assured to do you service tho coventrye ch canbury 12 august 1626 footnote 690 collier op cit i 443 apparently some very influential person was urging the passage of the bill but the scheme soon evoked the bitter opposition of the various troupes of players and of the owners of the various theatres and other places of amusement an echo of the quarrel is found in marmions hollands leaguer ii iii twill dead all my device in making matches my plots of architecture and erecting new amphitheatres to draw custom from playhouses once a week and so pull a curse upon my head from the poor scoundrels691 footnote 691 the dramatic works of shackerley marmion in dramatists of the restoration p 37 fleay a biographical chronicle of the english drama ii 66 suggests that the impostors agurtes and autolichus are meant to satirize williams and dixon respectively the poor scoundrelsie the playersseem to have caused the authorities to examine the bill more closely and on september 28 1626 the lord keeper sent to lord conway a second letter in which he condemned the measure in strong terms692 my lordaccording to his majestys good pleasure which i received from your lordship i have considered of the grant desired by john williams and thomas dixon for building an amphitheatre in lincolns inn fields and comparing it with that which was propounded in king james his time do find much difference between them for that former was intended principally for martiall exercises and extraordinary shows and solemnities for ambassadors and persons of honor and quality with a cessation from other shows and sports for one day in a month only upon 14 days warning whereas by this new grant i see little probability of anything to be used but common plays or ordinary sports now used or showed at the bear garden or the common playhouses about london for all sorts of beholders with a restraint to all other plays and shows for one day in the week upon two days warning with liberty to erect their buildings in lincolns inn fields where there are too many buildings already and which place in the late kings time upon a petition exhibited by the princes comedians for setting up a playhouse there was certified by eleven justices of peace under their hands to be very inconvenient and therefore not holding this new grant fit to pass as being no other in effect but to translate the playhouses and bear garden from the bankside to a place much more unfit i thought fit to give your lordship these reasons for it wherewithal you may please to acquaint his majesty if there shall be cause and so remain your lordships very assured friend to do you service tho coventrye canbury 28 sept 1626 lo conway footnote 692 i quote the letter from collier the history of english dramatic poetry 1879 i 444 on the letter lord conway has written the indorsement that it is unfit the grant for the amphitheatre should passe and such no doubt was the ultimate decision of the privy council for we hear nothing more of the project iii ogilbys dublin theatre in 1635 a playhouse was opened in dublin by john ogilbydancingmaster theatrical manager playwright scholar translator poetnow best known perhaps for the ridicule he inspired in drydens macflecknoe and popes dunciad at the beginning of his versatile career he was a successful london dancingmaster popular with the nobility and gentry when thomas earl of strafford was appointed lord lieutenant of ireland he took ogilby with him to dublin to teach his wife and children the art of dancing and also to help with the secretarial duties under straffords patronage ogilby was appointed to the post of master of the revels for ireland and in this capacity he built a small playhouse in dublin and began to cultivate dramatic representations after the manner of london anthony wood in athen oxonienses says he built a little theatre to act plays in in st warburgs street in dublin and was then and there valued by all ingenious men for his great industry in promoting morality and ingenuity693 footnote 693 blisss edition iii 741 aubrey writes he had a warrant from the lord lieutenant to be master of the ceremonies for that kingdom and built a pretty694 little theatre in st warburgh street in dublin footnote 694 pretty little theatre is the reading of ms aubr 7 folio 20 ms aubr 8 omits the adjective pretty for aubreys full account of ogilby see andrew clarks brief lives 1898 2 vols the history of this little theatre is not known in detail for its actors ogilby himself wrote at least one play entitled the merchant of dublin695 and henry burnell a tragicomedy entitled landgartha printed in 1641 as it was presented in the new theatre in dublin with good applause but its chief playwright was james shirley who came to dublin in 1636 under the patronage of the earl of kildare for the irish stage he wrote the royal master published in 1638 as acted in the new theatre in dublin rosania or loves victory now known as the doubtful heir under which title it was later printed st patrick for ireland696 and in all probability the constant maid697 the actors however had little need to buy original plays for they were free no doubt to take any of the numerous london successes from shirleys poems we learn that they were presenting jonsons alchemist middletons no wit two of fletchers plays unnamed and two anonymous plays entitled the toy and the general and we may fairly assume that they honored several of shirleys early plays in the same way footnote 695 aubrey mentions this as having been written in dublin and never printed footnote 696 published in 1640 as the first part and both the prologue and the epilogue speak of a second part but no second part was printed and in all probability it never was written footnote 697 never licensed for england reprinted in 1657 with st patrick for ireland the theatre came to a sudden end with the outbreak of the rebellion in 1641 in october the lords justices prohibited playing there and shortly after we are told the building was ruined and spoiled and a cowhouse made of the stage698 footnote 698 ms aubr 7 folio 20 v ogilbys second theatre in dublin built after the restoration does not fall within the scope of the present work iv the french players temporary theatre in drury lane in february 1635 a company of french players under the leadership of the eminent actor josias de soulas better known by his stagename of floridor699 appeared in london and won such favor at court that they were ultimately allowed to fit up a house in drury lane for a temporary theatre the history of these players is mainly found in the records of the master of the revels and of the lord chamberlain from the former malone has preserved the following entries by herbert on tuesday night the 17 of february 1634 ie 1635 a french company of players being approved of by the queen at her house two nights before and commended by her majesty to the king were admitted to the cockpitt in whitehall and there presented the king and queen with a french comedy called melise700 with good approbation for which play the king gave them ten pounds this day being friday and the 20 of the same month the king told me his pleasure and commanded me to give order that this french company should play the two sermon days in the week during their time of playing in lent ie wednesdays and fridays on which days during lent the english companies were not allowed to play and in the house of drury lane ie the cockpit playhouse where the queens players usually play the kings pleasure i signified to mr beeston the manager of the cockpit the same day who obeyed readily the housekeepers are to give them by promise the benefit of their interest701 for the two days of the first week they had the benefit of playing on the sermon days and got two hundred pounds at least besides many rich clothes were given them they had freely to themselves the whole week before the week before easter702 which i obtained of the king for them footnote 699 see frederick hawkins annals of the french stage 1884 i 148 ff for the career of this player on the french stage every gift required by the actor says hawkins was possessed by floridor footnote 700 la melise ou les princes reconnus by du rocher first acted in paris in 1633 see the athenum july 11 1891 p 73 and cf ibid p 139 footnote 701 housekeepers were owners who always demanded of the players as rental for the building a certain part of each days takings the passage quoted means that the housekeepers allowed the french players to receive all money taken on the two sermon days of the first week and after that exacted their usual share as rental for the building footnote 702 that is passion week during which time the english companies were never allowed to give performances the use of the cockpit in drury lane came to an end at easter for the queens own troupe under beestons management regularly occupied that building but the king summoned the french players to act at court on several occasions thus herbert records the 4 april on easter monday703 they played the trompeur puny704 with better approbation than the other on wednesday night the 16 april705 1635 the french played alcimedor706 with good approbation707 footnote 703 this must be an error for easter monday fell on march 30 footnote 704 le trompeur puni ou histoire septentrionale by scuderi footnote 705 wednesday was the 15th footnote 706 alcimedon by duryer footnote 707 malone variorum iii 121 note clearly these actors were in high favor at court sir henry who did not as a rule show any hesitancy in accepting fees notes in the margin of his book the french offered me a present of 10 but i refused it and did them many other courtesies gratis to render the queen my mistress an acceptable service in view of this royal favor it is not surprising to find that after they were driven from the cockpit they received permission to fit up a temporary playhouse in the manage or ridingschool of one m le febure in drury lane the lord chamberlains officebook contains the following entry on the subject 18 april 1635 his majesty hath commanded me to signify his royal pleasure that the french comedians having agreed with mons le febure may erect a stage scaffolds and seats and all other accommodations which shall be convenient and act and present interludes and stage plays at his house and manage708 in drury lane during his majestys pleasure without any disturbance hindrance or interruption and this shall be to them and mr le febure and to all others a sufficient discharge c709 footnote 708 this clause i insert from mrs stopess notes on the lord chamberlains records in the shakespeare jahrbuch xlvi 97 footnote 709 i have chosen to reproduce the record from chalmerss apology p 506 note s rather than from mrs stopess apparently less accurate notes in the shakespeare jahrbuch xlvi 97 apparently the players lost little time in fitting up the building for we read in herberts officebook a warrant granted to josias daunay710 hurfries de lau and others for to act plays at a new house in drury lane during pleasure the 5 may 1635 the king was pleased to command my lord chamberlain to direct his warrant to monsieur le fevure to give him a power to contract with the frenchmen for to build a playhouse in the managehouse which was done accordingly by my advice and allowance711 footnote 710 should we place a comma after josias that josias floridor was the leader of the troupe we know from two separate entries cf chalmers apology pp 508 509 footnote 711 malone variorum iii 122 note in glapthornes the ladies priviledge is a goodnatured allusion to the french company and their vivacious style of acting712 la but adorni what think you of the french ador very airy people who participate more fire than earth yet generally good and nobly dispositiond something inclining to overweening fancy this lady tells my remembrance of a comic scene i once saw in their theatre bon add it to your former courtesies and express it footnote 712 act ii scene i this passage is pointed out by lawrence the elizabethan playhouse p 137 whereupon according to the stage direction adorni acts furiously in the margin of his officebook sir henry herbert writes complacently these frenchmen were commended unto me by the queen and have passed through my hands gratis this was indeed a rare favor from herbert but they did not so easily escape his deputy william blagrove who accepted from them the sum of three pounds for his pains how long the french actors occupied their temporary playhouse in drury lane is not clear in the lord chamberlains book we find an entry showing that they presented a play at court in december 1635 warrant to pay 10 to josias floridor for himself and the rest of the french players for a tragedy by them played before his majesty dec last713 the entry is dated january 8 1636 and so far as i can discover this is the last reference to the french players in london we may suppose that shortly after this they returned to paris footnote 713 stopes op cit p 98 chalmers apology p 509 v davenants projected theatre in fleet street on march 26 1639 william davenant who had succeeded ben jonson as poet laureate secured from king charles a royal patent under the great seal of england to erect a playhouse in fleet street to be used not only for regular plays but also for musical entertainments and scenic representations davenant as we know was especially interested in the art of perspective in scenes and also in the italian opera musicale the royal patentunusually verbose even for a patentis printed in full in rymers foedera xx 377 i cite below all the essential passages the building know ye that we of our especial grace certain knowledge and meere motion and upon the humble petition of our servant william davenant gentleman have given and granted and by these presents for us our heirs and successors do give and grant unto the said william davenant his heirs executors administrators and assigns full power license and authority to frame newbuild and set up a theatre or playhouse with necessary tiring and retiring rooms and other places convenient containing in the whole forty yards square at the most714 wherein plays musical entertainments scenes or other like presentments may be presented so as the outwalls of the said theatre or playhouse tiring or retiring rooms be made or built of brick or stone according to the tenor of our proclamations in that behalf its location upon a parcel of ground lying near unto or behind the three kings ordinary in fleet street in the parishes of saint dunstans in the west london or in saint brides london or in either of them or in any other ground in or about that place or in the whole street aforesaid already allotted to him for that use or in any other place that is or hereafter shall be assigned or allotted out to the said william davenant by our right trusty and right wellbeloved cousin and counsellor thomas earl of arundel and surrey earl marshall of england or any other of our commissioners for building for that time being in that behalf its uses and we do hereby for us our heirs and successors grant to the said william davenant his heirs executors administrators and assigns that it shall and may be lawful to and for him the said william davenant his heirs executors administrators and assigns from time to time to gather together entertain govern privilege and keep such and so many players and persons to exercise action musical presentments scenes dancing and the like as he the said william davenant his heirs executors administrators and assigns shall think fit and approve for the said house and such persons to permit and continue at and during the pleasure of the said william davenant his heirs executors administrators and assigns from time to time to act plays in such house so to be by him or them erected and exercise music musical presentments scenes dancing or other the like at the same or other hours or times or after plays are ended715 peaceably and quietly without the impeachment or impediment of any person or persons whatsoever for the honest recreation of such as shall desire to see the same and that it shall and may be lawful to and for the said william davenant his heirs executors administrators and assigns to take and receive of such our subjects as shall resort to see or hear any such plays scenes and entertainments whatsoever such sum or sums of money as is are or hereafter from time to time shall be accustomed to be given or taken in other playhouses and places for the like plays scenes presentments and entertainments footnote 714 the fortune was only eighty feet square but the stage projected to the middle of the yard davenant probably wished to provide for an alcove stage of sufficient depth to accommodate his scenes footnote 715 that is he may give his musical presentments etc either at the hours when he was accustomed to give plays or after his plays are ended this does not necessarily imply evening entertainments the novelty of the scheme and the great size of the proposed building must have alarmed the owners of playhouses that the established theatrical proprietors were hostile is clearly indicated by the attitude of richard heton one of the sewers of the chamber to queen henrietta and at the time manager of the salisbury court playhouse in september 1639 he wrote out a document entitled instructions for my patent in which he advanced reasons why he should receive the sole power to elect the members of the queens company of players he observes that under the existing arrangement the company was free to leave the salisbury court playhouse at their pleasure as in one year and a half of their being here they have many times threatened and he concludes by adding and one now of the chief fellows ie sharers of the company an agent for one william davenant that hath got a grant from the king for the building of a new playhouse which was intended to be in fleet street which no man can judge that a fellow of our company and a wellwisher to those that own the house would ever be an actor in716 doubtless the owners of other houses had the same sentiments and exercised what influence they possessed against the scheme but the most serious opposition in all probability came from the citizens and merchants living in the neighborhood we know how bitterly they complained about the coaches that brought playgoers to the small blackfriars theatre and how strenuously from year to year they sought the expulsion of the kings men from the precinct717 they certainly would not have regarded with complacency the erection in their midst of a still larger theatre footnote 716 cunningham the whitefriars theatre in the shakespeare societys papers iv 96 footnote 717 see the chapter on the second blackfriars whatever the opposition it was so powerful that on october 2 davenant was compelled to make an indenture by which he virtually renounced718 for himself and his heirs for ever the right to build a theatre in fleet street or in any other place in or near the cities or suburbs of the cities of london or westminster without further and special permission granted this document first printed by chalmers in his supplemental apology is as follows this indenture made the second day of october in the fifteenth year of the reign of our sovereign lord charles by the grace of god of england scotland france and ireland king defender of the faith c anno domini 1639 between the said kings most excellent majesty of the first part and william davenant of london gent of the other part whereas the said kings most excellent majesty by his highnesss letters patents under the great seal of england bearing date the six and twentieth day of march last past before the date of these presents did give and grant unto the said william davenant his heirs executors administrators and assigns full power license and authority that he they and every of them by him and themselves and by all and every such person or persons as he or they shall depute or appoint and his and their laborers servants and workmen shall and may lawfully quietly and peaceably frame erect new build and set up upon a parcel of ground lying near unto or behind the three kings ordinary in fleet street in the parish of st dunstans in the west london or in st brides london or in either of them or in any other ground in or about that place or in the whole street aforesaid already allotted to him for that use or in any other place that is or hereafter shall be assigned and allotted out to the said william davenant by the right honorable thomas earl of arundel and surrey earl marshall of england or any other his majestys commissioners for building for the time being in that behalf a theatre or playhouse with necessary tiring and retiring rooms and other places convenient containing in the whole forty yards square at the most wherein plays musical entertainments scenes or other the like presentments may be presented by and under certain provisors or conditions in the same contained as in and by the said letters patents whereunto relation being had more fully and at large it doth and may appear now this indenture witnesseth and the said william davenant doth by these presents declare his majestys intent meaning at and upon the granting of the said license was and is that he the said william davenant his heirs executors administrators nor assigns should not frame build or set up the said theatre or playhouse in any place inconvenient and that the said parcel of ground lying near unto or behind the three kings ordinary in fleet street in the said parish of st dunstans in the west london or in st brides london or in either of them or in any other ground in or about that place or in the whole street aforesaid and is sithence found inconvenient and unfit for that purpose therefore the said william davenant doth for himself his heirs executors administrators and assigns and every of them covenant promise and agree to and with our said sovereign lord the king his heirs and successors that he the said william davenant his heirs executors administrators nor assigns shall not nor will not by virtue of the said license and authority to him granted as aforesaid frame erect new build or set up upon the said parcel of ground in fleet street aforesaid or in any other part of fleet street a theatre or playhouse nor will not frame erect new build or set up upon any other parcel of ground lying in or near the cities or suburbs of the cities of london or westminster any theatre or playhouse unless the said place shall be first approved and allowed by warrant under his majestys sign manual or by writing under the hand and seal of the said right honorable thomas earl of arundel and surrey in witness whereof to the one part of this indenture the said william davenant hath set his hand and seal the day and year first above written william davenant ls signed sealed and delivered in the presence of edw penruddoks michael baker footnote 718 that he did not actually surrender the patent is shown by the fact that he claimed privileges by virtue of it after the restoration see halliwellphillipps a collection of ancient documents p 48 possibly as a recompense for this surrender of his rights davenant was made governor of the kings and queens servants at the cockpit in june of the following year and from this time until the suppression of acting in 1642 he expended his energies in managing the affairs of this important playhouse bibliography in the following list are included the books and articles constituting the main authorities upon which the present study is based the list is not intended to be an exhaustive bibliography though from the nature of the case it is fairly complete for the guidance of scholars the more important titles are marked with asterisks it will be seen that not all the works are included which are cited in the text or referred to in footnotes the list in fact is strictly confined to works bearing upon the history of the prerestoration playhouses considerations of space have led to the omission of a large number of books dealing with the topography of london and of the counties of middlesex and surrey although a knowledge of these is essential to any thorough study of the playhouses furthermore titles of contemporary plays pamphlets and treatises are excluded except a few of unusual and general value finally discussions of the structure of the early stage of the manner of dramatic performances in the time of shakespeare and of the travels of english actors on the continent are omitted except when these contain also material important for the study of
